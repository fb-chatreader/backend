[{"title":"The Road to Reinvention","author":"Josh Linkner","summary":"Success is often compared to climbing a mountain. You start at the bottom, and slowly start to climb your way to the top. The journey may be arduous: you may fall, or slip, or struggle on rocky paths. Yet as soon as you reach the summit, you have made it, and can rest and enjoy your success. But really, this analogy is nonsense. Success isn’t a one-way climb on some pile of rocks, it’s a constant struggle to reach the top and stay there. If you relax with your momentary victory, you probably won’t be successful for very long. The key to greatness is to work hard and constantly develop your business. These blinks will show you exactly how you can achieve this and what benefits constant reinvention can bring you. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Borders booksellers had to shelve its business; why that dude riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle is probably a lawyer; and how one company racked in profits from having see-through pants. After you’ve completed a tough task, such as finishing a major project or closing an important deal, you probably feel like you’ve earned a bit of a break. However, in the business world, there is nothing more dangerous! Continued success means being on constant alert, never taking a break and always being ready to reinvent yourself as conditions change. The key to reinvention is in staying innovative. In the 1960s, Nike became a household name after inventing the modern athletic shoe. But afterward Nike didn’t just rest on its laurels. The company kept pushing, testing boundaries and investing new products. Two recent examples include the company’s Fuel Band, an LED-display wristband that measures physical activity and helps the wearer reach fitness goals; and the Fly Knit Racer, a shoe made of knitted threads rather than traditional materials. This kind of outside-the-box thinking led the magazine Fast Company to rank Nike in 2013 as the most innovative company in the world. Nike’s success confirms this; between 2006 and 2012, company revenue rose 60 percent. Importantly, if you don’t disrupt the market with your own business reinvention, then another company surely will. At its peak, the Borders bookselling chain had over 1,200 stores and by 2009, annual sales had topped $3 billion. Yet just two years later, the company had collapsed. What happened? Borders Books failed to see that the market was changing. It didn’t embrace the digitization of media through e-books, downloading and streaming, and focused only on physical books, CDs and DVDs, investing heavily in physical stores that the digital market was making obsolete. Clearly, reinvention is necessary to keep your business relevant. The next blinks will offer a starting point on how to begin the process of reinvention. The world is constantly changing. Or as Don Strickland, former vice president at Kodak, so eloquently put it: shift happens. Companies that fail to see which direction the wind is blowing and that aren’t ready to act against their own immediate interests will surely fall behind. Kodak is actually a sad example of this. At its peak, the company dominated almost 90 percent of the film market, and even was a pioneer in digital photography technology, to ensure its market dominance. In 1992, Strickland announced that Kodak was ready to introduce its first digital camera. However, the company board got cold feet. “Why develop digital cameras,” they argued, “knowing that it would clearly undermine our core business of selling film?” But digital film was the future of film, and Kodak was subsequently overrun by innovative competitors – and barely survived. Kodak’s example shows us that, while it might be difficult, change is necessary for survival. However, by constantly redefining your core business, that change will come much easier. One great place to start your reinvention is to examine your company through the customer’s eyes, following the example of Hawaiian company SNUBA. When the American economy tanked at the end of the 1980s, scuba-diving companies faced a serious problem, namely that customers couldn’t afford such a pricey past time. SNUBA took the opportunity to closely examine its business practices from the customer’s point of view, and identified a problem: diving required too much money upfront before a person could experience actually diving. So the company developed a system that didn’t require special training or certification, keeping the air tank on a surface, but connected to a diver through a long hose. The SNUBA experience is like diving, but suitable for beginners and cost-effective, too. It was a great success! When a company runs into a challenge, it often assumes that the problem lies in its products or services. So the company makes a change, introducing a new product line or snazzy offer. Sometimes, the way forward isn’t to think about what you’re doing, but how you’re doing it. Product innovation isn’t necessary for success. Often a simple change in how you offer, sell or market your products and services can be enough to revitalize your business. In the mid 1990s, Dan Gilbert, the founder of mortgage provider Quicken Loans, had a vision to sell his mortgages online to customers all across the United States. Today buying products and services online is commonplace, but at the time, Gilbert’s idea was revolutionary. By simply moving documentation processing online, Quicken Loans reinvented the whole process of selling loans. The what, that is, the product itself, remained the same. Changing the how, however, helped Quicken crush its competition. Yet it’s not enough to reinvent yourself once. If you want to stay competitive, you must devise a system that allows for a constant reinvention. Quicken’s Gilbert had a similar revelation in 2003. Just as a pilot can’t rebuild the plane as he’s flying, the people responsible for producing, selling and delivering products and services can’t be expected to reinvent company processes while fulfilling their normal duties. Moreover, the skills necessary for process optimization are often different from those for sales and marketing, for example. So Gilbert created what he called a “mousetrap team,” the sole responsibility of which was to scrutinize and innovate all the company’s processes, no matter how small. As a result, the company grew rapidly, and in 2013, company revenue reached $100 billion; what’s more, Quicken won a number of notable awards for its high customer satisfaction. In the rush to create innovative new products and services, a company might sometimes forget the reason it’s creating things in the first place: for its customers. In fact, according to the 2012 Customer Experience Index, only 37 percent of the brands evaluated received good or excellent customer experience scores. Are you part of that 37 percent? What can you do to improve your customer experience? One place to start is by improving the customer’s sensory experience. By appealing to all your customers’ senses, you can get them more engaged in your products or services. Say you run a karate studio. Try putting yourself in a customer’s shoes as she enters the studio. How does the studio smell? What does it look like? How does it feel? Now ask yourself creative questions. What if you offered cool towels at the end of each session? Or played traditional Japanese music, softly in the background? What other ways could you improve the sensory experience for your customers? Another way to improve the customer experience is by creating an emotional bond through stories that customers can relate to. That’s exactly what athletic clothing company Lululemon did in 2013, after women around the world began expressing frustration that the cloth used for one of the company’s major yoga clothing lines was see-through – potentially embarrassing when you’re performing yoga positions! Rather than issue a standard press release apologizing for the mishap, the company instead decided to appeal to its customers’ sense of humor by using a story instead. In its store windows across the United States, mannequins were put in yoga positions with banners displaying slogans such as: “You saw London, You saw France. We promise no more see-through pants” and “We’ve got you covered.” Branded as “second-chance pants,” the new, improved line of yoga pants continued the story that their customers had created, and in doing so succeeded in turning a problem into an opportunity to bond with customers. All companies have a unique culture, one that is often so ingrained in the company that it becomes invisible to employees. However, just like products and services, a company culture also needs to be constantly reinvented. Taking a fresh look at the values, goals and attitudes that shape the everyday life of your company can help revitalize your team’s creative energy and help you reach new levels of success. One place to start is by ensuring that your company culture empowers employees to take responsibility for their own decisions, as this will unleash huge amounts of productive energy. Take the Indian tire company Apollo Tyres, for example, which by 2005 had become a successful, profitable company. But company leaders wanted to take Apollo further. It dawned on managing director Neeraj Kanwar that what had been missing was a common goal, to be shared among the entire company. So he gave employees a challenge: they would try to grow their revenue sevenfold, to $2 billion by 2010. To do this, the company would have to overhaul its culture. So Apollo empowered team members to make decisions and take risks independently in an attempt to achieve their goal. In doing so, Kanwar succeeded in unleash the team’s latent energy and ultimately, Apollo reached its lofty target! Sharing company rituals among employees can also help reinforce a company’s core values. In 2012, for example, cloud computing company Rackspace made it on Fortune magazine’s list of top-100 places to work. The company’s shared core value, which it calls “Fanatical Support,” is all about fanatically improving the expertise, responsiveness and transparency of the company. The highest accolade a Rackspace employee can receive is the “Fanatical Jacket,” a straitjacket symbolizing – and reinforcing – the core value of the company. According to the researcher and professor Paolo Guenzi, rituals like these can improve employee productivity, build a shared identity and reinforce desired behaviors. Most companies have a clear idea of who their customers are, and some brands have even come to be identified with what others perceive as their customer base. Just think of a Harley Davidson motorcycle. What type of person do you see riding one? For companies looking to reinvent themselves, taking a fresh look at customers and finding ways to cater to new segments is a great starting point. Between 1973 and 1983, Harley Davidson’s market share plummeted from 78 percent to 23 percent, as cheaper Japanese motorcycles flooded the American market. Realizing that the company could never compete on price, the American manufacturer had to ask itself: How exactly can we compete? The answer was simple: through emotion. Harley had noticed that a new class of customer had begun to emerge. Wealthy bankers, lawyers and doctors – who saw Harleys as status symbols – had formed biker groups, giving themselves names such as the “Rich Urban Riders” and “Rolex Riders.” Taking advantage of this trend, Harley Davidson raised prices rather than lowering them. As a result, by 1990, 60 percent of the company’s customer base was comprised of college graduates and professionals worldwide. Another way to reinvent your customer base is by re-examining the scope of customer segments. If you want to build a prosperous business, it’s natural to want to appeal to the broadest possible customer base, by building a product that fits everyone’s needs. However, honing in on a narrow customer segment can help you to avoid competition. The California-based company GU Energy Labs is a case in point. Their GU Energy Gel is made exclusively for endurance athletes, such as marathon runners and personal trainers, who make up only a tiny fraction of the larger sports market. Yet the company is hugely successful and is the market leader in its niche. We’ve focused on how to reinvent your business to move it forward. Our final blink will show you how to reinvent yourself. Sometimes being successful in business isn’t about reinventing your company or your strategy, but rather reinventing yourself. Take a fresh look at your life, starting with this fundamental question: What is your passion? Letting your passion guide your life and your business will open a world of new possibilities. Your passion and excitement will give you the strength to truly reinvent your career. In 1975, motorcycle enthusiast Jim Jannard founded the sunglasses company Oakley, long a favorite among bikers and skiers. Yet after selling the company in 2007 for $2.1 billion, Jannard became obsessed with cameras. His passion for digital photography fueled his idea to create a digital camera that could produce the same results as a regular film camera, but at a much lower price. With the creation of his RED camera, Jannard managed to improve the quality of digital photography one hundred-fold and convinced many film enthusiasts that the future was digital. What’s more, reinventing the values that drive your life can help you achieve things that you really think are important. Tennis player Andre Agassi, at his peak, had it all: money, fame and power. Still, he wasn’t happy. In 1997, he fell out of the top professional rankings, became depressed and turned to drugs. But after a period of introspection, he reshaped his life. Now he was guided by new values such as generosity, compassion and thoughtfulness as his metrics of success, instead of tennis rankings and earnings. Through this, Agassi found new joy in tennis, and in 1999 he was again number one in the world. His success enabled him to pursue his true passion: charity. He founded the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education, dedicated to helping at-risk children, a foundation that has raised over $60 million. The key message in this book: To stay competitive over the long haul, companies – as well as individuals – must be open to constant change and reinvention. By rethinking who your customers are, how you manage your processes and how you express your company culture, you can find new, inventive ways to succeed. Actionable advice: Bring reinvention to your meetings. At your next meeting, set a timer for ten minutes and imagine that you’ve been invited to transform your company for the future. You’ve got $100 million at your disposal; what will you do? Try coming up with 35 ideas that will dazzle the CEO. Go crazy. Quantity is more important than quality!

Maybe for some, who associate them with too much wasted effort and frustration, they’re even a deal-breaker. But it’s really no biggy if you know how to go about it. These blinks of The Secrets to Writing a Successful Business Plan take you right to the core of the issue – that is, why business plans are so damn important, how to avoid common mistakes in both style and content, and how to craft them successfully. In these blinks, you’ll learn when it makes sense to make your business plan a 30-page roadmap – and when it doesn’t; why you should pay extra attention to the executive summary; and which three basic financial statements you simply must include in your business plan. Most people have heard of business plans but don’t know a ton about them. So, what exactly are these tools of entrepreneurship? Well, a business plan is basically a brief write-up that lays out the basic elements of a soon-to-be company. There are a few things to keep in mind before you sit down to write a business plan, and the first is knowing when you need one. For instance, say you’re forming a new business – like opening a hair salon, buying an existing motorcycle shop or launching a start-up based on your own unique idea. Every one of these actions requires a business plan that details how operations will take place.  But what does a business plan really do? Essentially it helps structure your project, confirm its feasibility and crunch the numbers on its projected profits. So a business plan is more than a mere formal, administrative document. In fact, writing one should be a creative process that helps you flesh out your business idea.  It’s this process of thinking that will help you determine how likely your chances of success are and whether your idea is financially sound. Not just that, but in your business plan you’ll set reasonable goals, go over your benchmarks and put the finishing touches to your concept. This exercise is necessary because the time you invest here will help you identify and avoid any potential errors, thereby boosting your chances of success.  And finally, it’s important that you clearly state your value proposition. You can think of this as your elevator pitch. That is, imagine you step into an elevator only to find Mark Zuckerberg. Now you’ve got 15 seconds to win him over to your idea by answering the questions, “which problems are you solving?”, “how are you better than the competition?” and “why will you succeed where others have failed?”  Before we get to the real meat of writing a business plan, it helps to go over potentially deal-breaking mistakes and learn how to avoid them, specifically when it comes to seeking funding.  First of all, precision is everything, especially when identifying your competition. That means you need to be accurate and state exactly what you intend to do. So, while it’s nice to share your dreams with people, your business plan should deal with concrete issues like financing, product development, distribution and branding among others.  It’s also good practice to identify your competition. Because if you don’t, your potential funders will assume you lack general business insight and won’t want to invest with you. So remember, every business has competition.  But you’ll also need to answer the question, “how will this company make money?” If you take an approach that focuses too much on starting the business now and worrying about profits later, your business plan is unlikely to find much support.  The next step is to add brief biographies of your core staff members. Remember that when choosing investments, funders are putting their faith in an entrepreneur and his team. Therefore, it’s vital to make investors comfortable with you and the people working for you.  Equally important is making sure that the money you are asking for is in line with your needs. For instance, if you apply for a $100,000 loan, the investor will want to know how every dollar will be spent, whether it goes to inventory, equipment or salaries. So, if you can only account for $50,000 of the total, you’ll appear unreliable and likely won’t receive financial support.  Finally, you need to be consistent. That’s because overall consistency sends a powerful message that convinces investors of your idea’s validity. That makes outsourcing parts of your business plan a dangerous tactic. After all, you might end up with an only partially cohesive document. For example, if you tackle the sales forecast but ask a consultant to draft the marketing plan separately, the figures will likely be out of sync.  OK, now that you know about common pitfalls, let’s have a look at strategies for writing a strong business plan. The first thing to do is to put together a feasibility plan, a tool for challenging your assumptions.  This document, about five pages in total, should cover the key elements of your plan: the business idea, your main advantage over competitors, a profile of your target customer and a few snippets about daily operations. You should also include some figures that approximate your potential cash flows.  Basically, by looking at a feasibility plan you should be able to quickly determine whether your idea is solid enough to proceed or whether your initial thoughts about the business concept were too loose or naive.  Once you’ve got a strong feasibility plan and believe your idea is a good one, you should share it with your mentors and advisors. In other words, discuss your project with objective experts you trust and seek their feedback. This is a great way to further challenge your preconceived notions about your feasibility plan. On the other hand, seeking advice from family or friends who might be too quick to praise you won’t help you get an objective perspective on what matters most.  Then, if possible, begin your business with your own financial resources or those of your family.  Why? Because half of all new start-ups fail in the first five years. If your business is one of them you’ll be in a better position if you borrowed money from your grandmother than from a bank.  Now that the basics are all laid out it’s time to learn about the core of the business plan itself! We all know not to judge a book by its cover, but when it comes to business plans, the opening section can make or break the deal: it’s called the executive summary and it’s absolutely essential.  That’s because this section might be the only one your readers even look at. After all, bankers and investors are busy people, often mired in piles of business plans. Since they’ve got limited time to review them all, it’s unlikely that they’ll get past the first two pages of your plan if the story you tell doesn’t grab their attention.  But what exactly is an executive summary? It’s a rundown of your entire business plan that should be consistent with everything that follows. So, in the first paragraph state the problem you are going to solve for your customers and how your solutions are unique. Then, in a marketing paragraph, explain who your target is, how much you expect to sell and what competition you’ll face.  The following section should be brief and focus on your team. Give details about all your past experience and expertise in the industry. Finally, the last paragraph should detail your finances through key figures like your expected income over the next three years. Here you should list how much money you need to get going, then split this amount between the sum you’re putting down and how much you’ll need from outside investors.  But remember to keep it short and sweet at two pages max. And although the executive summary is the first section of your business plan, it’s actually best to write it last. That’s because you’ll do a better job once you’ve drafted the rest of the plan and know exactly what your project is all about.  You might have been working on a project for years and take things about it for granted, but it’s all new to those reading your business plan, which means you’ll need to present your ideas clearly.  For starters, you should detail your product or service, the channels through which it will be distributed and any competitors. When it comes to the product, naturally your readers will want you to paint a clear image of how it works. If you invented a new type of electric engine, investors would want to see the technical details of the device.  But your distribution channels are also important. Because whether you plan to sell your product on the internet, through retailers or on the wholesale market, it’s essential to explain why the choice you made is the right one for your business.  It’s also important to highlight your competitive advantages. Maybe you’re local, meaning you’ve got inside knowledge of a particular market or tons of experience in your field.  Then you should lay out every detail of your operations from your production techniques to your schedule. Readers will want details on your daily business routine in general, everything from your location to working hours, to the equipment you’ll use. Maybe your main supplier is on the other side of the globe. In a case like this it would be essential to explain how the two of you will work together across this distance.  Any potential legal issues should also be detailed. For instance, when opening a bar one usually needs to acquire a liquor license.  Finally, you should introduce your team. That’s because your investors will want to know who is getting paid with their money. Putting your entire family on the payroll will likely raise some red flags.  So, to be clear about this, answer these questions: “Will you work in a team or by yourself?”, “Do you want to hire people on a contractual basis?” and “Do your staff members have the necessary expertise?”  Once you’ve got this information laid out you’ll need to communicate your business strategy and your plan for reaching your goal. To do so you should break it down into three parts. First, include a market analysis that details the size of your market and potential customers or business clients. By beginning this analysis with the size of the market, you’ll show that there are enough customers to make your idea profitable.  From there you can profile your ideal customer, a crucial step in figuring out how to reach him. For instance, say you invented a new Facebook-like site for dogs. Your target is likely pet lovers between the ages of 15 and 40 who are excited about new technology.  Step two is to produce a competition analysis. If you’re anything like the average start-up entrepreneur you’re likely convinced that your idea is so unique that no competitor even comes close. Well, unfortunately this is simply never the case.  So, a competition analysis is crucial for showing your readers that you’ve realistically assessed market conditions. In this analysis, you want to identify roughly five main competitors along with their biggest strengths and weaknesses. For instance, this might relate to their marketing strategies, their delivery policy or their operating hours.  Then you can try to determine how your competitors will respond when you enter the market. For instance, will they slash their prices, steal your ideas or maybe increase their use of aggressive advertisements? Finally, the last step is to offer specific marketing techniques, of which there are many, like email marketing, press and media, internet ads, blogging and countless other strategies. To determine which are right for you, keep track of the costs of each and the potential benefits they produce. It’ll be clear which gives the most bang for your buck! There’s another aspect of your business plan that’s absolutely essential to investors and that’s the financial statements. Most of us don’t know much about this, so it’s helpful to start with the basics. Financial statements are basically charts that detail key financial figures regarding your business activity, and drafting them is the last step before you tackle the executive summary. In fact, these tables are a kind of summary that uses numbers to wrap up everything you’ve previously described.  There are three types of financial statement that every business plan should have: the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash-flow statement.  First, the balance sheet is simply a two column table divided between assets and liabilities. The former describes what you’ve got – things like equipment, money and inventory – and the latter what you owe, such as loans to a bank or debts to a supplier. The balance sheet is more or less a snapshot of your company’s money and debt.  The income statement comes second. It’s a single column chart that details your sales, minus your expenses, thereby displaying your net profits. This statement should contain everything that has changed your financial position that year.  Finally, your cash-flow statement is all about – you guessed it – cash. This statement looks very similar to one you’d receive from a bank, simply showing the in- and out-flows of money.  Accurately producing these statements requires you to rely on solid assumptions. Remember, each figure you present should be supported by evidence. Whether that comes in the form of market research, interviews or even your own hypothesis doesn’t matter as long as it’s convincing. To be cautious, you can even draft a couple of different scenarios, one conservative and one a bit more optimistic. Just change your central assumptions accordingly.  Congratulations, you’ve got everything you need to craft a stellar business plan! But now it’s time to talk about investors. Because knowing how to approach them is essential to your plan’s success.  First off, if you are going to apply for a bank loan, don’t go in assuming they’ll fully fund your business. In fact, bankers tend not to consider themselves the sole source of funding. That means you can’t expect to get more than 80 percent of your funding from a bank and, before you even apply for a bank loan, you should have secured some other funding. Not just that, but a bank will also want you to commit your own money, bringing in collateral of about 125 percent of the loan.  But if you can’t get a bank loan you can go with two other potentially more expensive options. The choice is between business angels and venture capitalists, both of whom will offer cash in exchange for shares in your company.  The first, business angels, are extremely wealthy individuals who invest up to $2 million, expecting a return of between five and ten times their original investment. The second, venture capital firms, tend to invest larger amounts of between five and ten million dollars but expect much higher returns in the range of about 30 times the original. Naturally these funding options will cost you more in the long run than a bank loan because they are assuming a greater risk.  But regardless of the type of investors you secure, they’ll all have shared requirements when it comes to the financial data you provide. All of them will be interested in what’s known as your burn-rate, that is, the amount it costs you to operate over a given period.  Investors are obsessed with this indicator because it describes how long your business can stay afloat with their investment. They’ll also likely want to see a three-year financial forecast with the first year broken down month by month.  The key message in this book: Starting a business is hard work and over half of those that get off the ground go bankrupt within their first five years. It’s crucial to put in the groundwork, and you can only troubleshoot a new business by drafting a rock solid business plan.  Actionable advice: Know your competitive advantage and don’t think that low prices are a substitute: Before deciding to launch your business take the time to consider your competitive advantages and whether you even have any. If it seems like you don’t, you might be tempted to simply undercut competitors, but this strategy rarely pans out. That’s because while prices heavily influence consumer choices, people also tend to assume there is a problem with the cheapest option. In other words, rock bottom prices alone are no replacement for a unique market edge.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

By breaking down a process into smaller units, and training workers to perform highly skilled and specific tasks, a company can produce better products faster. Yet as you’ll see, division and departmentalization can go too far, having devastating effects on a company’s creativity and flexibility. But the problems are even bigger than that. Silos are in our heads just as much as in our companies. It’s time to bust them for good.  These blinks will show you how and why we build silos in the first place, and explain just how you can take action to modify them for the better, if not break them down altogether. In these blinks, you’ll discover how New York made fires more predictable for fire fighters; how Sony was stuck in an “octopus pot” for too long; and why Facebook insists its new employees head to boot camp. A silo is more than just a physical structure. These deep, narrow columns exist metaphorically not just in social circles but also in our minds – and they are harmful for many reasons. Silos in an organization effectively discourage people from working together. In New York City, various government departments were like silos, to the extent that even the fire department and emergency call operators – two groups that need to talk to each other – couldn’t even tune their wireless communications to the same frequency.  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at the time made it a top priority to better connect various departments. He also pushed for open office spaces, and ensured that the fire department, the finance department and the police investigations department shared data so that his administration could better predict the risk of fire in city-owned buildings.  While it’s certainly logical to share data and cooperate within a large organization like a city administration, it’s still a challenge. People tend to live and socialize within silos, choosing to stay within particular groups, usually made up of people who are similar to us.  We’re also encouraged to specialize as the business world becomes more complex. We value the opinions of experts, for example, even though they work with others in their fields' “silos.”  These sorts of specialized silos do have positive aspects, too. Silos help us organize our social lives, our workplaces, our economic systems and institutions, and lead to greater accountability.  But this increased accountability is a part of the problem, especially in the workplace. When teams are only accountable for their particular part of a project, they can become competitive or restrictive about data, wasting resources or worse, miscalculating risks. Broadly defined, anthropology is the study of human beings. Social and cultural anthropology focuses on society and culture, whereas physical anthropology focuses on evolution and human biology. The discipline split into these two fields in the twentieth century. Before this, anthropologists sought to understand how a “primitive” person transformed into a more “modern” individual. Often at the time, non-Western societies were considered by default as “primitive.” In the twentieth century, however, anthropologists began to conduct “participant observation” of non-Western societies, realizing that such groups maintained their own social systems and cultural norms, which were different from Western models but still functioned in a similar way.  French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, one of the more influential intellectuals of his time, was involved with anthropological research in Algeria yet had a moment of clarity when he returned to France. Together with an Algerian student, he began to study French society. The pair found they had greater insight into French culture, as one was an “insider” and one an “outsider.” In his research, Bourdieu discovered that France too had its own kind of cultural dogma.  Based on his research, Bourdieu developed a number of social theories. He postulated that a society’s physical space, its population and its culture are determined by its patterns of thought and its systems of classification. Nobody deliberately creates these patterns; yet the patterns do help to maintain social strata, for example.  Furthermore, a society isn’t just determined by the ideas it shares and identifies but also by the ideas it hides: taboos.  So society shapes us, but doesn’t trap us. We can reflect our own cultural norms or even overcome them, if we choose to do so. These ideas, based on anthropological studies that penetrate the reasons behind cultural categories and societal perspectives, can better help us understand how silos work in the modern day.  To come up with new ideas, people need space to be creative, freely exchanging ideas with other people from different disciplines. Silos, however, discourage all of this.  Most large organizations are divided into silos that work independently, making it difficult for silos to collaborate or efficiently communicate.  As one example, Japanese technology giant Sony was once a leading international firm, with revolutionary products sold all over the world. Today, however, the company is a shadow of its former self. What happened? Sony lost its creative drive after it grew too large. Founded just after World War II, Sony was at first a small, dynamic firm. In the early 1990s, new leadership decided to manage company growth by subdividing its divisions into self-sufficient, specialist units: silos. This was in line with a prevailing trend at the time. Companies were seen as collections of smaller, separate businesses, each with their own balance sheet. Yet this shift made the separate departments less willing to take risks, as they now had more responsibility. It also hindered communication between departments. This is why in 1999, Sony launched three different gadgets that played digital music. Each device was based on a different standard, as each was produced by a different division of the company. Sony was effectively competing against itself! It’s very difficult to restructure a company once silos are in place. Sony tried to fix the problem by hiring Howard Stringer, the company’s first CEO who wasn’t originally from Japan. When Stringer told the board the company had too many silos, his translator struggled as there was no word for “silo” in Japanese. The team eventually began referring to silos in Japanese as “octopus pots.” An octopus pot is essentially a silo, a narrow column that an octopus can get into, but can’t escape from. This image helped employees understand the concept of silos – but organizational issues still remained. It’s dangerous when one department in a company doesn’t know what other departments are doing. This creates problems, such as the inability to correctly assess business risks.  The Swiss financial services company UBS learned this the hard way during the 2008 financial crisis, when one of its silos caused the company’s downfall.  Earlier in 2005, the company created a new department for securitizations, a highly specialized market in which mortgages were packaged as bonds and traded. While the department was small, its financial activity was enormous; the bonds too held an AAA credit rating, the highest level.  However, when the crisis hit, those bonds were no longer considered a safe investment. Suddenly no one wanted to buy them; and UBS incurred huge losses. UBS could have avoided this situation if its separate departments had shared more information, but its staff across different silos had no incentive to do so; their salaries depended only on the performance of their own departments. In the end, UBS lost over $10 billion because of one silo located in its US branch, which executives at the company’s Swiss headquarters hardly even knew about. Silos also make it hard for economists and regulators to accurately assess the workings of the global economy. This was crucially the case with the appearance of new financial entities that didn’t fit old classification systems. These new, highly capitalized companies weren’t banks, as they didn’t take deposits or make loans; they weren’t hedge funds, as they didn’t officially invest in risky assets. As a result, these twenty-first century financial entities were just considered “other financial corporations,” slipping through both the naming and regulatory cracks.  Which is one of the many reasons why the 2008 financial crisis was so brutal and so abrupt. Industry types were focused only on their own silos; and within each silo, the world was rosy. The silos encouraged “tunnel vision” and prevented anyone from seeing the growing market risks.  Silos aren’t just inside your company, they’re also inside your mind.  That’s why silo-busting starts with you. If you’re a trained computer expert, for example, this speciality probably affects your social and cultural silo. You can break this silo down by sharing your expertise with other fields.  Personal silo-busting means interacting more with people who are different from you, both socially and professionally. Brett Goldstein, a trained computer expert from Chicago, decided after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York to work with Chicago police. He used his skills to analyze Chicago’s murder statistics, as teams across different districts weren’t sharing information to accurately follow changes in gang behavior.  Goldstein’s skills helped police better predict the possibility of gang conflict escalating to killings. He helped to break down silos in the police force while at the same time, breaking down his own.  Interestingly, more often than not police organizations as well as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are prone to overusing silos. It’s possible that if different security agencies had communicated better about the activities of al-Qaeda operatives, 9/11 may have been avoided.  There’s another important benefit of silo-busting, in that it can earn you a lot of money. The hedge fund BlueMountain Capital came up with an effective silo-busting strategy. The fund analyzed different markets to see when major investors through their activities were creating distortions in market prices, then bet against them. The fund knew that silos within banks often incentivize traders to do things that might make sense on a micro-level, but often don’t benefit the bank as a whole. Thus traders within bank silos sometimes work too much within one market, creating market price distortions.  So BlueMountain Capital kept an eye on market giant JPMorgan as in 2012 it went deep into highly volatile credit default swaps, and proceeded to lose billions in the process. BlueMountain zigged while JP Morgan zagged, and in the process, earned itself a ton of cash. Not every company is a mute collection of silos. Social media giant Facebook, for example, has been quite successful in avoiding the creation of impermeable silos within the company while still harnessing the advantages of concentrated, specialized work.  All new Facebook employees go through the same six-week course known as boot camp, no matter their rank or department. They all learn the same information, work together and get to know each other. The boot camp experience creates long-lasting bonds that remain, even when employees go off to their separate units. Facebook also holds weekly meetings and hosts social events to make sure employees keep interacting and sharing with each other. The company strives to maintain the positive aspects of silos by keeping separate teams that have the freedom to collaborate and work creatively, while not allowing the company to fragment too much. Facebook also has a program called Hackamonth, a way to shake up unproductive silos. After an employee spends one year working on a project, he joins a different team for about a month. About half of reassigned employees stay with their new teams and the rest return to their previous positions.  Sure, a Hackamonth costs money and time, but it keeps the company interconnected and allows more ideas to flow, fostering creativity too! Facebook also knows that separate teams in large companies often fall into competing with each other. That’s why it holds hackathons about every six weeks. In a hackathon, several hundred engineers gather in a small space for one night and focus on coding-related problems. As an added twist, hackathon participants never collaborate with the same colleagues they usually work with.  Despite all these efforts, there’s still a danger that Facebook could become one giant silo of its own. Only the introduction of new people and new ideas can prevent this. When you go to the hospital, you know what hurts – but you don’t necessarily know which kind of doctor you might need to make the pain go away.  One of the biggest and most renowned medical centers in the United States, the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, took seriously the idea of breaking down silos and revolutionized itself in the process. CEO Delos Cosgrove measured progress mostly in technical and economic terms until he heard that patients were choosing less-qualified clinics over the Cleveland Clinic because they felt clinic doctors weren’t personal or empathetic enough.  So Cosgrove started silo-busting by asking patients what they valued, and learned that personal service was very important to them. He then reexamined how the clinic ran as well as its approach to medicine in a broader sense. He began to question the classification system medical professionals used to assess their field. The Cleveland Clinic’s restructuring wasn’t just about mental reorganization, either. It also broke down the distinction between nurses and doctors by calling both “caregivers” and created new, multidisciplinary institutes that focused on certain body systems, like the Head and Neck Institute. These new institutes connected surgeons and physicians from different fields, a revolutionary step. Prior to this, a cardiac surgeon for example had never worked with a cardiologist! The Cleveland Clinic’s reorganization was possible because its employees received fixed salaries, which is unusual in the United States. The clinic still maintained a hierarchy and different salary groups, but the stability in pay allowed different physicians and surgeons to collaborate in new and important ways.  Ultimately, the clinic restructured itself to suit a patient's needs, not the institution's needs. The key message in this book: Humans have developed silos as a natural response to the increasing complexity of the world. Though they have their benefits, silos often blind us to risks and stifle our creativity. So we need to engage in silo-busting, both in our own minds and in society, too. When people from different silos come together and collaborate, they can produce great innovations.  Actionable advice: Take control of your silos instead of letting them control you. We can’t and shouldn’t abolish silos completely; we still need specialists in our world. However, we can master silos instead of letting them master us, by regularly reexamining and reorganizing our social, cultural and mental systems. Remember: silos are only useful in the short-run. The danger is when they become fixed.

But since every one of us has different values and opinions, the same message can have totally different effects, depending on who the receiver is. In these blinks, you’ll learn some small tips that will make a big difference in your powers of persuasion. Whether it’s at home, at the office, or in your own decision-making, you’ll find that the small bigs can revolutionize the way you approach persuasion. After reading these blinks, you will: know how to get people to show up to their doctor’s appointment. see why focusing on business failures is better than studying business successes. see how graffiti leads to litter. Did you know that some simple, small changes can significantly alter how persuasive a message is? More than a crafty tactic, persuasion is important, and lack of it can have costly consequences. For example, as a society, we lose a lot of money when we don’t fulfill our commitments. So persuading others to fulfill their commitments can be very beneficial. One industry which suffers as a result of lack of commitment is health-care. A popular phrase in healthcare is DNA, standing for “Did Not Attend.” This is when we schedule an appointment but don’t show up. In the UK alone, the problem of DNA has accounted for a £800 million loss. Governments and organizations are responsible for collecting funds in a prompt manner. Yet, due to late or absent payments, governments, organizations and customers alike are all charged fees. Fortunately, even slight changes in the approach can have a surprisingly large effect. You might think that if we were to offer people detailed information and a rational explanation on the subject, it would change their behavior. Take turning off the lights in an office, for example: a common approach is to give your co-workers reasons why it’s important to switch them off, such as cost efficiency and environmental friendliness. But persuasion science studies tell us that these rational methods are likely to fail. There is a better way to get workers to switch off their lights. It’s a small change that has a big effect: put a garbage bin under the light switch. This way, workers will be predisposed to flip the light switch as they throw out their waste when they leave the office. This is just one of the small bigs that can effect people’s behavior. As the rest of the blinks will show, these small bigs can also solve the aforementioned DNA problem and much more. Here’s a negotiating tip: before you hone your strategy, select the right place to hold the negotiation. Your environment is far more influential than you think. Depending on the situation, certain environments can even influence how responsible we are. One experiment by Keizer examined this oddity by placing advertisements on customers’ bikes in front of a shopping center. The number of people who threw the advertisements on the ground, instead of putting them in the trash bin changed depending on whether or not the researchers added graffiti to the alleyway adjacent to the shopping centre. When there was no graffiti, 33 percent threw the advert on the ground, whereas when there was graffiti, 69 percent did so. Another study showing how surroundings influence how we act focussed on creativity in different environments. Participants were better at solving creative problems in a regular room, as opposed to a room with a low ceiling, in which participants were found to have completed fewer creative tasks. Slight changes to seating arrangements can also change the results of discussions. Scientists found that different seating layouts influenced people’s attention in a discussion. Circular arrangements, for instance, made people consider more of what would be ideal for their group. In contrast, people seated in angular (such as L-shaped) or square arrangements, responded more positively to information or proposals that were self-oriented. Changing the venue itself can also have a significant impact on negotiations. Much like football games, there is the possibility of a home advantage in places where you negotiate. In one study, researchers assigned groups that were to negotiate with each other to either a home or visitor status. Before the negotiation, the home group was allowed to tailor a room (previously a neutral place) to suit them, such as displaying their names. The researchers observed that groups with the home status outperformed visitors in the negotiation. The decisions we make are based on our own thoughts, right? At least that’s what we like to think. But our behavior is strongly influenced by those around us, particularly by those with whom we identify. This tendency is called social proof. To take a closer look at social proof, the company Influence at Work decided to address the issue in the UK that many people were not paying their taxes. Their small big idea was to include a sentence in the reminder letters distributed by the government, stating that citizens from the same area were paying their taxes on time. As a result, the response rate to the letters rose from 67 percent to 79 percent. Even more impressively, when the name of the town was also included, the response rate rose to 83 percent. So, the more similar to ourselves we perceive others to be, the stronger the effect of social proof. Research in neuroscience has also shown that behaving contrary to a crowd consensus incurs emotional costs. In particular, fMRI studies have shown that areas in the brain associated with emotion are activated when we make decisions that conflict with others’ consensus. Contrastingly, we often disassociate ourselves from groups we don’t like. Studies have found that students are more likely to stop a certain behavior (such as wearing a special bracelet) when an “out-group” (in this case a “nerdy” student group) also sported the bracelets. There was a 32 percent drop in wearing the bracelets, in contrast to a mere 6 percent drop when there was no “out-group.” So it is important to couple your desired behavior with qualities which most people want to assume for themselves. Apple uses this small big technique well by accompanying its products with independent, confident and creative people. Because so many of us want to be perceived this way, we are far more likely to buy their products! We are all scared of making mistakes. But we can learn to play mistakes to our advantage. One way to do so is by noting other people’s mistakes. Rather than emulating what successful entrepreneurs did to make them successful, focus on what led to their failures. Charlie Munger, investment advisor to Warren Buffett, analyzes and avoids the unwise decisions of other companies that led them into some sticky situations. He created a collection of other peoples mistakes which he called his inanities-list. But isn’t this contrary to what we’ve been told? Don’t we learn from positive outcomes? Yet researchers assert that this is not the case. Professor Roy Baumeister and his colleagues discovered that we actually focus more on negative information and learn more from it than from positive information. It’s important to manage our own mistakes and we shouldn’t necessarily avoid them. Rather than averting mistakes, organizational scientists found that the Error Management model (EMT) is more accurate than the traditional error-avoidance slant, which posits that we should try to avoid making mistakes whenever we can. The EMT-model is similar to the inanities-list in that it involves acknowledging and understanding how other people’s failures came about. Secondly, it involves analyzing your own mistakes after the fact and responding appropriately to them. In the EMT-model, people learn that mistakes are a normal part of learning and so aren’t categorized as personal failure. Interestingly, this model can also improve your customer service. In a study on customer satisfaction, one hotel chain found that customers who had the chance to experience hotel staff responding to a mistake were more satisfied and loyal than customers who had an uneventful stay. Just as our physical environment is key to the art of persuasion, so is the persuader. Some minor changes in how we portray ourselves can do wonders for communicating our message effectively. Moreover, if you can convince people that you’re an expert, you’re already halfway to becoming a master of persuasion. For example, recent brain-imaging studies illustrate that we’re more likely to make financial choices that are otherwise unfamiliar to us when we are advised by an expert, such as a well-known economist. In these studies, brain areas connected to critical thinking and counter-arguing were almost inactive. The scientists postulated that the expert-factor ruled over everything, including quality of arguments, when the audience didn’t feel strongly either way. We may not all be experts, but if your self-confidence could use a boost, it may serve you to look back on the times when you were successful. This is evident in one study where two groups of participants had to attend a job interview. Before the interview, the first group noted experiences in which they felt powerful and the other group noted experiences in which they felt powerless. The result? The first group out-performed the second. Even compared to a control group, who didn’t do any writing, the powerful group was more persuasive. So, having confidence is ideal, but you shouldn’t take it too far. Researchers found that a review by a well-known food critic was more persuasive when he articulated insecurity, than when he said he was 100 percent positive that the restaurant was the best. The researchers explained that we often expect experts to be convinced of their opinion, so when they show insecurity, it sparks our attention, which results in the message being more persuasive. Therefore, to be persuasive, we need to be confident and at the same time aware of flaws in ourselves, our theories or our products. If you manage anyone at work, you will want to know how to motivate them. Here’s some useful advice. Often workers don’t achieve their full potential because they feel that what they are doing is not significant enough. When this happens, they start feeling detached from their jobs. Professor Adam Grant conducted a study in a call center where staff called up college alumni and had to persuade them to donate money to the college. Prior to calling anyone, one group was asked to read a text by another employee, highlighting the personal gain (e.g. their wages) the employee gets from doing their job, and the second group read texts written by students about how their situation had improved from receiving their scholarship. The second group received more than double the pledges than the first group. Why? Because the employees, having seen the meaningfulness of their work, became more motivated to ask for donations and actively persuade those they were calling. So what else can increase the chances of getting others to behave how we would like them to? Personal commitment and implementation intention plans. Take the aforementioned DNAs in the healthcare industry: when people had to write down their appointment date themselves, the DNA rates fell by 18 percent. This improvement is an example of an implementation intention plan. Implementation intention plans help us when we want to carry out a certain behavior such as going to the gym regularly. These plans are an agreement, but don’t necessarily have to be written down, and they outline where, when and how we intend to reach a particular goal. We can see the effect of this in one study in which households either filled out a voting plan, detailing the time and location of voting, or didn’t fill out any voting plan. Those households who had a plan were more likely than those who had no plan to actually vote on election day. As we’ve seen, good negotiating is about how and where you present your message. Another way to get a solid start on negotiating is to make the first offer and make it precise. Customers take the first offer from their counterpart and use it as a base or anchor for the negotiation. Even if an initial offer is much higher than they were expecting, they will adjust their expected figure accordingly. Say you work as a car salesperson and your customer is prepared to pay $2000 for one of the cars. But you pre-empt them and offer $5000 as a benchmark. According to research, your customer will agree to a price tag closer to $5000 than their expected $2000, due to this anchor effect. This phenomenon tells us that customers believe salespeople, who they regard as experts, offer such high figures because there must be something about the product’s value that they don’t know about. You could increase your persuasiveness even more if you were to present a precise amount such as $5132 to your customer. This is because it implies to the customer that a lot of time and effort went into researching the car’s value. So this price seems more accurate and realistic. If you want to make an offer even more enticing, you should partner it with unappealing offers. Take renowned chef Antonio Carluccio, for example. He decided to introduce an unfamiliar item to his italian restaurant menu in which, besides the pastas and salads, you could also order a Vespa scooter. Although his scooter sales didn’t take off, the rest of the menu seemed far more appealing because the other items were much cheaper than the scooter. This is a phenomenon in psychology known as perceptual contrast. A more down-to-earth way to use this idea would be to add a $60 wine to your menu, along with the $15 wines. Suddenly the $15 wine will seem far more attractive. Even the best persuasion tactics sometimes fail simply because people don’t want to change their behavior right this minute. In order to be persuasive, it’s often a good idea to remember that instant change isn’t always the only way. Sometimes we need to give people some time to act the way we want them to. Let’s take a look at short term decisions. When you think about going out for dinner this weekend, for instance, you think of the concrete costs of the decision, such as weighing up if you can afford it or not. Events in the future, however, evoke more abstract thinking. When considering the future, we think how the event is connected to our own morals and values. Therefore, if everyone we know is attending a particular Christmas dinner, then we are likely to agree to go, too. If an event fits into our moral values, we are more likely to say yes to it when it’s further away in the future. So how can we apply this technique? Well, for example, if you know that you are going to need help painting your apartment in a few weeks, ask your friends as early as you can. If they don’t yet have definite ideas of what they are doing on the date you need to paint the apartment, they are more likely to agree to help you. Note, however, that if something has to be done in a timely manner, don't give people too much time. It’s a mistaken belief that giving people extra time to complete a request or task increases the likelihood that they will do so. To test this, researchers in one study altered the expiration date of bakery vouchers and observed how often customers redeemed them. They found that those who received vouchers with long expiration dates reported they will likely use them, but they actually redeemed them five times less than customers with vouchers displaying shorter expiration dates. The key message in this book: Successful persuasion does not merely depend on the message, but on context and environment. By making some minor changes in how you approach persuasion, you can significantly improve your ability to convince others. Actionable advice: Keep your prices precise! Remember, the more exact a price is, the more people believe there are good reasons behind its pricing and will be more tempted to buy the product. So, instead of placing a $400 price tag on your product, try making it $457. Change your seating arrangements. The next time you schedule a meeting, think about your desired outcome. If a group decision is important, arrange seating in a circular fashion. If individual benefits are more important to you, use an angular or L-shaped seating arrangement.

Enron’s fall from grace is probably the most scandalous business story of our times, its skyrocketing profits followed by the largest bankruptcy case in US history. But how does a respected company make it to the top of the business world, only to crumble into economic tragedy? In these blinks, you’ll venture into Enron’s past to learn about the fascinating people behind this infamous scandal, and will see how greed and deceit can lead to such a dramatic demise. You’ll also learn why egomaniacs and backstabbers were welcome at Enron; how financial structures sneakily camouflaged existing debts; and  what went on in the company’s closed-door meetings. Does it ever feel like history is repeating itself? It sure seemed that way in 2001 when the American energy colossus Enron filed for bankruptcy. The company’s demise due to huge debts and fraudulent business practices mirrored problems they had experienced years earlier, when first starting out.  In fact, in 1987, just two years after it was founded, Enron was already saddled with debt.  Enron was formed in 1985 through a merger between two pipeline companies, Houston Natural Gas (or HNG) and InterNorth. An intelligent and ambitious man named Ken Lay assumed the role of CEO, and in 1986 the company was renamed Enron.  Unfortunately for Lay, it wasn’t long before Enron was in dire financial straits. By early 1986, Enron reported a first-year loss of $14 million, and by January 1987 its credit rating was at junk status. What happened? Enron had been engaging in dishonest business practices that had brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and a specific subdivision called Enron Oil was causing the most trouble. Enron Oil wasn't producing or selling oil, but simply speculating on oil prices; not only that, but the oil traders were manipulating their earnings.  For example, they would set up deals with fake companies that let them take a huge loss on one contract, only to cancel out these losses with a second contract that generated the same amount in profits. Their fictitious losses enabled them to move earnings from one quarter to the next.  Enron was trying to prove to Wall Street that it could turn a steadily increasing profit, a trend that the stock market is quick to reward. However, by 1987, Enron’s oil trading game had taken such a loss on high-risk bets that the entire company was on the verge of bankruptcy.  But Ken Lay was prepared to act. He assured analysts on Wall Street that this downturn was just a freak event that could never repeat itself. But as we now know, this kind of deceit and carelessness was at the very core of Enron’s company culture. Enron managed to pull itself out of its first crisis, but by the end of 1988 it was in hot water once again. The company’s main problem was that it didn’t have a business model that could turn real profits, an issue Enron hoped to solve by hiring Jeffrey Skilling.  Skilling, formerly a consultant for McKinsey and a graduate of Harvard Business School, joined Enron in 1990, taking the position of CEO at a new subdivision called Enron Finance. A very bright man, Skilling was a major force behind Enron’s transformation into a successful company – at least temporarily.  First, Skilling turned Enron into what he called a Gas Bank. The idea was that gas producers would sign a contract to sell their product to Enron, who would in turn sign contracts with customers. Enron’s profit was the difference between what it paid the producers and what it charged its customers. But Skilling saw another way to make money through these contracts: trading the agreements themselves.  The second step in Skilling’s master plan was to convince Enron to use mark-to-market accounting.  While conventional accounting works by entering revenues and profits from a contract as the money comes in, mark-to-market accounting logs the total estimated value of the entire contract on the day it’s signed. So, by immediately posting all potential profits, companies that use mark-to-market accounting appear to be growing quickly. This, in turn, pleases Wall Street speculators and the stock goes up.  Finally, Skilling forged a corporate environment in which sheer brains were valued more highly than skilled management and hands-on experience. In fact, he used to say that he liked to hire “guys with spikes,” meaning that if an executive boasted a single talent, or a spike, Skilling would take him on board regardless of any shortcomings.  That spawned a company full of egomaniacs, social misfits and backstabbers – which didn’t bother Skilling as long as they cunningly did what he needed them to.  But is it possible for a company to ride a wave of success solely propelled by a brilliant workforce? Not in the case of Enron.  It was Jeff Skilling who transformed Enron, but until the mid-1990s, most people outside the company had no clue who he was. The face of Enron to the outside world was in fact Rebecca Mark – the female star in a male-dominated industry.  Until the 1990s, developing countries were usually overlooked by corporations in the West, even though they had massive populations and matching energy needs. Rebecca Mark was the head of a company subdivision called Enron Development, and her task was to strike energy deals with as many developing nations as possible, thereby flying Enron’s flag the world over.  So, she set out around the globe, and by the mid-90s Enron Development appeared to be wildly successful, with Mark getting credit for making it happen. While she was happy to play up her good looks and dazzling smile, Mark’s signature characteristic was her optimism, resolutely believing that everything would work out well.   But despite her smiles and assurances, Mark gradually tainted the deal-making culture at Enron Development; her subordinates were made to think their task was simply to secure as many deals as possible, a result of Enron’s flawed compensation structure. For instance, developers were paid bonuses on a project-by-project basis, meaning that they got paid when a deal was closed – before a single pipe was laid or a foundation poured. Therefore, developers had no incentive to follow through with deals they’d signed, and there was nobody else at Enron to take responsibility for projects once they were off the ground.  So, while Mark assumed nothing bad could happen, disasters were taking place every day. For example, in 1995, Enron invested $95 million in a Dominican Republic-based power plant. But as it turned out, the Dominican Republic government wouldn’t pay for the power the plant generated. As a result, by mid-2000, Enron’s huge investment had returned a mere $3.5 million! In 1996, Enron announced that Jeff Skilling would be the company’s new president and chief operating officer, or COO. Newly installed at the top of the company, Skilling quickly began remaking Enron to suit his image. Trading became Enron’s central focus, but Skilling also de-emphasized old projects like pipelines and the production of natural gas. Although Enron had already become the biggest name in the natural gas industry, Skilling wanted to go further. He wanted even more trading, and to deal not just in gas but to expand into the electric power sector as well, even though Enron was still an outside player in electricity.  While refashioning the company, Skilling took every chance he could to shed its old business operations, even ones that were profitable. As a result, by the end of the ‘90s, Enron had witnessed a profound shift: trading and cutting deals were now its core business.  But Skilling’s changes had other consequences, a major one being that Enron became a place where risk taking and financial deceit were practically inevitable. Why? Because Skilling’s tactic for generating Enron’s annual earning targets was absolutely ludicrous: he would set a fabricated number that simply reflected what Wall Street wanted.  The problem was that a company founded on trading and making deals can’t possibly rely on its earnings to steadily rise, since trading desks can earn or lose millions in one fell swoop.  As a result, the deals Enron brokered came with increasingly greater risks, and Enron’s Risk Assessment and Control department, or the RAC, would step aside as long as a deal had the necessary commercial support. At the same time, thanks to the mere existence of the RAC, Enron could paint itself as a company that handled greater risk more carefully than any competitors.  But to hit the earning targets it promised investors, Enron had to pull a few tricks; the company overstated its future revenue to delay recording the losses it was actually taking. While Skilling transformed the nature of Enron’s business, it was Andrew Fastow who transformed its finances.  It all began when Fastow, who had been a part of Enron’s financial division since 1990, was promoted to chief financial officer, or CFO, in 1998. He and his team went to work masterminding Enron’s finances to close the gap between the reality of the firm’s business and the picture Skilling and Lay wanted the world to see.  How? By creating financial structures that hid Enron’s debt.  Take Whitewing as an example. This Enron subsidiary was created in 1997 to purchase and sell off the company’s poorly performing assets. Say Enron constructed a power plant at a cost of $8 million and expected the plant to be worth $10 million – the company would mark a $2 million profit in its books.  When the plant underperformed, drawing a market value of just $7 million, Enron should have erased the $2 million profit it logged and replaced it with a $1 million loss. But instead, Enron would just sell the plant to Whitewing for the full $10 million. Whitewing would in turn sell it for $7 million and be compensated with the remaining $3 million in Enron stock.  Since the $3 million worth of stock Enron issued wouldn’t show as a loss on the books, the company had essentially disguised a $1 million loss as a $2 million profit.  But Fastow wasn't just making money for Enron – he knew how to pay himself too. For example, in 1999 he started a fund called LJM, named for the initials of his wife and two sons, Lea, Jeffrey and Matthew. Not unlike Whitewing, LJM invested in Enron’s badly performing stocks, a venture that allowed the company to keep them off its balance sheets.  However, Fastow heading LJM while also holding the position of CFO at Enron was an obvious conflict of interest, because he could essentially negotiate with himself. In the end, Fastow’s dual positions allowed him to quietly make tens of millions of dollars in personal profit. Enron couldn’t ride it’s fraudulent accounting practices forever. The company thought of them as a life preserver that would keep their business looking good until Skilling came up with another plan to make real profits.  Skilling’s first idea was to get into the electrical energy business, mainly because, by the mid-1990s, retail electricity was regulated by state governments. Enron was banking on the fact that the market would eventually be deregulated; when that happened, they would be perfectly placed to sell electricity straight to businesses and homes across the country.  There was just one problem: local energy providers organized a fierce backlash to stop deregulation, leading only a few states to actually curb regulations after all. And in California, a state that actually let Enron sell power directly to customers, Enron spent over $20 million on ads to bring in new business. However, despite the discounts Enron could offer, consumers weren’t ready to switch away from the reliable utility they’d always used in the past. In addition, Enron simply didn’t belong in the business of electricity. For instance, to woo customers, Enron promised to make huge improvements to efficiency – the only problem was, they didn’t have the first clue how to do it.  OK, so Skilling’s first plan was a bust, but what about his second? Well, it turned out to be a colossal failure, too.  Skilling pitched broadband as Enron’s next big thing, asking why Enron couldn’t trade bandwidth capacity just like it did natural gas. So, in 1999, Enron promised that it would soon be capable of delivering real-time bandwidth-on-demand. To do so, it would build a sophisticated new broadband network system.  At the time, Enron painted its system as “lit, tested, and ready.” But in reality, it wasn’t anywhere close to operational on a commercial scale, and a great deal of the technology they promised never even made it out of the lab. The fact was, Enron couldn’t provide bandwidth-on-demand then, and they never would. Given what you now know about Enron, it might be hard to believe that Thomas Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, said the executives at Enron had “the aura of whiz kids, of golden boys who could do no wrong.” In fact, Skilling and Lay were even being mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Apple’s Steve Jobs.  Analysts had kept blind faith in Enron’s performance. Take Enron’s annual analysts meeting of January 2000, an annual affair in which Skilling and other executives reviewed each business unit’s performance.  The meeting’s highlight? The company executives unveiled Enron’s new broadband strategy by confidently stating the company would become “the world’s largest provider of premium broadband delivery service.” Skilling even predicted that the new business venture would be worth a whopping $29 billion! Naturally, the room went mad, with some 200 analysts making rushed calls to their trading desks and telling them to invest in Enron. As a result, the company’s stock rose 26 percentage points in just one day. In fact, not one of the analysts in attendance ventured to ask a probing question; the mood was one of absolute praise for Enron.  So, while it might seem that the analysts themselves weren’t in the know, there was a surprisingly large circle of people who knew exactly what lurked beneath Enron’s shiny exterior.  For instance, many of the analysts knew the firm’s recorded earnings were well beyond the actual money coming in. In fact, J.P. Morgan analyst Kyle Rudden wrote in mid-1999 that “ENE [Enron’s stock symbol] is not a cash story...Enron has significant flexibility in structuring contracts and hence booking earnings.” But that’s not all the analysts knew. They also knew that Enron had huge quantities of off-balance-sheet debt, debt that doesn’t show on a company’s statement of financial position; even so, they only occasionally mentioned this in their reports.   On December 13th, 2000, Skilling was standing atop Enron’s peak: the company had just announced that he would take Ken Lay’s position as CEO. In celebration of his promotion, Business Week printed a reverential cover story, naming him America’s second-best CEO – just behind Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer. Skilling hadn’t even held the job for three months.  But despite the praise for Skilling, skepticism about Enron’s success was beginning to surface. On September 20th, 2000, Jonathan Weil – reporting for the Texas Journal, a regional supplement of the Wall Street Journal – published a story focusing on energy traders’ reliance on mark-to-market accounting, Enron’s essential tool for logging profits before the cash actually came in.  Upon reading the story, an influential hedge fund manager named Jim Chanos began investigating further. He discovered that although Enron was reporting steadily increasing earnings, the business itself didn’t appear to be earning much money at all. He took his skeptical views about Enron to Fortune magazine, and in March of 2001 they published a story with the headline “Is Enron Overpriced?” The piece made note of Enron’s lack of cash flow and rising debt, but also revealed the mounting skepticism toward Enron in the investment world.  That skepticism grew even more when Skilling unexpectedly left his position as CEO. On August 14th, 2001, the company announced his departure and said that Ken Lay would return to fill the role. Skilling’s statement to investors was, “There is nothing to disclose, the company is in great shape...this is an entirely personal decision.” But the move definitely looked strange. Why would such an ambitious CEO resign, just like that, only six months into the job? It was inevitable that Skilling’s sudden resignation would raise another wave of speculation into potential troubles at Enron. The day after Skilling’s resignation, a mid-level Enron veteran named Sherron Watkins mailed an anonymous letter to Ken Lay saying, “I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals.”  Nonetheless, Lay appeared unperturbed and, according to one Enron executive, “Ken thought there was nothing wrong with Enron that what was right with Enron couldn’t fix.” But regardless of what Lay said, Enron’s massive debt and plummeting stock were poised to send the company into a cash crisis.  A few of the deals Enron had made in order to bring in cash stipulated the immediate payback of billions in debt if Enron’s stock price and credit rating dropped past certain points. Since the media had unveiled how Enron was playing fast and loose with its finances, its stock had already dropped below the allowable limits of these deals, and the company’s credit rating was nearing junk territory.  By way of example, Enron’s stock had dropped from an August 2000 peak of $90 per share to below $20 per share in October 2001.  The company’s executives needed to find two or three billion dollars in a hurry, or its panicked creditors were going to shut the company down. But even that was out of the question, as banks had already made clear that Enron’s line of credit was bone dry.  Their only hope to avoid going bankrupt was to merge with Dynegy, another Houston-based energy trader that Enron had always held in contempt. Initially, Wall Street traders seemed to think the deal was a good idea, but they soon began to have second thoughts, as did the executives at Dynegy – after all, did Dynegy really know what a merger with Enron had in store? In short, the deal failed and Enron, without any alternatives, filed the biggest bankruptcy case in the history of the United States on December 2nd, 2001. In the wake of Enron’s collapse, everyone involved – even the board of directors – denied all responsibility. But by 2003, their charade was starting to fall apart, as prosecutors for the United States Department of Justice began issuing a long list of indictments. In the end, 33 people were indicted, and among them were 25 former Enron executives.  Here’s what happened to the people at the top – Lay, Skilling, Fastow and Mark: In 2004, Fastow pled guilty to all charges. He spent six years in prison and was released in 2011, admitting that he had “engaged in schemes to enrich [him]self and others at the expense of Enron’s shareholders.” He later added that “I and other members of Enron’s senior management fraudulently manipulated Enron’s publicly reported financial results. Our purpose was to mislead investors and others about the true financial position of Enron, and consequently, to inflate artificially the price of Enron’s stock and maintain fraudulently Enron’s credit rating.” Ken Lay passed away before spending a day in jail. He had been indicted on ten counts including conspiracy, making misleading statements and fraud. He pled not guilty to all charges and was found guilty of every one of them. But on July 5th, 2006, before the court had determined his sentence, he collapsed while with his wife outside of Aspen, Colorado – he had died of a heart attack.  Jeffrey Skilling was indicted in 2004 on 35 counts, including conspiracy, fraud and insider trading. Skilling was found guilty of 19 of his charges, despite maintaining that he “had no idea that the company was in anything but excellent shape.” In 2006, he was sentenced to over 24 years in prison and a $45 million fine.  Oh, and Rebecca Mark? She left Enron in August of 2000, before the scandal went public. She had sold her Enron stock at its peak, raking in a whopping $82.5 million. Mark was never accused of committing any crimes.  The key message in this book: The energy giant Enron used fraudulent business practices, including a toolkit of accounting scams and a toxic deal-making culture, to artificially inflate its stock. The company’s deceitful tactics inevitably led to its collapse, which ended in the biggest bankruptcy case in US history and a slew of indictments.  Actionable advice: Don’t let stock prices become an obsession. Enron’s stock price became all Jeff Skilling could think about. The company’s Wall Street standing was like his report card, and when away from the office he would call in multiple times a day to check on the stock’s performance. Keeping an eye on the financial health of your company is key, but Skilling’s obsession was the spark that ignited criminal impulses, which eventually landed Enron in hot water. Keep in mind that, generally, the quicker a stock rises, the more likely it is to plummet soon thereafter.  So, instead of solely focusing on ensuring a rising stock price, invest your energy into slow but sustainable business growth!

In the real world, however, there is more to developing a successful business than strategy and execution. You need to develop a relationship with people; without people, whether it be your employees or your customers, you cannot hope to succeed. These blinks explain how successful companies, from Amazon to Northwestern Insurance, have succeeded because they managed to establish meaningful connections with all people. In these blinks you’ll discover why there is no alternative to simple good taste; why only a few people are involved in the making of a Porsche; and why you should never need to buy more than two pizzas for your team. What do you think of when you think of successful businesses? Great leaders? Great management? Excellent products? The foundation of all great businesses is their strategy. You can think of a business like an equilateral triangle. The strategy is the base: it’s knowing what market you’re in, who your customers are and what your competitors are doing. It supports the other two sides of the triangle. The first of those two sides is the hard edge. The hard edge is how the business actually functions. You can’t just have a good strategy – you’ve got to execute it deftly, as well. You can measure the success of the hard edge with raw figures that compute production speed, capital efficiency or logistics, to name a few. Harder to measure is the second side, the soft edge. The soft edge is the deeper meaning that a company communicates to its customers and employees. It’s that unquantifiable something that makes a company great. Good businesses sit on a strong base and adhere to an effective hard-edge operation model. Great businesses, however, always do more than that, which is what gives them their soft edge. So how do you measure your company’s soft edge? Values, innovation, culture, creativity – you can’t put these things on a graph and track whether they correlate with your investment returns. However, there is a model that’ll help you cultivate and keep track of your company’s developing soft edge. Imagine that your soft edge is a platform supported by five pillars. Now label these pillars: there’s the trust you earn from your employees and customers, the smarts that facilitate learning and innovation, the teams that collaborate and share ideas, the taste that gives your product depth and the story that gives your brand its purpose. Now let’s take a look at the five pillars that support the soft edge. You know that feeling you get with your closest friends? That feeling that everything’s going to be okay? That’s trust. Imagine if you felt that way at work. Trust is at the heart of the soft edge. It’s equally important to establish both external trust with your customers and internal trust with your staff. It’s absolutely vital that your customers trust you. In fact, the latest Edelman Trust Barometer – an international study of trust in businesses and other organizations – shows that trust affects corporate reputation more than the quality of products or services. You earn trust with your customers by showing them you have a secure business. Northwestern Mutual, for example, has built its company on trust. It’s the largest insurance provider in the US and it’s spent 157 years cultivating trust with its customers. The ratio of Northwestern’s insurance contracts to its assets is 7:1 – $1.5 trillion in contracts and $215 billion in assets. These figures clearly illustrate both how sound and prudent their business is and that customers are unafraid to entrust money to them. Obviously, there’s much to be gained from making trustworthiness one of your company’s core values. Creating internal trust begins when you’re honest and open with your employees. The network storage company NetApp has been quite successful with this. NetApp is regularly on various lists of the best places to work, including Forbes’s list of the most innovative companies. Even when the company went through a rough period and had to cut staff, their reputation for honesty and openness endured. Why? They treated their staff with utter respect. The executive management team even traveled to all the affected offices to personally deliver the bad news. Because they trusted their company, the remaining employees, though conscious that they too might get laid off, continued working hard. You know those companies who always seem a step ahead of their competitors? What makes them so smart? Do they have a bunch of speed-reading champion employees? From the outside, it’s hard to tell what makes a business smart, but in fact smart businesses are defined by something definite: hard work and the constant quest for improvement. A strong company always has to be ready to change. It needs to work hard and be prepared to make mistakes. That’s what makes a company smart. The best way to up your company’s braininess is to learn from your mistakes. David Chang, a famous chef and the owner of the Momofuku restaurant group, knows this well. He trained in Japan, where the concepts of kaizen (continuous improvement) and hansei (acknowledgement of your own mistakes) are highly valued. Chang honors this in his restaurants by giving his staff the freedom to try things out, letting them make mistakes and learn in the process. That’s how he improves the dishes he serves. So smart businesses constantly strive to learn and make improvements. They do this not only by learning from their mistakes but by learning from other companies, too – even those in other industries. Healthcare giant Mayo Clinic, for instance, uses this kind of lateral thinking to train their employees: They sent their staff to train at two of the world’s largest companies in the hospitality industry. They wanted employees to learn to treat their patients as customers, and to treat them with the utmost respect and care. The Mayo Clinic employees learned skills not normally taught in the healthcare industry, like how to put their patients at ease with little more than a greeting. So think outside the box, learn from your competitors and seek inspiration from other fields. And remember that, in business, having smarts is an ongoing process. Of course, smarts aren’t the only key to success. Your business has to have the right kind of organization, too. Humans are hardwired to function and excel in groups such as families, tribes and communities. Businesses should emulate the kinds of groups we instinctively work well in. This means teams should be small. Small teams ensure efficiency and effective communication. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, once said that a development team should be small enough that two pizzas will feed them all. That’s about eight to twelve people. In a group that small, everyone has the chance to get their hands dirty by trying out new ideas before discussing the results with the whole team. Porsche also implemented this strategy. After they created mini-teams focused on improving products and their development processes, their production quadrupled and their profitability increased by 19%. Another example is SAP, the German software company, which took inspiration from Porsche and also scaled down their development teams to between eight and twelve people. Their development time was reduced by half; on average, it dropped from 14.8 months to 7.8 months. The most effective teams consist of people with a wide range of backgrounds, beliefs and skills. Diversity ensures a multiplicity of perspectives on whatever project is being worked on. Nest Labs, a company that produces smart thermostats, believes in diversity within teams. They make sure to put engineers, marketers, designers and other workers together to get a multifaceted perspective on any products they’re developing. Tony Fadell, Nest Labs’s CEO, says the reason for this is simple. Their customers are diverse, so their teams should be as well. What exactly gives a great smartphone its greatness? How it looks? How it functions? How it feels in your hand? Excellent design isn’t merely a matter of solid interface – there’s always something more. Top-tier products need taste. Taste should seem innate, giving the product an aura of intelligence and intrigue; it’s that quality that’s hard to put a finger on, but makes the customer feel excited and smart. Although taste may seem like an abstract concept, every company needs to push for it. With taste in mind, Tony Fadell tries to give his customers a Nest Labs experience even if they’re doing something as simple as buying a thermostat. Nest Lab thermostats have a clean design without any buttons and they’re controlled remotely through WiFi. They come in bamboo boxes that symbolize Nest Lab’s commitment to green production and waste reduction. They also come with a special screwdriver and screws that allow customers to install their device wherever they think it looks best. Research in aesthetics has shown that people prefer familiar designs and objects to new ones. We feel more affinity for designs we recognize because they evoke all the emotions and memories we might associate with similar objects from our past. So when you create your brand, try to link it with something people already love. Jony Ive, the famous Apple designer, was inspired by Dieter Rams, a designer for Braun. In turn, Rams was inspired by the Bauhaus school of design. So part of what makes Apple products great is that their design traces a tradition of minimalism. Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, also understood the value of taste. He didn’t just build a coffee company – he reinvented the way Americans drink coffee by bringing Italian coffee culture to the US. He infused his cafés with ambience, complete with baristas and Italian words for coffee sizes. Now let’s look at the final pillar supporting a company’s soft edge. Just think of the first Apple products, built in that garage in Palo Alto. Stories like that one play a large role in shaping our perception of successful companies; it’s often what brings us to view them as great. A company’s story helps us understand it. It gives the brand its purpose. It lets us know where it came from, what it is today and where it’s going. Northwestern Mutual, for instance, helps build their story by hosting, in Milwaukee’s BMO Harris Bradley Center, an annual two-day meeting attended by more than 10,000 financial representatives. The representatives share their experiences of overcoming problems and finding success. The meeting is part of the 157-years-long story of Northwestern Mutual. Another key part of Northwestern’s story is their 10-3-1 sales formula: Ten calls should lead to three meetings that lead to one sale. When Northwestern is hiring, candidates must demonstrate their grit by trying to land sales with the 10-3-1 formula. This increases their recruitment costs fivefold, but it’s worth it to maintain the story. The best stories are always simple, so don’t make yours too complicated. People always respond best to simple, straightforward messages; whether it’s visual arts, writing or your brand’s story, keep it simple. You should also avoid making predictions about your story, because you’ll look foolish if they don’t come true. Be open to the unpredictable. Like teams, taste, smarts and trust, your story is also easy to forget about in today’s fast-paced business environment. But as we’ll see in the last blink, these pillars of the soft edge can set you apart from your competitors. It’s important not to think of the soft edge as merely another part of business, like marketing or logistics. The soft edge is much more than that. Remember, it’s the human side of business. These days, companies have an unprecedented amount of data to define their hard edge. It’s the soft edge – cultivated by human ingenuity and innovation – that sets some companies apart from the rest. The Swiss team Sauber, which competes in Formula One, illustrates the significance of the soft edge. Sauber uses systems that gather a great deal of information to help them improve their cars. At the end of the day, however, it’s the human driver who has to innovate and perform at 200 MPH. A successful race is a combination of human acumen and helpful data. If a company wants to continuously innovate, endure rough periods and enjoy lasting success they need to have a business model that covers all three edges: strategy, the hard edge and the soft edge. The soft edge is the easiest to neglect; many businesses don’t even bother with it at all. Wall Street, for instance, is driven by the hard edge. It’s all about speed, execution and short-term capital efficiency. Many CEOs, badgered by investors and barraged with stock market information, forget about the values of their employees and customers. This hard-edge approach certainly won’t distinguish them from their competitors. In contrast, companies like Northwestern and Apple stand out because of how much they care for their soft edge. This doesn’t only bring them popularity and strengthen their relationships with customers – it brings financial wins, too. So don’t neglect the soft edge. It’s too valuable and important to be overlooked, though many companies do exactly that. Just keep in mind: A company with a soft edge is a company that stands out. The key message in this book: The soft edge is what makes great companies stand out in today’s overcrowded business world. So give yours the time it deserves. Build trust with your customers and employees, use smarts to keep up and put people in teams that will be effective. Push your company to have great taste and craft an engaging story for it. Your business won’t just be more successful – it’ll be more meaningful, too. Actionable advice: Make teams you can feed with two pizzas. This rule of thumb has worked for Amazon and Porsche – it’ll work for you, too. Teams are at their most effective when they’re diverse and small enough for all the members to be fully engaged. That means that two pizzas should be enough to feed the entire team.

Covey with Rebecca R. Merrill","summary":"“I trust you.” What does that mean? For many of us trust is something like love: an abstract, rather fluffy thing. But this isn’t true: trust is a concrete, measurable factor. And it’s an asset that we should spend more time cultivating. These blinks highlight the benefits you can expect if you spend time growing trust in your relationships. Whether you run a business or just want to improve your personal interactions with others, reading this advice can help change your life. In these blinks you’ll learn why it’s better to behave with integrity than win at all costs; why every time you go through airport security, you are paying a trust tax; and how you should forgive those who betray you...to a certain extent. Pick up a newspaper and you’ll immediately be confronted by headlines about fading trust in banks, corporations and relationships. Trust affects everything. But what is it exactly and how does it affect us so much? Trust can be defined as the confidence you have in someone. When you trust others, you feel assured in their abilities to do something, such as paying back that $100, or staying faithful to you in a partnership. Trust is beneficial to us, as it facilitates good communication. For example, it’s far easier to understand someone when you trust them. You’ve probably experienced times when your best friend (whom you trust) understands what you’re saying even when you aren’t speaking clearly. Conversely, you’ll find it harder to understand what people you’re not so familiar with are talking about, even if they’re speaking in plain terms. Aside from our friendships, if we can achieve trust through improved communication, it’s excellent for business. Interestingly, trust enables us to do things more quickly at a lower cost. This is known as the economics of trust. For example, before 9/11, it took Americans 30 minutes to get through airport security for national flights. After 9/11, as trust rapidly declined, security clearance required an hour and a half. Due to the fear of terrorist attacks (lowered trust), everything started to take longer (lowered speed), and as a result, expenses for security machines and personnel rose (increased costs). So we see that the traditional economic formula of strategy x execution = results is inadequate. An element of trust must be added, and this comes in two forms. One is a trust tax, for relationships experiencing waning trust. Another is a trust dividend, if there’s a high level of trust. The formula then would be (strategy x execution) x trust = results. So in the airport security line, the equation would therefore involve a trust tax, which would lead to a slower, less efficient end process. Distrust generates many problems. Cultivating self-trust is crucial; if you can’t trust yourself, how can anyone else trust you? To foster self-trust, you need to make yourself credible by adopting The Four Cores. The first is Integrity. This entails being honest, standing by your principles and doing what you say you’ll do. A fantastic example is Andy Roddick, who displayed integrity in a 2005 tennis match. At match point, his opponent’s serve was called “out” and Roddick proclaimed the winner. Then he shocked everyone by showing that the ball was actually “in.” The game continued and Roddick ending up losing the match, but he had kept his integrity. One way to increase integrity is to make and keep commitments to yourself, even if it just means consistently getting up when your alarm clock goes off every morning. Sticking with a simple commitment like this will increase your self trust. The second core is Intent, meaning positive motives and behavior. For example, research comparing professions we trust showed that we trust NGOs more than politicians, largely due to the common belief that NGO motives are generally conscientious. You can improve intent by analyzing and redefining your motives, asking questions like “Am I really listening to this person or do I just want to win the argument?” The third core is Capabilities. That is, developing abilities that evoke confidence. For example, a child who learns a musical instrument is likely to possess higher self-confidence, which can benefit other areas in their life. One way to improve your capabilities is to keep learning. Try reading up on new developments in your industry or doing your own research in an area you’re interested in. The last core is Results, where you build a track record of deeds to which you’ve committed yourself. FedEx, for instance, has a respectable reputation for actually delivering overnight as they promise. Because of this, we trust their delivery methods and so does the company itself. By working on these core principles, we develop our own self-trust and in the end this helps others to trust us too. To establish trust in your relationships, you need to behave in a trustworthy way. How many times do we really believe the skirt-chaser who uses charm and excessive flattery? To make your word hold more weight than the skirt-chaser’s, here are two things you can do: First, tell the truth. Omitting information, double-talking, or spinning stories are all different ways we avoid speaking the whole truth, even if we’re not lying outright. The problem is, this behavior erodes trust, whereas being candid increases it. If you’ve got a reputation for being dishonest, you’ll make it hard for yourself to keep good relationships. Another thing you can do is demonstrate respect for others by showing them you care. When people think you really care about them, they’re less likely to believe you want to con them, and will start putting faith in you. So how can you show you care? You can do the tried-and-true thank you notes, acknowledge the contributions of people around you, be generous in giving acknowledgement, and avoid bad-mouthing people. Bear in mind, though, that you’ll undo all the good that comes from this behavior if you overdo it! We all appreciate a straight and honest talker, but stating clearly how much you hate your friend’s new romantic partner, for example, is simply hurtful. Avoid going overboard, otherwise you will strain your relationships and weaken your trust levels. The following analogy will help you see clearly if you are creating or destroying trust. Try thinking of your efforts in terms of a trust account. When you act in a trustworthy way, you make a “deposit.” When you act to the contrary, you make a “withdrawal.” The aim here, then, would be to stay in credit! This means asking others for feedback on your behavior. Doing so will help you gauge how you are progressing and where you can improve. This way you’ll receive and maintain trust from others. In business, you’re often told you need to please your stakeholders, but what does this mean exactly? Stakeholders can be divided into three types: internal (employees), external (the market), and societal (other members of society who judge your business). Each of these stakeholders require different approaches in order for them to trust you and your business. In order for internal stakeholders (employees) to trust an organization, they need to observe alignment. This means that the organization must act in a trustworthy way. When they do so, the trust that results is beneficial for all. When employees trust each other, they communicate better, which increases efficiency and results in company growth and even pay raises. To instill trust in external stakeholders, a good reputation is paramount. Winning the trust of the market involves focusing on your brand or reputation. For example, Chinese products are unfortunately perceived as less trustworthy than British, German or French products, because they have a reputation for being somewhat inferior and unreliable. Perhaps you can recall a time when you bought a Made in China coat, only to have its buttons and threads come loose a few days later. For the third type of stakeholder – the societal stakeholder – trust is developed through contribution. A company which has a reputation for doing good by contributing to society will be well loved and respected. In late 1992 a police assault on construction worker Rodney King instigated riots in Los Angeles, California. Amongst all the burned and looted buildings, only the McDonald’s restaurants were left unscathed. When asked why this was the case, locals stated that McDonald’s had supported literacy initiatives and sports programs in the community and had always offered jobs for youth in the area. Rioters hadn’t touched McDonald’s because the chain had created societal trust. Once trust has been lost, many of us think it’s lost forever. But in fact, trust can be restored. Let’s take a look at how. Regaining and even strengthening trust takes effort, commitment and the extension of smart trust. Smart trust lies in the middle ground between distrust and naive gullibility, and combines the following elements: an inherent feeling that others are generally worthy of trust, and a close look at the possible implications of trusting someone. Say you are about to go into business with someone who has previously betrayed you. Although we’d normally be right to approach every situation with the hope that everyone involved is inherently trustworthy, and to forgive any wrongdoings, diving straight into a joint venture with this person would demonstrate a lack of learning on our part. Practicing smart trust in this case would mean we wouldn’t trust this person unless we’re confident they’ve learned from their mistakes. Until then, it wouldn’t make sense to trust them completely. Extending smart trust also shows others that they can trust us in return, and in this way damaged relationships can be rebuilt. Trust can also be restored by improving your credibility. It isn’t possible for us to “fix” someone else’s opinions about us and force them to trust us, so we have to try other means of rebuilding trust. Even if you’ve jeopardized someone’s trust, you can make an effort to regain it by behaving in a way that improves your credibility. The author’s son, for instance, was permitted to use the family car on the condition that he didn’t drive over the speed limit, yet he was caught doing exactly that. However, he displayed credibility by working hard to pay off the speeding ticket and therefore restored the trust of his family. The key message in this book: Trust is a universal asset that can be created by every one of us. Trust changes everything for the better by speeding up interactions and lowering costs. If we conduct ourselves in ways that promote trust, it will flourish and we will witness the difference in our companies and our personal relationships. Actionable advice: The little things count. The next time you want to show others you care and wish to gain their trust, remember that it’s often the small gestures that go a long way. Taking a little time to call them, or taking them aside at work to acknowledge their efforts will help build their trust in you.

Rogelberg","summary":"Take a look around a typical office, and you may conclude that the modern employee attends meetings more than she actually works. Although meetings are taking up more and more of our working day, many of us simply aren’t seeing the benefits of this enormous time investment. All too often, meetings leave us feeling unengaged, unenlightened and deeply frustrated about the interruption of our work.  It doesn’t have to be this way. Though many organizations have resigned themselves to fruitless meetings, researcher and management consultant Steven G. Rogelberg hasn’t. By pulling from scientific research and analysis, Rogelberg shows how you can transform your meetings into invaluable tools for solving problems and making decisions. With a wealth of simple tips and techniques that you can implement tomorrow, these blinks provide a clear and concise guide to changing the way you meet forever. In these blinks, you’ll learn what really needs to go on your agenda; how music can help your meetings; and why the most creative meetings are silent. How much time do you spend in meetings? Whether it’s one-on-one with your manager or catching up with the whole department, many people would say far too much! In the United States, for example, 55 million workplace meetings happen a day. All these meetings are costing companies huge amounts of money and time.  It’s a fact that employees spend more and more of their workdays in meetings. The Harvard Business Review estimated that in 1976, American workers had eleven million meetings a day. That’s just one-fifth of the number of American meetings that currently take place. Indeed, research conducted by software company Lucid Meetings indicates that non-managerial staff now meet an average of eight times weekly. For managerial staff, that number is even higher at 12 times per week. And senior leaders like Executive Officers now spend the majority of their time in meetings. Indeed, one joint study by Harvard and Columbia University found that CEOs in Italy were spending 60 percent of their working day in meetings. Incredibly, this figure excluded time spent on conference calls!  Inevitably, all this time adds up to a big expense.  You can uncover just how much money each meeting costs your company by multiplying an attendee’s hourly wage by the number of hours the meeting took, and adding together the answer for each person who attended. But be prepared, because the answer may shock your finance department.  Xerox, a printing company, estimates that meetings between their 24,000 person development team cost the company over $100 million a year. And Elise Keith, co-founder of Lucid Meetings, estimates that across all workplaces in the United States, the US is spending $1.4 trillion on meetings a year – that’s around eight percent of the country’s annual GDP!  But is this time and money well spent? Evidence suggests that many workers don’t think so. A 2005 survey conducted by Microsoft asked 40,000 workers all over the world what they thought of meetings. Depressingly, 69 percent said their meetings were unproductive. In a survey by Clarizen of two thousand American workers, a shocking 50 percent of respondents said they would rather do any other unpleasant work activity than attend their weekly team update meeting!  Clearly, something is amiss with many of our office meetings, but how can we make them better? Let’s start by looking at how we lead meetings. How good are you at leading meetings? Unfortunately, if you’re anything like most people, you’re likely to overestimate your abilities. In the author’s own research, for example, he has discovered that those leading a meeting typically rate it more positively than the attendees. Another research insight might explain this finding – the more someone talks in a meeting, the more positive their impression of that meeting will be. And who does most of the talking in most meetings? That’s right – whoever’s leading them.  So to get a more realistic estimate of your abilities, you’ll need to ask the people who attend your meetings what they really think of them.  The company Weight Watchers uses touch screens located near meeting rooms to collect employee feedback. When attendees leave meetings, they anonymously rate them using an emoji scale. Weight Watchers then uses this feedback to determine where change is needed. Importantly, these touch screens are also used after an adjustment has been made to assess whether or not it had a positive impact. In one instance, Weight Watchers added whiteboards presenting the meeting agenda to conference rooms, and dissatisfaction decreased from 44 percent to just 16 percent.  Leaders themselves can take a step toward better meetings by adopting the mindset of servant leadership. A servant leader is one who strives to meet the needs of their team and unlock each member’s true potential. To become a servant leader yourself, try to adopt a “giving” mindset. This means purposefully helping other people and sharing knowledge whenever possible. During meetings, servant leaders take responsibility for ensuring things run as effectively as possible. They exercise excellent time management, pacing the meeting according to the demands of the agenda. They also notice when conversations stray from the topic at hand and work to refocus the discussion. The servant leader listens attentively to discern any latent concerns that attendees might have. If a concern is detected, the leader introduces it into the discussion. Lastly, the servant leader facilitates an atmosphere in which attendees feel comfortable enough to express their opinions and politely disagree with one another. This permissive atmosphere is achieved by actively encouraging debate, reminding people to keep their criticism constructive and preventing any one person from dominating the meeting. Unsurprisingly, expectations around meetings vary from country to country. In Latin America, for example, it’s fairly typical for meetings to begin much later than scheduled. But across all countries and cultures, there’s one aspect of meetings that seems universal – no matter their purpose, or the number of people involved, they typically take one hour. But blindly following this unwritten rule can lead to a lot of wasted time.  This is due to a phenomenon known as Parkinson’s Law, which dictates that the length of time needed to complete a task will expand or contract according to the time you have to do it.  The effects of Parkinson’s Law are well documented. In one study, college students were asked to solve a set of easy mathematical problems. However, they gave some students only the amount of time they actually needed to solve the problems and gave others more time than they needed. And just as Parkinson’s Law predicts, they found that the group with more time took longer to complete the problems. Many other groups have replicated these findings, including NASA scientists! With this in mind, try to shorten your next meeting by a few minutes and see if your discussion magically shrinks to fit the shorter time frame.  You can start getting a feel for how long your meeting should be by reflecting on your goals, how many people attend and how past meetings went. Once you’ve done that, don’t be afraid to come up with an unusual meeting time. You could take inspiration from research firm TINYpulse, for example, who begin their daily team meeting at precisely 8.48am. This quirky starting time intrigues people and, according to the company, attendees are never late! You could even choose to make your meetings very short – just fifteen minutes long. These meetings are known as huddles, and research is overwhelmingly positive about their capacity for boosting the performance of teams and individuals alike. The Obama administration, for example, used daily huddles, as do tech companies like Apple and Dell. Another famous fan of super brief meetings is Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, who insists that her meetings last no longer than ten minutes. Everyone likes an easy fix. In times gone by, traveling quack doctors made a fortune selling useless pills and potions that promised to cure every illness and ailment. Why did people buy them? Because they represented an easy solution to a problem. Unfortunately, when it comes to the world of meetings, there are plenty of business quacks promoting a similar cure-all – the meeting agenda.  And, just like those useless potions, an agenda alone won’t magically make your meetings better.  Several studies have failed to find any association between the presence of an agenda and the quality of the meeting as perceived by attendees. Interestingly, research conducted in 2003 by the Economist may shed light on why agendas are failing to boost meeting quality. The study focused on meetings between senior managers in multimillion-dollar companies. It found that in 50 percent of the organizations, meetings either used the same agenda each time or created a last-minute, ad hoc agenda. Evidence like this suggests that many agendas are thoughtlessly produced and relentlessly recycled. Luckily, there is a better way. In fact, agendas can be a valuable meeting tool. But for this to be the case, leaders need to get specific about what goes onto them.  Arguably, the most important items to include on any agenda are those that originate from the attendees themselves. Research shows that employees who contribute to a meeting are more likely to feel committed to both their team and the wider company. You can encourage this by ensuring that the items on the agenda are ones that actually matter to employees. A few days before the meeting, take the time to email attendees to ask them what topics they would like to include on the agenda.  Once you know this, you need to carefully plan the order in which topics will be discussed. A psychology study by Middle Tennessee State University found that items that were discussed early on in the meeting tended to receive the most time and deliberation, no matter how complex they were. Therefore, make sure you rank agenda items in order of importance, with the most essential at the very top. Did you know that the big office meeting is the slacker’s best friend? For those who want to sit back, relax and listen to other people talk, the get-together that’s full of attendees provides ample opportunity to hide. But if you want your team to get ahead, you need to cut those slackers out of your meeting by drastically reducing your invitation list.  Although intuition might tell us that meetings benefit from any additional brainpower in the room, science reveals that inviting extra attendees is actually counterproductive.  Why? Well, as meeting size increases, the likelihood of social loafing increases, too. This phenomenon describes the tendency of individuals to reduce their efforts and motivation when they work in a group. One study highlighted social loafing by measuring how much effort people playing tug of war expend. By putting a device on the rope that calculated force, the researchers found that those who tugged in groups of three expended 85 percent of their potential pulling ability, whereas those in a group of eight tugged with just 49 percent of their potential strength. So to make sure everyone pulls their weight in your next meeting, try keeping the numbers as low as possible. Moreover, even when attendees are doing their best to be productive, evidence suggests that being in a big meeting hinders their efforts. Just consider a recent study that looked at data from consulting firm Bain & Company. The researchers examined what happened to groups’ decision-making ability as the number of people involved grew. They found that if a group increased beyond seven members, each extra individual lowered the group’s ability to make an effective decision by a staggering 10 percent.  So, just how many people should you invite to your next meeting?  Luckily, one man might have found the answer. John Kello is a management consultant who has spent much of his career studying meetings. He concludes that seven attendees is the ideal number of people for decision-making. This is because, as group sizes get bigger, coordinating everyone becomes harder, so inefficiencies surrounding the process of decision-making are more likely to arise.  Some of the world’s best leaders seem to agree with Kello’s analysis. Steve Jobs, for example, was famous for his hatred of big meetings. When President Obama invited him to a high-profile gathering of tech leaders, Jobs turned him down. Why? He thought the meeting sounded too large to accomplish anything. The business world is littered with products that failed miserably. Remember Harley Davidson’s cologne, or lighter company Bic’s throwaway underwear? If you do, then you’d probably rather you didn’t. This raises the question – why do successful companies market products that are obviously doomed to fail? Remarkably, it seems the answer may have everything to do with bad meetings.  After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the launch of these ill-fated products and others like them, many business experts have concluded that bad decisions are made for one major reason – the people involved didn’t raise their concerns during meetings.  Evidence suggests that this withholding of important information is commonplace. Just consider a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, which challenged a group to decide on a particular topic. Before the group met, the researchers gave each of the participants information on this topic. Crucially, some of this information was shared with everyone, whereas other pieces of information were only shared with a single person. The experiment was designed so that if the participants each shared their unique piece of information, they could reach an optimal solution. But if they withheld their unique knowledge, and only shared the information that was known to all of them, they couldn’t reach this optimal solution.  The result? As we might have predicted, the attendees were much less likely to discuss the information that was unique to them than the common knowledge, and an optimal decision was not reached. This same experiment has been conducted more than 65 times. More often than not, the participants don’t arrive at the right solution.  In view of these findings, it’s clear that the traditional meeting is an inadequate format for soliciting attendees’ unique insights. Luckily, a technique called brainwriting may hold the answer. During a brainwriting session, each attendee anonymously writes their ideas down instead of verbally presenting them. This allows them to share their unique perspective or knowledge which, as we have seen, is all too often missing from traditional meetings. Afterward, the meeting leader collects these notes and privately reviews them.  Although this might sound simple, numerous studies comparing brainwriting formats to traditional meetings suggest it leads to a higher number of better quality ideas. One study, for example, found that brainwriting meetings generated more original ideas by a staggering 42 percent! So when it comes to meetings, it might be time to stop talking and get writing. You’ll probably know how emotionally draining a bad mood can be. As well as exhausting, negativity is contagious. Indeed, research suggests that if someone around us is in a bad mood, we are at risk of contracting their negativity. Not only that, but a bad mood also threatens to undermine the effectiveness of your meetings. In fact, creating a positive vibe during meetings is crucial to their success.  Researchers from St. Louis University, for example, found that groups in which people were in a good mood were better at performing creative tasks than groups in which members were in a negative or neutral mindset. Furthermore, they found that groups in a good mood enjoyed better engagement between members and were more likely to share and apply knowledge from all members. Another study examined footage of real meetings. They found that meetings that contained more jokes and laughter also had a more emotionally supportive atmosphere, held more constructive discussions and produced more innovative solutions to problems.  Unfortunately, many of us are primed to go into our meetings with a negative mindset.  This is because we interpret the meeting as a frustrating interruption from whatever important work we were doing before. With this in mind, it’s vital that the meeting leader creates a positive atmosphere as soon as attendees enter the meeting room. There are several ways to do this. Firstly, consider playing music in the meeting room when attendees first come in. Music will help mark a separation between attendees’ feelings of frustration about being interrupted and the meeting that is about to take place. You could even approach the first person to arrive, ask them who their favorite artists are and put their music on. Secondly, the author’s own research has found that providing tasty snacks during a meeting supports positivity. Lastly, consider providing some toys for people to play with during the meeting, such as play dough or small puzzles. Evidence from New York University’s Polytechnic School of Engineerings suggests that the sort of hand movements that these toys require promote lower stress levels, boost focus and redirect pent-up energy toward the task at hand. The key message in these blinks: The typical office meeting is too big and too unfocused to facilitate great teamwork. To whip your weekly meeting into shape, try making it shorter, more positive and less talkative. Don’t be afraid to prune your invitation list, and make sure you prioritize topics that are highly relevant to your attendees.  Actionable advice: Meetings and phones don’t mix. If you’re thinking of conducting your next meeting remotely, with all or some individuals phoning in, you might want to think again. In fact, attending meetings via telephone encourages people to reduce their efforts and contribute less. Because phone attendees are out of sight, and their voices may not be readily distinguishable from other remote attendees, they feel anonymous. And research shows that people are less likely to work hard anonymously. So instead of phoning it in, try to encourage those who cannot be there in person to attend the meeting via Skype or video call instead. Just being visible will give their motivation a sizeable boost.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The second door is the VIP door, where the celebrities and billionaires slip straight through. And then there’s the third door. Most people don’t even know it exists, but it does. You have to step out of line, run around the back of the club, bang on the door, maybe sneak through a kitchen. You’ll need a little chutzpah and a little initiative, but there’s always a way. The world’s most successful people went through the third door, ignoring the queue in their determination to get ahead. In these blinks, you’ll follow the path of an ambitious young man on his quest to track down and interview some of the most successful people in the world and learn the secrets of how they got ahead. In these blinks, you’ll learn how braving an important phone call got Bill Gates’s career off to a flying start; how re-engineering your sleeping pattern could give you a competitive advantage; and why biting off more than you can chew isn’t necessarily a bad idea. Alex Banayan was supposed to become a doctor. At least, that was his parents’ plan for him. But at 18 years old, a month into college as a pre-med, he realized this wasn’t the path for him. One day, while reading a biography of Bill Gates instead of studying, Banayan started wondering. Bill Gates had become the richest man in the world and revolutionized the software industry. But how? How did he go from a regular 18-year-old kid, just like Banayan, to becoming the wealthiest man in the world? Banayan started looking into other successful people: How had Steven Spielberg, a guy who didn’t even get into film school, ended up as one of the most successful directors in history? What did Lady Gaga do to pivot from waiting tables to nailing her first record deal in 2006? Banayan couldn’t find a book that gave him the answer to these questions, so he decided to write it himself. Why not? He’d arrange interviews with Bill Gates and of other legends, travel across the US to meet with them, write up his discoveries and share them with his entire generation. Getting the interviews was one thing, getting to them was quite another. The hard part, he quickly realized, would be funding the travel to all those interviews. But as luck would have it, the game show The Price is Right was being filmed a few miles away. Winning the show was how he’d fund his quest. Some googling told him that the wackier the behavior at casting, the more chance of getting selected for the show. So when he turned up on set, Banayan hugged janitors, danced with security guards and flirted with old ladies. It worked, and he got selected. He didn’t actually know how to play the game though, so began chatting to his fellow contestants. One kindly old woman, who said she’d been watching for 40 years, took a shine to him. She advised him to always guess low, as guessing too high would get you eliminated. Hours later, with studio lights shining in his face, Banayan won the final prize – a sailboat, retail price $31,188, which he sold days later for $16,000. His quest could begin. After reading Tim Ferriss’s phenomenally popular book The 4-Hour Work Week (2007), Banayan became obsessed with meeting the author. At a conference where Ferriss was speaking, Banayan hid in a bathroom during the speech, realizing that its location gave him the best chance of intercepting Ferriss as he came off stage. When Ferriss finished talking, Banayan sprung out and snatched a quick chat. Ferriss seemed interested in Banayan’s mission and said he’d get in touch. But time passed with no contact from Ferriss, so Banayan started emailing Ferriss’s assistant. Business books say that persistence is important, Banayan reminded himself. The author was undeterred at receiving no reply, even when Ferriss’s assistant rejected the request. In total, Banayan sent 31 emails, one of which claimed that a one-hour interview with him, a college student, would be one of the best investments that Ferriss, a multi-million selling author, would ever make. Staying upbeat, Banayan always ended his emails with a cheery “Thanks in advance!” Then one day, out of the blue, Ferriss agreed to talk. Persistence works! Or so the author thought. When they met, Ferriss talked a little about persistence. Ferriss got his first big break after he tried to build a relationship with a certain startup CEO. Ferriss had emailed the CEO asking for a job, and was turned down 12 times. Eventually, Ferriss emailed to say he’d be in the CEO’s neighborhood the following week – a total lie – and that it would be great to stop by. When the CEO said ok, Ferriss jumped on a plane from New York to San Francisco to “casually” meet him. Ferriss got the job. But in telling the story to Banayan, Ferriss wanted to be clear about one point: There’s a difference, he said, between being persistent and being a hassle. Ferriss was never rude, and while he was persistent, he got the balance right. He didn’t email ten times a week. He told Banayan not to say things like “Thanks in advance!” because it sounds rude and entitled. Instead, say something like “I totally understand if you don’t have time to respond.” Months later, when reading through old emails, the author realized that Ferriss had been trying to save Banayan from himself. Only then did he understand how much he had to learn. When a contact at Microsoft said he could get Banayan an interview with Qi Lu, Banayan wasn’t sure what to think. Any interview was good news, but he’d never even heard of this guy. But Banayan’s interest was piqued when he learned that Lu was one of the tech world’s rising stars. At 27 years old, Qi Lu was earning just $27 a month. Fast forward to his 47th birthday, and he was a president at Microsoft. Qi Lu grew up in a poor village in China. As a child, he wanted to be a shipbuilder but wasn’t strong enough, so he focused on his school work and ended up studying computer science at Fudan University. There, he had the spark of inspiration that would change his life. He realized that one thing in life is constant – whether you’re rich or poor, you only have 24 hours in a day. That led him to think that sleeping less could give him a competitive advantage over his peers. So he started to re-engineer his sleep pattern, cutting out one hour, then another and another. At one point he slept just one hour a night, forcing himself back to consciousness with an ice-cold shower, but this was too much to keep up. Eventually, he settled on a sustainable four hours a night, and he’s stuck to that ever since. By reducing sleep and working extra hard, Lu managed to publish five research papers on the topic of model checking in computer science astonishingly early in his academic career. One day, a visiting professor from Carnegie Mellon came to give a talk on the same topic. Lu made some perceptive observations and impressed the professor with his research. The professor suggested that Lu try and study in the US, saying he would waive his $60 application fee – $60 that Lu didn’t have. That encounter might feel a little lucky, but it was only by carving out an extra few hours in the day that Lu had been able to deliver his research papers. As he said himself, luck is a little like a bus: If you miss one, another will come along. But if you aren’t prepared, you can’t jump on. These days, Qi Lu is so productive that at Microsoft his colleagues say he works twice as fast as anyone else. They even have a term for it – “Qi Time.” After his initial success in talking to Qi Lu and Tim Ferriss, Banayan hit a brick wall. Qi Lu had helpfully passed on an interview request to Bill Gates, but the message came back that Gates wouldn’t meet. Banayan embraced “Qi Time,” getting up at six o’clock every day to write more cold emails requesting interviews. But the only consequence of more emails going out was more rejections coming back in. Eventually, “Sugar” Ray Leonard, a six-time world champion boxer, agreed to an interview at his California mansion. Banayan had written to the boxer saying that he believed the younger generation could learn from his advice. When Leonard first started boxing as a child, he was skinnier, shorter and younger than the other kids. He knew that he needed an edge. One morning, as the yellow school bus pulled up to collect him, Leonard didn’t get on. Instead, as it pulled away, he chased it, running all the way to school. He did the same on the way home, and the same the next day. Day in, day out, rain, wind or snow, he chased the school bus. Leonard said that, as a child, he didn’t have as much boxing experience as the other kids. But he did have the heart and the desire to improve. Years later, in 1981, twelve rounds into a welterweight world championship fight against the then-undefeated Thomas “The Hitman” Hearns, he was getting badly beaten. His left eye was so swollen that he could barely see. But he was able to summon what he called his hidden reservoir – a buried reserve of strength and determination. It’s the reserve that allows a mother to lift a car off a trapped child, Leonard said. We all have it, and success comes to those who can tap it. When Leonard stood up for the 13th round, he exploded in a whirlwind of adrenalin and concentration. In the 14th round, with his opponent limp on the ropes, Leonard was the champion of the world. Banayan explained to Leonard how he wasn’t getting far with his mission. Leonard told him not to let anyone tell him that his mission, his dream, isn’t possible. Stay in the fight, the boxer said, find your hidden reservoir, and you can do whatever you want to do. It’s always good to have a mentor in life. For Banayan, that mentor was Elliott Bisnow. A 20-something kid who dropped out of school and built a company, Bisnow Media, with his dad, that would go on to sell for 50 million dollars in 2016. In 2008, Bisnow also co-founded Summit Series to provide fun conferences for entrepreneurs and the world’s elite. Impressed at how much Bisnow had achieved so young, Banayan got in touch. They met days later in LA and quickly became friends. Bisnow helped Banayan access a world of entrepreneurs and taught him invaluable lessons. The key one was to bite off more than you can chew. Summit Series began when Bisnow wanted to meet more young entrepreneurs. Most of us in that situation might decide to go to networking events, or perhaps move to a bigger city. Not Bisnow. Bisnow cold-called young entrepreneurs, asking if they wanted to get a group together and hang out for a weekend. He gathered 20 young leaders, including the founders of TOMS Shoes and the websites Thrillist and CollegeHumor, and took them for a weekend’s skiing on his own money. He didn’t actually have the money, instead he put the $30,000 in upfront costs on a credit card. Then he began cold-calling companies to ask if they wanted to sponsor a conference of the top young entrepreneurs in the US. Companies started saying yes, and Summit Series was born. Bisnow was out of his depth. He had to ask his mother what food he should provide. Granola bars? Apples? He had no idea. But he worked it out, and ever since, he’s tried to live by the philosophy that you should bite off more than you can chew – be ambitious, aim high and work out the details later. It certainly worked for Bisnow. Summit Series is now a huge enterprise, and very popular among the business and cultural elite. Attend an event, and you might hear Richard Branson telling entrepreneurial tales in the morning, listen to national poetry slam champion IN-Q in the afternoon and hear Erin Brockovich discuss social justice, all in the same day. Bisnow and his co-founders even bought an entire ski-resort in Utah to act as a base for an exclusive, entrepreneurial community. Bisnow is the living embodiment of what you can achieve if you aim high. When Banayan tried to approach Bill Gates for an interview, he got this message from Gates’s office: he would never get an interview while he didn’t have a publishing deal. So Banayan set out to find a publishing deal. The key to this was finding a literary agent. From that point on, Banayan’s motto was “get a literary agent, get Bill Gates.” Banayan read books about how to get published and approached literary agents by the handful. He’d met plenty of entrepreneurs through Bisnow, and asked those with book deals to introduce him to their agents. He was doing everything right, but only getting rejected. There was one literary agent left on his list, and she such was a superstar – she’d even rejected Tim Ferriss for his first book – that it seemed pointless even to approach her. It was Banayan’s college friend Brandon who changed his mind. Brandon was a bookworm and told Banayan a story he’d once read about Walmart. It was the year 2000, and brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart were being hit hard by online shops like Amazon. Walmart was panicking about losing market-share, so they tried to replicate Amazon’s tech and strategy. But it didn’t work. One day, a new executive tried something: She hung a banner up in the office that said, “You can’t out-Amazon Amazon.” Soon afterward, Walmart’s market share boomed as they focused on executing their own business strategy, not copying Amazon’s. Banayan, Brandon explained, was Walmart. All he’d been doing was copying other people’s strategies for success. He’d been pitching to literary agents as if he was Tim Ferriss, but without the platform and fame that Ferriss had. Since Banayan had started his mission, he’d studied how successful people got ahead. But while that’s a good way to learn, he discovered he couldn’t tackle every problem that way. On this occasion, he needed his own playbook. That night, unable to sleep, Banayan got up and wrote an email to his number-one-target literary agent. Instead of repeating his usual spiel, he wrote out why he believed in his mission. He wrote that together, the two of them could change the world. The email was more like a teenage love note than a professional email, but he sent it. A day later, she offered to represent him. After securing his book deal, Banayan eventually persuaded Bill Gates’s office to set up an interview. Researching ahead of the meeting, Banayan discovered an incident that he felt explained Gates’s early success. It resonated with Banayan, who had always suffered from nerves when he needed to make an important phone call or conversation. The lesson? Sometimes you have to break through your discomfort. Aged just 19, Gates and his partner Paul Allen heard that a computer company, MITS, had released the first minicomputer onto the market. Gates saw an opportunity, and the two of them wrote to MITS proposing to sell software to run on the machine. After getting no response, they debated how to follow up. Neither Bill nor Paul wanted to make the phone call. Both were nervous. Eventually, Bill took the leap. Taking some deep breaths, he told the founder of MITS that they wanted to come in and present some software. It worked, and they got the meeting. There was one small problem – the software didn’t exist. But eight weeks of hard work later, they presented their new code, signed a deal, and made the first of many millions of sales. Having the bravery to make that phone call ultimately kicked off their success. When the interview finally took place in Gates’s office, Banayan asked him for advice on negotiation and strategy in the early days of your career. Gates had two key pieces of advice: Firstly, if you’re young, you need a way to blast through people’s skepticism. When Gates went to sales meetings, he would overwhelm people with his expertise, talking fast and in great depth about programming language and software platforms until it was clear that he wasn’t some dumb kid. Secondly, he surprised Banayan by saying that when establishing Microsoft in the early 1980s, he prioritized strategic positioning over immediate profit. When Microsoft began selling to IBM, he took the decision not to push for too much money to ensure he got the deal. He knew that rivals to IBM would emerge and that the prestige of working with IBM would help Microsoft sell to these rivals as well, securing higher profits. The lesson was clear: when starting out, take the position that will help you in the long term over short-term profits. One day, at a party hosted by his friend, Miki Agrawal, founder of the period-proof underwear business THINX, Banayan saw Tony Hsieh, CEO of online shoe retailer Zappos. Hsieh was walking around with a clipboard that had “Wishes List” written on it, explaining that, for one day, he was acting as fairy godmother. When Hsieh asked Banayan what he wished for, Banayan knew straight away. I want to be the Zappos CEO for the day, he said. His 20th birthday was coming up soon and he wondered if he could shadow Hsieh. Hsieh was a little surprised, but agreed. While giving him marketing advice, Hsieh told Banayan that he should consider his end goals for the book. Most people don’t consider what their goals are, and if they do, they’re often not honest about them. In doing so, he helped Banayan understand that it’s okay to embrace your ego. Hsieh himself had written a bestseller, Delivering Happiness. For Hsieh, when he wrote Delivering Happiness, one motive was definitely vanity and ego. He thought it would be nice to tell his mum and dad that his book was number one on the bestsellers lists. This surprised Banayan, who’d always thought of an ego as a bad thing. But Hsieh went on to explain that it’s worse to have an ego and deceive yourself that you don’t. In reality, it’s better to accept that you can accommodate an ego alongside other goals, such as wanting to inspire young entrepreneurs. The other lesson Banayan learned from his time with Hsieh was the power of asking for help. While shadowing Hsieh in and out of meetings and through a company-wide presentation, Banayan noticed Zappos employees throwing him a few jealous looks. One approached him to say he’d worked at Zappos for years and dreamed of shadowing the boss. How did Banayan get so lucky? Later that day, while thanking Hsieh for his time, Banayan asked the CEO why he didn’t let his employees shadow him sometimes. Hsieh looked blank. He’d be happy to, he said. But no-one ever asked him if they could. Banayan pursued Warren Buffett for an interview for months. He even flew to Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, in the hope of bumping into him, only to discover he arrived at the same time as the worst snow-storm for 30 years. Banayan never met the “Oracle of Omaha,” and instead spent time in his hotel room shivering from the cold. Having read everything there is to know about Buffett, he picked up a few lessons in success. The first was to find out what people need and use that to get access to them. In 1951, after Buffett finished his studies, he set himself up as a stockbroker. But every time he tried to get a meeting with a local businessman, they turned him down. Who wants to meet some young guy with no track record, trying to sell stocks? So Buffet thought of a different approach: He started calling business people, telling them he could help save them from paying too high taxes. Now they finally wanted to meet, and Buffett was able to kick-start his career. Banayan figured out that maybe people don’t want to talk to you for the reasons you want to talk to them, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t talk at all. You just need to figure out what they want. He received a similar lesson when he met Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and the first drug infusion pump, among other innovations. Kamen explained that sometimes it’s best to look at a problem from a different angle. Not so long ago, there’d been something of a crisis in science and technology education in the US. Many people saw this as an educational crisis and tried to solve it by improving the education system – tinkering with course content and training new teachers. Kamen, however, believed that it was a culture crisis. He created a competition called FIRST – a non-profit which treats high-school engineering like sport by running national and international robotics competitions screened on NBC and NASA TV. FIRST has now impacted millions of lives. So, Kamen said, don’t get frustrated if you don’t break through. Reframe the question in a way that allows you to find a solution. After hearing who Banayan was interviewing, one man said he didn’t feel worthy of being on the list. He was also, by some distance, the happiest guy Banayan had met. Steve Wozniak was, alongside Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. But unlike Jobs, or Gates, or Buffett, Wozniak has never been seen as a business tycoon, largely because he left Apple in 1985. When Banayan ate lunch with Wozniak in Cupertino, California, Wozniak oozed happiness. He seemed to genuinely love his life, from his loving relationship with his wife to the cuteness of his dogs and the excitement of his upcoming road trip. Why all this happiness? Wozniak was happy, he said, because he felt he was living life on his own terms and doing what he wants to do, not what society dictates is the right thing. For example, early on in the Apple story, Steve Jobs was the obvious choice for CEO. Where Wozniak was going to fit into the executive team wasn’t so clear. The last thing he wanted to do was manage staff or deal with internal politics, so he told Jobs he wanted to be a simple engineer. This was something he already knew he loved and was happy to continue doing. Maybe society says that you should reach the highest position possible, Wozniak said. But is that really what’ll make you happiest? Wozniak’s determination to live life on his own terms also meant living by his values. This often put him in conflict with Jobs. When Apple was filing its initial public offering in 1980, Jobs and Wozniak were all set for a huge payout. Both would become ultra-rich. But Wozniak discovered that Jobs had refused to give stock options to some employees who’d been with Apple since the beginning. Wozniak saw these people as family. After all, they’d helped make the company what it was. But Jobs wouldn’t budge. In the end, Wozniak gifted some of his own shares to the old employees, so they too could share in the financial reward. The day Apple went public, they became millionaires. Of the two men, Jobs has gone down in history as the more successful. But as Wozniak sat back, opening a fortune cookie and laughing happily, his success seemed obvious too. The key message in these blinks: We all have the power to make little choices that can alter our lives forever – to pick up the phone and make that first sales call, bite off more than we can chew, or simply follow our vision. You have the power to choose. You can accept the inertia in your life and continue waiting in line for the First Door. Or you can duck out of the line, run around the back, and take the Third Door. The choice is in your hands.  Actionable advice: Have a pipeline.  Whatever you’re trying to achieve, build a pipeline of opportunities. Say you want to work in a startup. Don’t concentrate on just one, or two. Build a pipeline and approach them all. You’ll never know which one of your hundred startup CEOs woke up this morning thinking “We really need a new sales guy.” Building a pipeline is one way of increasing the chances that you’ll get lucky.

This legendary leader has put pen to paper to share over four decades of triumph, failure and lessons about the Virgin way to lead. But as you’ll find out, the Branson brand isn’t built on great leadership alone. You’ll discover how exemplary listening skills, a generous spirit and a zest for fun have all shaped his story and philosophy of life. From his early childhood and years as a high-school dropout to opening his first-ever Virgin Records store, you’ll witness the formative experiences of one of the world’s most eccentric entrepreneurs and learn that he’s never been afraid to do things differently. So sit back and enjoy Branson’s insightful anecdotes about some of the world’s most famous brands. In these blinks, you’ll discover what leadership lesson Branson learned from his father; how procrastination saved him from the financial crash; and why innovators are always being told no. Our parents give us a lot, from their time and attention to their eye colors. But what about the less obvious things that make us who we are, such as our personality and general life philosophy? Richard Branson believes that his approach to leadership is all thanks to the way his parents raised him. As a young boy, Branson often visited the local shop to buy chocolate bars. Unfortunately, he paid for his chocoholic habit by pilfering small change from his parents’ bedroom. When the shopkeeper eventually told his father Ted of her suspicions, the young Branson expected a mighty punishment. But to his surprise, his father took little action – he didn’t even acknowledge that he knew about the theft. In fact, all his father did was give his son the cold shoulder for the rest of the day. Though he escaped punishment, Branson never stole his parents’ money again. Why? Because he knew full well that he had disappointed his father – Ted’s silence made that clear, and no harsh reprimand was needed. As an adult and an employer of tens of thousands of people, Branson has tried to live up to his dad’s example of leniency. When Branson was running Virgin Records, for example, he became aware that one of his younger employees, a talented Artists and Repertoire (A&R) person, was stealing records and selling them to other stores. Though Branson would have every reason to fire him, he remembered his own experience of stealing and his father’s kindness. Thus, after privately confronting the employee about his theft, he gave him a second chance and allowed him to keep his job. The result? Just like the younger Branson, this employee never stole anything again. Moreover, he became a great asset to the company, discovering several hit artists, including the singer Boy George. Unfortunately, Branson’s humane attitude is at odds with some of his business contemporaries. US President and billionaire businessman Donald Trump, for instance, previously delighted in publicly denigrating people and firing them on his TV show The Apprentice. This may have all been for entertainment, but it nonetheless reflects the hard-nosed and authoritarian values that many business leaders subscribe to. Fortunately, though, that’s not the Virgin way of doing things. When it comes to qualities we look for in a leader, listening features rather far down on the list. Instead, we focus on their powers of oration – their speaking skills. Just consider two esteemed leaders of the twentieth century, Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. Ask anyone what made these men great, and they’ll probably mention great speeches. Indeed, Churchill’s ‘Finest Hour’ speech in 1940 and Kennedy’s famous inaugural address in 1961 have defined both leaders’ legacies. But even if their oratory skills were applauded, Churchill’s and Kennedy’s successes amounted to much more. In fact, Branson believes that these great men must have been great listeners, too. In Branson’s opinion, listening is a woefully underrated skill and the hallmark of many excellent leaders. Over four decades ago, Branson started a lifelong habit of listening intently to what others had to say, and diligently noting down any interesting remarks they made. As a teenager, Branson interviewed the famous novelist John Le Carre for his magazine, Student. Although he usually brought a tape recorder to his interviews, it was old and rarely worked. As such, he began diligently noting down his interviewee’s responses. And the behavior stuck – these days he has hundreds of notebooks, filled with his own and others’ reflections. And it’s not just Branson himself whose career has benefited from a policy of careful listening and note-taking. In the 1990s, for instance, Branson gave a speech in Greece about his business. During the question and answer session with the audience, one young man stood out. Not only did he ask excellent questions, but he also listened intently enough to ask great follow-up questions, and even wrote down Branson’s answers. Who was this eager young man? Well, back then he was simply the son of a wealthy shipping magnate. But these days, he’s Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of one of the UK’s most successful airlines, EasyJet. To Branson’s mind, Ioannou’s incredible success just goes to show how far a thirst for listening, and a passion for note-taking, can take you. Ask someone what their company culture is like, and they may look at you blankly. Indeed, for many of us, the only way we feel as if we’re experiencing any ‘culture’ in the office is if we eat yogurt at our desks. But that’s not the Virgin way. In fact, Branson agrees with Peter Drucker, the wise management consultant who famously said: “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” What does a winning company culture look like? Well, Branson believes it comes down to everyone, from executives and managers to junior employees, being highly serious – serious about having fun, that is. Indeed, before Virgin became the business behemoth it is today, the organization consisted of little more than Branson and his workmates kicking back on bean bags in Virgin Records’ only shop, having a great time. This was simply a group of people who enjoyed their jobs and the company of their colleagues. Sure, the going was tough sometimes. Hard work and long hours were often part of the equation. But the reason Virgin is so successful today is that everyone involved played as hard as they worked. Late night partying is actually commonplace at Virgin. Branson has witnessed this thoroughly fun-loving culture in other successful organizations, too. One company that exemplifies this culture is Southwest Airlines, a low-cost Texas-based airline. For much of its 40-year history, larger-than-life founder Herb Kelleher has steered the company. Leading by example, Herb has always tried to inject some fun into his business. When a competitor almost sued Southwest for plagiarizing their marketing tagline ‘Just Plane Smart,’ Herb persuaded the other company’s CEO to settle their dispute with an arm-wrestle! Their customers are also treated to the cabin staff’s unique sense of humor. One group of passengers once boarded their plane, only to find that the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. Where were they? Hiding in the overhead bins, of which they promptly jumped out, shouting: “Surprise!” The result of all this silliness? Not only is Southwest Airlines a great place to work, but in a notoriously competitive industry, it’s also the only airline company in history to turn a profit for forty years straight! How can you make your own luck? Well, an ancient philosopher wisely opined that “luck is what happens when opportunity meets preparation.” In other words, when opportunity knocks, you’d better make sure you’re ready to greet it. Let’s take a look at an example from Branson’s own life to see what happens when these two elements come together. The first album that Branson’s fledgling Virgin Records ever released was Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells. Unfortunately, though the album was a hit in the UK, Branson was having a hard time selling it to the Head of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, who thought the record would be unpopular with American audiences. One day, after many phone calls from Branson, Ertegun sat in his office and gave Tubular Bells another listen. Into his office walked the film director William Friedkin, who immediately asked what the music was. On the spot, Friedkin decided it would be perfect as the soundtrack to his upcoming movie. That movie turned out to be The Exorcist, the hit horror film. Not only did Atlantic Records buy the album, but the film also brought it to worldwide fame. Of course, the fact that Friedkin walked in and heard the record was a great piece of luck, but would Ertegun have been listening to that album if Branson hadn’t pressured him to give it another try? Probably not. Another key ingredient for cooking up your own luck is courage. When Branson’s friend Antonio was a student at Stanford University, he randomly struck up a conversation with a stranger next to him in a cinema queue, who also turned out to be a student. Spontaneously, they decided to go for coffee together, where the stranger told Antonio that he and a friend were launching a company. When they finished, the stranger showed him what his company was working on. Though their research was too technical for Antonio to understand, he thought the idea had potential, and the very next day he pledged to give the student the $10,000 he’d been saving up to buy a car with. This bought him a 1 percent share in their nascent business. A pretty brave move, you’d probably agree! Some might even say foolhardy. What was that business? Today it’s known as Google – that stranger was Sergey Brin. Antonio still has his 1 percent stake, but now it’s worth billions of dollars. Sure, it was lucky that he went for coffee that day. But this piece of luck wouldn’t have meant anything if Antonio hadn’t had the guts to take a big risk with his money. Making great decisions is arguably the most important part of being a leader. As the top decision-maker at Virgin, Branson understands that there’s no secret formula for making the correct call every single time. Indeed, after decades of getting it mostly right, but sometimes wrong, there’s only one thing he’s sure about – the best decisions usually take time. Interestingly, Branson didn’t always take such a measured approach to decision-making. In fact, for most of his career, he admits he’s been guilty of jumping into things feet-first, with varying results. Virgin’s entry into the aviation industry, for instance, was the result of a quick, instinctual decision on Branson’s part. Instead of commissioning the reams of market research that would usually accompany such as enormous move, he decided his gut instinct was sufficient and quickly launched Virgin Atlantic, and later, Virgin Blue. Although these two ventures were commercial successes, Branson’s hasty judgment hasn’t always been so prescient. A similar snap decision, for instance, was to launch the soda Virgin Cola in 1984 and Virgin Brides, a bridal wear business, in 1996. Unfortunately, neither of these ventures were profitable. Nowadays, as a seasoned entrepreneur with decades of both success and failure under his belt, Branson subscribes to a decision-making approach that’s best described as purposeful procrastination. In other words, when he’s presented with a decision, he and his team take as much time as possible to work out the best course of action. This cautious strategy has proved highly rewarding. Several years ago, for instance, Branson was approached by Goldman Sachs and offered the opportunity to invest in a little-known financial commodity. Almost immediately, members of Branson’s Virgin Money team were recommending he jump on board. However, as Branson himself had never heard of the commodity, he insisted that his team dig deeper and try to uncover more potential downsides of investing. Eventually, after an intensive fact-finding mission, and with Goldman Sachs pushing him for an answer, Branson politely declined. Interestingly, that hot financial commodity turned out to be subprime mortgages – the very thing that would blow up the corporate world in 2007 and cause a global financial crash. Furthermore, in 2010, Goldman Sachs was fined $550 million for handing out misleading, incomplete information to potential investors. As Branson now knows, Virgin received that incomplete information. It was only thanks to his purposeful procrastination that they didn’t lose a lot of money, as well as their reputation, in the scandal. As an innovator, your biggest challenge is often persuading naysayers that your idea will work. In the sixteenth century, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Bayazid II wanted to build a bridge across Istanbul’s River Bosphorus, an act that would connect Europe and Asia. Unfortunately, the engineers of the day were stumped. Eventually, the Sultan asked an Italian artist named Leonardo da Vinci to come up with a design. Incredibly, da Vinci produced a beautiful rendering, based on cutting-edge mathematical concepts that he was sure would hold. But the rest of the engineering world sneered at his efforts and told the Sultan that the design was too fantastical to succeed. Da Vinci’s bridge was never built. Fast forward 500 years, and today’s innovators are still told no by their short-sighted contemporaries. Luckily, in his own visionary career, Branson hasn’t let the naysayers hold him back. When the first Virgin Megastore was launched in New York, for instance, Branson chose Times Square as the location. In 1996, Times Square was considered scary – many told Branson that New Yorkers simply wouldn’t go to that part of town. Well, they were wrong. Not only did the Times Square megastore quickly begin making weekly sales of over $1 million, but its presence helped trigger the redevelopment of the whole Times Square area. This isn’t the only time Branson has proved his critics wrong. After launching Virgin Atlantic, for instance, Branson realized that up to 40 percent of the average passenger’s travel time was actually spent on the ground – often waiting in the departure lounge. Thus, he decided to make this experience every bit as luxurious as that spent flying. While other airlines neglected their passengers on the ground, offering them little more than bad coffee, Virgin Atlantic launched clubhouse departure lounges that offered sit-down meals, business centers, haircuts and even massages. Moreover, these amazing benefits were all included in the price of the flight, which Virgin’s critics believed would make them financially unsustainable. Once again, though, Branson proved them wrong. Indeed, Virgin Atlantic’s perks were so desirable to passengers that even customers loyal to other airlines began switching over, leaving Virgin’s competitors scrambling to add swanky departure lounges to their own offerings. So don’t let conventional wisdom stand in your way. If you’ve got a great idea, pursue it! Branson is proud to say that the Virgin way is to always lend a hand to the young people who will become our next generation of entrepreneurs. Of course, finding budding entrepreneurs and equipping them with the skills they need to succeed cannot be done by the business world alone. That’s why Branson is calling on schools to wake up to the enormous potential of entrepreneurship and change the way they teach our children. As a school dropout at the age of 16, Branson believed, as he still does, that the mainstream school system places too little emphasis on the skills needed for an entrepreneurial career. The entrepreneurs of the future, for instance, will need to take risks, deal with failure and be unafraid to challenge convention. If you spend some time talking to your average teenager, you’ll probably notice they have these qualities in spades. Unfortunately, many schools believe free-thinking young people should have these qualities drummed out of them in the classroom. And what are they replaced with? The status quo. Instead of encouraging kids to realize their true potential or indulge their curiosity and see what career it leads to, teachers encourage children to enter the same jobs and professions that their teachers probably suggested, too. The upshot of this approach is that children are taught an outdated curriculum, in which algebra is valued over understanding human emotions, and calculus is taught instead of critical thinking. So, how can our schools start preparing our children for the future?   Crucially, they need to get real-life entrepreneurs into the classroom to start talking to young people about their work. Branson still remembers with frustration that the only job his teachers ever talked about was teaching! To open young people’s eyes to a world of possibilities, educators need to engage with those who have chosen different paths themselves. Moreover, if you’re an entrepreneur talking to young people, don’t be afraid to focus on the failure you’ve encountered, as well as your successes. Remember, tales of resilience in the face of hardship are every bit as valuable to young minds as those of triumph. The key message in these blinks: Success in business is a combination of hard work, luck and having the courage to follow your convictions. As a phenomenally successful entrepreneur, Branson has learned that doing things your own way is nearly always better than sticking to the status quo.    Got feedback?

Drawing from the experiences of his own training, the author has devised a set of strategies that anyone can use to define their missions, sharpen their focus and develop the tactics necessary to accomplish their missions, whether personal or business-related. In these blinks, you’ll learn what it takes to develop personal discipline, take an ethical stand, and shape your life accordingly, how hanging upside down from a mountain helped one executive take tighter control of his life, some simple tricks for deciding whether your decisions are tactically sound, and how to discipline your “fear dog” and nourish your “courage dog” to maximum health. Each individual is unique, but it isn’t our color, shape or language that differentiates us: it’s our soul – our sense of who we are. Inside our souls, there are fixed points unique to us, and it’s these points that give our lives meaning. When we’re unsure of what to do, for instance, what job to pursue, they act like our GPS, guiding the way for us. So how can we find these unique, fixed points? The first thing you must do is make a stand, deciding which things you absolutely cannot compromise on. For example, the author’s stand is: “I will find peace and happiness through seeking truth, wisdom, and love, and not by chasing thrills, wealth, titles or fame.” Knowing which values cannot be compromised helps him to shape his life in a way that is meaningful to him. For example, if he were offered a job with a great title and a huge paycheck at the expense of sincerity, then he wouldn’t accept it because that would mean compromising his values. Second, you must know your purpose. Your purpose answers the question: What do I really want with my life? Knowing your purpose enables you to determine steps necessary to achieve it and overcome any hurdles along the way. However, if you don’t follow your purpose, it will be difficult to achieve anything. For example, on his first day of SEAL training, the author was able to enjoy the beauty of the day despite the extreme challenge of his training. His buddy, however, didn’t share his positive outlook, struggled with the challenge, and ultimately quit. The author asked him afterwards what had happened, and his friend confessed that he didn’t even want to be a SEAL. His dream had always been to be a veterinarian. So why was the author successful with this challenge but his friend wasn’t? Quite simply, because the author had identified his purpose and his friend hadn’t. During their training, Navy SEALs are taught that, when they wield their weapon, they should place enormous concentration and focus on their aim, utilizing something called front-sight focus. Not only is front-sight focus absolutely essential in combat, it’s also applicable in our everyday lives. In fact, all goals require focus if we’re to achieve them, and great accomplishments are only possible when we identify our goals and achieve them in succession, one goal at a time. Imagine, for example, that you run a business and you have several goals to achieve simultaneously: you need to reduce your costs, be environmentally conscious and introduce new products onto the market. You could try to accomplish all your goals at once, but the lack of focus ultimately leads to inefficiency. It would be better to employ front-sight focus and concentrate on one single, immediate goal at a time in order to achieve each of them more efficiently. But front-sight focus doesn’t always come naturally. In order to cultivate front-sight focus, you must first gain control of your mind. You should start by learning to ignore outside influences, thus allowing yourself to focus on a singular goal. One way to do this is through deep breathing and silence. Deep breathing forces you to concentrate only on the present moment, thus avoiding any distractions. Practicing deep breathing will help you focus on the front-sight. Silence provides you with a space to think more clearly. If you work in an office, for example, your mind gets overloaded by the distractions of office chatter and ringing phones, which ultimately saps your concentration. One way to overcome this might be to go outside and sit in a quiet place, like a park. The stillness will allow you to regain control of your mind, thus offering you the chance to focus on your goal. Undoubtedly, you’ll be confronted by many things in your life that make you uncertain: things that make you feel afraid or like you can’t succeed. What’s the best way to handle these kinds of challenges so you can create the kind of life you want? You have to work hard to overcome your weakness and, in doing so, build a stronger character. We naturally fear anything that might cause us harm, so we often do whatever we can in order to avoid those things. While this strategy is understandable, it’s also limiting. In fact, we can accomplish so much more without the limitation of staying in our comfort zone. One executive demonstrated this during a mountain climb during which he overcame his fear of heights. As he climbed the mountain, he panicked and flipped upside down, hanging on only by his rope. Instead of rushing to his aid, his coach told him to “stop screaming” and focus on overcoming his fear. In spite of the panic, he was able to calm down and right himself. Ultimately, he learned that if he challenges his fears, he will be stronger for it. In order to excel at overcoming your weaknesses, you must first cultivate your discipline, drive and determination: Discipline creates habits, e.g., the habit of confronting (and not fleeing) fear Drive is the motivation behind the habit, i.e., the belief that you can reach your goals Determination is your commitment to your mission, i.e., working extremely hard to accomplish your goals You can use these principles to overcome fear and expand your possibilities. If you’re afraid of heights, for example, you can develop the discipline to create the habit of looking down from a new height every day. You can also cultivate your drive by telling yourself that nothing can stop you. Then, use your determination to enact your new habit every day without exception. Those who have mental toughness are the first to jump into any challenge and the last to throw in the towel; they never quit, and they face challenges with a smile. But how do you cultivate mental toughness? To forge your mental strength, you need to have control over your thoughts and mind. One way to accomplish this is through positive thinking. Try this trick: imagine there are two dogs inside you, a courage dog and fear dog, and the idea is to to feed the courage dog and discipline the fear dog. The fear dog is the source of your fear and unease, and thus weakens you mentally. Therefore, you want to be sure to appropriately discipline him. The courage dog, on the other hand, is the source of your strength. He thrives on positive thoughts, such as “you can do this” or “I’ll never give up,” so you want to be sure to feed him as often as you can. By banishing your fear and cultivating courage, you gain the strength to react appropriately in any situation. But in order to cultivate this mental toughness, you also need control over your emotions. Emotions don’t only affect our minds, but also our bodies. For example, when we get angry, our muscles tighten; when we’re afraid, we hold our breath, thus making it harder to control our performance. One way to overcome this is by transforming negative emotions by feeding them with positivity. For example, during his military training course, one of the author’s classmates made a mistake that cost him his front tooth. He became so angry that his muscles began to tighten and his performance got even worse. However, after having noticed these negative emotions, he was able to transform his anger into determination, thus giving him the strength to complete the course even faster. Have you ever had the feeling something bad was going to happen, and it turned out that your intuition was right? This feeling is your subconscious and it can be used to your advantage. In order to harness the power of your subconscious, you must be aware of all the various information gathered by your senses. You’ll need to slow down and collect the information through all your senses: from your ears, nose, eyes, mouth and skin. Your subconscious collects all this sensory data and uses it to help you better understand your environment and thus make better decisions. For example, when you’re having a conversation with someone, your ears collect large amounts of sensory data. But that doesn’t just help you to understand your conversation partner’s words – assessing their tone of voice also helps you gain a deeper understanding of what they're trying to convey. In order to best access your subconscious, you should employ the two following techniques. The first is focused awareness. This type of awareness involves laser-sharp focus where your conscious mind is fully engaged in processing information. The second is relaxed awareness, i.e., not focusing on anything in particular and gathering a bigger picture of your surroundings. Employing these two types of awareness in succession helps information pass from the conscious to the subconscious mind, where it will remain until your brain recalls it in the form of inspiration or strokes of genius. In fact, Einstein employed a similar technique by napping after a period of deep focus. His “aha” moments often came to him during or after his naps. Indeed, your subconscious can be a great source of inspiration, so long as you make use of all of your senses and correctly store the information they’ve gathered. Now that you’ve gained some knowledge into how to structure your mind for success, the final blinks will focus on the tactics and strategies you can use to accomplish your mission. Why is it that 95 percent of startups fail within their first five years? Because the business world is volatile: new technologies can make products obsolete, investors can abandon projects, etc. But is there any way to mitigate these risks? While you can’t avoid risk altogether, you can make your business more resilient by selecting high-value targets. This process helps you optimally allocate resources by knowing what’s most important. You can assess a target’s value by using FITS (fit, importance, timing and simplicity): Does your target fit the specific skills of your team? Is it important in order to achieve your overall mission? Is it a prudent time to tackle this target? And is the target simple and clear or rather complex? For example, imagine you’re running a factory and your goal is to adopt carbon-neutral technology. You can use FITS to assess the practicality of your goal. You should ask questions like: Is my team qualified to install and implement this new technology, i.e., are they fit for the job? If not, do the benefits of this new technology outweigh the cost of training my workforce? Will it help you be a better company, i.e., is it important? Do I have the resources available to achieve my goal, i.e., is it the right time to make these changes? Finally, is the project simple enough to be realized efficiently? If the answer to any of these is no, then you should seriously consider whether to begin the process of becoming carbon neutral. If you decide to start the project anyway, you run the risk of being unable to cope if something unexpected happens due to the fact that you’ve diverted your resources elsewhere. Sometimes we’ve invested so much of ourselves in our ideas and inventions that they’re hard to let go, even when it’s necessary to. However, rather than tinker with a defective product until it works, sometimes you have to break and totally rebuild it. Whenever your product “breaks,” you shouldn’t get upset, but instead welcome the failure, as it’s a welcome chance to learn from past mistakes. For example, the body-building product Body Rev failed because it was too complicated to use and targeted the wrong market. Instead of tweaking the product to make it simpler or seeking out a new market, the inventor decided to simply build an entirely new product: the Perfect Pushup. The inventor learned from his mistakes by creating a simple product from scratch and targeting a more lucrative market. However, it’s better to not have to wait until something fails before improving upon it. Instead, you should constantly think up innovative ways of making your products and ideas better. One way to do this is by critically examining your own work as well as studying rival products and assessing their strengths and limitations. Indeed, an unwillingness to actively look for problems with your own product will leave you stuck in the status quo, and you won’t be able to think outside the box and stay innovative. Imagine, for example, that you’ve created a reasonably successful product that works fine. Sure, it has a few issues, but you’ve only had a few customer complaints and finding a solution might be difficult. You may choose to not take action, but your competitors certainly won’t. They’ll probably spot even this tiny defect and develop their own innovative solution. Before long, they’ll have stolen all your customers and left your company in the dust! It’s a fact of life that there will always be conflict both in our personal lives and in business. You should always be ready to deal with these conflicts. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean preparing your defenses. Instead of reacting when conflict strikes, you should always be in offensive mode. One way to do this is rework your defensive language vocabulary and turn it into part of your offense. Given that the words we use affect people’s attitude towards a given situation, we have control over whether they function defensively or offensively. Words like “good,” “can’t,” “try,” “maybe,” “failed,” etc. produce images of uncertainty and doubt. However, if we substitute them with words like “great,” “do,” “definitely,” etc., then you can change your language in a way that uses stronger, more decisive and positive words. If you make a new habit of using assertive, positive language, you can gain the upper hand in both your personal and business relationships. Furthermore, “offensive” mode helps you to use surprise and speed to get an edge over your competitors. In any business in this modern world, the ability to swiftly react is essential – technology and the business environment are constantly changing. Indeed, a business’s very survival depends upon quickly reacting to these changes, lest they be overtaken by those businesses that can adapt more quickly. Take Apple, for example. They constantly receive praise for their creativity, yet they aren’t the quickest in their field. That award goes to Samsung, which, after being faced with the iPad, went on the offensive and produced a rival tablet so swiftly that even Apple was caught off guard. Thus, Samsung was able to use its speed to quickly adapt and get ahead. By remaining on the offensive, you too can catch your competitors off guard and take advantage of their slow reactions. The key message in this book: If you want to achieve your goals, you must first define your purpose and then live by it. In addition, you should carefully sculpt your mind with positivity so that you can attain maximum focus and convey strength. Actionable advice: Feed the right dog. Imagine two dogs living in your soul: the courage dog and the fear dog. Each time you succumb to fear, you feed the fear dog, and each time you overcome fear, you feed the courage dog. The more you feed them, the more strength they have and the more influence they have on your life. If you want to overcome your fears, then you need to nourish your courage dog while disciplining the fear dog.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Indeed, it could be argued that an ability to negotiate determines, to a large extent, your success in life. So it’s surely good to know how to turn a negotiation into a success – or, in other words, how to reach an outcome that profits both you and the person you’re negotiating with. These blinks will teach you how to do exactly that. You’ll learn when to be steadfast and when to concede, how to behave favorably and which attitude to adopt when trying to make a deal. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to give coinage; why an advertising company left British Rail waiting in a dirty room with stale food; and why you should talk to strangers. Whether you’re working on a promotion for yourself or a deal on behalf of your company, bargaining skills are essential. There are a few central skills that will have you negotiating like a pro and you’re about to learn how to develop them. But first, it’s important to understand how negotiating has transformed with time. A successful negotiation used to be described as a process of wrestling your opponent into submission. For instance, when two warring nations would meet to agree on a peace treaty, the stronger military power of the two would essentially force the other into accepting their desires. The same was true for business negotiations when a large firm wanted to acquire a smaller one. In the past, this approach has worked just fine for big businesses, since they tended to be less interdependent than they are today. Back then, forcing a rival or smaller partner out of the game might present a small setback – say, a financial loss in one quarter – but wasn’t sheer suicide. But that’s all changed. Today, losing a business partner can cause long-term damage and serious financial loss. That’s why current negotiations are all about satisfying every party involved. Just take firms like Apple and Coca-Cola, which produce, market and sell their products all over the world. This global presence means they’re more dependent on the cooperation of other firms such as materials suppliers or local marketing agencies. Because of this, they must approach negotiations in an entirely new manner; they must strive for common ground and solutions that leave everyone feeling good. Instead of simply strong-arming others, they now have to sit down with smaller companies to gain access to their markets. But that doesn’t mean bad negotiations are a thing of the past. It’s still important to actively prevent deals from going sour, and that all depends on the attitude you bring to the table – a concept you’ll learn about in the next blink. The basic attitude you bring to a negotiation will play a major role in shaping the discussion. Simply put, some attitudes are great and others aren’t. Let’s first discuss the ones you should definitely avoid. The two most harmful attitudes you can bring to a negotiation are losing and using. The first refers to entering a negotiation with the sense that no matter what happens you’ll come out the loser. Such a feeling can stem from bad experiences in the past or a sense of total powerlessness when facing your negotiating partner. This attitude can only do harm – both to you and, potentially, the other party. After all, if you come to the table in this state, you might just say “to hell with it” and try to drag everyone else down with you. It goes without saying that this isn’t a winning strategy. The second unhelpful attitude – using – refers to a desire to reap all the benefits, while refusing to cede a single demand to the other party. In the business world of today, such an approach just won’t get you anywhere. If a company feels like it’s being used, it will simply look elsewhere for business partners. Furthermore, behaving this way will earn you a reputation as a “user” and companies with whom you seek to do business will start coming into negotiations with more aggressive attitudes to protect themselves from being used. The end result can only be worse deals for you. So rather than being a loser or a user, be a fuser – a person committed to finding the best possible outcome for everyone involved. Instead of focusing on cutting the biggest slice of the pie for themselves, fusers endeavor to create a bigger pie for everyone to share. So if you find yourself using the other side, remember that this approach will only mean missing out on creating greater value for everyone. But how do you become an expert fuser? We will find out in the next blink. Anyone who has ever played a game of poker knows that, before betting begins, you need to determine how strong your hand is. Well, the same goes for any negotiation. So how can you determine the strength of your position? First, you need to “count your aces.” You can do this in three steps. First, know exactly your company’s specialty is. In a negotiation, you’ll be the expert on your company’s market position and you shouldn’t let someone with an inaccurate understanding of your product walk all over you. Therefore, do your homework on your company’s position. Second, you need to remember that bigger isn’t always better. If you’re in negotiations with a firm that’s larger than yours, you don’t need to be scared of the clout they carry. Being smaller can actually be a benefit; it affords more agility, flexibility and adaptability. As a smaller company, these are your advantages. Third, consider the knowledge you have that the other side doesn’t. This might come in the form of a recent customer survey or product satisfaction study. Having new, up-to-date information could help put you in a strong negotiating position. From there, it’s key to remember what you want to achieve, which, in every single case, should be a positive outcome for everyone. Just take Will, an author. When he cut a deal with a publisher, he proposed a cover picture for the book consisting of a Moses-like figure standing in front of a wall of fire and holding the ten “Rock and Rollercoaster” commandments. In this case, the publisher didn’t exercise their veto power, even though they knew the picture was a bad idea. Instead, they allowed it to become the cover image as it would please the author and create a friendly climate.. That’s the gist of fusing. Next, you’ll get more in-depth knowledge about the negotiation process itself. When entering a negotiation, as when preparing for a job interview, it’s crucial to have the facts straight about the other party. But that’s not all the matters. You must also prepare the ground for the setting of the negotiation. This means fostering the appropriate climate. You can do this in a variety of ways, from getting the meeting started on time to providing your guests with a comfortable place to wait and drinks to enjoy. But sometimes you’ll need to take a more creative tack, and comfort won’t be your goal at all. Just consider the advertising company Saatchi and Saatchi’s approach when negotiating with British Rail. They intentionally made the representatives of British Rail wait in a dirty room with stale food until they were ready to leave, only to reveal that this was all to show how the rail line’s customers felt on a daily basis – a reality that Saatchi was ready to help them transform. This stunt drove the point home and put Saatchi and Saatchi in a much better position to negotiate. Setting the stage is of the utmost importance, but it’s also essential to notice the little clues the other party might send your way. This is a major part of being a successful fuser. But how can you decode the hidden information being communicated? A good place to start is by turning up your empathy and increasing your observation of body language and vocal tone. Facial expressions – vacant eyes or a little smile tugging at the lips – can often give you a powerful sense of how your negotiating partner feels. For instance, vacant eyes might mean that you’re losing the person’s attention, and that it’s time to spice up your language. On the other hand, the beginnings of a smile might imply that she is pleased with what you’re suggesting and you’re on the verge of a great result. As you near the end of a negotiation, it’s time to get serious. The phase during which you bid and bargain can easily make or break the whole deal and it’s essential that, before making your own bid, you ask the other party what they want. Doing so will make them feel both heard and like their position is being taken seriously. Not just that, but putting your needs first could damage the mood or, if the other company is smaller, make them feel steamrolled. That being said, there are times when bidding first can be to your advantage. For instance, if you want to buy a necklace that you think is worth $500, you might open with a bid of $200. The seller, who wants a price of $800, would normally start his offer around $1,200 to prevent the negotiation from dropping below his desired price.  However, your low starting bid might cause the seller to hesitate and open with a lower initial offer of, say $900. This will start him off much closer to his bottom line while you still have plenty of room to negotiate with. From there, once bids have been put on the table, remember that bargaining might take place before an agreement is reached. It’s important that you to come prepared for this phase with a list that clearly details which points you’re willing to concede and which are absolutely non-negotiable. Such a list will help ensure that the negotiation ends profitably for you. But remember, you can’t win everything and there will inevitably be points that you lose during bargaining. If these are pieces you absolutely need, don’t be afraid to walk away from the deal and find a new partner. And finally, once everything is looking good, let the deal close. If bargaining is taking too much time and you feel that the deal is ready to go, just accept it flat out and avoid making final concessions as an act of goodwill. Now that you’ve got a picture of what a successful negotiation looks like, it’s time to have a closer look at the subtleties of making a deal. Two major ones are behavior and body language, both of which are crucial to setting the proper climate. For instance, if your goal is to achieve a sense of cooperation, you should ask the other side what they want, and then talk about all that you can accomplish by working together. Your body language and tone should communicate your excitement and engagement. Don’t speak in a monotone or let your shoulders slump; you should be excited, speaking faster than usual and smiling broadly. These signs of excitement will show the other party that you’re happy to be speaking with them. But if things are going differently than you expected and a behavioral change is called for, definitely make it. For example, if the climate becomes explicitly hostile, don’t hesitate to switch from a welcoming tone to a challenging one. Failing to do so will signal to the other party that you’re easy prey. One sign of such a shift could be that your opponent is squaring up her shoulders and taking an aggressive stance. If she does so, don’t be afraid and don’t back down. By squaring up yourself and looking her straight in the eyes, you’ll show that you’re ready for a fight. And remember, you don’t need to be in a negotiation to practice your skills; you can actually hone your technique in a variety of everyday situations. So if you’re having a hard time in business negotiations, try opening a conversation or negotiation outside of work. Just go to the nearest farmer’s market and, rather than accepting the listed prices for vegetables, engage the vendors in negotiations to reach a better price for yourself. Such practice will build your self-confidence without incurring any risks for you or your company. The key message in this book: Successful modern negotiation is all about achieving the best result for everyone involved. By paying close attention to the way you negotiate, you can come to the table with an improved attitude and set a climate that results in a winning deal for all parties.  Actionable advice: Change your inner language. Feeling insecure about your skills as a negotiator will set you up for failure. So when preparing for a meeting, try having a conversation with your inner self that’s positive and supportive. Reflect on why you think others will take you seriously and figure out why you believe it. Acknowledge the progress you are making and, before you know it, you’ll be walking into the negotiating room with a can-do attitude. Got feedback?

Otto Scharmer","summary":"Society is currently facing tremendous challenges such as overpopulation and political conflicts. To face them, leaders must not only look to the past, but learn from the future as it emerges. To learn from the future as it emerges, leaders must lead themselves and their organizations through a U-process, first descending to the source of their deepest creativity and then coming back up to turn their ideas and insights into reality. In Theory U, you’ll discover how you can connect with your future self and learn from it rather than from the mistakes of the past. You’ll also find ways in which you can tap into your blind spot, the deepest source of your creativity. Finally, you’ll also learn how the U-process could make, for example, healthcare services warmer and more human while simultaneously increasing efficiency and the satisfaction of all parties involved. There are several trends in the world today that seem to be leading to imminent disaster. For example, although the economy is thriving, the number of poor people in the world is rising. Similarly, although we’re investing heavily into agriculture, we’re only using unsustainable mass-production methods to produce our food. These trends arise from three major shifts occurring in society. First, there’s the technological and economic shift of a globalized economy. Since the collapse of the socialist economies, the whole planet has, for the first time ever, been adhering to similar economic policies like downsizing governments and privatizing state-owned industries. This shift presents us with the challenge of how to make the economy more equitable to all, including future generations. Second, there’s the shift in international relations as powerful global institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank emerge. This challenges us, as we need to find a way to deepen democracy and evolve our political institutions so that everyone can directly participate in the decision-making processes without supranational institutions overruling them. Finally, there is a cultural and spiritual shift in the way we see and interact with the world. Non-governmental organizations and civil groups have emerged as global actors, having achieved  nonviolent societal transformations like the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the peace and human rights movements of the 1980s. Also, people are increasingly interested in spiritual topics like personal mastery and flow. One study found that including a spiritual component in employee training significantly raises their productivity. This presents us with the challenge of how we can start seeing every human as being on a journey – a journey to become their true, authentic self. Because of these major shifts, many leaders and key decision-makers now find themselves feeling lost and powerless. Today’s challenges place enormous pressure on leaders. To understand how they might overcome them, let’s take a look at three perspectives on creativity and leadership. Consider the work of an artist: There’s the thing that results from her creative process – this is the what.\n There’s the process of painting that happens while the work is created – this is the how.\n Finally, there’s the moment as she stands in front of a blank canvas. Here, you look at the work before creation begins and focus on the source of her inspiration. An analogous division can be seen in leadership: You can focus on what the outcomes of leaders’ actions are. You can look at how leaders lead, observing the processes and strategies they use. Or, finally, you can ask what the source of their leadership decisions and creativity is. This source is usually overlooked, and is therefore known as the blind spot. To be an effective leader, you must be able to access your blind spot, because it will allow you to learn from the future as it emerges. To grasp what this means, you must first understand that everyone has two selves: one connected to the past and the other connected to future aspirations. The author experienced this divide when, as a young boy, he came home from school one day to find his parents’ farmhouse burned to the ground. His home and the things he had been attached to had suddenly been taken away from him. In effect, his past self had vanished. But then he became aware of another self, one which he could bring to life through his own actions: his future self. You can learn from both of these selves: learning from the past is what schools teach, for example: you make choices that avoid the mistakes of the past. But you can also learn from the future as it emerges, meaning you make decisions based on what you aspire to be in the future. Imagine, for a moment, that your consciousness is a lake. In the humdrum of daily life, you usually stay on the surface of that lake without indulging in deeper introspection or reflection. But the blind spot, your source of deep creativity, is at the bottom of that lake. And to find the truly innovative ideas needed today, leaders must be able to tap into the blind spot. So how can you dive down to the bottom of the lake? First, you need to open your mind and heart to new ideas. In everyday life, most of us develop fixed, predictable ways of thinking, like mental ruts. These patterns show that we always tend to reproduce past behavior. But to reach the blind spot, it’s important to not let the past color your perceptions of others, and to refrain from making judgments. If you go even further and fully imagine yourself in someone else’s shoes, you get a fuller understanding of their experiences and can thus experience the world more richly. This is essentially a deep dive toward your blind spot. Once there, you’ll find that your two selves – the past self connected to your experiences and the future self connected to your hopes and dreams – can converse. This phenomenon is known as “presencing” and it results in genuinely new and innovative ideas. Finally, you must swim back up and bring the innovations you found at the bottom to life. First, crystallize your visions and define clearly what exactly it is you want to achieve. Next, start to realize your ideas in small steps. Don’t start with a grand commitment or a big public speech. Instead, test out your ideas incrementally. And so, the way to tap into your blind spot for the most creative and innovative ideas is U-shaped: you go down, you “presence” and you come back up to turn your ideas into reality. Read on to find out how you can use the U-process in practice. To start on your journey down the U, the first step is to gather information with an open mind. Listen to the people around you without judgment. Remember that all great ideas need a trigger. For example, the author was once approached by a student to teach a class on corporate social responsibility. At first, he refused due to a full schedule, but after some consideration, he realized the class was exactly what he wanted to do and he changed his plans to accommodate the class. If he had not been open to the student’s idea, he would have missed this great opportunity. To ensure you don’t miss any great ideas, you should practice putting yourself in other people’s shoes. Take four minutes each evening to review your day, but imagine you’re looking at yourself from someone else’s perspective. Pay attention to how you interacted with others and what people wanted from you or suggested you do. Don’t judge what you see, just observe. But to descend down the U, it’s not enough to listen passively: you also need to actively approach people and talk to them. This is valuable information gathering. Whatever the problem or topic is that requires you tap into your blind spot, find and talk to the people who have a lot of knowledge and experience in that field. But remember to also talk to the less-visible individuals who are often ignored – they can be crucial. For example, if you wanted to find ideas to reform the education system, you should talk to knowledgeable and important people like principals, but also to the students, who may not normally have a say. Here too, it’s important to stay open to suggestions and listen to what the people really tell you, without judging them. This type of listening will help you understand the problems people face and see possible solutions to them. Which helps you dive deeper down the U. While the advice you get from others is very valuable, listening to your blind spot is even more important. Life is a journey where you must follow the feeling you get from your blind spot, that deep source of creativity unique to you and the life you’ve lived. Trust that feeling more than the advice you get from others. To help you listen to your blind spot, adopt a practice of intentional silence. Many great thinkers and leaders do this in their daily lives. For example, you could adopt a morning practice where you rise early and spend some time in a quiet space. You can meditate, pray or just practice internal silence, but also try to think about what brought you to your current place in life. Then, make a commitment to what you want to accomplish on this particular day. In this silence, you will find it easier to listen to your blind spot and what it tells you. The blind spot will help you understand what’s really important to you and evaluate whether it’s worth the cost of pursuing it. Ask yourself: What situations in your life are the ones when you feel most connected to your source of energy and inspiration? Now think of those situations and activities as seeds. What would a future look like where those small seeds have grown into an inspiring forest? What would nurturing those seeds into a forest demand, and what would you need to give up for it? And what if, despite all your work, you were to fail in bringing about the forest? Would you think it had been worth the risk? By asking these questions and listening to your blind spot for the answers, you’ll find out which projects and goals are really important to you and worth pursuing. Once you’ve found creative ideas for your projects in your blind spot, you must swim back up and turn your ideas into reality. The first step is to crystallize your ideas and your vision, meaning that you must define them clearly and unambiguously for the implementation phase. To crystallize your vision for the future, you can use this exercise: First, focus on where in life you wish to be in the future. Second, think about where you are at this very moment. Finally, in the present, find the seeds for the future you wish to achieve and develop those seeds. For example, perhaps the future you envision demands you develop some capabilities or acquire some resources? Next, to get the ball rolling you must set priorities and manage your time. You should start each morning by asking yourself, “What are the one or two most important tasks for today?” This allows you to prioritize those things and ignore unimportant distractions, resulting in important headway each day. As soon as it’s possible, you should test your idea. Make a prototype and present it to others before your idea is even fully developed. This lets you gather feedback from others and refine your assumptions about what direction the project should take. Remember, though: prototypes are not meant to be successes, they’re merely meant to teach you things, so embrace all kinds of feedback. If you have multiple ideas for projects to pursue, you need to decide which one you’ll prototype first. To make this choice, you must ask yourself three questions: Does it matter to the people involved? Is it a new idea? Can it be done quickly and on a small scale? If the answer to all three is “yes,” then that project is a strong candidate to be prototyped. Such projects will likely attract lots of supporters, making it more likely to be successful. Next, you’ll find out how exactly the U-process can be used to lead a group to solve a real-world problem. In a rural area near Frankfurt, emergency care services had been in a bad way. Both doctors and patients felt unhappy with how cold and mechanical the approach to care was, where patients were treated as mere biological machines that were broken and needed to be fixed. To help reform this system, the author moderated a meeting between physicians and patients, structured around the U-process. First, he led the group down the U by asking them to really talk to each other and listen to what everyone had to say. He managed to draw people into first-person stories told by others so they better understood the big picture. Quickly all groups realized that they actually shared the same problem. Once at the bottom of the U, the group began coming up with ideas together. They moved away from polite conversation and into a genuine dialog and collaborative problem-solving. This intense dialog allowed them to access their blind spot, and they realized that they all shared a similar vision of the solution to their problems: physicians acting more like lifestyle coaches than healthcare-dispensing machines. Finally, the author led the group back up the U to make a concrete implementation plan and put it into action. Based on the ideas they had generated, the group prototyped and then institutionalized a new, cheaper, more effective emergency care process. Today, emergency calls are transferred to a central call center instead of individual doctors, increasing efficiency and reducing the workload of some doctors. Rather than treating every emergency call as an emergency, physicians are now able to also provide counseling, comfort or a home visit as needed. This has resulted in more satisfied patients and more satisfied physicians, as the process has a human touch to it. This illustrates how effective leaders can use the U process on an organizational level to come up with new, innovative solutions to problems and then implement them rapidly. The key message in this book: To counter the challenges of tomorrow, future leaders cannot simply learn from the past. They must learn from the future as it emerges, and this means they need to tap into their blind spot: the source of all their creativity, where their past and future selves meet. To reach their blind spot, leaders can use the U-process, which leads them down to discover great ideas, and then brings them back up so they can be implemented.  Actionable advice: Start your days with silence. Make time in your mornings to connect with your deep source of creativity by, for example, meditating in silence. During this time, don’t allow any outside stimulus like, the radio, the TV or the internet, to disturb you, as it kills the very inner silence you want to cultivate. Prioritize your day to make headway in important projects. The first thing you do each morning should be to ask yourself what the one or two most important things you want to get done during the course of the day are. Then ruthlessly prioritize those tasks. For example, ignore incoming messages until those tasks are done. This strategy means that every day you can at least be sure you got the tasks done that mattered the most, and thus made headway in your work.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Of course, relatively few of them will make it to the top, and most will finish a long way short of the billions they chase. Why do the businesses of some entrepreneurs make it while others don’t? Looking into the success of the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Think Like Zuck highlights the business practices of the most successful CEOs. By following this advice, you stand the best chance of rising above everyone else and becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg yourself. In these blinks you’ll discover why Mark Zuckerberg took things slowly at first; why it’s OK to sometimes “take inspiration” from your rivals; and why one company only hires happy staff. Say you want to launch a start-up. Should you look for the most up-and-coming industry? Or should you create a concept that caters to the biggest available market? Well actually, you should try a completely different approach, and let your passion drive you. After all, that’s exactly what Mark Zuckerberg did to build his phenomenal career. Even before Facebook, Zuckerberg’s passion for connecting people was evident. For instance, in the 1990s, he built a messaging system called “Zucknet” to connect computers at his parents’ house. While following his passion gave Zuckerberg his career direction, there was also another benefit to it: Consider the fact that in the beginning, Facebook wasn’t so different from Myspace and Friendster. However, since Zuckerberg’s passion was all about socially connecting people online, his product best matched what people actually wanted – allowing it to ultimately trounce rivals. The lesson here is that when you follow your own passion, there’s no harm in “stealing” inspiration from elsewhere, because your idea will naturally stand out on its own. Another advantage of following your passion is that you’re more likely to be persistent – that is, you won’t give up, even when you fail. For instance, before Zuckerberg founded Facebook, he created “Facemash,” a social platform that allowed users to compare and rate photos of Harvard students. However, since the site used photos of students without permission, it was shut down by Harvard’s disciplinary board. Even though Zuckerberg failed, since he was driven by passion, he was able to persist. It’s worth noting that although Zuckerberg’s passion was vital, his ability to act also played a huge role in his success. Because after all, no matter how much you love something, if you don’t act on it, you won’t succeed. But luckily, you can overcome inaction by remembering the message on a poster located in Facebook’s headquarters. It reads, “Done is better than perfect.” Beyond a passion, the successful entrepreneur also has a mission – a personal goal – and he won’t give up until it’s accomplished. The entrepreneur’s mission will define the company’s mission, and this has huge consequences. After all, an inspiring mission can convert customers into loyal followers, which is a major advantage for any company that wants to stand out in the marketplace. For example, even though Apple sets higher prices and has a smaller market share than competitors, it’s still massively successful, partly due to its inspiring mission to create products that challenge the conventional and encourage people to “Think Different.” Because many customers identify with this bold message, they flock to buy the company’s products. And while a mission is a great way to differentiate your company, there’s another benefit: Seeing your company as more than a business can improve your chances of succeeding in the long term. That’s the case for Mark Zuckerberg, whose mission for Facebook was “to make the world more open and connected.” That’s why whenever he received an offer to sell Facebook, he declined: he felt that his mission was still incomplete! And in fact, this mind-set figures into one of Facebook’s most famous slogans: “The journey is only one percent finished.” And in addition to serving as a crucial guidepost for the founder, the company and customers, the mission also plays a key role in motivating employees. Because ultimately, highly skilled professionals who don’t care about the project won’t do a job as well as less experienced employees who deeply care about the mission. This principle is evident at Threadless, a successful company that prints designs by unknown artists on T-shirts. The CEO prefers to hire people that lack experience but share his vision – that is, giving artists a platform for their work – over those with impressive experience but a lack of enthusiasm about the mission. As discussed in the previous blink, someone who loves their work will be a better employee than someone who doesn’t. And entrepreneurs have to remember that if they want to hire the right people. So how do you hire the right people? Well, start by defining your company’s culture. Because if you want to find employees who share your core values, you have to understand what those core values are. That’s what the leadership at Zappos, a top online retailer, did when they created quirky slogans to encapsulate the company’s core values: For instance, “deliver wow through service” or “create fun and a little weirdness.” And to ensure all new hires match these values, Zappos tests its candidates by asking them, for example, to evaluate how lucky they are, on a scale from one to ten. Zappos automatically filters out all pessimists – that is, anyone who rates themselves below a seven. If this process seems overly elaborate, remember that the choices you make during the hiring process will make or break your business. To that end, one of the reasons Zappos cares so much about the recruitment process is because the CEO once calculated that the company lost more than $100 million due to bad hiring decisions. But even when you’ve hired the right people, there’s still more to do to ensure that your employees love their jobs and perform optimally: You have to treat your team well and prioritize their happiness. After all, if you take care of your workers, they will take care of the customers in the same way. Companies therefore need to establish an atmosphere of trust, and to make the company feel like a fun place to work. To that end, Facebook’s offices are equipped with music and gaming equipment, thus allowing workers to take a break and relax. Facebook started out as a 19-year-old college kid’s coding project, but it eventually became an indispensable communication tool. How did that happen? Well, the key to Facebook’s success is that it has always focused on great product and user experience. And in fact, great product should be the centerpiece of any business strategy, something you never compromise on. In other words, ensuring that your product matches (or exceeds) customer expectations should underpin every business decision you make. For example, when Facebook started to grow, Mark Zuckerberg ensured the expansion happened slowly and carefully, so that the company could cope with new demands. So at first, Facebook was only available to Harvard students; Zuckerberg didn’t open the service to other universities until there was enough server capacity. However, although you need to be careful to keep the quality of the product high, that’s only one piece of the puzzle: You also need to be innovative – that is, you need to constantly look for new ways of making your product better. Since innovation is such a crucial factor with regards to product quality, employees should be encouraged to think differently. To that end, consider Facebook’s philosophy to “move fast and break things.” Piggybacking on this principle, the company hosts internal hackathons for developers to come up with new ideas – and this very process has helped lead to many great Facebook features, such as Timeline, Chat and even the Like button! However, the hackathon model doesn’t just produce innovation, it also teaches employees a crucial lesson: Not all new ideas work the first time, and failure is OK. Because ultimately, sometimes you need to fail lots of times in order to succeed spectacularly. For example, James Dyson made 5,127 prototypes before he finally got it right and invented a bagless vacuum cleaner that became a bestselling product in Britain and a market leader in the United States. The best teams are made up of people with different skills. For instance, every great football team has a combination of defenders, midfielders and strikers. Not surprisingly, this model also translates to great leadership teams. And of course – like any great football team – the most successful leadership teams don’t merely have different skills, they have complementary capabilities and experience. So in that sense, a good business team would combine a visionary (someone with great ideas and innovative zeal) with a builder (someone with great organizational skills and business savvy). This balance ensures that the mission stays in focus while the operational part of the business continues to be developed. For example, since Sheryl Sandberg (“the builder”) became COO at Facebook, Zuckerberg (“the visionary”) can focus all his attention on what he’s best at: Building products and company vision. Meanwhile, Sandberg has lots of experience in business development (an area Zuckerberg doesn’t excel in), which she can bring to the table to optimize Facebook’s operations. It’s worth noting that creating this balance of employees has a purpose: It’s a way of multiplying the company’s chances of success. After all, if your team includes many different areas of knowledge and expertise, you’ll be able to examine problems and opportunities from many different angles. And that’s exactly what happened when Steve Wozniak showed his first invention, the personal computer, to his friend Steve Jobs. Wozniak was so proud of his creation, he was ready to give it away for free, for the good of all! However, Jobs – who possessed an inordinate amount of business savvy – saw an opportunity for the two friends to create their own company. And that’s how Apple Computers was born: Wozniak created an innovation and Jobs figured out how to turn it into a business. The key message in this book: The most successful businesses are run by passionate leaders who have a purpose, build powerful alliances and focus on creating innovative, high quality products. Actionable advice: Don’t settle for anything you aren’t passionate about.  It can be easy to fall into a project or a job you don’t actually care about, just because you think you ought to. But don’t give up on your passion. Instead, keep looking until you find something that truly inspires you. Trust us, you’ll know when you’ve found it!

Jones","summary":"Having a career used to mean working for the same employer for many years, gradually advancing to the top. But times have changed. Modern careers are unpredictable, and most of us will have many jobs in the course of our lifetime. That means that it’s more important than ever to learn to negotiate change by becoming resilient and adaptable. Some people have a knack for these skills, but it’s up to the rest of us to learn them. Those who do, usually end up with a very particular mind-set – they think like an entrepreneur, seeking out new opportunities and coming up with new ideas. And they act like CEOs, taking responsibility, planning ahead and staying grounded in their core values. Beverly E. Jones presents a collection of 50 tips for cultivating both. The following blinks distill some of the best, with a focus on learning to manage crucial points of career changes like a pro. In these blinks, you’ll learn: why you need to have a plan on day one; why it’s crucial to keep it classy when you’re on your way out the door; and why rejecting a compliment is a missed opportunity. New beginnings are exciting, but a strong start requires more than just a positive outlook, something the author, Beverly E. Jones, learned the hard way. On her first day at a Washington law firm 30 years ago, she faced a surprisingly chilly reception. A senior partner even told her that he didn’t see why his colleagues had hired her. She would need to prove herself to get work inside the firm, he told her. She spent her first day with nothing to do – no one offered her any work, and she hadn’t prepared anything for herself. Things quickly got better, partly because she learned something from the disaster of the first day right away: no one else was going to make her successful – she had to do it herself. On day two, she had already begun planning ways to keep busy, manage clients and make others inside the firm aware of what she could do. These days, an employer would probably do a better job of onboarding you to a new job. But creating your own plan for success is still crucial, and a few tricks can help. Figure out what your boss wants. Keep an eye on her schedule, how she prefers to communicate, and what she needs to keep her bosses happy. How does she typically share information with both subordinates and superiors? Don’t expect to be told these things. As you start to settle in, set yourself realistic objectives that you can work toward in the short term. Prioritizing and achieving goals will help keep you on the right track. High-priority items can be included in this, but so can small, achievable things like scheduling introductory meetings with new colleagues. Put in an intense effort for four to six weeks, giving an extraordinary amount of focus to kickstarting your new endeavor. Clear your calendar to focus on work – it won’t be sustainable for the long term, but it doesn’t need to be. Set a deadline for transitioning back into a more normal life, satisfied that the intense work you’ve put in is a worthwhile upfront investment. This step isn’t likely to be easy but, as the CEO of your own career, laying the groundwork for future success is crucial. Meanwhile, keep an eye on your stress as you adjust to a new and unfamiliar environment. Take responsibility for managing this and be sure that you invest time in a fitness program that will help you stay cool-headed and energetic. The only person who can keep you healthy and functioning at your best is you. When Jones began working at her first law firm, it became clear that the successful lawyers were the ones who cultivated their own clients, behaving in effect like entrepreneurs within the larger firm. She learned to do likewise, which also meant marketing herself, doing plenty of billable work and keeping an eye on the bottom line by making sure that she brought in enough money to cover what it cost the firm to employ her. Over time, she realized that every large organization is a collection of small outfits. And those small outfits thrive when individual employees cultivate an entrepreneurial mind-set. There’s even a term for those who do this – intrapreneur. An intrapreneur takes initiative by handling what needs to be done whether or not they’re asked to do so. Intrapreneurs have the get-up-and-go to follow through with “first draft” ideas until they’re polished, profitable products. Anyone can cultivate an intrapreneurial mind-set, bringing a whole new vitality to an existing job. To do so, first, make sure that you understand the larger mission of the organization for which you work. This is pivotal, as an intrapreneur needs to set their goals and make plans to achieve them, something that needs to be in accord with collective strategies. The same goes for practical matters – you should have a grasp of the basic functions of your business and a mental picture of how those operate in your workplace. Understand the roles played by marketing and sales divisions, for example, and also how human resources and public affairs fit into the picture. Focus on the people you’re working for – your customers. This means the people who buy the products you create, and also people like your boss or coworkers who rely on your work to do theirs. What do these people want and need? How do they think? Finally, get comfortable with an entrepreneur’s familiar friend – failure. Entrepreneurs who succeed get used to learning from failure, which means that fear of it never stops them from taking chances or striving to innovate. Start easing your fear of failure by seeking out situations where there’s no guarantee you’ll succeed. If you’re a terrible dancer, for example, try signing up for a dance class. Go through the experience, enjoy what you can and see how little there is to fear in not excelling. Rejection is a rite of passage for people who strive for greatness, and yet most of us still struggle with it. Take Paul, one of the author's clients. He was turned down for his dream job despite being a highly qualified, high-achieving professional. He knew that he compared favorably to his main competition for the job, and he felt confident about his chances of being selected. When he found out that he hadn’t been chosen, Paul reported to the author that, aside from feeling intensely frustrated, he also felt angry about his frustration. These emotions, he thought, were not only unbecoming – they simply weren’t the right way to handle rejection. One of the techniques the author taught Paul was to take a closer look at his feelings through writing. At the author’s suggestion, he made notes about what he was experiencing, trying to describe things precisely. He distanced himself from the emotion by taking a detailed look at the pain he suffered. Another writing-based strategy that can help with rejection is to keep a gratitude journal, which helps tamp down negative thinking. Listing the things that you’re grateful about for just a few minutes each day can already have a big effect. For one thing, it helps keep worries at bay – feeling gratitude lessens activity in the part of the brain associated with anxiety. Finally, a game face and a gracious attitude can both help keep doors open in the future. In Paul’s case, it helped to talk honestly about his disappointment, and he was able to discuss with people like his partner and good friends, who supported him and helped him keep things in perspective. But it was equally important to maintain a professional demeanor with the rest of the world. Despite his disappointment, Paul made a point of thanking the people involved in the hiring process. This paid dividends later on when one of them reached out to him later on and helped him get a job that suited him even better than the one on which he’d missed out! Paul’s decisions helped him to be more resilient and find the silver lining in a tough setback. And he did so while taking responsibility for his process as a CEO would. That helped him to not just get through his tough spot, but to build up his capacity for handling similar challenges in the future. It’s hard to build something in the middle of change. But like it or not, change happens – transitions, mergers, acquisitions and liquidations are all part of the landscape in the professional world. One of the author’s mentees, Andrea, is an expert at surviving and thriving in uncertain times. Some of her tips will keep you from freezing up when change is blowing in. For one thing, Andrea is always ready for change because she thinks like a CEO. That means she’s focused on the big picture, making sure that she understands her industry and the factors that affect it. This means keeping an eye on the market she works in, the regulatory framework of her industry, changes in the political environment and innovations on the horizon. Knowing all this helps Andrea see change coming and be prepared when it arrives. Seeing the big picture also keeps her from thinking that change is all about her, rather than what it is – temporary and impersonal. This means that instead of getting upset and resorting to complaining, she can stay focused on dealing with the situation at hand. Staying on an even keel is even easier when you’ve cultivated stability in your life outside of work. For Andrea, this means balancing her busy work schedule with staying active in her church and connected to friends, family and mentors. It also means avoiding financial pressure, which would make losing her job a disaster. Following Andrea’s example means thinking twice about big expenditures, like a large house. It can also mean developing avenues for additional income – perhaps something like part-time work or consulting – which further reduce financial pressure. Building an emergency fund can have the same effect, letting you know that you have a safety net. There’s another benefit to this, too. The author has noticed that clients who start a new side enterprise often bring fresh energy to their main job. What better way to boost your capacity for entrepreneurial thinking than starting something yourself? Let’s face it – taking a compliment can be tough. The author used to believe that modesty was the polite response to praise. As a young professional, she even downplayed her work if someone praised it, saying that it was nothing, or that credit belonged elsewhere. But brushing aside a compliment can devalue your accomplishments. The complimenter might believe you when you say “no big deal,” leading them to reassess the value of what you’ve done. It also robs you both of an opportunity – after all, a compliment is more than just a positive assessment. It’s also an enjoyable moment that makes both people feel good, so chances are that the person approaching you with a compliment is feeling positive about it. By rejecting her praise, you’re knocking the wind out of her sails rather than reinforcing her good mood. You’re also denying yourself the benefit of a compliment, which is like a little reward for your brain. What’s more, research has shown that it’s a reward that will boost your performance – if you accept it! Using feedback to connect professionally is a vital element to thinking like an entrepreneur – one that will keep you from feeling isolated as you operate independently. So be sure that you can take on board whatever positivity that connection offers you! The good news is that handling praise gracefully can be learned. There are five basic steps. First, accept the compliment. Even if it’s difficult, and you feel like you don’t deserve it, start by saying “thank you.” Then show your satisfaction with the work. It’s not immodest to extend the pleasant moment that starts when you say “thanks.” You can always acknowledge that you’re happy with how your work came out by saying, for example, that you’re proud of the outcome. The flip side to taking pride in your contribution, of course, is to remember to include others. Don’t forget to pass the credit around to those who helped make things happen. If it was really a team effort, acknowledge it as such. Then give something back, if you can be sincere about it. Fake praise does no one any good. But if the person giving the compliment played a part in your success, mention something about that. When the exchange runs its course, don’t prolong it. If the compliments continue past a comfortable point, there’s nothing wrong with lightly cutting things off – say you’re about to blush, for example, and move on. As a teenager, the author had a serious tea-drinking habit, and she always added lots of sugar. She knew it was unhealthy, but drinking tea without that added sweetness seemed impossible. One day, inspiration struck, and she removed a few grains of sugar from a heaping spoonful. In the days that followed, she removed a few more. Over the course of a year, she gradually reduced the amount of sugar on her spoon until she could drink sugarless tea. The Sugar Grain Principle of incremental change has been helping her achieve things ever since, and it eventually led to the Sugar Grain Process, the author’s five-step process for tackling career change. The first step is to visualize the career you want – just as the author visualized drinking tea without sugar. List the things you’d like to see in the next chapter of your career, starting with the pros and cons of what you’re presently doing. Next, define some general, achievable goals that will bring you closer to your wish list – things like “manage stress better” or “hone technical expertise.” Three goals are generally realistic to start with. Third, try to think of some “sugar grains” for each goal – small items that will lead you in the right direction. Don’t call these “steps” – the point isn’t that they form a direct path, but rather that they help you get active and build momentum. One grain often leads to another, so be open to that. If the first grain is attending a function, and you meet someone inspiring there, the next might be to get in touch with that person. The fourth step is setting your pace. Knowing what you want to accomplish should give you an idea of how fast you’ll need to move; if your goal isn’t time-sensitive then there’s no rush and one sugar grain a week might be plenty. What’s important is that you pick a pace and stick to it – the process works because you commit to keeping a steady and consistent pace. Finally, keep a record of the process. That’ll help you mark your progress, and you’ll probably find that examining your record will offer novel insights and new ideas for sugar grains. Eventually, you’ll find that the process and the nimble, entrepreneurial mind-set that it encourages are building their own momentum – you may even miss your sugar grains once you reach your goal! One of the author’s consulting clients, “Bill,” was let go from his law firm with little notice and a small severance payment. A group he was part of had quit the firm and taken their clients with them. In the resulting turmoil, Bill was fired. Bill was shocked and angry, but he also took the time to look at things objectively. He didn’t know colleagues outside of his former group well, so most would probably only remember him for having been laid off. Determined to change that, he contacted leaders and staff at the firm and found a way to thank them for anything he could without being insincere – things like training they’d given him, or their contributions to a positive work environment. Then, over the years, he did his best to stay in touch. These actions changed the impression of him that lingered after he’d gone, to such great effect that one day he was even re-hired as a partner! Leaving a good impression on the way out is something anyone can do, and it’s just the kind of quick pivot in a tough situation that exemplifies the behavior of a CEO. Learning to do this starts with a few simple strategies: First, let your boss know right away when you’ve committed to a new opportunity. It may be uncomfortable to break the news, but it’s better to do it before she hears things secondhand. On the way out, don’t be overly frank. Everyone fantasizes about saying what they really think on the way out the door, but it’s more important to end things on a good note. Even in an exit interview, it pays to watch what you say – you can’t always count on word not getting around. When it comes to your actual work, tie things up neatly. Finish things or get them as close to completion as possible. Leave detailed notes that will help your successor or your coworkers take over your responsibilities. Then take time to thank people. Consider those who have helped you or contributed to your success, and let them know. Be honest and as specific as possible. Handwritten notes are a great way to do this, as is a personal visit. Finally, make it possible to stay in contact. Make sure your contact information is widely known and connect with people on LinkedIn while there’s still time. If you want to keep in touch with people in the future, don’t leave it to chance. The key message in these blinks: Careers are no longer “one size fits all,” and most of us will have our fair share of departures and fresh starts in the course of our working lives. That means it’s vital that we get comfortable with change and learn to be resilient to anything that comes our way, as well as being nimble when we recognize opportunity. An entrepreneurial mind-set and a CEO’s resolve can help us ensure that, no matter what the situation, we’re grounded and prepared for anything, making the most of the opportunities at our disposal. Actionable advice: Do a little something every day. Once you have a goal, don't wait until you've got a master plan to start working toward it. Instead, take small steps every day – regular action will help you get the ball rolling. You can always let a plan form once you’ve got some momentum going. Got feedback?

Whether it’s what to study, which job to apply for or which house to buy, the outcomes of our decisions rely on many other factors. It’s simply not possible to know every single relevant variable when we make up our minds. Like poker, life-changing decisions are largely based on luck. But calling it all “luck” is a bit disingenuous – it’s more like a game of probabilities. What’s more, the decisions we make are linked to the ways our brains are neurologically wired. So what can you control? Well, probably more than you think. With lessons grounded in poker and cognitive psychology, these blinks explain how it all starts with thinking in bets. You’ll find out why hard-luck stories are a waste of time; why car accidents are always someone else’s fault; and how time travel might be our best tool for making decisions. Super Bowl XLIX ended in controversy. With 26 seconds left in the game, everyone expected Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll to tell his quarterback, Russell Wilson, to hand the ball off. Instead, he told Wilson to pass. The ball was intercepted, the Seahawks lost the Super Bowl, and, by the next day, public opinion about Carroll had turned nasty. The headline in the Seattle Times read: “Seahawks Lost Because of the Worst Call in Super Bowl History”! But it wasn’t really Carroll’s decision that was being judged. Given the circumstances, it was actually a fairly reasonable call. It was the fact that it didn’t work. Poker players call this tendency to confuse the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome resulting, and it’s a dangerous tendency. A bad decision can lead to a good outcome, after all, and good decisions can lead to bad outcomes. No one who’s driven home drunk has woken up the next day and seen it as a good decision just because they didn’t get into an accident. In fact, decisions are rarely 100 percent right or wrong. Life isn’t like that. Life is like poker, a game of incomplete information – since you never know what cards the other players are holding – and luck. Our decision-making is like poker players’ bets. We bet on future outcomes based on what we believe is most likely to occur. So why not look at it this way? If our decisions are bets, we can start to let go of the idea that we’re 100 percent “right” or “wrong,\" and start to say, “I’m not sure.” This opens us up to thinking in terms of probability, which is far more useful. Volunteering at a charity poker tournament, the author once explained to the crowd that player A’s cards would win 76 percent of the time, giving the other player a 24 percent chance to win. When player B won, a spectator yelled out that she’d been wrong. But, she explained, she’d said that player B’s hand would win 24 percent of the time. She wasn’t wrong. It was just that the actual outcome fell within that 24 percent margin. We all want to make good decisions. But saying, “I believe X to be the best option” first requires good-quality beliefs. Good-quality beliefs are ideas about X that are informed and well thought-out. But we can’t expect to form good-quality beliefs with lazy thinking. Instead, we have to be willing to do some work in the form of truth-seeking. That means we have to strive for truth and objectivity, even when something doesn’t align with the beliefs we hold. Unfortunately, truth-seeking runs contrary to the ways we’re naturally wired. For our evolutionary ancestors, questioning new beliefs could be dangerous, so it was low priority. If you hear a lion rustling in the grass, for example, you’re less likely to stop and analyze the situation objectively, and more likely to just run! When language developed, we could communicate things that our own senses had never experienced, leading to the ability to form abstract beliefs. This ability worked via our old belief-forming methods, though, and questioning remained something we did after belief-forming and only infrequently. In 1993, Harvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert and his colleagues conducted experiments showing that this tendency to believe is still with us. In the experiments, participants read statements color-coded as either true or false. Later, they were asked to remember which statements were true and which were false. But this time, they were distracted so as to increase their cognitive load and make them more prone to mistakes. In the end, the subjects’ tendency was to simply believe that statements had been true – even those that had “false” color-coding. And as easily as beliefs are formed, they’re equally hard to change. When we believe something, we try to reinforce it with motivated reasoning. That is, we seek out evidence that confirms our belief, and ignore or work against anything contradictory. After all, everyone wants to think well of themselves, and being wrong feels bad. So information that contradicts our beliefs can feel like a threat. The good news is, we can work around our tendencies with a simple phrase: “Wanna bet?\"If we were betting on our beliefs, we’d work a lot harder to confirm their validity. If someone bets you $100 that a statement you made was false, it changes your thinking about the statement right away. It triggers you to look more closely at the belief in question, and motivates you to be objectively accurate. This isn’t just about money. Whenever there’s something riding on the accuracy of our beliefs, we’re less likely to make absolute statements and more likely to validate those beliefs. Focusing on accuracy and acknowledging uncertainty is a lot more like truth-seeking, which gets us beyond our resistance to new information and gives us something better on which to bet. The best way to learn is often by reviewing our mistakes. Likewise, if we want to improve our future outcomes, we’ll have to do some outcome fielding. Outcome fielding is looking at outcomes to see what we can learn from them. Some outcomes we can attribute to luck and forget about – they were out of our control anyway. It’s the outcomes that seem to have resulted primarily from our decisions that we should learn from. After analyzing those decisions, we can refine and update any beliefs that led to our initial bet. Here’s an example: A poker player who has just lost a hand needs to quickly decide whether it was luck or her own poker-playing skill that was responsible. If it was skill, then she needs to figure out where her decision-making went wrong so she doesn't repeat the mistake. Most outcomes result from a mix of skill, luck, and unknown information. That’s why we often make errors in our fielding. Knowing how much of each is involved is tricky. Plus we’re all subject to self-serving bias. We like to take credit for good outcomes and blame bad outcomes on something or someone else. For example, social psychologist and Stanford law professor Robert MacCoun examined accounts of auto accidents. In multiple-vehicle accidents, he found that drivers blamed someone else 91 percent of the time. And 37 percent of the time they still refused responsibility when only a single vehicle was involved. We can try to circumvent self-serving bias by looking at other people’s outcomes. But in that case, it just operates in reverse: we blame their successes on luck and their failures on bad decisions. Chicago Cubs fan Steve Bartman found this out the hard way in 2003 when he accidentally deflected a fly ball from Cubs left fielder Moises Alou. The Cubs lost the game and Bartman became the subject of angry fans’ harassment and even violence for more than a decade. But why was Bartman held responsible? He tried to catch the ball, just as lots of other fans did. But Bartman had the bad luck of deflecting it. The world saw the other fans’ good outcome, that is, not touching the ball was a result of their good decision not to intervene. Whereas Bartman’s bad outcome was all his fault. Phil Ivey is one of the best poker players in the world. He’s admired by his peers and has been incredibly successful in every type of poker. One big reason for this? Phil Ivey has good habits. Habits work in neurological loops that have three parts: cue, routine and reward. As Pulitzer-prize-winning reporter Charles Duhigg points out in his book The Power of Habit, the key to changing a habit is to work with this structure, leaving the cue and reward alone but changing the routine. Let’s say you want to minimize your self-serving bias in poker, but your habit is to win a hand (cue), attribute it to your skill (routine) and feed your positive image of yourself (reward). You might try attributing each win to a combination of luck and skill in order to change the habit. But how do you then get that boost to your self-image? Instead of feeling good about being a winning poker player, you can feel good about being a player who’s good at identifying your mistakes, accurately fielding your outcomes, learning and making decisions. That’s where Phil Ivey excels. His poker habits are built around truth-seeking and accurate outcome fielding rather than self-serving bias. The author mentions a 2004 poker tournament in which Ivey mopped the floor with his competitors, then spent a celebratory dinner afterward picking apart his play and seeking opinions about what he might have done better. Unfortunately, most of us don’t have habits as good as Phil Ivey’s, but that doesn’t mean we can’t work with what we’ve got. One way we can improve the way we field outcomes is to think about them in terms of – you guessed it – bets. Let’s say we got into a car accident on an icy stretch of road. It might be that we were unlucky, that’s all. But would that explanation satisfy you if you had to bet on it? Chances are, you’d start to consider other explanations, just to be sure. Maybe you were driving too fast, or maybe you should have pumped your brakes differently. Once the stakes are raised, we start to look into the causes a little more seriously, to help us move beyond self-serving bias and become more objective. As a fringe benefit, this exploration also makes us look at things with a little more perspective. We start to see explicitly that outcomes are a mixture of luck and skill. Despite our hard-wired tendencies, this forces us to be a little more compassionate when evaluating the other peoples’ – and our own – outcomes. We’ve all got blind spots, which makes truth-seeking hard. But it’s a little easier when we enlist the help of a group. After all, others can often pick out our errors more easily than we can. But to be effective, a group dedicated to examining decisions isn’t like any other. It has to have a clear focus, a commitment to objectivity and open-mindedness, and a clear charter that all members understand. The author was lucky early in her career to be brought into a group like this, made up of experienced poker players who helped each other analyze their play. Early on, poker legend Erik Seidel made the group’s charter clear when, during a break in a poker tournament, the author tried to complain to him about her bad luck in a hand. Seidel shut her down, making it crystal clear that he had no interest. He wasn’t trying to be hurtful, he said, and he was always open to strategy questions. But bad-luck stories were just a pointless rehashing of something out of anyone’s control. If she wanted to seek the truth with Seidel and his group, she would have to commit to objectivity, not moaning about bad luck. She did, and over time, this habituated her to working against her own biases, and not just in conversations with the group. Being accountable to committed truth-seekers who challenged each other’s biases made her think differently, even when they weren’t around. In a decision-examining group committed to objective accuracy, this kind of change is self-reinforcing. Increasing objectivity leads to approval within the group, which then motivates us to strive for ever-greater accuracy by harnessing the deep-seated need for group approval that we all share. Seeking approval doesn’t mean agreeing on everything, of course. Dissent and diversity are crucial in objective analysis, keeping any group from being more than an echo chamber. Dissent helps us look more closely at our beliefs. That’s why the CIA has “red teams,\" groups responsible for finding flaws in analysis and logic and arguing against the intelligence community’s conventional wisdom. And as NYU’s professor Jonathan Haidt points out, intellectual and ideological diversity in a group naturally produces high-quality thinking. Shared commitment and clear guidelines help define a good-quality decision-examining group. But once you’ve got that group, how do you work within it? You can start by giving each other CUDOS. CUDOS are the brainchild of influential sociologist Merton R. Schkolnick, guidelines that he thought should shape the scientific community. And they happen also to be an ideal template for groups dedicated to truth-seeking. The C in CUDOS stands for communism. If a group is going to examine decisions together, then it’s important that each member shares all relevant information and strives to be as transparent as possible to get the best analysis. It’s only natural that we are tempted to leave out details that make us look bad, but incomplete information is a tool of our bias. U stands for universalism – using the same standards for evaluating all information, no matter where it came from. When she was starting out in poker, the author tended to discount unfamiliar strategies used by players that she’d labeled as “bad.” But she soon suspected that she was missing something and started forcing herself to identify something that every “bad” player did well. This helped her learn valuable new strategies that she might have missed and understand her opponents much more deeply. D is for disinterestedness and it’s about avoiding bias. As American physicist Richard Feynman noted, we view a situation differently if we already know the outcome. Even a hint of what happens in the end tends to bias our analysis. The author’s poker group taught her to be vigilant about this. But, teaching poker seminars for beginners, she would ask students to examine decision-making by describing specific hands that she’d played, omitting the outcome as a matter of habit. It left students on the edge of their seats, reminding them that outcomes were beside the point! “OS” is for organized skepticism, a trait that exemplifies thinking in bets. In a good group, this means collegial, non-confrontational examination of what we really do and don’t know, which keeps everyone focused on improving their reasoning. Centuries ago, the Catholic church put this into practice by hiring individuals to argue against sainthood during the canonization process – that’s where we get the phrase “devil’s advocate.” If you know that your group is committed to CUDOS, you’ll be more accountable to these standards in the future. And the future, as we’ll see, can make us a lot smarter about our decisions. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld describes himself as a “Night Guy.” He likes to stay up late at night and doesn’t worry about getting by on too little sleep. That’s Morning Jerry’s problem, not Night Jerry. No wonder Morning Jerry hates Night Jerry so much – Night Jerry always screws him over. It’s a funny description, but temporal discounting – making decisions that favor our immediate desires at the expense of our future self – is something we all do. Luckily, there are a few things we can do to take better care of our future selves. Imagining future outcomes is one. Imagined futures aren’t random. They’re based on memories of the past. That means that when our brains imagine what the future will be like if we stay up too late, they’re also accessing memories of oversleeping and being tired all day long, which might help nudge us into bed. We can also recruit our future feelings using journalist Suzy Welch’s “10-10-10.” A 10-10-10 brings the future into the present by making us ask ourselves, at a moment of decision, how we’ll feel about it in ten minutes, ten months and ten years. We imagine being accountable for our decision in the future and motivate ourselves to avoid any potential regret we might feel. And bringing the future to mind can also help us start planning for it. The best way to do this is to start with the future we’d like to happen and work backward from there. It’s a matter of perspective: the present moment and immediate future are always more vivid to us, so starting our plans from the present tends to make us overemphasize momentary concerns. We can get around this with backcasting, imagining a future in which everything has worked out, and our goals have been achieved, and then asking, “How did we get there?\" This leads to imagining the decisions that have led us to success and also recognizing when our desired outcome requires some unlikely things to happen. If that’s the case, we can either adjust our goals or figure out how to make those things more likely. Conversely, we can perform premortems on our decisions. Premortems are when we imagine that we’ve failed and ask, “What went wrong?\" This helps us identify the possibilities that backcasting might have missed. Over more than 20 years of research, NYU psychology professor Gabrielle Oettingen has consistently found that people who imagine the obstacles to their goals, rather than achieving those goals, are more likely to succeed. We’ll never be able to control uncertainty, after all. We might as well plan to work with it. The key message in these blinks: You might not be a gambler, but that’s no reason not to think in bets. Whether or not there’s money involved, bets make us take a harder look at how much certainty there is in the things we believe, consider alternatives and stay open to changing our minds for the sake of accuracy. So let go of “right” and “wrong” when it’s decision time, accept that things are always somewhat uncertain and make the best bet you can. Actionable advice: Try mental contrasting to make positive changes. If you want to reach a goal, positive visualization will only get you so far. In fact, research shows that mental contrasting – visualizing the obstacles that are keeping you from your goal – will be far more effective. So if you want to lose a few pounds, don’t picture yourself looking good on the beach. Instead, think about all the desserts to which you’ll struggle to say “no” – that’s much more likely to motivate you to do the hard work. Got feedback?

These blinks won’t teach how to tip a cow, but they will show you how we must overturn our “sacred cows,” virtues such as fairness, passion and perfectionism that we strive for everyday. The truth is, although these virtues may benefit us in many ways, they have to be used in moderation. For example, being fair to everyone can lead us to reward the weakest, less deserving members of our teams, to the annoyance of the best ones; perfection and fear of failure can keep us from innovating. These blinks will show you better ways to operate in business. In these blinks you’ll find out how far away Ritz-Carlton staff are told to stand from customers; why being passionate can be bad for your health; and why perfectionism is bad for your health. The desire to live in a fair world is hardwired into our brains. When we see someone experiencing an emotion, our brains mimic it. In fact, one study of this phenomenon showed that if you see someone getting an electric shock, your brain reacts as if you've been shocked. This natural tendency toward fairness isn't always a good thing, though. In our quest for fairness, we sometimes confuse it with sameness. We form empathetic connections with others, but sometimes project our own thoughts onto them. Have you ever caught yourself buying someone a gift that was actually something you wanted? When we want something, we often assume others want it too. In business, this conflation of fairness and sameness often leads people to make the mistake of treating every customer the same. We imagine our customers must all want the same things we want. This can make us accidentally shut out any customers who are different. So what's the better alternative? Well, you need to constantly remind yourself that everyone is different; strive to treat everyone as an individual. The Four Seasons hotel implements this doctrine well. It encourages employees to make their guests feel at home, and give them any service they desire. By contrast, the Ritz Carlton have specific rules; e.g., they have to stand at least ten feet away from all guests and greet them with, “How may I help you, [sir or ma'am]?” Of the two hotels, the Four Seasons has a higher customer satisfaction rate, and a growing market share. It may be because people prefer to be treated as individuals. “Balance” and “passion” are both buzz words in the self-help industry these days. Many people strive to be passionate at work, while balancing the different aspects of their life. This isn't really a healthy attitude, however. Consider the idea of “work/life balance.” People often think this means they should limit their daily working hours to spend more time at home. In many cases however, that only amounts to the person working at home rather than spending time with their family. Instead, be bolder with your balancing. Don't “balance” things by constantly making trade offs and compromises. Work hard at one important thing at the time. If you need to work, work. Don't compromise. When you need to spend time with your family, give them your full attention. In the long run, things will still balance out, and you'll be much happier and more productive. Obsessive passions can also lead to burnout and poor health. In fact, one study of professional dancers found a correlation between passion and chronic injuries. When the “passionate” dancers got injured, they just kept dancing and made their conditions worse, rather than taking the time they needed to recover. So don't become obsessed with your work. Practice harmonious passion instead. This means showing passion for the things that make you happy, even if they aren't your main focus in life. Serena Williams, for example, is one of the most successful tennis players in history, but she also has a great passion for fashion and nails. She's actually a qualified nail technician. She still devotes time to nails, even though it isn't the focus of her career. That balance makes her happier and healthier. Many people assume that excellence is the key to success. If you do each little thing perfectly – by keeping your desk tidy and delivering everything on time – your output will be perfect too. Actually, that isn't true. Aiming for excellence throughout the entire work process won't produce excellent results. If a leader pushes his team to be excellent at all times, the team will get worn out. The team members won't strive to be creative or think differently because they'll be afraid of imperfection. Demanding excellence at all times will ultimately prevent the team from making any serious progress. The key here is to understand that your end product should be excellent. The path to it, however, almost certainly won't be. Consider the success of the golfer Bubba Watson. He's won several majors, but his golf swing is far from perfect. He learned to golf from his father, not a professional coach. His imperfect training helped him develop a perfect technique. To ensure that your staff are freed from the pressures of excellency, lower the stakes. Don't overstate the importance of any single role. If a person feels like her role is absolutely vital to the team, she’ll be afraid of doing anything wrong, so she won't be creative. An experiment on a group of women in the American military illustrated how much the pressure of perfection can affect a team's performance. Participants in the study were tested on their ability to shoot. One group was told that the purpose of the experiment was to see why women were worse shooters than men. These women felt pressured not to let their gender down, and their results were worse than the control group. Pressure doesn't help people – it diminishes them. When you free your employees from pressure, they'll inevitably perform better. Our world is changing rapidly. People often assume that the more innovations they produce, the more successful they'll be. That’s a common fallacy, though. When you produce new things just for the sake of it, you're innovating for the wrong reasons. Narcissistic creativity is a case in point. Narcissistic creativity means wasting resources creating something that just shows off the company's skill, rather than filling an actual market need. Sony, for instance, has unleashed thousands of new products – like TVs, video games and music – in an attempt to outdo its rival, Apple. Apple's collection of products is tiny in comparison, yet the iPhone alone generates more revenue than Sony's entire annual sales. So instead of innovating for no reason, innovate sensibly. Here’s how: First, try rechanneling your creative energy. When you find a problem, you may be tempted to attack it with your full force of creativity. If you find a flaw in one of your products, you might want to design a new one. But take a step back – sometimes a small problem can be fixed with a simple tool. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. If you don't fully unleash your creative energy on each little thing, you'll save it for more important times. So wait until your innovation can produce something people really need. That's how you transform the market. Another way to be creative in a constructive way is to repurpose ideas. Use tools that already exist instead of struggling to come up with something completely groundbreaking. This is how Pinterest has become so successful. Pinterest simply repurposed the idea of the pin board, and put it online so people could collect interesting images and share them. This simple concept has allowed the site to experience huge success. Key message: The “sacred cows” aren't sacred at all, so don't let them hold you back. Re-examine your definitions of “fairness” and “balance”; let your process be imperfect, and only innovate when the time is right. When you stop following the sacred rules of business, your organization will prosper more. Actionable advice: Work and innovate when the time is right. When you need to devote yourself to your work, do it. Don't cut your work short, but also don't work when it's time for the other important things in your life, like family. Similarly, when you need to innovate, innovate. Don't innovate just for the sake of it – you'll only waste your creative energy. Save it for when it has the potential to yield something great.

Are you satisfied with results? Perhaps you feel your success is being hampered by hundreds of issues, like employee bickering or too much bureaucracy. Or maybe you feel like you need to reinvent the wheel just to survive the next few months. These blinks outline a step-by-step method to solving your business problems. The Entrepreneurial Operating System will help you weed out unnecessary processes in your organization and help you regain footing in your chosen market. Based on lessons learned through practice and experience, this system shows you how focusing on just six elements can help get your company back on track. So get your leadership team on board and take the first steps toward revitalizing your company by reading these blinks. In these blinks, you’ll learn why trying to please everyone is a bad idea; why one is the magic number when it comes to responsibility; and why a company needs “rocks” to thrive. When we reflect on Steve Jobs’s tenure at Apple, it’s clear his work inspired many people. After all, his goal was to build a company that didn’t just create technology but improved humanity. While the goal of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) isn’t as lofty, its powers shouldn’t be underestimated. This entrepreneurial tool is like an abbreviated business plan, seeking answers to a series of questions to get your company on track. It has six steps. The first is to define a vision for your company. Your vision will guide every other process and decision in your organization, which means that it needs to be crystal clear. It will define your organization, where it goes and how it gets there. Beyond that, your vision needs to be understood and shared by everyone in the organization. If it isn’t, your employees won’t move or act in concert. Finding a vision begins by defining what you want to be like as an organization. To do so, have your leadership team identify two things: your core values and your core focus. Your core values are three to seven fundamental principles by which your company is guided. For example, among the core values of American restaurant chain Zoup! Fresh Soup Company are a “can do” attitude and a passion for the company’s brand. These values determine who the company hires as well as how it handles staff, clients and business partners. Once you’ve defined your core values, you can move to your core focus by defining what your company seeks to provide. Or, to put it another way, which needs your company wants to satisfy. Why is defining this focus important? Let’s look at laser printer service and supply company, Image One. The company faced problems when it expanded its business into computer networking. Amid the turmoil, company executives reminded themselves of Image One’s core focus: to simplify the printing environment of its clients. So they decided to ditch the computer division and stick to their core focus. Ever since, the company has thrived, experiencing an annual average growth rate of 30 percent. Imagine you’re planning an around-the-world getaway. You’re probably thinking about which cities to visit, how to pack in smaller attractions and, of course, how to get around. When developing a business plan, you need to consider similar details. Ensure that your leadership team plans carefully what will be accomplished, when it will happen and how. To do so, brainstorm a ten-year target with your team. This is your company’s larger-than-life goal for where you want to be in ten years, crucial to defining your company’s overall direction. Next, suss out your three-year picture. This should describe which strategies you’ll use over the next three years to approach your ten-year target. Once you’ve done that, you can make a one-year plan that states what has to happen in the next 365 days. And finally, you should define your quarterly rocks. These are specific, attainable and measurable milestones you can reach within the next 90 days. After you’ve planned for the future, both near and far, you can decide on a marketing strategy. The first step is to ensure efficiency in how you win loyal customers. Remember, you can’t make everyone happy. Trying to do so might just end up frustrating loyal clients. This is why you need to define a target market and adapt your strategy to it. For instance, if you’re the owner of a small aquatics center, it’s not in your business interest to cater to both active children and stressed-out adults. The needs of the two customer bases are different, and you won’t be able to satisfy them both simultaneously. Having defined your target market, you should identify any issues that might affect your business. In the case of the aquatics center, for example, these might be rising energy costs or a similar business opening nearby. Being aware of these will help you address them ahead of time. Every good manager knows you’re only as strong as the people who work for you. This is why staff members are the second crucial component to organizational success. So how can you make sure you’re employing people who share your company’s values? Use the people analyzer! This chart allocates one column to each of your company’s core values and a row to each employee. To populate your chart, record which employees adhere to which core values with a plus mark for “most of the time,” a plus/minus for “sometimes” and a minus for “never.” Once you’ve collected this data, look for employees who exhibit most of your core values most of the time and all of your core values at least some of the time. While an employee might be growth oriented – a possible core value – that person might not always adhere to another value important to your company’s success, such as fairness. Having the right people on your team is key, but you also need to make sure people are in the right roles. The GWC (Get, Want, Capacity) chart helps you ensure all employees are doing jobs that are best suited to their skills. To use this chart, you ask three questions. Does the employee Get it – does she understand her role? Does she Want it – does she like the job? And does she have the Capacity, whether intelligence, experience or any other quality, to perform the job effectively? If your answer to any of these questions is “no,” then you know the person isn’t right for the job. Let’s say one of your most talented engineers is in line for a promotion to an executive position. He Gets it, knowing what the position entails; he has the Capacity to be a good executive, too. But there’s a problem, as he dreads meetings – he doesn’t Want it enough, and thus wouldn’t make a good executive. The third key to optimizing your business for success is good data management. Many people greet this term with contempt, but managing data doesn’t have to be a grueling task. In fact, keeping track of information crucial to your business is simple with a couple of easy-to-use tools. You can monitor and manage employee performance with a scorecard. Decide with your leadership team which performance factors – from five to 15 – to monitor and set a target goal for each, such as number of sales proposals given or new subscribers won. Define then who is responsible for reaching a given weekly target and, when someone doesn’t meet a goal, follow up to find out what happened. By tracking employee performance, you’ll be able to identify any issues early on. And by quantifying performance in this fashion, you can hold people accountable clearly and objectively and also trigger healthy competition. Yet what do you do if your scorecard indicates that your team is failing to meet its targets or is facing another problem? Here’s where the fourth key to managerial success comes in. It’s designed to help you identify important issues before they can harm your business. The name of the game is IDS, or identify, discuss and solve. Begin by listing everything that doesn’t work the way it should, making sure your staff is comfortable reporting any concerns. Then, approach the issues using the three steps stated above. First, identify what’s going on, bearing in mind that some issues might be symptoms of bigger problems. Then discuss, giving everyone on your team the chance to voice opinions about key issues and suggest ways to handle them. And finally, solve by deciding on solutions. Often you’ll solve an issue by assigning a concrete task to a particular person. When they complete this task, the issue should ideally disappear. Just like your vital organs power your body, core processes keep your company running smoothly. On average, companies have seven such areas, such as marketing, human relations and operations. These processes represent the fifth component of the Entrepreneurial Operating System. For your company to thrive, you need to identify, document and streamline them all. Here’s how. The first step is to have your leadership team list all the processes that are core to your business. Once your leadership team understands how these processes function within the company, they can begin working on ways to simplify them. Be sure that everyone on the team agrees with the list and uses the same names to refer to the different processes. Doing so will add clarity and simplify work moving forward. Once you’ve agreed on a list, have the people in charge of each process document each important step. For instance, the head of human resources might write down the steps she takes when recruiting, orienting or terminating employees. Next, you should review the process yourself. By taking a look at the steps team members have articulated, you’ll likely identify some that are redundant or discover areas that can be simplified, such as with technology. You might find that a department prints and files a paper copy of every company document, even though the same documents are saved and filed both in the cloud and on the company’s intranet servers. In this case, printing just creates extra work and adds cost. After you clarify redundancies, you can eliminate other unnecessary tasks, simplifying processes however you can. From there, the remaining task is to ensure that your processes line up with your company’s core values, the values you and your leadership team defined from the start. If one of your core values is family orientation, for example, you’ll want to not sell just family-friendly products but also provide family-friendly working conditions, such as offering paid family leave. Now that your processes are under control, it’s time to learn the final step of the Entrepreneurial Operating System. Remember the concept of “quarterly rocks” from an earlier blink? These small milestones help you realize your company’s greater goals. But for these rocks to be effective and lead you toward success, you need constantly to set new goals. To do so, meet quarterly with your leadership staff to review progress and set goals for the next quarter. Setting quarterly targets is effective, because 90 days is about as long as one person can remain focused on a single project. At the meeting, have your leadership team list everything that needs to be accomplished during the next quarter. Teams should generate around ten to 20 goals on average. Since this is far too many goals to realistically reach, the second step is to discuss ideas and whittle them down to seven top priority goals, or rocks. Rocks differ from goals in general in that they’re specific, attainable and measurable. For instance, one of your rocks might be to hire a new expert for human relations. Once you’ve chosen your top goals, make sure people are accountable for them. Assign each rock to a person on your leadership team who will be in charge of realizing it. It’s key that only one person be assigned to each rock; when multiple people are in charge, nobody feels responsible. After all your rocks have been assigned, each member of your team should set a personal rock. This can happen on a “rock sheet,” or diagram that lists company rocks and individual rocks. You can use this list at weekly meetings to monitor progress. By making clear the responsibilities of each leader, you’ll create maximum accountability. Finally, share the company’s rocks with every person in the organization and have each department generate rocks, too. Do this by inviting everyone to a quarterly meeting where you share new rocks and report on those from the previous quarter.   From here you can have departments and employees decide on one to three individual rocks in line with those of the company at large. The key message in this book: To gain traction in the market, you need to develop a clear and coherent plan for your business. But that’s not all. It’s also essential to have the right people in the right places, track data, streamline processes and account for any potential issues in your business.  Actionable advice: Keep meetings focused by shouting, “tangent alert!” Meetings and discussions go on too long because participants go off on tangents, or stray from the issue at hand. To prevent this, invite meeting participants to say “tangent alert!” when they notice a conversation is drifting. This will help your team stay focused and accomplish the meeting’s goals.

A great deal of a business’s success depends on how the employees work together. Every group of co-workers is a tribe. Each tribe has a tribal culture that’s expressed through the attitudes of its members. There are five stages of tribal culture, and tribes at the higher stages are more efficient and successful. Tribal Leadership will teach you how to identify those five stages, and become a tribal leader, so that you can guide your workplace tribe up the ladder, and enjoy greater success. You’ll also learn: how being too focused on outperforming your competitors can be counterproductive, how bringing your tribe to a higher stage can put you on the Fortune list of best companies to work for,    why the vice chair of CB Richard Ellis only talks to people in groups of three at business parties, and how you can move your whole tribe to a higher culture stage, one member at a time. People have formed groups throughout history, and for good reason: we need each other to survive. The workplace is no exception to this. It’s impossible to complete a large-scale project, for example, or launch a new product by yourself. To complete these goals we need help from other people, so we form tribes. What exactly is a tribe? It’s the social structure in which people operate. Tribes consist of 20 to 150 people, so a company that has over 150 employees is more like a big tribe comprised of smaller tribes. Also, there must be some social interaction between its members. Think of it this way: if you saw a member of your tribe walk by, you’d at least say hi to them. In all tribes, the members have different roles that serve different purposes. A group of people that all think and work the same way won’t succeed – tribe members have to work individually on some tasks but together toward the same goals. For example, consider the roles you’ll find in a small town. Every town has a police officer, a preacher, a librarian, etc. These roles are quite different, but the town needs them all to function properly. Tribes work in the same way. Forming a tribe is necessary for completing any large-scale project. No one could’ve built cathedrals or survived the Ice Age alone! Tribes are equally necessary for modern day goals like releasing a new medicine or editing and publishing a book. You’ll find tribes in all workplaces, as they are important and necessary in every field. Since tribes are so critical for completing any kind of sizable goal, it’s important to have a thorough understanding of how they work. They are an essential part of how we, as humans, operate. Have you noticed that some people are more hardworking than others? The same is true of tribes: some are more productive and function better. Each tribe has it’s own tribal culture, characterized by the members’ relationships and attitudes toward each other. The tribal culture results from the interactions between members, but it also influences the members in turn. To understand this, think of a class at school. A good class is one where most of the students perform well. But how do they perform well? By being in a good class. Even a “bad” student will probably start to improve if moved to a better class. The performance of the class as a whole depends on the students, but the students’ performance also depends on the class. In an office setting, the tribal culture works the same way. It influences the actions of individual employees. Over time, the employees unconsciously adopt the culture and mind-set of their fellow tribe members. So if an office has a lazy or apathetic culture as a whole, even an ambitious new member will become lazy eventually. So even if a tribe has some skilled employees, it won’t function well if it has an unproductive tribal culture. A workplace’s tribal culture is also characterized by its size. A tribe is bigger than a team, but smaller than the company as a whole. Realistically, a single team can’t determine the work process of an entire company, and the top management echelon of a company also can’t maintain a personal relationship with each of the employees. That’s where a tribe’s culture comes in: the tribal culture determines the mood of the employees, and how they handle their individual workload. Naturally, it’s critical to foster a good tribal culture if you want your workplace to succeed. But what is a “good” culture, anyway? Why are tribal cultures so important? Because they affect the entire tribe, and which stage the tribe reaches. There are five stages, and the lowest stages are the least productive. A tribe in stage one has a hostile environment. People with a stage one mind-set feel that life is cruel and unjust. They often believe they must be violent or hateful to survive. Only two percent of Americans have a stage one mind-set at their workplace, but many more do in society at large. For example, children from underprivileged backgrounds often have a stage one mind-set. If their family can’t afford a pair of shoes, they might steal them without guilt. They believe that life is unfair and they need to break rules in order to save themselves. If a tribe has a stage one tribal culture, it’s too hostile to function well. The mafia, for instance, typically consists of people with no regard for rules, and members often end up fighting each other. So if you’re an employer, don’t hire stage one employees. They won’t be loyal, and will take any opportunity to further their own interests at the expense of the company. Like stage one, stage two tribal cultures are also ineffective. Stage two is characterized by apathy: people with this mind-set don’t think that all life is awful, just that their life is awful. They don’t believe their situation can improve, so they avoid responsibility at all costs. This mind-set is more common: around 25 percent of American workplaces have a stage two culture. It occurs frequently in highly bureaucratic environments, where many people do dull, repetitive work in cubicles. They’ll likely cite the boss, system or their education as the reasons they can’t do something more creative. In stage two workplaces, employees won’t show initiative unless they have to. Thus, like stage one workplaces, they are quite unsuccessful. In the middle of the five stages of tribal cultures, we find stage three. Stage three is the most common mind-set, affecting 48 percent of American employees. Unfortunately, it is still negative and unhealthy. Stage three is characterized by selfishness and arrogance toward others. People with a stage three mind-set only care about their own interests. They’ll form two-sided bonds with other stage three people, but only if both sides directly benefit. A employee with a stage three mind-set probably feels quite lonely, largely because they often view their colleagues as incompetent or lazy. For example, a doctor once told the authors of this book that nurses are only nurses because they’re not smart or hard-working enough to be doctors. Consider how alone this doctor must feel: he thinks his colleagues lack the intelligence to appreciate his work, and aren’t as dedicated as he is. His stage three attitude and statement is not only unkind to his colleagues – it affects him negatively as well. A stage three tribal culture makes a workplace unproductive, because it prevents real cooperation between members. Individual employees might benefit at times in stage three, but good collaboration is necessary for any meaningful project to succeed, and stage three employers are usually too self-interested to collaborate well. Imagine that our stage three doctor wants to develop a new suturing method. If he doesn’t have enough confidence in his colleagues to delegate some responsibilities to them, he won’t have time to work on the suturing between his usual daily tasks. Completing a meaningful goal like that is quite difficult on your own – it requires help from others. A stage three mind-set can really hinder the cooperation that’s necessary in any prosperous workplace. Stage four is the stage you’ll ultimately want to aim for. In stage four, tribe members are united around common values and a noble cause they truly believe in. Members are more devoted to the tribe’s cause than to their own success. For example, a surgeon in stage four won’t focus on their own fame or financial gain. They’ll remember that they went to medical school to help others, not themselves. That desire to help others will be the driving value of their career. Values are very important in stage four tribes. The former CEO of Amgen, for instance, spoke to all his employees to make a list of what they valued most in the company. The Amgen executives then used this list as a guideline to make sure that the company always adhered to the employees’ values. Because of their shared values, tribe members collaborate much more easily in stage four. They often form three-sided relationships called triads. The vice chair of CB Richard Ellis does this at business parties. She only speaks in groups of three, to make sure that people in different fields can meet and truly engage with each other. This healthy collaboration and engagement makes stage four work environments the most successful. The power of harnessing all the members’ ideas can pave the way for real innovation. In 2003, for instance, IDEO designed some new buildings for the hospital group Kaiser Permanente. Before they began, they worked together with the Kaiser staff in role-play situations, asking them to pretend to be patients. By doing this, they discovered that the new buildings were unnecessary – it was better to rearrange the space they already had. They held their value of focusing on the patients over their desire to expand, and collaborated to find the best solution. Though stage four is optimal for businesses, stage five is where the magic truly happens. Stage five is rare – only two percent of American workplaces have a stage five tribal culture. In stage five, the central cause of the tribe is the only thing that matters to the members. They don’t work toward the company’s goals for personal gain. Instead, they feel an almost religious sense of wonder about their cause, or the possibilities it offers. For example, the biotechnology company Amgen was extremely successful in the 1990s. When asked who their main competitor was, they didn’t name another company, but diseases themselves. They didn’t aim to become the most successful corporation in their field: instead, they truly wanted to defeat adversaries like cancer or obesity. Stage five mentalities like this pave the way to innovation and success. When people aren’t distracted by potential competitors, they can fully invest themselves in their goal. An engineer at Amgen embodied this when he spoke about the billions of dollars Amgen had made from their patents. He didn’t say anything about the advantage this had given them over their competitors. Instead, he marveled at the new diseases they might now have the funds to cure. Stage five tribal cultures usually occur right after a great discovery or achievement, so they’re quite unstable. The euphoria that members find in devoting themselves to their goal might not last. Incidentally, Amgen floated in and out of stage five during the 1990s, depending on what advances they were making. Businesses in stage five always outperform the lower stages, but in the end, they’re unreliable, so a stage four business is still more productive in the long run. All tribes, including workplace tribes, need a tribal leader. In a business tribe, the leader doesn’t necessarily have to be the manager or CEO. However, tribal leaders do eventually have high positions in their companies, as their performance typically results in them getting promotions. The role of the tribal leader is to guide the tribe forward when they’re stuck in one of the stages. This can be challenging, as the members can make it difficult to move forward. We saw how individual employees adopt the nature of the tribe’s culture, meaning that if the tribe is in a lower stage, the members might prevent each other from moving forward. A strong tribal leader, however, can pull the whole group higher. For example, the CEO and vice president of Griffin Hospital successfully brought the Griffin tribe from stage two to stage three, then finally stage four. They engaged the staff by asking for their input on important company issues, such as new building designs and patient service plans. This taught the members to collaborate and work toward higher goals together, eventually resulting in Fortune naming Griffin one of the best companies to work for. Tribal leaders have the responsibility to bring the tribe to higher levels, as the Griffin leaders did. A sustained, high tribal culture level ensures the company’s long-term success. Most managers only focus on raising profits and gaining customers, but those goals can’t bring the company prosperity in the long run. The leader’s genuine devotion to their employees is what guides the tribe into higher and more efficient levels. The Griffin tribe leaders’ devotion was so successful that representatives from other hospitals still visit Griffin to learn how they can benefit from studying their model. Strong leaders create environments that are not only successful, but inspiring too. A leader must move their tribe to each higher stage, but it’s important not to rush it. Before moving on to the next stage, the leader must become a master of the previous stage. Although the stages are quite different, it’s important to progress through all of them. If a leader tries to move the tribe from stage two straight to stage four, for instance, the tribe won’t be stable. If the tribe encounters a serious challenge, members will be tempted to back away and think only of themselves, because they didn’t mature out of that by passing stage three. Consider how this applies to Griffin Hospital. The leaders couldn’t have fostered collaboration if the staff had hated their jobs in the first place. They wouldn’t have cooperated. Firstly, they needed to feel secure about their own interests, then they could unite around the common cause of patient welfare. To move the tribe in this way, the leader or leaders need to build the right kind of relationships between the members, and use the right kind of language. The tribe’s stage is expressed by the way the members relate to each other. Let’s look at a person moving from stage two to stage four. People in stage two think their lives are awful, and they don’t communicate well. To ease them into stage three, where people are motivated by self-interest, encourage them to test out new ideas, and to build two-sided relationships they’ll benefit from. They’ll start to see that they can improve their situation, and begin to focus on that. Once they’re secure in stage three, you can start to guide them into stage four. Do this by encouraging them to work in triads, and reminding them of the cause they’re working toward. With the right focus, an attentive and strong tribal leader can bring the tribe to greatness. The key message in this book: Tribal culture is the key to success, and tribes in the higher stages of culture are the most efficient. The tribal leader has the responsibility of moving the tribe to the next stage by encouraging certain behaviors among individual employees. With a strong tribal leader, the majority of the tribe members will eventually arrive at the next stage. Actionable advice: Work with your employees individually. Even though your goal is to get the employees to a higher stage as a group, you achieve that by helping each one individually. So encourage them to be creative, work with each other, and keep reminding them of the cause they’re working toward. The more employees you can get to progress to a higher stage, the more they’ll influence the others, and eventually elevate the group as a whole.

He explains why trying to reach everyone with your cause, like most big companies are still trying to do, only leads to mediocrity and a lack of intense feeling for your idea or brand.  These blinks elaborate step-by-step how anyone can form and lead a tribe, and how to use this powerful force to change the status quo and create a new future. In these blinks, you’ll discover: why tribes are the future of growth – and can potentially change the world, how to be a great leader of your very own tribe, and \nwhy today there are too few heretics, and too many sheepwalkers.\n For millions of years people have been part of tribes. Whether the groups are religious, ethnic or political, it seems we can’t help it: humans need to belong to a collective larger than themselves. In fact, tribes are everywhere; and whether you know it or not, you also are a member of at least one of them – as an employee of your company, a member of your religious community or a fan of your favorite band. But what actually is a tribe? All tribes share three components: a group of people, a common cause and at least one leader who represents and organizes the tribe. Take Wikipedia, for example. The vast majority of work for the website is performed by a group of about 5,000 contributors and editors. They all work together to realize the common cause of Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia’s cofounder: a vision of freely accessible, communally created information. However, the most important feature here is the shared cause. A tribe’s shared cause leads its members to internalize the tribe’s values and ideas as their own. These internalized incentives make tribe members into driven believers instead of mere followers. The cause of a tribe – either a yearning for or a resistance to change – can be anything from environmental justice, a political campaign or a group of Apple enthusiasts who believe in the superiority of their beloved consumer electronics. Tribes have always been with us, but with today’s technology, the number of tribes is exploding. This is mainly due to the internet: tribes used to be local, but now, with the reach of the internet – and especially social media – geography is no longer a barrier to tribal growth. And thanks to social media, a tribe’s influence is no longer directly correlated to its size, but to the cause for which it stands, and how it uses communication technologies. Why? Because today, real sustainable growth derives from the people who truly love your cause, advocate your values – and beat the social media drum for you. The marketing mantra of the past was to reach as many people as possible with your products. But times have changed – and this blink will show you how. Many companies are stuck in the past and still focus on developing products for the masses, a strategy which can lead to catastrophic consequences. For example, Nokia used to be the most successful mobile phone company in the world. But when smart phones emerged, they missed the boat and still haven’t recovered. Shortly before the smart-phone market boomed, no specific company had the technological advantage – as some might think Apple had, considering their success. So where did Nokia go wrong? Nokia stuck to its old model: it worked on how to produce the cheapest possible mobile phones that everyone would like. The problem with creating a product that will please everyone is that almost every time, it leads to a mediocre product that people will use – but not fall in love with. In contrast, Apple set out to produce a new kind of phone that almost no one would initially like, but that a few people would really love. And when people love something, they tell their friends. Soon enough, a new tribe is born. Apple was right to create an extraordinary product, because tribes don’t form around mediocre causes. People today are not content with off-the-shelf ideas anymore. A powerful cause needs to have a personal, exclusive and meaningful story that people can identify with. Furthermore, it needs to scream of newness, and allow for people to be directly engaged in the movement. Fundamentally, a meaningful cause scratches an itch that hasn’t been sufficiently scratched yet. Be it viral YouTube videos or the latest ideas of influential bloggers, reaching people has never been easier, cheaper or more effective. So what does this mean? You too can reach people by forming a new tribe. The first thing to know is that people need to be able to communicate intensely about their shared cause. This means that communication can’t just be vertical – between you (the leader) and the individual tribe members – more importantly, it must be horizontal, between tribe members. And with today’s technology, you have everything you need to facilitate both vertical and horizontal communication. Websites, blogs and social networks allow you not only to spread your cause, but also provide the room and the tools for your tribe to communicate, share ideas and organize. For example, you can use Basecamp to organize projects, and Twitter to share brief updates about developments. At the same time, these websites allow you to set ground rules for participation, and align everyone with your common vision by setting specific goals. Consider CrossFit.com, a website where fitness fanatics can connect and exchange their fitness programs, knowledge and much more. CrossFit certification courses across the United States sell out weeks and months in advance, and more and more trainers are opening gyms to support the growing demand of the CrossFit tribe. And it’s all coordinated by one central website. This is the work of Greg Glassman, otherwise known as “Coach.” He understood how to lead a tribe by telling his fitness stories and giving people the possibility to connect together via his website. Have you ever wondered how many people make up a movement? The answer is around 1,000: that’s the amount of true believers you need for a group to keep moving. But how do you get so many people to follow your cause? You have to tap into something people already yearn for. Creating a movement is about organizing an existing yearning into a way that tribe members can connect with each other, and form a movement under your leadership. As former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley defines it, a movement contains three elements: A narrative that tells the story of the future you’re trying to build; a connection between the leader and the tribe and among the tribe members; and something to do – the fewer limits, the better. But too often potential leaders don’t realize that a movement can’t be about money. If your cause is to be successful, it needs a meaningful story about something that is worth talking about. And too often, organizations only offer something to do – and nothing to buzz about. So what does it take to create a movement? As an example, let’s examine Nobel Prize winner Al Gore and his award-winning global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth, the message of which rapidly turned into a worldwide movement. But what Al Gore said about climate change and our society wasn’t new; this knowledge was already 30 years old when he first started. Why then did the idea suddenly take off? Because it needed a leader to organize people into a community that already knew what was the right thing to do. Al Gore shared his film for free with thousands of people, because he believed in it and because he knew that in giving others the opportunity, they would join him. And in doing so, he became the leader of a tribe. So what’s the secret to creating a tribe? Tell a story to people who want to hear it. Help them connect as a tribe. Lead the movement. And finally, make a change. A bigger tribe is a better tribe, right? For most leaders, this sounds about right. But they’re wrong. At least in the beginning, a tribe’s biggest advantage is not its size, but the multiple connections between the members, the leader and the outside world. In fact, a tribe has four different directions of communication: Leader to tribe, tribe to leader, tribe members to one another and tribe member to outsider. Normal marketing pales in comparison, with communication generally only in one direction: company to market. The most important of these directions is the communication between members. And this is where tightening a tribe comes in. Tightening a tribe means bringing members closer together by facilitating communication and tightening their common bonds. You can do this by transforming a shared interest into one passionate goal, and by providing a platform for members to easily connect with each other. Or you can harness the power of insiders and outsiders. To create a feeling of cohesion, you have to develop a culture of insiders – which inevitably excludes others. This allows the tribe to differentiate itself from other tribes, and create a stronger sense of internal identification.   For example, through his obsession with secrecy, Apple’s Steve Jobs passively created a whole bunch of rumor sites where Apple fans speculated about new products. The sites helped to bring Apple fans together and raised the level of suspense and curiosity about new products higher than for any other company. So remember, your main task as a leader is to organize and strengthen your tribe. But what else makes a good tribe leader? Management is primarily about getting a job done. But leadership is all about change, and this implies going where no one has been before: into a vacuum. For a tribe to form there has to be a particular change that people want to see made. This need for change has to come from a certain discomfort with the status quo, from a sense that there is something missing in the world. A leader steps right into this discomfort zone – the vacuum – and starts to organize so people will follow him. Leaders do this despite the risks because of two things: they have faith in the cause and they know that innovation is always more effective the earlier it happens – so the sooner the better. But with all this talk about leaders you might be thinking: well, that’s fine for the famous and the charismatic; but that’s not me. How can I be a leader? By correcting your misconceptions. The truth is, leaders are first generous – and through that are seen as charismatic. Many people today have the impression that you have to be famous or ooze charisma to be a leader. But in fact people – and that means potential tribe members – very quickly sniff out whether your motivation is authentic and altruistic, or if you’re just an egomaniac. Real leaders are generous and more focused on giving than taking. That’s why Al Gore made his presentation available for free, and why Shepard Fairey, the artist behind the famous Obama posters, shared his concept free of charge. They believed in the inherent value of their cause, and therefore made others believe in them. Today, Al Gore’s film has been presented by hundreds of people all over the world, and the price of Shepard Fairey’s art has skyrocketed since the 2008 U.S. presidential election. We’ve seen how rewarding being a tribe leader can be. So why isn’t everyone doing it? The answer is simple. There are too many sheepwalkers out there, people who have been conditioned by school and society to be obedient and afraid of change. They have been taught to keep their heads down and mind their own business – just like sheep. Well-educated sheep, but sheep nonetheless. What we need in the world are more heretics: people who question the status quo and the existing dogmas, and take action without asking for permission. Organizations need more heretics to advocate change from the inside: because if you hire amazing people and give them freedom, they will do amazing things. And tribes need heretics as leaders to break into new territory and help change the world. So why aren’t there more heretics out there? Because the media primes us with a story about heretics: one filled with tales of inevitable downfalls and self-delusion. After all, who would dare believe they can challenge the status quo? You can overcome this false narrative by talking yourself out of the fear: remind yourself that everything worth doing is risky, and that the world needs and demands the change you’re trying to make. Fear is what is stopping us from transforming our ideas into reality and changing the status quo. But with today’s technology, there is no excuse anymore: you no longer need power or money to make a change. So step up – and start leading your own tribe. The key message in this book: All around us, there are tribes yearning for leadership. And today, thanks to the power of the internet, anyone can step up and be the leader of a tribe – leaders we desperately need to guide the world, and its tribes, to a better future. Actionable advice: When something bothers you, be bold. Next time something bothers you about the status quo, don’t just sit there and be silent – use your voice and write a manifesto about the better future you foresee. Then publish your message online and share it with as many people as you can. Suggested further reading: Purple Cow, Permission Marketing and Linchpin by Seth Godin.

Chances are that black turtlenecks, vast fortunes and Facebook rank high on your list of associations. But what about a working-class Pennsylvanian football coach who cursed like a sailor and blew kisses to his colleagues across the boardroom? Well, meet Bill Campbell, a business guru every bit as unorthodox as he was instrumental in helping start-ups like Apple and Google become the household names and multi-billion dollar ventures they are today. A friend and mentor to everyone from Steve Jobs to Google’s ex-CEO Eric Schmidt, Bill’s unique insights into leadership and team-building made him one of the world’s most influential and important business minds by the time of his death in 2016. That might sound like the work of a lifetime, but Bill crammed his amazing achievements into just a few decades. And unlike so many other would-be gurus, Bill was a one-off, a true original who never forgot his roots or the lessons he’d learned as a college football coach. Based on over 80 interviews with the people who knew and loved him, these blinks explore the life and ideas of a true Silicon Valley legend. Along the way, you’ll learn what flat hierarchies can and can’t do; why the most effective leaders don’t shy away from showing their emotions; and why trust is the most important currency in the boardroom. Silicon Valley is often associated with whip-smart university dropouts who revolutionize the world from their garages before they hit their mid-twenties. But innovation in the Golden State isn’t just a young man’s game – in fact, one of the tech mecca’s greatest pioneers didn’t arrive in California until he was already in his forties. Born in the Pennsylvanian steel town of Homestead in 1940, Bill Campbell was the son of a physical education teacher who moonlighted at the local mill. A quick-witted and determined student, Bill was set on making something of himself early on in life. In his teens, he took to the op-ed pages of the school newspaper to remind his peers of the importance of good grades and to warn them against “loafing.” But it wasn’t an academic career that he’d set his sights on – his true passion was football. After heading to New York to study economics at Columbia University in 1958, he joined the college team, the Lions. He wasn’t the most likely candidate: weighing 165 pounds and standing five foot ten, he was the team’s smallest member by some margin. But what he lacked in physical stature, he made up for in fearlessness and willpower – qualities that earned him the nickname “Ballsy.” Under his inspired captaincy, the Lions won the Ivy League title in 1961, a feat they’ve never managed to repeat. At the end of his studies, Bill was offered a position as an assistant football coach at Boston College. He jumped at the chance and moved north in 1964. Over the next decade he established himself as a highly capable coach, and offers from other universities began flooding in. One came from Penn State, home of the nation’s top college football coach, Joe Paterno. It was a golden opportunity but Bill turned it down. Why? In a word, loyalty – his alma mater had also offered him a job. Returning to Columbia in 1974 was a sentimental rather than a practical decision. The university’s football facilities were in poor shape and badly underfunded. This showed through in the team’s results. During Bill’s tenure, the Lions won just 12 games and lost 41, a run of bad form which ended in a humiliating 69-0 drubbing at the hands of Rutgers at Giants stadium. It was time to move on, and in 1979 Bill resigned. Bill’s coaching career was over and, aged 39, he entered the business world. His first job was at the ad agency J. Walter Thompson. He showed the same enthusiasm in his new role as he had on the gridiron, and clients loved him – especially Kodak, who decided to poach Bill from the agency and install him as their head of consumer products in Europe. It was a brilliant start to a late-blooming career. Things got even better in 1983, when Bill received a call from an old Columbia buddy. John Sculley had just left Pepsi to become the CEO of a tech start-up called Apple. Convinced he was on to the next big thing, John offered Bill a chance to get in on the ground floor. It was a huge move, but Bill accepted. Why? Well, he believed he’d climbed as high up the corporate ladder as he could: more senior positions would be unattainable for him because of his unorthodox background as a football coach. California, however, was different. It was easygoing and more of a meritocracy – in other words, a great place to take his career to the next level. He wasn’t wrong. Nine months later, Bill had been made vice president of sales and tasked with overseeing the launch of Apple’s new flagship computer, the Macintosh. It was in that position that he made one of the smartest decisions in the company’s history. In 1984, Apple bought an advertising spot during that year’s Super Bowl. Bill’s team had come up with an ad that riffed on George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984. It showed a young woman running from armed guards before bursting into a monumental chamber filled with grey-uniformed men with shaved heads watching a “Big Brother” figure giving a speech on a large screen. As she tosses a mallet at the screen, causing it to explode, a narrator promises that “1984 won’t be like 1984.” Steve Jobs loved it, but Apple’s board hated it. Worried it was too controversial, they tried to sell the slot to another company. That’s when a sales executive asked for Bill’s final verdict. Throwing caution to the wind, he gave the go-ahead. The rest is history. The Big Brother-themed spot became one of the most famous ads of all time and ushered in the era of Super Bowl advertising we know today. The first leg of Bill’s journey with Apple came to an end in 1990. In his last years at the company, he headed up a spin-off software venture called Claris. It did well under his stewardship, but Apple ultimately decided against making Claris public. That was Bill’s signal to leave and begin a new chapter in his career. He would spend the next decade at the tablet computer startup GO and software manufacturer Claris, before trying his hand as a business coach. And his first client? His old employer, Apple. We’ve already seen that it was Bill’s sense of loyalty that brought him back to Columbia as a coach. Well, that quality ran deep. When Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple back in 1985, Bill was one of the only prominent team members to argue that the company couldn’t afford to lose their talented figurehead. Jobs remembered that loyalty. When he was reinstated as Apple’s CEO in 1997, he named Bill one of the company’s directors – a position he retained until 2014. But there was more to it than that. Whenever he needed advice or to talk things out, Jobs called Bill. Over the following years, Bill worked side by side with Jobs as he rescued Apple from near-bankruptcy and put it on the path to becoming a trillion-dollar company. Word of Bill and Jobs’ Sunday afternoon walks around their Palo Alto neighborhood soon spread. In 2001, Eric Schmidt decided to find out what all the fuss was about. Schmidt, a software engineer and entrepreneur who’d worked with an array of top Silicon Valley companies, had just been named CEO of a small start-up called Google. A star in his own right, Schmidt was initially skeptical and wondered what on earth a gruff ex-football coach could teach him. It didn’t take him long to change his mind. At their first meeting, the two men instantly hit it off. Over the next 15 years, Bill met up with Eric and other Google leaders just about every week. By the end of that decade and a half, Google – like Apple – was worth billions of dollars. So what exactly did Bill’s trillion-dollar coaching entail? Well, that’s what we’ll be exploring in the following blinks. In 2001, when Bill started working with Google, the company was in the middle of a radical experiment. Fed up with top-down interference in creative projects, Google’s co-founder Larry Page had decided to do away with managers altogether. Larry’s so-called “disorg” model seemed to be working, but Bill thought it wasn’t sustainable. Their argument went back and forth until Bill made a suggestion: Why not ask the folks at the sharp end of the action – Google’s engineers – what they thought? The response was unanimous – they wanted managers. Why? They needed leaders to resolve stalemates. Because everyone was on an equal footing, disagreements about which projects needed prioritizing weren’t being resolved. There’s plenty of evidence to back that intuition up. As a 2005 study in the American Journal of Sociology notes, flat hierarchies are great at fostering creativity but less adept at implementing the innovation that results. Rolling out projects like Google’s search engine is all about logistics, and that means someone needs to make tough calls about how resources are going to be allocated. However, autocratic management isn’t a viable solution either. After all, if you start dictating terms to talented subordinates, you’ll end up driving them away. But if neither democracy nor autocracy works, how do you make those kinds of calls? Here’s Bill’s answer: When you’re in a tricky situation and can’t reach an agreement, it’s a leader’s duty to remind everyone of the company’s first principles – the values that define its mission and purpose. That’s a lesson he learned back in the 1990s, when he worked with Tellme Networks. Tellme had just created the first cloud-based speech recognition software, but it was strapped for cash. That’s when telecommunications giant AT&T offered to pay tens of millions of dollars to license the software if Tellme agreed to exit the market. Half the board, including CEO John LaMacchia, wanted to take the deal. Bill was against it, but knew he’d lose the team if he ramrodded his view through. So he decided to take a walk with Tellme founder Mike McCue and talk principles. Bill reminded Mike that the company had the best product in the business. AT&T’s deal was lucrative, but it would ultimately mean withdrawing Tellme’s innovative technology and gifting market dominance to a substandard alternative. Was that really why Mike had set up the company? It was the wake-up call Mike needed. When he laid out Tellme’s principles to the board, the deadlock was broken and the offer was rejected. There’s a common idea that people who show their emotions in the workplace aren’t as competent as their less “touchy-feely” peers. But that’s a fallacy. Few people know that better than the folks who worked with Bill. Bill was famous for his personal warmth and informality. He gave his colleagues bear hugs, had a breezy – and often downright profane – way of talking, and wouldn’t hesitate to blow a kiss to a colleague on the other side of a meeting room. More importantly, he’d drop everything to help people out if they were in trouble. When Steve Jobs was incapacitated by cancer, for example, Bill visited him in the hospital every day. This wasn’t just a personal quirk – showing that you care about the people you work with is a telltale sign of an effective leader. Take a 2014 study by leadership and HR experts Sigal Barsade and Olivia O’Neill. They found that organizations which foster companionate love – a kind of emotional openness that treats everyone as equals – have higher rates of employee satisfaction, better team performance levels and lower absenteeism. That’s because this approach breaks down the barriers between the personal and professional, which in turn means that people don’t feel like they have to check parts of their personalities at the door when they enter the office. Showing your emotions at work might seem like a scary proposition. But don’t worry – you don’t have to be as outgoing as Bill to pull it off. In fact, there all sorts of simple ways to create a more open, accepting environment. When Bill was working at Apple, he made sure that the board responded to presentations they liked by getting out of their chairs and clapping. As Apple’s Phil Schiller recalls, that was like a parent showing his appreciation for a child. Bruce Chizen, a software developer at Claris, remembers observing Bill’s easy-going way of talking to colleagues in the elevator or cafeteria. Mimicking this didn’t come naturally to Bruce, but then he realized how little effort it actually took once he got into the habit. Simply remembering names and asking “how’s it going?” or “what are you working on?” was more than enough to start building personal connections with his coworkers. In the 1980s, when Bill was first starting his Silicon Valley career, most executives at tech firms were men. One of the few women in a senior position at the time was Deb Biondolillo, Apple’s head of HR in the US. Bill had noticed that Deb always chose a chair at the back of the room rather than at the conference table at the company’s weekly staff meetings. He asked her what she was doing all the way back there and told her to “get to the table!” One day, Deb finally took the plunge and grabbed a front-row seat. That’s when gruff executive Al Eisenstat sat down and asked her what she was doing there. Deb nervously told him she was waiting for the meeting. He eyed her suspiciously and then turned to Bill, who subtly indicated that he’d made the call. That, she recalls, was the moment she knew things would work out. Bill’s methods might have been unorthodox, but he was the greatest champion of bringing women to the boardroom table the authors have ever encountered. They put this down to his old sports instincts. As a coach, he had intuitively understood that winning is about selecting the best players, whoever they are. In the boardroom, that meant putting more women on the team. He wasn’t wrong. Take a study published in the journal Science in 2010 which examined the “collective intelligence” of teams. Why, the authors asked, are some groups smarter than others? They narrowed their answer down to three factors. First off, higher IQ teams allow everyone to participate, rather than being dominated by one or two voices. Secondly, they display greater emotional intelligence. And, finally, they have more women! Unfortunately, there’s still a lot more work to be done before women achieve equal representation in the tech world. According to the 2016 US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, just 20 percent of tech executives are women. The 2018 Entelo Women in Tech report, meanwhile, puts the figure at just 10 percent. So what can today’s business leaders do? Well, one of Bill’s favored approaches was to encourage mentoring programs. When Shellye Archambeau became CEO of the risk management software company MetricStream, she founded a group of senior women executives to support each other. Bill often attended their meetings to listen and ask questions. As he saw it, groups like Shellye’s are a brilliant way to share experiences and give members new opportunities. In the previous blink, we saw how Bill helped Deb Biondolillo get a place at the table. The reason he could persuade Deb to grab a seat next to an intimidating executive and Al Eisenstat to accept this was simple: they both trusted him. But what is trust? Well, here’s how an influential 1998 article published in the Academy of Management Review journal defines the concept: trust is all about a willingness to take a chance because you have positive expectations for someone else’s behavior. And that’s often what makes boardrooms tick. Take an example from Bill’s time working with the software company Intuit. The board was split between two factions. One wanted to write off recent losses and focus on long-term growth. The second, led by Bill, believed that tolerating short-term operational failures meant there wouldn’t be a long term. The deadlock was broken when Intuit’s head of sales, John Doerr, argued that they should back the coach. Why? He’d earned their trust. Bill’s method of earning people’s trust was simple: listen! Google computer scientist Alan Eustace calls Bill’s approach free-form listening. Rather than fidgeting with his phone or anticipating the moment when he could get his two cents in, he focused his full attention on what people were saying. More importantly, he asked questions. That, as a 2016 Harvard Business Review paper argues, is something all great listeners do. Practitioners of this kind of respectful inquiry are regularly regarded as the most trustworthy and valuable conversation partners because of their ability to trigger spontaneous insights. This, in turn, heightens the speaker’s feelings of competence, belonging and autonomy. But trust isn’t just great at diffusing boardroom standoffs – it also transforms disagreements into positive rather than toxic experiences. When trust is absent, your feelings can get in the way of objectivity, and criticisms of your ideas feel like personal attacks. Once that happens, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll give a fair hearing to the potentially valuable insights of your sparring partner. When you trust people, by contrast, you focus on the issues at hand rather than taking things personally. And as the authors know from their own experience of working in a company molded by Bill’s philosophy, the best answers usually emerge when you talk things out honestly. The key message in these blinks: A working-class ex-football coach with a non-technical degree who’d parachuted into California at the relatively ripe age of 43, Bill Campbell wasn’t exactly your average Silicon Valley star. But that didn’t stop him becoming one of the most important business gurus in the world. With his passion and straight-talking advice, Campbell helped a series of start-ups conquer the world and generate trillions of dollars in revenue. Actionable advice: Don’t waste meetings dwelling on emotional responses  One of Bill’s most important lessons, Apple executive Eddy Cue recalls, was his insistence on getting emotional responses to setbacks out of the way at the beginning of meetings and moving on to other issues at hand.

What to read next: How Google Works, by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg Bill, as Eric Schmidt and his coauthors are quick to point out, was the secret ingredient that gave Google its edge. It was his careful guidance and coaching which helped its leaders transform the company from just another Silicon Valley start-up into the global behemoth it is today. But what about the other ingredients? Well, that’s just what Schmidt and Google’s former senior vice president of products Jonathan Rosenberg set out to explain when they created a confidential slideshow to explain the company’s philosophy to its senior workers back in 2010. Realizing that keeping that knowledge secret went against Google’s ethos of openness and transparency, the duo decided to share their recipe for success with the world.

They seem too focused, too smart, too right all the time to make decisions like the rest of us, don’t they? Not necessarily. The authors of this book interviewed some 125 great leaders and found that they’re not so different from the rest of us. They have unique qualities that can’t be summed up in a few simple leadership cliches about “vision” or “talent.” Rather, these leaders manage to concentrate on the right things; they know which issues are most important and stay focused on them. How? They follow their True North, that is, the compass that represents who they truly are and guides them to become the best leaders they can be. As these blinks show, when the world around you seems in disarray or feels like it’s spinning out of control, your own True North can keep you on track, inspired and true to yourself. Find your True North to become an excellent, authentic leader. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a fishing trip suddenly re-motivated the chairman of The Gap; which tear-filled inspiration changed Oprah’s approach to leadership; and why great leaders have the self-awareness to see their own shortcomings. We all have unique life stories shaped by past relationships and events. Authentic leaders, however, gain more from these experiences than the rest of us. Authentic leaders are genuine people - that is, true to themselves and their beliefs - who are able to motivate others to perform at their best. Ultimately, they’re more concerned with serving others than with their own success or recognition. Understanding the meanings of the key events in your unique story will guide you and help you find and focus on your True North. This, in turn, will set you on the path to becoming an authentic leader. A case in point is Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks. When an accident caused his father to lose his job, his whole family lost their health coverage. Schultz’s mother was pregnant and unable to work, so his parents borrowed money and avoided bill collectors. Schultz had vowed to create a different reality for workers if he had the chance, and he thus made Starbucks the first company in the United States to offer health coverage to part-time employees working as little as 20 hours a week. In this case, Schultz’s experience and memories of his father carried him along the path to authentic leadership. Authentic leaders’ stories also provide the context for their lives, as well as the inspiration to have an impact in the world. Take Reatha Clark King, former president of the General Mills Foundation. As a poor, black woman growing up in Georgia during the 1940s, both poverty and discrimination were constant obstacles in King’s life. Nevertheless, she won scholarships and eventually earned a PhD in thermochemistry. King’s goal is to create more opportunities for the poor and to help others overcome the barriers of racial and gender discrimination. She drew inspiration from her own story to stay true to who she is – and to stay on course with her True North. Money and success don’t make authentic leaders forget those they’ve left behind; rather, they spur a sense of responsibility to help them. As you start earning acclaim and the rewards that come with it, you’re at greater risk to get derailed from a path to authentic leadership. There are five archetypal leaders who most easily lose sight of their True North: Imposters, Rationalizers, Glory Seekers, Loners and Shooting Stars. Imposters lack self-awareness and self-esteem, and accomplish success through cunning and aggression. They are politically minded, and once they’ve attained power, they care little about the way they’re perceived. Rationalizers’ weakness is that they deviate from their values. These are the managers who never take responsibility, but do everything they can to make their quotas. Rationalizers sacrifice a  company’s long-term health for their own short-term gain. Glory Seekers are people we all know. They work for and are motivated by outward signs of success, like money, fame, glory, power and acclaim. Loners’ fatal flaw is their failure to develop personal support structures, such as close relationships or mentors. Picture someone who thinks they can – and must – be the lone wolf. Being so intently focused on their objectives, they are likely unaware that their behavior identifies them as a loner. Shooting stars don’t have an integrated life. They rise too fast to learn from their mistakes, and they never have time for family or friends. Their sudden rise to power often leaves them overwhelmed by personal and professional problems. A real-life example of one archetype, the imposter, is Philip Purcell, the former CEO of Morgan Stanley, who was challenged to create a financial services powerhouse by combining investment banking with the brokerage business. Purcell built his power base by cunningly manipulating the board and pushing out people who questioned his leadership. Many became frustrated with his “leadership” style, and several talented workers left. While anyone can lose their way, you can get back on track by understanding that leadership isn’t about you, but about empowering others to lead. Some leaders think their power lies in their ability to motivate others to follow them – but that’s a myth. Being an authentic leader isn’t about getting supporters to help move you along; it’s about motivating others to reach their full potential. It often takes a triggering experience to get you to realize this essential purpose of your leadership. Oprah Winfrey, for example, once conducted an interview on her show with a woman named Trudy Chase, who had been sexually abused as a child. During the interview, Winfrey remembered her own traumatic experiences from her youth, and was overcome by her emotions. Since that pivotal interview, she understands that her mission goes far beyond pursuing personal success, and instead revolves around empowering people all around the world, especially women. Winfrey’s story illustrates the kind of transformative events that most authentic leaders experience. It is often during these hard moments that you realize authentic leadership isn’t about advancing yourself and your interests; rather, it’s about inspiring others to bring out their best.   Having undergone this transformation, you will abandon the belief that you are the hero of your own journey in order to lead others to a greater calling. We see an example of this in Steve Rothschild. As vice president of General Mills in his thirties, he felt like a man in the middle, lacking the satisfaction of leading his own team. A year later, he decided to leave General Mills, having realized that his passion was helping poor, underprivileged people become financially sufficient and develop stronger families. So, he set out on a mission to provide employers with skilled workers by training unemployed or underemployed adults, founding the organization Twin Cities RISE! Your leadership purpose is your True North. The following blinks will look even closer at the compass that will guide you there. Know thyself is age-old advice, but that doesn’t make it any easier to follow. After all, we’re complex beings with numerous aspects to our character. That’s why you need a compass – one that helps you calibrate your actions so that your leadership stays aligned with how you want to live your life. When your compass works, it keeps you on track toward your True North. Self-awareness lies at the heart of your compass. You need to know which roles you’re best at, along with your natural strengths and interests. One key thing self-awareness does is help you find true self-confidence. Take Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen; he felt insecure about working in the tech industry because he was not an engineer, but he knew he had business and product-marketing skill and that he could learn about engineering. This assessment of his skills and abilities gave him the confidence to work his way up to becoming CEO. Another reason self-awareness is so important is that it helps you fill your skill gaps with colleagues that complement them. For Ned Barnholt, former CEO of Agilent, self-awareness allows leaders to see their own shortcomings, which helps them build stronger teams. Barnholt has enough self-awareness to know that accounting isn’t his strong suit. So, he surrounds himself with excellent financial people. On the flip side, a lack of self-awareness can lead to major problems. For example, David Pottruck, former CEO of Charles Schwab, was an extremely hard worker, and simply couldn’t understand why his colleagues resented him. He was understandably shocked when his boss gave him a low rating for trustworthiness – the reason: his colleagues saw him as self-serving. Pottruck had to work hard to confront his blind spots and gain an understanding of how others see him. But it paid off. After winning the support of his colleagues he eventually led the firm to outstanding success. With the center of your compass firmly grounded in self-awareness, you must now uncover the values and the principles that will guide your leadership. What is most important to you? Is it maintaining your integrity? Or perhaps helping other people? Once you know what matters in your life, you are well equipped to establish the leadership principles that will define your leadership style. In essence, these leadership principles are your values translated into action. It’s easy to live by your values when times are good. But when you’re under pressure – like when your success, career or life is at stake – those same values will be seriously tested and may even change. For instance, David Gergen, former presidential advisor of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, wanted to lead a life that was consistent with the values passed on to him by his family. But when the Watergate Scandal emerged, Gergen felt he couldn’t resign, as he didn’t want to be viewed as a rat leaving a sinking ship. Even though he wasn’t corrupt himself, he was still in a potentially career-ending situation. And after seeing Nixon’s total lack of transparency, both before the scandal broke and after he  misled the public, Gergen realized that his central leadership principle was transparency. Your values and moral compass can be tested in every conceivable way. But once you’ve discovered your True North, you can remain true to your values without straying. Take Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys, who wanted to show the world that it was possible to run a business in India without corruption, and create wealth legally and ethically. For example, because he refused to pay bribes, Infosys had to wait an entire year before their telephone line was installed! Although this made it difficult to grow at first, Murthy’s leadership principle of honesty instilled discipline throughout the company – something everyone they worked with came to appreciate. According to Murthy, there is a direct connection between his company’s system of values and the success they’ve enjoyed over the last 24 years. In addition to self-awareness and values, authentic leaders also need to find the right motivation. Of course, to do that, you first need to know what motivates you. There are two types of motivations: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic motivations, such as good grades, trophies or high salaries, are measured by the external world. Intrinsic motivations, on the other hand, are derived from your own sense of meaning in your life – in other words, your True North. These motivations are often closely linked to your life story, and can be things like personal growth, the satisfaction of doing a good job or staying true to your beliefs. Intrinsic motivations come from within you, and are thus more subtle than extrinsic motivations. In fact, many people never tap into these powerful motivations. Indeed, society’s obsessive focus on material gain and the accompanying social pressures cause many leaders to seek international acclaim rather than doing what motivates them intrinsically. For instance, many young leaders take high-salaried jobs in order to pay off loans or build a nest egg. They believe that, after ten years or so, they can move on to do the work they find fulfilling. Instead, they become addicted to their lifestyle and become increasingly demotivated and unhappy. The key to developing as an authentic leader isn’t purging yourself of all extrinsic motivations, but balancing them with intrinsic motivations. Bob Fischer, chairman of The Gap, offers a good example of how to balance these motivations. In his mid-20s, he went fishing in the north fork of the Feather River, where he came across the remains of rusted gold mining equipment. This sight inspired a deep concern in him about the well-being of the environment. This environmental awareness led to a new intrinsic motivation in Fischer. He brought his employees together to look at what the company could recycle and joined the board of the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC). His initiative not only helped the environment (intrinsic motivation), but also the company’s public perception (extrinsic motivation). Everybody needs support and appreciation – even high-level executives who seem completely self-assured. Great leaders understand this, and build great support teams as a result. Indeed, many authentic leaders have had a mentor who has changed their lives by helping them develop skills to become better leaders, as well as the confidence to lead authentically. Mentors don’t necessarily make you feel good about yourself, but they do provide the tough love necessary to help you learn critical lessons. Don’t be afraid to approach potential mentors. There’s always more to learn from experienced people who are willing to help you and and challenge you to improve. While still in his 20s, Dave Dillon was made merchandising vice president of Fry’s supermarket, a division of the family-owned Dillons company. One day he got a call from Chuck Fry, the man who sold Fry’s to Dillons. Fry offered to walk him through a Fry’s store; since then, they speak for at least one hour a day, with Fry coaching Dillon on how to maximize the company’s potential.   Like mentors, personal support groups can also be a powerful source of wisdom and advice that will help you grow as a leader. The most effective groups are those made up of peers who meet regularly and talk about what’s most important in their lives. One of the authors, Bill George, meets every Wednesday morning for 75 minutes with a men’s group that formed 30 years ago. In fact, he and the other group members all consider the group to be one of the most important elements of their lives. It enables them to clarify their beliefs, values and understanding of vital issues, while also providing a source of honest feedback when it’s needed. You don’t even have to leave the office to find a peer support group – look within your company. Your colleagues will face similar challenges and give you insights about things you don’t see. Building a support team doesn’t end with personal support groups or mentors; your life partner, family and close friends are also part of this support network. Being a leader can be lonely and isolating, so keep nourishing your good relationships. As we’ve seen, authentic leadership isn’t just about who you are at the office. In order to get the most out of your True North, you have to lead an integrated life. An integrated life is one that brings together the major elements of your personal and professional life, including work, family community and friends, so that you can truly be the same person in each environment. Many people wonder whether it’s possible to live a rich personal life and a great work life at the same time. It is! You simply have to realize you can’t be everywhere for everyone. Sometimes you need to make trade-offs. Take Kris Johnson, once a rising star at Medtronic. After being promoted to head of Medtronic’s global business, Johnson found that she was spending too much time away from her family on grueling international trips. She left Medtronic's for another mid-sized venture capital company so she could spend more time with her daughters. In essence, she found the freedom to strike the proper balance between work and family. That balance required her to sacrifice some career potential for more family time. Moreover, authentic leaders are always aware of the importance of staying down to earth – it keeps them from getting cocky at high points and forgetting who they are during low points. One way to do this is to find a place you can return to to help you stay grounded. Many authentic leaders have a special place they can go with their families to restore themselves and regain their perspective. Akshata Murthy, having grown up in Bangalore as the daughter of Infosys CEO Narayana Murthy, regularly returns to India to see old friends and her extended family, and is committed to making an impact there someday. You can’t avoid the stress of leadership, but you can maintain a balance between your personal and professional life. The key message in this book: Not every leader is an authentic leader, someone who follows their “True North” and leads a mission of integrity. By exploring different aspects of your character and your motivations, you can develop an internal compass that will always keep you pointed in the right direction. Actionable advice: Take the New York Times test. Before moving forward with any decision that might have difficult ethical questions, ask yourself: How would I feel if this entire situation, including transcripts of our discussions with all the juicy details, was printed on the front page of the New York Times? If the thought fills you with dread, then rethink your actions. If it makes you beam with pride, then proceed, even if others criticize your actions later.

David Marquet","summary":"If you’re a manager, you know that constantly improving your leadership skills is important, so you can keep your team focused and moving in the right direction. But what if your strategies aren’t working? What if employees seem increasingly listless, uninspired by the work you assign? Perhaps it’s time to reconsider how you lead. In these blinks, you’ll learn from the first-hand experience of L. David Marquet, a U.S. Navy officer who transformed one of the fleet’s worst-performing submarines into a well-oiled, effective team. Marquet learned that encouraging others to lead made him a better leader, and in turn, empowered his whole team to perform better and succeed together. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover why the leadership style that helped build Egypt’s pyramids is no longer relevant; why the best way to lead is to create more leaders around you; and why briefing puts people to sleep instead of inspiring them. Be honest: Do you like your job? If you answered “no,” you’re not alone. Job satisfaction in the United States is at an all-time low. From 2004 to 2012, less than half of U.S. workers considered themselves satisfied with their jobs; in 2009, a Conference Board Survey showed worker satisfaction to be at its lowest rate ever. Dissatisfaction in the workforce isn’t the only trend that’s emerged in recent years. We’ve also witnessed a considerable drop in productivity, with up to $300 billion lost due to productivity issues in the United States alone. Times have also been tough for those outside the workforce, as U.S. unemployment sat at 9 percent for a record 31 months, up until November 2011. The symptoms, a doctor might say, are bad. Yet before they worsen, it’s crucial that we work out where the illness actually is. To do so, we’ve got examine the structure of organizations themselves. For centuries, we fashioned our organizations according to a particular style of leadership. The Egyptians harnessed it to build the pyramids; this strategy also drove the Industrial Revolution. We’re talking about the leader-follower approach, where decisions are made by a leader (a boss) and carried out by followers (the workers). A leader-follower system is perfectly suited for work requiring physical labor, allowing menial tasks to be delegated among many individuals to increase efficiency. However, many more jobs today are dominated by cognitive tasks and decision-making, not at all suitable for a “follower” workforce. As a result, the leader-follower approach is ill-suited to the times. Think of it this way: it’s a great strategy for building pyramids, but not for operating a nuclear-powered submarine or even starting a technology business! To truly empower workers, we need to overhaul our idea of leadership. Find out how we start in the next blink. It’s clear that our leader-follower mentality needs a makeover. So what are the alternatives? If we want to create a satisfied, empowered workforce, our best bet is to adopt a radically different leadership structure: a leader-leader system. This approach proves that leadership isn’t just a magical quality bestowed on a select few. Instead, it recognises that we are all leaders, in some fashion. The difference between a leader-leader and leader-follower approach is reflected in the way decisions are made. In a leader-follower structure, information is sent up the chain of command, and a decision is made only once the information has reached and been digested by those at the very top. Yet in a leader-leader system, the power to make decisions is distributed throughout the chain of command, allowing individuals to act even on newly arrived information. For example, a navigator realises his submarine is off course and in very shallow water. Instead of alerting his commander first, he jumps into action, rectifying the problem safely and effectively. This example isn’t hypothetical – the author experienced it firsthand. A nuclear-powered submarine with the U.S. Navy, the USS Santa Fe was notorious for its poor performance. It also had the worst crew retention rate. That is, until the author became its commander and used the leader-leader structure to take the sub from one of the worst performing in the fleet to one of the best. Tactical effectiveness went from “below average” to “above average to excellent” in inspections, some 36 crew members chose to re-enlist, and the USS Santa Fe was awarded the Arleigh Burke Trophy for most-improved ship in the fleet – all thanks to the author’s leadership strategies. A leader-leader approach clearly is worthwhile. But how do you implement it? We’ll see in the following blinks. So now you know that a leader-leader approach can help your team perform more effectively. Yet how do you start to implement it in a business? Establishing a leader-leader system begins with rewriting the basic foundations – the DNA, so to speak – of your organization. You need to ensure that decision-making involves employees and is sustainable. To do this, however, as a manager you may need to give up some of your power. While uncomfortable, it is the only way to create change in a deeply ingrained hierarchical system. On the USS Santa Fe, this meant moving power traditionally reserved for captains down the chain of command to chiefs, who were responsible for each division in the submarine. Before anything else, the author talked with each chief to learn how he could empower them. He found that the first thing the chiefs wanted was greater responsibility for the men in their divisions, starting with the ability to approve leave time. Formerly, this involved chiefs signing off on a leave application, which was then sent through three different officers, a department head and an executive officer, above them all. Ending the inefficient process, the author gave his chiefs the power to fully approve leave. With greater responsibility for their divisions, chiefs became more passionate about the performance of their men and began to take charge of improving efficiency overall. However, reassigning responsibility isn’t the only way to empower a workforce. In fact, the USS Santa Fe made use of a simple three-word phrase to actively involve the entire crew in the running of the submarine. The phrase was: “I intend to…” For example, instead of a navigator requesting to change course, he would simply inform the captain of his decision by saying, “I intend to alter our path.” The captain could then quickly approve this by saying, “go ahead.” Yet the decision essentially was made by the navigator. We’ve seen two examples of how passing control down the chain of command is at the core of a leader-leader system. However, other steps are needed to sustain such a dynamic. Next, we'll discover the pillars of competence and clarity, and why they are so vital. Giving more responsibility to employees often seems like a risk. You know that such a move is empowering, but are you sure they’ll be competent enough to handle it? Fortunately, there are practical mechanisms that ensure your workforce builds and maintains their competence levels. The first of these concerns “taking deliberate action.” Once, on the USS Santa Fe, a crewmember breached protocol and shut off a circuit breaker earlier than he should have. The captain had to ensure this would not happen again. The crewman accepted that he went against protocol, so extra training wasn’t an answer. Nor was more supervision, as that was already in place. The problem was a lack of attention, which the captain solved by introducing a policy of deliberate action. The crew would now pause, vocalise and gesture toward what they were doing before they did it. Whether turning a valve or changing course, taking deliberate action reduced errors in any setting regardless of the task, as it allowed others to monitor and correct any mistakes before they could even occur. This technique saw the USS Santa Fe go on to receive the highest grade ever given on nuclear-reactor operations inspections. Yet there was another vital change on the USS Santa Fe that boosted crew competence. When assigning tasks, emphasis was shifted from briefing to certifying. When briefing, you can only ensure the competence of the person giving the brief. Those being briefed often daydream or stop listening halfway through, as the task is a familiar one, and they’ve heard it before. Rather than just giving information, certifying made crewmembers answer questions about the task they’d been assigned. If the answers were acceptable, the crewmembers were then \"certified\" to take on the task in question. In this way, underprepared or inattentive teams can be identified and addressed, when a crewmember can’t respond adequately to questions about a task. In this way, the leader-leader structure on the USS Santa Fe boosted both employee satisfaction and performance. However, one more element was crucial in bringing this newly empowered team to its full potential, as we’ll see in our final blink. In a leader-leader organization, the power to make decisions lies with everyone. Because of this, it’s vital that every employee is on the same page and working toward the same goals. But how do you ensure this? To keep your organization united and productive, it’s vital that core values are upheld. One way to do this is to inspire employees with the company’s legacy or history. The crew of the USS Santa Fe emphasised the historical importance of their work in several ways, including making an announcement to the whole ship whenever it passed a sunken U.S. submarine. This way, the crew’s sense of purpose – that of serving and protecting the United States – was bolstered. Corporations can also use the company’s legacy to inspire. For example, Apple regularly holds employee conferences, in which the philosophy of “thinking differently” is highlighted through Apple’s history of innovation. This reinforces original thinking as a corporate and personal goal in the minds of Apple employees. Core values can also be strengthened by rewarding employees that uphold them in the tasks they perform. However, administrative issues often get in the way of giving immediate praise – rewards often take days to be received, by which time the action is already long forgotten. On the USS Santa Fe, the author understood that praise had the greatest impact when good performance was recognised immediately. So if a sailor avoided a disaster through quick decision-making, the success was announced to their division shortly afterward, immediately reinforcing the core values of the ship. The way that rewards are structured can also have an impact on an organization’s productivity. Man-versus-man rewards, where employees are encouraged to compete against each other, are unproductive. However, man-versus-nature rewards pit employees against an external enemy, which helps build camaraderie and a stronger work ethic among workers. An example would be rewarding employees when the company’s stock price surpasses that of a competitor. The USS Santa Fe demonstrates the success of the leader-leader approach in both increasing productivity and empowering workers, simply by changing the way we think about leadership itself. Think back to the statistics cited in the first blink. It’s clear that the U.S. economy could also do with an overhaul! If organizations everywhere took steps toward establishing a new leader-leader dynamic, just imagine the success we would achieve! The key message in this book: A top-down approach to leadership is ineffective and does not tap the natural leadership abilities we all have. A switch to a leader-leader organizational style takes only a few institutional changes but does require a complete reevaluation of the way we look at leadership. Yet the benefits of such a switch will be felt both by workers and the organization itself.   Actionable advice: Communication is key! When given a project, don’t try and complete it perfectly before showing your work to your boss. Keep her up to date with short, but early and frequent conversations to make sure you are both on the same page in terms of what your goals are.

They tell a tale about two birds in a tree: One is in the lower branches and the other is at the tree’s peak, looking out on the view. The lower bird represents the anxious ego, the one that jumps around doing things and trying to attain others, while being blind to the bigger picture. Meanwhile, the higher bird is perched serenely at the top, enjoying a full perspective of the world and its connections. Unfortunately, business tends to act like the lower bird and it causes a lot of harm. That’s because businesses often see themselves as separate from other areas of responsibility like those to humanity and nature. Instead they focus only on the ones that are explicitly in their domain, like stockholders and investors. Not just that, but it’s this logic that has been foundational in economic and environmental crises, things like the 2008 financial meltdown and climate change. Luckily there’s a way to change that and it’s called being-centered business. This approach is all about attending to the deep connection between a company and the world it operates in. All business leaders should adopt this approach and one that’s done so in stride is The Body Shop. For instance, Anita Roddick, the company’s founder, became famous by defending the environment as well as indigenous Amazonian tribes. In fact, it was this deep connection to the planet and its people that helped her build a billion-dollar corporation. The Upanishads tell another story about a boy who wants to understand Ātman, or the essence of the world and all beings. So, his father instructs him to place a piece of salt in a glass. The following day, the boy’s father asks if he can see the salt. When the boy says he can’t, the father tells him to sip the water and describe its taste. Naturally, the boy says that it’s salty. The point is that just like the salt invisibly permeates the entire glass, so does Ātman permeate all being. That means that since we’re all beings, we’re all part of Ātman. For instance, think back to the two birds: the one in the lower branches is focused on material objects and experience, but the bird on the top is different. It’s our universal self, in other words, Ātman. So, how can one embrace the higher bird? Using the author’s REAL road-map, a guide to becoming a Being-Centered leader. The map breaks down into four parts, each of which shows how a lower bird can reach for the top of the tree. The first step is to recognize that there’s something higher than yourself, the higher bird. Second, you must experience connection to that higher bird. Third is to anchor yourself in a stable vision of the higher bird while letting go of the lower bird’s fear. And finally, you embrace leadership by example for other birds. In this process it’s important to remember that the lower bird should be led by the higher one but both are necessary. That’s because being without doing has no outcome but doing without being has no higher purpose. Did you know that the english word right stems from the Vedic concept of Rta? It’s the idea about how worldly things fall into the right order. For instance, night follows day, summer comes after spring and a balance is maintained between gods and humans. The manifestation of this order is called Dharma, or the balance within and between systems. So, since business is a subsystem of other, greater systems, we all need a world in which we can conduct it. For instance, business is a subsystem of the economy, which is a subsystem of humanity, which is a subsystem of nature, which is a subsystem of Being. Each system follows another and is dependant on it. Therefore, without nature there could be no humanity, without humanity no economy and no economy would mean no business. And, since these systems are interdependent it’s essential that we keep them in mind when doing business. That’s because each subsystem can be considered a form of capital. For instance, there’s the material capital of goods and services, infrastructure and the stuff of which it’s built. Then there’s the human and social capital like human resources and the wealth developed through socializing. There’s also the natural capital of ecosystems which provide humans with necessities like food, air and water. And finally there’s being capital, that is the foundational values of a business. But the higher systems are prone to danger and it’s essential for a Being-Centered leader to employ the Dharma principle. That’s because if the capital of a system runs out, that system will run the risk of collapsing. So, if balance is not maintained within and between subsystems, the larger systems will be undermined. For instance, going back to the birds in the tree, the tree can be seen as the larger systems. Therefore, the goal of a Being-Centered leader is to protect the tree’s fruits and keep its roots firmly grounded, despite the desires of the lower birds. So we, as the lower bird, have seen that there’s a higher reality, a larger system that we’re inside of. But what we’ve seen so far is just a brief glimpse. Then how can we see further? By aspiring to a higher sense of self through the work we do. That’s because work is the realm in which we develop skills and the aspects of our material selves that are important to us. This fact is abundantly clear in startups, work environments in which people give their work everything they’ve got, often investing more hours to work than sleep or any other activity, with the drive to change the world in whatever way. It’s this ambition that business leaders can seize on to deepen our connection to the higher reality and here’s how: First of all, our material insecurities deter business leadership, making it difficult to access the higher reality. Most commonly this occurs through excessive planning meant to hide insecurities. For instance, when the author’s startup, Gandiva began facing problems, the author invested a lot of time in planning for different scenarios. But all this planning only laid bare the author’s crippling fear of failure. Luckily, he found another way to deal with his insecurities. When he felt insecure, he would remember the reasons he founded the company in the first place. In other words, he would get in touch with the sense of higher self that he’d set out to realize. As a result he was able to move from his constantly planning, efficiency obsessed self to a higher one, in the process finding a deeper sense of purpose. So, however sentimental his notes to self from that time may seem to him now, they represent the author’s path to connecting to his higher bird, his innermost motivation for opening the business. Another story told in the Upanishads is that of Bhrigu, a boy who endeavors to understand reality’s mystery. He meditates over what could be essential to humanity and comes to the realization that joy is foundational to our lives. Well, the same is true of business. That’s because joy means happy employees, and happy employees mean long term profitability. For instance, a business has lots of different stakeholders from customers to employees, but in the hectic capitalist world, plenty of companies devote all their energy and attention to the shareholders. The problem is that this strategy is unsustainable because it lacks dimensionality. So, by focusing more on their customers and employees, business can increase long term success and profits. For example, Southwest Airlines is famous for creating a fun work environment. In fact, the CEO, Herb Kelleher takes a lead role in this endeavor by planning pranks, like hiding in overhead bins to surprise employees. His actions have inspired employees to enjoy themselves at work with funny-in-flight announcements like “please do not leave children or spouses when you exit the plane”. And Southwest isn’t just having a good time, they’re also the most profitable U.S. airline and have enjoyed 39 consecutive years of profitability in an industry where such streaks are rare. So, happy employees are good business, but they aren’t the only people businesses should look out for. In fact, caring for the well-being of all humanity is also a path to success, whether it’s lending a hand to educational, social or environmental work. For instance, the Brazilian cosmetic company, Natura Cosméticos consistently ranks among the top five sustainable companies in the world. They’re deeply connected to the Amazonian tribes who live in the forests where they gather ingredients and are therefore committed to protecting this ecosystem. And that’s not all, the company also dominates the Brazilian beauty product market, seeing global sales of over $3 billion in 2011! Have you ever read an article on a major corporation’s quarterly report? It’s likely you have and that’s because the businesses of today are obsessed with pleasing shareholders. In fact, it’s common for successful business leaders to hold fast to this ideal. For instance, a study of over 70,000 quarterly conference calls on the topic of earnings found that leaders were more focused on producing short term profits to attract investors interested in quarterly earnings. However, there’s another route and it goes back to Being-centered leadership, which brings employees to the table as key stakeholders. Take Costco, a company whose ethics place employees before investors, paying them 40 to 70 percent more than competing businesses, like Wal-Mart, pay their employees. The result is that turnover after the first year is significantly lower: 6 percent at Costco compared to Wal-Mart’s 44 percent. That means Costco benefits from a more experienced and knowledgeable workforce. And that’s good for business. In fact, Costco’s returns are double the Standard & Poor’s index and 3.5 times higher than Wal-Mart’s. But don’t forget the customer. They can be included as stakeholders as well. A good example is the Tylenol Crisis of 1982. Here’s what happened: Bottles of the pain medication had been tampered with, the pills laced with lead. This resulted in the deaths of seven people in the Chicago area. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, Tylenol’s manufacturer, jumped into action, pulling 32 million bottles of U.S. shelves at a cost of $100 million. He even appeared on 60 Minutes to explain how the company was improving customer safety, a strategy that included a three month project to enhance anti-tamper packaging. The result? People who saw the show were 5 times more likely to choose a Johnson & Johnson product than those who didn’t. So, when Tylenol was reintroduced it almost immediately recouped its 35 percent market share. Having been inspired by the Upanishads, Mahatma Gandhi died in possession of only ten things, amongst them were an eating bowl, sandals and spectacles. His commitment was based on the intention to have as small a negative impact as possible; that the world is not here for us to take from, but to care for. Unfortunately, this sentiment is rarely shared by the businesses of today. In fact, business as it’s done today, doesn’t account for the true costs of its actions. For instance, we overuse nature, but don’t see the costs because the environment doesn’t send an invoice. So, at present, the global economy receives $72 trillion in “free goods”, like natural resources, per year and does annual damage that costs about $6.6 trillion. Not just that, but by 2050, the costs of that damage will likely have grown to $28 trillion! But to break free from this approach and embrace stewardship, we’ll need to train our sights on long term growth, a concept that we struggle to understand. That’s because compound aggregation of wealth, wherein capital grows exponentially each year, is difficult to comprehend and it’s even harder when trying to determine the effects something will have 100 years in the future. So, leading as a steward is all about understanding that nature and society aren’t free amenities for business to take, but resources that companies should care for. Take Eileen Fisher, founder of the eponymous fashion company and a superb steward. For instance, her company only employs organic natural fibers and makes durable clothes built to last, thereby reducing the impact on the environment. Additionally, they design many of their items for cold washing, which uses less energy. The company made 90 percent of its 2012 spring line in this way. But the business is also good to its employees. They all begin every day with yoga and receive $1000 annually as a wellness allowance to be spent on health. Have you ever heard of a sage? It’s essentially a wise person whose physical self, as represented by the lower bird, is perpetually connected to the higher bird. As a result, they can be extremely inspirational. In fact, even some CEOs are sages. Just take Paul Polman, CEO of a gigantic consumer goods corporation called Unilever. For Polman, the 2008 financial crisis was a “crisis of ethics” that lead him to reevaluate the way Unilever operates. He decided to stop quarterly reporting and focus the company on long-term growth. As a result, the shares of the company owned by short-term, profit hungry hedge funds dropped from 15 percent to 5 percent between 2009 and 2013. Not just that, but the company’s Sustainable Living Plan endeavors to double sales while cutting in half the corporation's environmental impacts and improving the nutritional value of its products. That means the company includes a variety of stakeholders including the natural world. And it’s profits? Well, during Polman’s tenure, Unilever’s share price increased 55 percent, revenues grew by 25 percent and operating costs were even reduced. But beyond even that, in 2012, Unilever was also ranked the world’s most sustainable company by Deloitte Innovation. So, CEOs can be sages, but so can investors. Just take The sage from Omaha, infamous U.S. investor Warren Buffet. His investment firm grew by over 587,000 percent between 1965 and 2012. That means if you invested $200 with Buffet in 1965, you’d be a millionaire by 2012. Compare that to the $15,000 your investment would have returned if invested in the S&P 500. You’re probably not surprised to hear that Buffet’s secret is a focus on long-term growth. But he’s also a profound humanist who has committed to donating his entire fortune upon his passing and pushed other billionaires to give away at least half of theirs. And, when Buffet makes the move to give environmental issues a central role in his investment philosophy it will have incorporated all perspectives. The key message in this book: There’s a different way to do business, a departure from the status quo that supports instead of harming nature and humanity. It’s called Being-Centered leadership and it works by linking the goals of a company to the interests of the planet in which it operates.  Actionable advice: Use rituals to connect to the higher reality. For ages, society has been connected by rituals conducted surrounding birth, marriage, death and countless other life events and rituals can likewise help business leaders connect to their higher reality of existence. It’s as simple as accessing the greater meaning embodied in rituals and using it to build a more inclusive identity and meaning for your business. Got feedback?

Obviously, it wouldn’t work. That tool was perfectly fit for the olden times, but nowadays we simply need something else. And it’s just the same with management strategies. Of course, those “ancient” strategies really aren’t all that old, but they’re obsolete, nonetheless. Over the last few decades, the character of work has changed fundamentally. We’ve delegated more and more plannable work to machines while human work has become increasingly creative and unpredictable. And often, this labor isn’t manual anymore; it’s mental, like writing computer programs. We’re manipulating ideas and knowledge instead of things. Work like this comes with rules of its own. In these blinks, you’ll discover new management strategies that will help you adapt to this transformed world of work. Additionally, you’ll learn about some popular management tools that never really worked from the get-go. You’ll find out what’s so bad about emails; why Amazon pays its employees to quit their jobs; and why, sometimes, companies are better off sharing their ideas with their competitors. We’ve all been taught that the customer is king, but the reality is that this saying no longer holds much water. That’s because your employees should be your main concern. And don’t worry about your clients, they won’t mind if you focus on the people who work for you. In fact, happy employees lead to happy and loyal customers. For instance, if you, as a manager, make certain that your employees love their jobs, they’ll be more motivated and therefore more likely to be friendly and engaging with customers. Don’t believe this? Well, it’s actually supported by research. Stephen Brown and Son Lam of the University of Houston published a 2008 study that found that employee job satisfaction is closely tied to happy customers. Their research showed that the clients of happy employees perceived the quality of their service to be much higher and, interestingly enough, the correlation holds up even for customers who have little employee contact. So it makes good financial sense to put your employees first. Because if you take care of them, they’ll do the same for your customers. How? Well, the key to happy, committed and creative workers is trust. That means you need to cut loose your rigid rules and avoid constantly checking up on your employees. After all, nobody likes being micromanaged. Instead, set a few simple rules that allow your employees to use their common sense, and trust them to excel with this freedom. For example, Netflix has no standard working times and no vacation policy. This means their employees set their own schedules according to their workloads and are free to take time off at their own discretion. And the same goes for travel expenses. The only rule there is to act in Netflix’s best interest. Amazingly, the result of this policy was actually a reduction in costs! Not just that, but it produced more engaged employees who wanted to invest in “their” company and who were less likely to move on. While some stories of lone wolf heroes stand out, behind every star there’s a hardworking team. So, if you’re hiring a new employee, don’t just look for stellar qualifications, make sure they also fit your company. After all, just because someone was successful at one company, doesn’t mean they will be at yours. In fact, research has found that even top performers who transfer companies don’t necessarily excel in their new workplace. That’s because they need the right team to enable them. Not just that, but your entire team’s performance can suffer if they don’t click with a new hire. For instance, the same research found that teams with a new star employee often find themselves facing new conflicts. So, while hiring is conventionally done by one or two people, if you want to hire an employee who will fit in, it’s important to have your whole team participate in the hiring process. For instance, when Whole Foods wants to hire a new worker, they let the prospective employee work with the team they’re applying to join. After a few weeks, the team votes on whether to bring the person on board. But regardless of your hiring process, there will always be some disengaged employees who are pulling your company down. If you want to cut these bad seeds loose, the best strategy is to pay them to quit. That’s because disengaged employees are unproductive, prone to skipping work and letting their bad attitudes rub off on others. The only reason these employees stay on with the company is that they’ve already invested so much in it. After all, it takes a lot of effort to get a job and receive the training you need to do it. As a result, employees have a hard time admitting to themselves that their efforts were poorly invested. But it’s easy to help these disengaged employees move on by offering them a decent bonus for quitting. Because if someone is truly disengaged, receiving a cash payment will help alleviate some of the pain they feel upon parting from their job. So, now that you know how to let disengaged employees go, it’s time to look at the changing character of work and what it means for management. In today’s economy, lots of us think for a living. In other words, rather than using our hands to make a physical product, we write essays or software, analyze systems and teach others. The term for such employees is knowledge workers, and their rise to prominence has a huge impact on the world of management. That’s because strict hierarchies, schedules and job descriptions are way too rigid for knowledge work, which means managers now need to make all organization temporal. After all, knowledge work, like developing an operating system, is far more unpredictable than manual labor in, say, a textile mill. It’s just too difficult to come up with a strict timetable for a creative pursuit. As a result, knowledge work tends to revolve around projects in which everyone’s tasks change as the project does. For instance, someone might be the leading product designer for one team, but join another to iron out issues with the packaging of an established product’s special edition. Basically, employees are organized around projects, not fixed job descriptions. That means that for modern companies that depend on flexibility, rigid organizational structures and work descriptions just don’t make sense. In fact, your company will be much more flexible and productive if employees have the ability to make their own decisions. That’s because they’ll be able to react immediately to circumstances that change their tasks instead of waiting for a manager to give the go-ahead. For example, if there’s a new project, employees can organize themselves into project groups. But for this to work, you need to ensure that everyone in the company knows what skillsets their co-workers possess, even if they are in different departments. Having this knowledge is crucial to the development of flexible, well-running teams. In fact, research has found that workers who feel that they’re in control are the most productive. That’s because when people act autonomously, they develop intrinsic motivation. That is, their motivation comes from within, not from an external source like pay, praise or prestige. It might seem as though a manager is obsolete in this context, with workers organizing a lot on their own. But the function of a modern manager has simply changed to enabling employees to achieve this self-organization. For instance, by providing the appropriate environment. You’ll learn how to accomplish that next. Facebook was proud to announce that they’d built the biggest open office ever to exist. Is this the future of work? Well, when designing workspaces, it’s best to pair open offices with closed spaces, giving your employees a choice in their environment. After all, while open offices are great, facilitating communication and teamwork, a 2005 study by the researchers So Young Lee and Jay Brand, indicates that people in open offices complain about noise and lack of privacy – and they take more sick days. So, since both open and closed offices have their advantages, your best bet is to offer both. Interestingly enough, that’s exactly the strategy of companies like Facebook, who are in love with the idea of open offices. The system works because employees can switch office types depending on the task they’re currently working on and their personal preferences. And according to the same study, this type of personal control over work environment really satisfies employees. So, the hype around open offices tends to only talk up their pros. In just the same way, people tend to overrate the benefits of email. The truth is, limiting the use of email helps your employees focus. That’s because the inbox is one of the biggest distractions of modern society. For instance, according to a study, the average employee checks their inbox about 36 times per hour. Obviously checking your email this often is going to disrupt your work. Just imagine trying to write an article or do accounting while being drawn to your email every two minutes! That’s why the French technology company Atos SE limited the in-house use of email, replacing it with a custom-designed internal social network. The network leaves people to actively seek out the information they need, rather than constantly bombarding them with unsolicited content. So, working environment and style are key, but moving forward you’ll need a broader view. Everybody knows about Silicon Valley, but have you ever heard of its rival region, Boston’s Route 128? This tech center was a leader in the field long before Silicon Valley until its love for non-compete clauses hindered its success. Why? Non-compete clauses are bad for business because they prevent companies from learning from one another. Here’s how. Basically, this legal tool prevents employees of a company from working for a competitor if they quit, thus preventing former employees from spreading company secrets. Sounds good, right? Well, not really. Companies rely on the flow of knowledge and ideas. And we all know that ideas flow through people as they network, talk and cooperate. So, if employees are allowed to move around from company to company, they’ll build knowledge and ideas from all over the spectrum and connect other employees with the experience they’ve gained. That means amazing networks that can span an entire region. In fact, that’s exactly what happened in Silicon Valley. Companies in the region allowed for the free flow of information and the huge amount of input it generated meant incredible innovation for everyone as they used other people’s ideas as stepping stones to their own inventions. Simply put, collaboration helped the region thrive. However, with a non-compete clause, you cut yourself off from the knowledge of others. That was the case with Route 128. Non-competes became widespread in Boston and, as companies locked their doors, innovation shut down too. Eventually, Route 128 was struggling economically and couldn’t attract the top talent it needed. So, obviously companies compete with one another, but they should collaborate as well. To foster connections you should maintain contact with employees who are no longer with you or who are soon to move on. That’s because research has shown that companies with close ties to other businesses are more likely to prosper. Building an alumni network will help your company gain a better footing in an industry network. But maybe your company is already well connected. Don’t sweat it; there’s plenty more you can do to make it thrive. OK, so you’ve already learned a ton about the most innovative management strategies, but two more policies are definitely worth your while. The first is about those dreaded performance rankings. After all, performance rankings just don’t work the way they should, and you’re better off going with different feedback mechanisms. For instance, most companies rank their employees once a year. It’s a ton of work for little payoff. In fact, Microsoft discovered that performance ranking actually killed ideas, creativity and innovation. That’s because employees were so concerned with their rank that they were scared to make or admit to mistakes and avoided any challenging tasks. Not just that, but employees were competing with one another rather than collaborating. So, Microsoft decided to give its staff personal, timely feedback instead. A few times a year, a Microsoft manager meets individually with his employees to go over how well they have collaborated with others, what they want to learn and achieve before their next meeting and what they did to accomplish the goals they set at the last one. With feedback like this, everyone feels more fairly assessed, comparison between peers is less evident and employees are encouraged to build their skills. Remember, timely feedback is important, and your employees want to know how well they’re performing. But lots of them also wonder how much their co-workers make, and it actually makes good sense to have transparency on this issue. That’s because being open about wages will show your employees that you’re fair and prevent them from incorrectly envying their colleagues. After all, if you keep quiet about your pay scale, your employees might get the misguided idea that they’re being shortchanged compared to their co-workers. This will breed envy and prevent bonding as well as collaboration. For instance, at Whole Foods, any employee can look up the performance data and salary of their peers. As a result, the company enjoys amazing teamwork. The key message in this book: Modern knowledge work is about creativity, collaboration and engagement – the exact opposite of classical management strategies. So, instead of strict schedules and hierarchies, employees now need autonomy and flexibility. Care for your employees and you’ll be amazed by the payoff.  Actionable Advice: Keep your organizational chart flexible.  Do you keep an organizational chart? Good, keep it up but use it as a rearrangeable board. That’s because people’s roles in the modern economy aren’t determined by job descriptions, but by the flexibility of project-oriented work. That makes trying to squeeze your company’s organizational structure into a permanent graph impossible. So, keep your chart, but use a pencil or other erasable utensil to write it. Got feedback?

If Walmart were a country, its GDP would be greater than Norway’s. The company is the world’s largest commercial employer; and it manages just slightly fewer people than does the Chinese military. Yet how did Walmart, a company with hundreds of billions of dollars in profits each year, secure its market position and its success? These blinks put you ringside to watch the company’s stratospheric rise, explaining how an efficient and masterful combination of technology, management and strategy made Walmart what it is today. Yet you’ll see too that what goes up can come down – and that Walmart’s toughest challenges are ahead of it.   In these blinks, you’ll discover why during negotiations you should go canoeing with your enemy; how strawberry Pop-Tarts helped Florida cope with a hurricane; and why Walmart may in the near future either win big or fail miserably. How did Walmart become the largest retailer in the world? There are two core principles responsible for the company’s success: low prices and broad selection. Let’s start with price. Walmart’s pricing policy is famous in its own right. The company’s policy is called EDLP – Every Day Low Prices – and Walmart works hard to deliver on that promise. But how do they manage to do so? In a word, efficiency. Walmart is ruthless in taking every possible measure to cut its costs and lower its prices. Here’s just one example: In the early 1990s, deodorant was packaged in cardboard boxes. Walmart saw this as an unnecessary cost, as the extra packaging took up precious shelf space and wasted fuel in transport, making shipping more costly. So Walmart asked deodorant suppliers to sell their products without boxes. And as a result, the retailer saved 5 cents on every deodorant sold! Scale also plays an important role in Walmart’s commitment to low prices. Buying and selling higher volumes of goods allow the company to reduce prices. This may seem counterintuitive, in that we typically assume that selling a product at a lower price leads to lower profits. But that’s not necessarily true, as Walmart knows well. Let’s say you buy an item for 60 cents and sell it for $1, rather than $1.20. By pricing the item lower, you’ll sell three times as many items. So although you’re earning less per item, you earn more overall. It’s also worth noting that there’s another advantage to scale. In Walmart’s case, the larger it becomes, the more bargaining power it has with suppliers. Walmart has such market clout that suppliers simply can’t afford not to place their products on the retailer’s shelves. Thus, suppliers sell to Walmart at lower prices, which allows the retailer to pass on the savings to customers. Have you ever visited a Walmart store? You can’t help but be astounded by the enormity of the store itself, the endless aisles of goods. A typical Walmart Supercenter carries around 100,000 products in a 54,000 square-foot space. In other words, Walmart’s assortment of retail goods is without peer. This is especially astonishing if you consider that Walmart first got its start in mostly rural areas of the United States. The company opened its first store in the small town of Rogers, Arkansas. What sort of business strategy is that, opening in a rural outpost? Walmart management realized that rural, often low-income areas were neglected by other retail chains. Conventional corporate wisdom assumes that unless there are 50,000 potential consumers in a general area, a big store won’t turn a profit. Thus rural areas were left dependant on smaller, local retail stores that carried a limited range of products and closed on Sundays, to boot. But Walmart proved that a giant corporate-owned retailer could not only survive but thrive in rural areas. Walmart realized that customers would be willing to drive 70 miles or more to buy a significantly discounted lawn mower, for instance. By carrying a broad assortment of goods catering to every possible need, Walmart could reach customers who lived both near and far. Walmart also introduced its own private labels, such as Sam’s Choice, to sell alongside popular national brands. Private label products are essentially equivalent to well-known brands but are less expensive, as the costs of advertising and marketing are considerably reduced. It’s worth noting that although having a broad assortment of products benefits Walmart, there’s a drawback to having too much choice. That is, customers might get overwhelmed and consequently buy nothing at all. Sometimes less is more! For instance, when Walmart Canada removed two peanut butter brands from its shelves, sales of the remaining three brands rose. Another factor that makes Walmart successful is its approach in working with suppliers. Unlike many other retailers, Walmart doesn’t work with middlemen. This policy came at the urging of Walmart founder Sam Walton, who disdained distributors. Middlemen weren’t creating anything of value, he reasoned, but were simply getting paid to sell products produced by someone else. Walton rightly surmised that by bargaining directly with manufacturers, the retailer could save money. Thus Walmart developed its own supply chain capabilities and cultivated direct relationships with vendors. In the early days, however, this wasn’t easy. Walmart’s negotiations with suppliers were ruthless, with each party fighting tooth and nail to get the better deal. But this changed one day, as Walton was on a canoeing trip with friends. As it happened, the vice president of Procter & Gamble, a consumer goods manufacturer, had also been invited. Over the course of a friendly conversation, the two realized they had the same objective – that is, creating the best possible experience for the consumer – yet had different ways of achieving it. They also discussed the fact that Walmart and Procter & Gamble were operating with basically zero mutual trust and barebones communication. To change the situation for the better, the two managers created a Walmart/P&G team to improve communication and collaboration between their companies. These kinds of close supplier relationships eventually became the rule and not the exception for Walmart. Even though the retailer never fully abandoned its ruthless negotiation style, Walmart has expanded its relationships with suppliers, participating in product development, test marketing, package design and data sharing. Ultimately these collaborative relationships have led to increased efficiency and lower prices. For example, Walmart shares data on item-level sales with General Electric, so that the supplier knows exactly how many products to deliver and ship to Walmart every day. Walmart’s eventual logistics mastery started with a simple problem. Since its first stores were located in rural, isolated areas in the southern United States, many distributors found it unprofitable to deliver goods to Walmart stores. But Walmart made a virtue out of necessity: If no one wanted to deliver to its stores, the company would do it instead, setting up its own distribution centers, complete with a fleet of trucks. Today, the scale of Walmart’s logistics empire is unprecedented. It has more than 40 regional distribution centers, each over one million square feet. And each distribution center works around the clock to deliver goods to between 75 and 100 stores within a radius of 250 miles. What’s more, it takes some 85,000 employees to keep the entire logistics train moving along. You might wonder: how on earth can Walmart manage such an operation? Well, it all comes down to technology. Walmart from the start embraced state-of-the-art technology and supply chain innovations. In 2006, Walmart introduced the Remix project to improve merchandise flow and availability rates. In the past, Walmart had two different distribution networks: one for dry groceries, like cereal, and another for household merchandise, like paper towels. Both of these networks however included fast-selling items and slow-moving ones. Yet Walmart realized that the slow-moving products were gumming up the works, preventing other faster-selling products from getting to shelves quickly, possibly leading to losses in sales. So Walmart set up High Velocity Distribution Centers for fast-moving goods in any product category. When a store is aware that a product is running low, it sends data to the closest distribution center. Trucks are packed with the required goods and brought immediately to the Walmart shelf, with no time lost. Walmart’s focus on technological innovation has put it ahead of the competition, as it has made the retailer much more efficient, therefore enabling better service and lowering prices. The company’s technology tracks every single item in its stores. And when shelves run empty, a computer automatically alerts a warehouse that an order needs to be placed and shipped. Importantly, this system generates unparalleled amounts of data, enabling astounding real-time inventory visibility, data which has an immediate impact on merchandise planning. Here’s a fantastic example. When Hurricane Ivan was about to hit Florida, Walmart’s algorithms predicted there would be high demand for Kellogg’s Strawberry Pop-Tart toaster pastries. The retailer’s computers notified distribution centers and the products arrived in time to allow Florida families to stock up on Pop-Tarts before the storm. Yet the retailer doesn’t simply keep its data to itself to benefit, but openly shares some information with its suppliers. This way, suppliers not only know which products sell well but also can pull accurate information about which items sell well on which days and in which stores. This enables suppliers to plan their production more efficiently and better coordinate inventory levels with Walmart. With this sort of streamlining, Walmart can reduce not only waste but also the labor costs associated with storing inventory, which all translates to cheaper prices for the end customer. Tight relationships with loyal suppliers. An end-to-end logistics empire. State-of-the art technology. These are the reasons why Walmart is at the top of its game. But what’s ahead for the retailer? Read on to find out. Walmart may be the biggest retailer in the world, but the company is still far from reaching its full potential. There are still two large categories of potential customers to which Walmart hasn’t successfully reached out: residents in U.S. cities and international shoppers. As we mentioned earlier, Walmart got its start in rural, lower-income areas. To grow, Walmart needs to expand to urban centers, especially as there are many underserved urban areas that lack access to fresh, affordable groceries, for example. Since some 23 million consumers live in such areas, the strategy holds huge potential! And while Walmart plans to open 300 stores in urban areas by 2016, success is not guaranteed. As of today there is not a single Walmart in New York City. And it’s easy to see why: Walmart Supercenters are gigantic, and the real estate costs alone would be astronomical! There is a simple solution, however, which is to make the stores smaller. And that’s precisely why the company introduced Walmart Express in 2011. At just 15,000 square feet, these stores will still be able to offer three times the product selection of an ordinary grocer. The company is also taking seriously its global expansion plans. Walmart International is already active in 26 markets, making it the third-largest retailer in the world, behind Walmart U.S. and Carrefour. But there’s still more that the company could do to reach out to some 4 billion untapped global customers. The company’s long-term potential, especially in countries like China, India and Brazil, is huge. For now, Walmart International has entered such markets but doesn’t yet dominate them. In the future, however, Walmart International might surpass its U.S. counterpart as the biggest retailer in the world. How to reach out to new customers isn’t Walmart’s only challenge. A more serious challenge already looms: analysts expect Amazon to overtake Walmart as the world’s biggest retailer by 2024. There are two reasons why this is a possibility. First, Walmart has criminally neglected e-commerce. And second, Amazon is beating Walmart at its own game when it comes to price and assortment. Walmart’s online sales today hover near $6 billion, which is small when compared to Amazon’s $34 billion in annual sales. The question is, how could Walmart miss such an obvious source of revenue? In part, Walmart has focused its attention on expanding its Supercenters, which in general perform quite well. But there’s also another reason for Walmart ignoring the internet. A decade ago, when the retailer tried experimenting with online technologies, its core customers weren’t interested. In 2004, Walmart launched an online music store to compete with iTunes. However, since the typical, low-income Walmart shopper didn’t yet have internet access, the project was a flop. So Walmart has its reasons for coming late to the online game. But that’s not the only factor at play. The second reason Amazon may surpass Walmart is because it’s already surpassing the retailer at its core strengths, offering lower prices and a broader assortment of products. Consider this example: when Wells Fargo compared two baskets of goods in 2011 – one purchased at Walmart, the other on Amazon – the financial services company found that the basket from Amazon was nine percent cheaper, even when factoring in shipping costs. Another comparison found that when it comes to assortment, Walmart “only” offered 96 different types of camcorders, whereas Amazon offered 2,016. And this trend holds true more generally, in that the online retailer offers approximately 14 times more products than Walmart! In other words, Amazon is not only a fierce competitor but also a worthy foe. The key message in this book: If there’s a single secret to Walmart’s success, it’s that the company is ruthlessly efficient in all matters. Whether maintaining a broad mix of products, managing logistics, holding negotiations with suppliers or mastering state-of-the-art technology, efficiency is Walmart’s key organizing principle, all for the sake of offering customers the lowest prices possible.  Actionable advice: Be cheap! Walmart executives are frugal and have to follow certain rules to keep costs down. For instance, when a Walmart executive travels to meet a supplier to arrange a new purchase, the trip’s costs have to be one percent less than the money earned on the deal.

The internet has opened up new and ever faster modes of communication; we are now more connected than ever before. This fact is just one of many that have fundamentally changed how the world does business. Yet increased connectivity has also raised new issues. What used to be a regional or local problem can now turn into a global crisis almost overnight. How does a business navigate these tricky waters? These blinks show you how business is done today and what you can do to revolutionize how you participate, by re-thinking everything from managing employees, innovation, accountability and more. In these blinks, you’ll discover how a shower footrest can be considered the height of innovation; how Google and Apple stay ahead of the competition; and why you shouldn’t think about what to build, but build how to think. Recent decades have witnessed great change, but such change has also raised the stakes. In our rapidly moving, globalized world, leaders have far more power and responsibility than ever before. And a lot more to answer for if something goes wrong. Global leaders must be conscious of the impact their decisions have. One bad decision could lead to a compromised food product, for example. Yet where once such a slip-up might have just affected a small town, today the health of hundreds of thousands of people could be at risk. Many leaders are already grappling with how an interconnected, international economic system can amplify the fallout from a decision. Sometimes it’s necessary to pay up to contain a mistake before it spirals out of control. In 2011, for example, French and German banks moved to bail out the financial systems of Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain spending almost $900 billion in an attempt to maintain the euro’s stability and prevent an even larger currency crisis. Think about today’s global leaders. Do you trust them to keep small mistakes from turning into global catastrophes? The internet and other new technologies have become effective tools to drive a global sense of consciousness and, importantly, keep world leaders in check. Injustices are harder to sweep under the rug; news stories travel around the world in the blink of an eye. As a result, the pressure to create change and increase social responsibility is far greater. In 2008, Coca-Cola came under fire for using unsustainable methods to extract water from a drought-stricken region in India. As the news spread, Coke sales dipped all over the world. The then company CEO announced the company would become “water neutral” by 2020.   Yet as a global society we can no longer rely on government or private sector policies as the sole method of damage control. Read on to find out what sort of change really needs to happen. Did you make a mistake today? Forget to do something you said you would, or fail to notice something you should have? Humans make mistakes; and so do policy makers, bankers and even those in government, as all of us are human. We also, as humans, try to justify our actions in an attempt to appear ethical, regardless of how much power, money or responsibility we may have. The 2008 economic crisis wasn’t just about money – it dealt too with moral and ethical issues. Dishonesty, arrogance, greed and denial were rife among global bankers. Those in the industry or working with the industry wound themselves up in a web of morally questionable practices. Mortgage lenders approved loans for people who had no jobs, income or assets. Bankers on Wall Street bundled these faulty loans into securities that were sold as solid investments. Investors convinced their clients such products would guarantee above-average returns. And ratings agencies craved new business so badly that their objectivity was compromised. So how did so many people get it so wrong? Capitalism is an ideology that brings extraordinary privileges. But if the capitalistic system isn’t based on or led by moral principles, everyone loses. We need a way of doing business that doesn’t exhaust our natural resources, and understands people not just as consumers but as human beings. So how can we create change? The next blinks will explain how. Large-scale, successful companies these days are struggling to keep up. Bureaucracy and its principles of discipline and stability are no longer enough to keep a business afloat in a rapidly changing, hypercompetitive market. Add to this increasing calls for social accountability and you’ve got a challenge like nothing companies have faced before. So how can a successful company adapt? First, it’s time to do away with your company’s top-down, bureaucratic structure. Sure, many CEOs and managers will tell you that they support personal growth, diversity, mentoring and empowering employees. The reality, however, is you cannot achieve any of this if bureaucratic methods remain the rule. We see this in the way that initially creative and innovative companies change after becoming successful. These companies protect their success, and instead of challenging the status quo, they start defending it! This is a perfect formula for market decline. Here’s just one example. Despite Samsung’s multimillion-dollar research budget and army of talented employees, the technology company is still not the leading LCD television brand in the United States. Vizio, however, is – and is a company with less than 200 employees and a focus on purchasing flat-screen suppliers based in Asia. What’s more, Vizio claims some $2.5 billion in sales. The lesson here? No matter how big your brand name, a great brand can’t always top a truly ingenious business model! Your best bet for success is to encourage innovation in your workplace. How do you do this? The secret is to always encourage wild ideas and keep people talking. And the more ideas, the better. This way you don’t waste time thinking about “what to build.” Instead, you’ll “build to think!” Innovation is today’s buzzword. But what exactly does it mean to be innovative? It’s not about throwing all your resources at a single project expected to be the big game-changer. In fact, effective innovation comes down to discovering those small details that make and keep your clients happy. As open markets encourage fierce competition, the window of opportunity to come up with something totally different from your competitors is actually quite small. But what if you managed to convert a low-cost product in a crowded market into a highly valued experience? Virgin America did this. Even though domestic air travel is a very competitive market, since Virgin’s launch in 2007, the airline has been voted consistently as America’s best. How did the company do it? Simple: by remaining aware of the little things that make customers happy. Virgin offers comfortable seats, touch screens so you can order healthy food directly from your seat, pleasant music in the washrooms and Wi-Fi on every flight, plus a fun, energetic flight crew. Virgin demonstrates that innovation isn’t always about coming up with something groundbreaking or even genius, but instead being consistently in tune with a client’s unspoken needs and wants. But how can you tackle unspoken needs if you don’t know what they are? This is where innovation comes in. Brainstorm with your staff to find creative solutions that turn little details into parts of an overall memorable experience.   Consider this innovation: a triangular shelf some 20 inches off the floor in the corner of a hotel shower. What for? So a woman has a place to rest her foot while she shaves her legs. Such an innovation costs virtually nothing, yet is highly effective in creating a positive and long-lasting impression for your clients. If you think a CEO alone should be the company commander and controller, then it’s time to change your thinking! It’s time to realize that values are created by employees and customers. Take Apple and Google, two companies that are the best in their respective fields. How did the companies get to where they are? By merging core business values with new thinking. Both companies have built natural, flexible hierarchies, where status is determined not by the position you have but by the contributions you make. This motivates people, both professionally and personally, to innovate. Google in particular has succeeded at learning early, inexpensively and quickly. Through simulations, role-playing and cost-effective mock-ups, customers can interact with early-stage ideas to give Google real-time feedback. This automatically gives the company a competitive edge. True, some of today’s most-successful companies are young and have been revolutionary from the start. But what matters is that these companies have stayed on top of the game. So how can you make sure you are and stay competitive? First, you have to constantly challenge the status quo. This mind-set will give you access to a whole range of new consumers. Just a decade ago, for example, playing video games meant hanging out on the couch – until Nintendo Wii changed the game completely! Second, you should create diverse work teams with people of different ages, genders, cultures, skills and industry experience. If you do, you’ll have access to different types of customers, giving you far greater insight into new market segments. Finally, remember to keep your ego in check. Don’t hesitate to ask staff or consider different opinions if you’ve got a crucial decision pending. You might be surprised at the blind spots you didn’t even know you had! Nothing in our history could have prepared us for the overwhelming pace of change that characterizes today’s business world. The Industrial Revolution in the mid 1800s established our current business models in which obedience and discipline are expected. It’s taken us a long time to shift away from this mindset. We no longer need elites to set the tone or course of discussion. Instead, people all over the world can organize independently online. The workplace too should therefore be revolutionized! So what can the internet teach the world of work? On the internet, authority originates from the bottom. People become influential based on the acceptance and respect they receive from others.   If you post a self-made video on YouTube, in seconds it can be viewed around the world, and yet no one would think to ask whether you went to film school. What’s more, bloggers and Facebook users are now empowered by the access they have to individuals, companies and governments, access that used to be prohibited or just not possible a decade ago. The way we think about transparency and reward systems are changing. People are no longer just driven by money, but recognition and accomplishment are seen as currencies now too. So what got us here? The fact is that people are intrinsically passionate. This is what you’ll see if you just give a person an open space where she can develop her talents and allow her creativity to flourish. Just think of how much time people worldwide have invested in editing Wikipedia articles, building free apps or penning advice blogs, all just to feel recognized and appreciated. And it’s this kind of passion we should foster in the workplace! The key message in this book: Amid a rapidly changing society fraught with increasing responsibility, companies often struggle to stay ahead. But by recognizing that passion, innovation, creativity and flexibility are what matter most, you can be certain of success even in an uncertain world.  Actionable advice: Remember the human side of things. The next time you find yourself in a moral quandary over work or what you’re earning, imagine that your capital is your mother’s life savings fund and that she is the only shareholder. See your boss as an older sibling, and your employees as your best, dearest friends. Think of clients as your children. By making the impersonal more personal, you can be sure you won’t trade long-term benefits for a quick payout. Most importantly, imagine you’re already rich, and are only working because you’re passionate about your job! Suggested further reading: Decisive by Chip and Dan Heath The book identifies the main issues that typically stand in the way of decision making: a narrow view on our problems, short-term emotions, and overconfidence when it comes to predicting the future.

Kottler","summary":"Do you dislike your job? Do you dread your morning alarm, that shrill herald of the day’s drudgery? If so, you’re not alone. In fact, you’re in the majority: an astonishing 80 percent of American workers report being disengaged or dissatisfied with their job. What’s the reason behind this depressing statistic? One of the biggest factors is bad leaders. No one wants to face day after day of being led by someone who neither listens, extends trust nor thinks there’s more than one way to do things. There has to be a better way to lead, right? Well, there is. Leaders can not only help employees manage the nine-to-five; they can inspire them to solve problems and reach new levels of success and work satisfaction. In these blinks, you’ll discover the three most important characteristics of a great leader; why phones kill effective meetings; and what Horatio Nelson and Sir Francis Drake can teach us about leadership. If you’ve been working long enough, it’s only a matter of time before you end up with a bad boss. But have you ever asked yourself what it is that makes some people so bad at leading effectively? One trait common to bad bosses is that they believe they know everything. Great leaders, in contrast, know that, especially in today’s chaotic, fast-changing environment, it’s impossible to know it all. Michael Skelly is an experienced leader, responsible for launching several successful companies focused on renewable energy. While earning his MBA at an Ivy League school, Skelly realized that, though his classmates were bright, they were often too scared to ask questions, since asking would reveal a lack of knowledge. At the same time, Skelly found that these classmates all respected his willingness to speak up and admit his ignorance. Skelly now incorporates this refreshing honesty into all his business dealings, and when asked about his greatest strength as a leader, he points to his ability to ask questions and admit when he doesn’t understand something. Skelly’s example also shows that being a humble leader is important, especially today, when more organizations are moving toward democratic and decentralized leadership structures. Universities and hospitals, as well as pharmaceutical and technology companies, are all favoring participatory leadership, which brings employees from every level into the decision-making process. Rather than adhering to the traditional model of having everyone obey orders passed down from on high, these organizations are implementing more democratic and collaborative structures. Appropriately enough, the author has found that it’s within these democratically-run organizations that know-it-all leaders are most resented. Doctors, professors, software engineers and scientists lodge the most complaints about bosses who stick their noses in their work. So a good leader isn’t one who barks orders or thinks they have all the right answers. A good boss knows when to stand back and trust that their staff has what it takes to make decisions and do the job they’ve been hired to do. Have you ever been in a meeting and suddenly realized that most people aren’t really listening? Sure, no one is whispering to his neighbor or passing notes, but each pair of eyes is directed toward a laptop, a tablet or phones. All good leaders know that good teamwork requires clear communication between team members. And many recent studies have shown that mobile phones can prevent your team from achieving the quality communication it needs to succeed. One such study found that the mere presence of a phone – whether it’s resting on the table or in a person’s hand – can adversely affect the way people interact during a meeting, even if the phone is switched off! According to the researchers, the presence of a phone made people more likely to keep discussions light and focused on non-controversial or insignificant topics. Not only that, but a visible phone also reduced feelings of empathy between the participants. So, if you want to hold meaningful meetings and honest discussions, you should take control and make your conference room a phone-free zone. You can either be up-front about your policy, requesting that all team members come to the meeting “naked” – that is, without any devices. Or, if that doesn’t work, you can bring out a basket at the start of each meeting and collect everyone’s phone. If you go this route, it’s good to remind people ahead of time to bring pen and paper, in case anyone uses their device to take notes. It’s also advised that leaders keep their phones out of sight when they’re in a negotiation situation. Researchers have found that, when leaders paid attention to their devices during important negotiations, they were seen as less trustworthy by their counterparts in the discussion. It may go without saying these days, but when looking back at US presidents, we see a remarkable range of different personalities. For instance, Lyndon B. Johnson was an outgoing and playful type; he and his secret-service agents would sometimes play hide-and-seek. Whereas Calvin Coolidge was so introverted that guests to the White House used to make wagers about who could prompt him to say something during dinner. With personalities so vastly different, you may wonder if the leaders of the free world – the people who epitomize leadership – share any common attributes. But when we take a closer look, we can pinpoint three leadership attributes that we can learn from. In fact, these attributes were even valued during Plato and Aristotle’s time. And today, they continue to be considered qualities that separate great leaders from mediocre ones. The first is self-confidence. Great leaders are calm under pressure, clear about their personal and professional beliefs and secure in their ability to get results. Second is a proactive spirit. This typically appears in leaders as optimism, enthusiasm and helpfulness. Likewise, great leaders are diligent and reliable, and when they say they’ll get something done, you can trust that they’ll follow through. In other words, they back up their words and intentions with action. The third attribute is relational capacity. This one manifests itself in leaders as agreeableness, empathy and sensitivity to the needs of staff. As a result, the best leaders inspire a sense of loyalty and commitment in their followers, who aren’t merely dedicated to the cause, or the company, but to the leader as a person. Now, just because a leader has one or two of these attributes doesn’t make him a good leader. Indeed, the worst bosses tend to have too much self-confidence, otherwise known as hubris. This is often the result of their experiencing success in some other context, which then goes to their head, causing them to feel overconfident in their abilities. This hubris can have disastrous results. In fact, hubris is what doomed the Russian invasions of both Napoleon and Hitler. Filled with an overinflated sense of pride, they ignored their advisors and doomed their armies to failure. Does this sound familiar? Your boss chews you out in front of your peers, causing you to feel publicly humiliated, even though you were just following orders! You then return home, fuming with anger. And as you walk through the door, you see the kitchen’s a mess – and this pushes you over the edge: you get upset with your partner or children, causing confusion and injury all around. There is plenty of research that shows how bad treatment from a leader makes employees more likely to take out their frustrations on other people, particularly those at home. The employee might even take it out on a pet, which is why this chain of events is known as kick the dog behavior. The problem isn’t only that a hurt employee may vent anger on innocent people or pets, but also that bad, dysfunctional leadership may cause employees to adopt this style of behavior in their own life. So a mom who is verbally abused by her boss at work will use these same hurtful tactics in her parenting, and her kids will grow up and perhaps bequeath this bad behavior to their offspring. The home can also become a dumping ground for hostile emotions when an employee’s workplace is too oppressive, with no room for frustrations to be aired. And, sadly enough, research shows that venting pent-up anger on loved ones does indeed make us feel better. Or, as neurology professor Robert Sapolsky put it, “Giving ulcers can help you avoid getting them.” To put the point in more scientific terms, studies have found that aggressive behavior directed at others, after you’ve experienced similar aggression from someone else, can effectively lower your stress hormones. So it’s not uncommon for people to soothe their damaged self-esteem by lashing out at others, and it’s our leaders’ responsibility to make sure the fuse never gets lit. If you have any familiarity with Britain’s most distinguished military leaders of yore, then you’ve probably heard of Admiral Horatio Nelson, the naval hero who died at the Battle of Trafalgar. Nelson is particularly famous for breaking all the traditional rules of warfare and still inspiring utter loyalty from his crew. It’s not easy to be an unconventional leader and still command the loyalty and trust of your staff. So how did Nelson do it? Quite simply, Admiral Nelson inspired his crew by forging powerful bonds and demonstrating that there was nothing he wouldn’t do to keep his men safe and victorious. This brings us to the next essential piece of great leadership: the creation of trusting, reciprocal relationships. Compared to other leadership techniques and strategies, these types of relationships are paramount. Studies have found that all other techniques combined generally account for less than 15 percent of a team’s successful results. The majority of positive leadership results derive from trust, caring and other mutually supportive bonds that come from a strong relationship between leaders and followers. So, if you aspire to Admiral Nelson-like levels of leadership, don’t focus on clever ways to intervene in the work of your staff. Focus on building a healthy working environment that relies on trust and fosters caring attitudes. A great way to do this is to reduce inequality between different wage groups. These days, the average CEO is paid three hundred times more than the lowest paid staffer. And researchers have suggested that this extreme inequality is a major contributor to the distance that employees and executives will experience in their relationships with one another. And this distance, in turn, has been shown to be responsible for much of the bullying and aggressive behavior within a company. In some organizations, the massive pay gap will be beyond your control. But in these situations you can try to compensate by finding ways to make sure your staff feels valued. Over a relatively short period of time, we’ve experienced profound changes in our everyday technology. Today’s smartphones are just as powerful as room-sized computers were a few decades ago. And these technological breakthroughs have come with tremendous advantages, but they’ve also brought significant stress to leaders who are now expected to react to situations with a speed that previous generations would have found absurd. Nevertheless, it’s crucial that effective leaders stay cool under pressure, even if they might be panicking on the inside. Another legendary British leader was the sea captain Sir Francis Drake. In the 1500s, when word arrived that the mighty ships of the Spanish Armada had been spotted on the horizon, Sir Francis didn’t overreact. At the time, he was playing a round of lawn bowling and with utter confidence he said, “time enough to play the game and thrash the Spaniards afterwards.” He wasn’t being glib. Rather, he knew that, were he to panic, his men would panic, too, and the battle might be lost before it even began. Though he might have been filled with dread, he projected confidence and made it seem that everything was under control. Like Sir Francis, a good leader will always stay composed, even in the direst of circumstances. Fortunately, there are ways for leaders to lessen the amount of stress they’re experiencing. One of the best things a leader can do is remember that many factors are out of their control, and that it’s futile to spend time and energy wrestling with things that can’t be controlled. So keep in mind that how others react, how the economy is performing and whatever happened in the past are all beyond your influence. Whenever you find yourself obsessing over something, take a mental step back and be honest about whether you can truly do anything about the situation. It can be difficult not to worry about certain things, even if you know those worries are of little help. So try to keep a healthy perspective and remember that life is short, and it would be a shame to spend too much of it fretting about things that you simply can’t alter. The key message in this book: Great leaders take charge of their own life, habits and behavior. The keys to effective and successful leadership include being honest about your limitations, exhibiting self-confidence and creating strong bonds of trust. With these attributes in mind, today’s leaders can take their team to new levels of success. Actionable advice: Process failure constructively. Research has shown that the key to successful leadership is not to avoid making mistakes, but to instead learn from mistakes and understand what it is that should be avoided in the future. In order to turn your mistakes into valuable lessons, ask yourself whether there were warning signs prior to the mistakes you’ve made. You can also turn to trusted colleagues and ask them the same question to see if they noticed any warning signs. Then, compare your perceptions with those of your colleagues to make sure you don’t end up repeating the same mistakes. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

How does one recruit the right person? Who is the perfect fit? It might seem like a simple undertaking, but consider this: half the recruiting companies end up hiring individuals who aren’t the right fit or don’t have the right skill sets. And the cost of those missteps is staggering. So what can be done? In these blinks, we’ll take a look at how you should think about hiring. We’ll look at the thinking that needs to be done before beginning the hiring process itself, and equip you with a battery of questions that can be used in interviews. In the end, you’ll be more than ready to find the right “who” for your business. You’ll also find out what the disadvantages of hiring a generalist are; why social skills are as important as professional skills; and the four interviews you should conduct with all potential recruits. Hiring can be a nightmare. But why all the fuss about getting the right person on the first try? If a new hire doesn’t work out, you can always just replace her, right? Well, here’s the truth: if you think hiring is a matter of trial and error, you’re probably pretty new to the grueling initiation rite that is onboarding a new employee. Furthermore, hiring errors can cost companies a fortune and they happen far more often than they should. Studies done by the authors have found that a typical hiring mistake will cost a company around fifteen times the employee’s monthly salary. Some of these costs stem from poor decisions made by the employee; the rest, from the work necessary to fire and replace him. To put this in perspective, imagine you hire a manager who earns $100,000 a month. If your decision turns out to be a bad one, you’ll have cost the company up to $1.5 million! Clearly, hiring the wrong person is an expensive mistake. Yet it happens all the time. According to management guru Peter Drucker, most managers make at least 50 percent of their mistakes during hiring decisions. This makes sense, though. Business people often lack the skills they need to make sound hiring choices. So they end up relying not on personal expertise, but gut instinct. This approach can be likened to that of an amateur art critic whose repertoire of responses to a work of art is limited to “I like it” and “I don’t like it.” The problem is that art can easily be forged and first impressions are often weak guides. Like the rash and uninformed critic, people who hire based on instinct can be fooled by charismatic candidates with little true ability. Or, in other instances, managers act like prosecutors, trying to trick candidates into slipping up. As you’ll learn, doing this will only put a prospective hire on the defensive, preventing you from finding out whether he has the right skills for the job. Luckily, there’s a better approach, and in the next blinks you’ll learn all about it. Would you consider hiring an unlicensed contractor to remodel your kitchen? Probably not. After all, there’s no way to know whether she has the skills necessary to complete the job. By the same token, you shouldn’t hire people without knowing precisely what qualifications they need to succeed. To do that, you must define your hiring needs. Recruiters often forget to define exactly what it is they're looking for – a lapse that can derail the entire hiring process. Indeed, it’s crucial to know exactly what you want right from the get-go. One of the authors recently worked for a major financial services firm that needed to hire a VP of strategy and planning. The author started the process by asking the management team what the new VP’s role would be. His question sparked a heated discussion. One manager argued they needed someone who could craft a master plan for their budget, while another said they needed someone with a vision for new strategies and products. It was immediately clear that the team didn’t agree about what they were looking for, which is precisely what you want to avoid. After all, if you’re not sure who you want to hire, you’ll end up with a generalist, rather than someone with specialized skills. In fact, hiring an all-round candidate is one of the most common mistakes in hiring. People tend to be impressed by the generalized abilities of such people, forgetting, meanwhile, to ask about essential and specific skills. Just imagine you have a backlog in your business operations. You need someone who can tighten up your operations and prune the old work. In interviews, you speak with a capable, innovative and charismatic business developer. Even though she’d be a stellar candidate in a different context, she’s not right for the job at hand. Why? Well, while she might generate more business for the company, this is exactly what you don’t want; more business will increase your backlog, thereby creating greater operational delays and increased customer complaints. Intellect and smarts alone won’t make an employee great. She needs to have social skills, too, something recruiters would do well to keep in mind. But to truly ensure that new hires fit in, you also need to know what the culture of your company is. In fact, one-third of the CEOs that the authors interviewed while preparing this book admitted that they’d made massive hiring mistakes by writing off the importance of a cultural fit. To avoid making this mistake yourself, define your company culture from day one. Bring your leadership team together and ask them how they would describe the environment of the company. No need to get too fancy – quick, off-the-cuff definitions will do the trick. For example, one of the author’s clients came up with catchwords like “analytical, dynamic, fast and informal.” Now they know that new employees should be comfortable in an environment that matches those words. That being said, ensuring a cultural fit might mean saying no to people with serious talent. Just remember: a prospective hire might be incredible at her job, but not share your company’s values and, in the end, your company culture is more important. For example, the NPO Institute for Sustainable Communities recruited a new employee for an essential role in an African country, where the institute was battling AIDS. The new hire did a great job, managing to transform the opinion of both the country’s president and parliament, who had previously been dismissive of the AIDS crisis, calling it a matter of immorality. However, the new employee wasn’t a team player. He was brilliant, but also arrogant and often made those he worked with feel inferior. His work-style had a negative impact on the overall performance of the team and, in the end, the CEO had to let him go. Plenty of billion-dollar firms consider hiring to be one of their most important business operations. But despite this fact, for most companies, it’s not a continuous process. That’s because traditional hiring methods only look for new employees when they’re needed, which is a major error. After all, with the clock ticking, the hiring team is under intense pressure to find someone – and fast. This makes it more likely that they’ll hire the wrong person. Not just that, but generally when a manager knows there will be a vacancy, she contacts the HR team and asks them to find some potential candidates. As a result, the company ends up having to choose among the available job hunters instead of selecting the absolute best candidates. So what’s a better method? It’s best to get referrals from your networks, both business and private. In fact, herein lies the golden rule of hiring. Seventy-seven percent of the CEOs interviewed by the authors said that using their own network was hands down the best way to make successful hires for their company. But the key is to always be searching for these people, not just seeking them out when you know you need them. For instance, the CEO of Aon Corporation, a leading insurance firm, says his success isn’t a result of being smarter than the competition. Rather, it’s a product of devoting a tremendous amount of his time to finding new talent for his company. He has a goal of finding 30 new potential hires every year and his main managers have the same target. As a result, the company always has a substantial pool of stellar candidates whenever a specific position opens up. So building a roster of potential candidates is key. But even with such a pool, you need to be able to choose the right person for the job. In the next blink, you’ll learn how to do just that. When sussing out candidates, interviews are crucial – and knowing how to structure them is even more important. That’s why, to ensure that your hiring decisions hit the mark, you should use a four-interview system. Each of these interviews will build on the others, increasing in precision as the process advances. Implementing this system will require effort and dedication, but it will be worth it in the end, as you’ll be much more likely to find the perfect match for the specific role you’re filling. Such a comprehensive approach is important. After all, this isn’t an audition for a part in a movie; you can’t make a decision based on seeming ability and appearance. You’ll need a long list of facts about a person’s professional life – a life that may span decades. So make a point of conducting four basic interviews: the screening interview, the who interview, the focused interview and the reference interview. The first of these, the screening interview, is an initial test to filter out candidates who are clearly not right for the job. This interview should be conducted by phone and last no longer than thirty minutes. There are four essential questions to answer here: What are the candidate’s professional goals? What are his professional strengths? His weaknesses? And, finally, how does he think his former bosses would rate his performance? The answers to these questions will give you a rapid-fire overview of the candidate’s profile and past performance. But don’t go too deep. Remember: the goal is to screen and eliminate. In other words, as soon as it becomes clear that someone isn’t a fit, you should begin winding the interview down. Next up, you’ll learn about the other three interviews that complete this process. The screening interview will narrow the field, but you’ll have a way to go before you select your ideal candidate. The next step is to unearth relevant facts about these promising candidates and the who interview is your tool to do so. This second interview is more in-depth, the goal being to find out who the candidate really is. It’s based on a method pioneered by Brad Smart, the father of one of the authors. Here’s how he came up with it: As a young management psychologist, Brad was asked to sit in on management recruiting interviews involving senior partners. When the partner finished asking questions, Brad was allowed to ask a few more. In these interviews, he went deep, asking about every single detail of the candidate’s career – all her successes and all her failures. The senior partner was impressed by this approach and, since then, such in-depth interviews have proven to be a successful practice. Typically, these who interviews involve questions related to the tasks required by prior roles, what went well during them and what could have gone better, as well as relationships with bosses and colleagues. If done correctly, at the end of the who interview, you’ll have a full picture that lets you select promising candidates from the broader pool. Once you’ve made these selections, it’s time to ensure that the candidates actually fit precisely what you’re looking for, which is where the last two interviews come in. First, in the focused interview, you should go through the specific tasks the job entails. For instance, if the role of the position is to increase sales, you’ll want to reevaluate the candidate’s skill set around bringing in new customers. This is also an opportunity to ask any follow-up questions after you look at your notes from the who interview. And, finally, the last step is the references interview, where you check the candidate's references by asking precise questions. Doing so will help you uncover the whole truth and set you up to make an intelligent decision. At the end of this process you should be ready to make an offer. But what if the candidate doesn’t want the job? You’ll learn how to tackle that in the next blink. Imagine how frustrating it would be to conduct four interviews with a perfect candidate, only for him to walk out the door. It would be a huge letdown, but you can make sure it doesn’t happen by selling the candidate on the job. That means convincing him that the job fits both his skills and personality. After all, employees want to be set up for success and the better a job fits their skills and style, the more likely they are to flourish. Just take Mark Stone of the private equity firm Gores Group. He says that if you’re as concerned about a job fitting a candidate’s needs as you are about him fitting the job, convincing him will be a piece of cake. Shockingly, taking this step is exceedingly rare. Ninety-nine percent of recruiters only endeavor to learn whether the candidate is equipped for the job, utterly failing to consider the potential hire’s perspective. In short, making sure the role is right for the candidate is as important as figuring out whether the candidate is right for the role. But it’s also important for a new hire to feel included in the company culture, which means you’ll also need to sell him on the environment. To do so, tell him about the company, its vision and its goals. Discuss the way people behave in the company. Is it inclusive and familial or competitive and fast-paced? Make sure the candidate understands that you chose him because he fits in. Make him feel welcome! And, finally, selling a job also means making sure it fits with the candidate’s family life. That doesn’t just mean having flexible timetables, but also making families a part of the company culture. For example, Gabriel Echavarría owns a ceramics company in Colombia, and he puts a tremendous emphasis on meeting the families of every new employee. The families are taken on a guided tour of the company site, introduced to employees and invited to parties. The whole goal is to make them feel at home in the company. Management experts and CEOs agree that bringing on talented employees is the single most important facet of building a successful company. But to make hiring all-star candidates a part of your company culture, you’ll have to lay out a clear process. First, you need to make clear to your management team that people are your top priority. This is essential. Indeed, successful managers interviewed by the authors said that they spend up to 60 percent of their time thinking about their current and future employees. From there, your job is to improve hiring methods. To get your team on board with this, you need to do more than just mention hiring at meetings. Rather, you need to have discussions about the idea, convincing your managers why hiring is important. During these discussions, you can bring in materials on the subject and circulate them throughout your firm. You might even hold workshops to train your team to network and keep an eye out for talent. That being said, be sure your hiring techniques remain within the law. Getting creative during the hiring process is great but there are a few legal restrictions you need to respect. For instance, you need to stick with relevant criteria when evaluating candidates, whether positively or negatively. If you reject somebody, do it because of the facts, not your personal feelings. Beyond that, you must have some type of standardized hiring procedure so that all candidates receive equal treatment. Be sure that there are no disparities in regards to demographics. Finally, you should be aware that it’s illegal to ask a candidate certain questions. For example, you can’t ask a prospective hire if she’s married, whether she intends to have kids, what her sexual orientation is or when and where she was born. With these few precautionary facts in mind, you’re ready to build a talent pool for your company to source from. Get started today and you can put your firm on the path to the incredible success that only comes from having the best people on board. The key message in this book: Hiring is often treated as a last-minute necessity – an approach that brings poor results. To make sure that your company has the talent it needs to succeed, you should instead make hiring a top priority. Treat this process as a constant effort and never stop building your pool of potential hires.  Actionable advice: Be persistent and offer concessions.  Hiring is hard work and you don’t want it all to be for nothing. So, once you find the right person for a job, you shouldn’t take his first no as a definitive answer. Instead, find out what he needs in order to say yes and compromise if you have to. Don’t risk losing out on top talent because you didn’t do everything you could. Got feedback?

McCormack","summary":"Perhaps you’ve aced all of your exams at business school, and maybe you’ve already read countless books about how to succeed in your entrepreneurial efforts. But regardless of how much theoretical knowledge you’ve accumulated, it’s quite a different matter to apply these lessons out in the real world. And that’s what these blinks have for you: tips and tricks for building and running businesses, handed to you from those who already have years under their belt on the job market, and who are already doing business – really, really well. In these blinks, you’ll also learn how Pepsi won over Burger King; why holding back is sometimes the best move; and the advantages of starting your business on a slow burn. When it comes to business, it’s easy to buy into the misconception that it’s all about numbers and growth. But it’s not! It’s about people. It doesn’t matter if you’re selling a product or hiring someone; to get ahead in business, you have to know who exactly you’re doing business with. If you know their personality and what makes them tick, you’ll be able to predict their behavior. You’re probably used to the clichéd slick businessman facade. But remember, a businessman won’t fulfil that stereotype with everyone. He’ll talk to his boss, clients or employees in different ways. If you’re aware of these different fronts, you’ll know that there’s more to the “suit” than meets the eye. There will always be a lot going on beneath the surface. But how do you discover the richness of someone’s personality? You have to really listen. Listening isn’t a passive process – you have to actively take in what you’re hearing and make an effort to understand what people are telling you. Let’s take Pepsi as an example. For years, Pepsi tried unsuccessfully to court Burger King, urging them to sell their product alongside Coca-Cola and arguing that customers wanted options in their drink choices. But Burger King kept declining their proposal, claiming that they did offer a choice, as they had plenty of other types of soda on offer. It was only then Pepsi started listening to Burger King. They saw what was going on below the surface, so they changed tactics. In their next pitch, they took a novel approach. “Hey,” they said, “we’re both number twos.” After all, Burger King had long since played second fiddle to their rivals McDonald’s, just as Pepsi had to Coca-Cola. This convinced Burger King, and they switched to Pepsi in solidarity. Listening is one thing, but making a good impression is also important. Let’s look at that next. Say you’re about to meet with a potential client. What's the best way to make a good impression? One way is to play with preconceptions. If you keep things fresh with a bit of unexpected behavior, it can act in your favor. Imagine, as a manager, you want to approach an aspiring golfer. The golfer will probably expect you to pursue them aggressively to get you on board. But if you do the opposite of what they expect, they’ll be surprised and will be even more interested in what you have to offer. The author himself once wanted his company to represent a famous television personality. However, he knew that she expected him to be aggressive in pushing for a deal. So, he turned the tables and played with that preconception. In fact, he didn’t even mention representing her at all; he just introduced himself and his business, and then said a few words about her career and her prospective opportunities. Perplexed and wrong-footed, she started pushing for a deal herself instead! Another way to make a good impression is through personalized communication, and in many cases, any personal comment will do. It doesn’t matter if it’s a few words or a few written paragraphs – showing a bit of genuine interest is bound to grease the wheels. Use whatever personal information you have at your disposal to individualize your communication. For instance, you could start an email by telling the recipient that you hoped her workload had gotten a bit lighter or that her latest business deal had been successfully signed off. Business is about people and personalities. Make it work for you! Imagine you’re trying to sell something. You really want a positive response and you’re negotiating and persuading your way toward a deal. It’s sometimes at this very moment that you can feel something’s off, that something’s not right. Do you stop? Or do you press on? You have to learn to trust these feelings of doubt. It’s OK to feel uncomfortable and put the brakes on, especially when you know you’re selling something valuable; it’s a perfectly understandable response. If you don’t feel right, or if you sense an unpleasant tone in someone’s voice, that’s fine. Come back another day when the timing is better. There are other feelings that you can trust, too. Just think of those uncomfortable sensations of rejection and failure. Some people let those feelings interfere when they're selling a product; instead, you can use them to boost your endeavors. Everyone hates rejection and failure – there’s no denying it. But when it comes to rejection in business, it’s rarely personal. Far more often, it’s about the product you’re selling. Even so, if you do take it personally, it will make you redouble your efforts and dedication to making that sale. Rejection is a powerful emotion and if you harness it, you'll do an amazing job next time around. It’s just as true for failure. It hurts and is a feeling that loves to linger. But it, too, is a powerful motivator that will give you the incentive you need to keep pushing on. The best ideas need refinement and time. It’s a generally accepted principle that nothing comes out perfectly the first time around. There’s a chance that an idea is not succeeding because it’s just not very good, but timing can also be surprisingly important. For instance, the author once tried to develop a pro golf tour in South America, but the project quickly fell through. The problems were all down to timing; unforeseen events, chief among them being skyrocketing inflation and severe currency devaluation, had derailed what had seemed a solid plan. The project had simply become far too expensive to get off the ground. The author was certain it was a great idea and knew there was demand for it. Nonetheless, external circumstances had intervened. The South American pro golf tour could be a success – just not this time. In business, you shouldn’t trash an idea immediately. A bit of a headwind to begin with is to be expected, and a “no” from a buyer, bank or collaborator doesn’t necessarily mean your idea is a bad one. Economic factors beyond your control might mean that a “no” at that precise time is necessary. But perhaps in a few weeks, months or years, circumstances might be a little more receptive. Another highly underappreciated facet of selling something successfully is silence. No, really. Sometimes it’s best to keep quiet, especially about the negative aspects of a sale. There’s no need to mention such downsides because doing so serves no purpose whatsoever, even if you think it might be relevant in the moment. Imagine you’re selling a portable radio. Even though the batteries might have to be replaced in 20 months, you’re under no obligation to say so. The same is true if you know the product will soon be replaced by an updated model. So what? This will only make the potential buyer look at the negatives rather than, say, the radio’s sleek design or great sound. Accentuate the positives and you won’t go wrong. At business school, you’re taught the dry stuff: how to balance a budget, what “supply and demand” means and how inflation impacts businesses. But how do you put this into practice? How do you actually run a company? What matters, first of all, is quality. Whether it’s the quality of clients, employees or products, this has to be the focus from the start. Consider the author. He founded IMG, an international management organization for sports figures and celebrities, in 1960. Arnold Palmer, now considered one of the greatest golfers ever, was his first client. At the time, however, Palmer had only won one championship. The next two clients, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus, were also golfers, and were also relative unknowns. Still, the author could see their positive qualities: they had class, character and were courageous and determined. These were traits he wanted to represent with his company. After all, it’s quality that will get you the best footing in the market. Another tip for newcomers is not to rush things. It may seem counterintuitive, but there’s no point in growing for the sake of growing. If you take things slowly, you’ll give yourself the time to understand what makes a successful business. You’ll be able to build a strong foundation, such as a good management team. Strength in these key foundational positions makes sustained success far more likely. Let’s look at IMG again. In the organization’s first six years, it only represented golfers. They could easily have represented other sports figures as well, or even decided to expand in other directions, such as running sports events or managing fashion model agencies and celebrities (in fact, that’s what they do now). But at the time, it was a worthwhile step to get to know the business thoroughly before diversifying. After six years, the well-organized and respected IMG brand was ready to push further out. So, having plenty of patience is a good way to start a business. But how do you keep things ticking along nicely once your business takes off? There’s no denying it: business executives are busy people. They run around trying to do everything at once and never seem to have time for their hobbies, let alone time to relax. But it doesn’t have to be this way. If you manage your time wisely, you can still do non-work-related activities. The trick here is to include these activities in your schedule. Whether it’s meeting friends at your favorite restaurant or getting in a few rounds of golf, it can still be done. Take the author. When he was busy working as head of IMG, he’d still find time to read, exercise or just decompress. If he had a commitment at 7:00 a.m., he’d get up at 5:00 a.m. and find time for a bit of quiet reading. Most others would likely have taken an extra hour in bed. By the same token, while scheduling, be sure to allocate sufficient time for your activities; in other words, be realistic, not optimistic. Meetings, writing emails or visiting a client always take longer than you think, so don’t be stingy. Allocate more time than you think you need, so that you have a buffer if anything goes astray. And, of course, once you have your schedule, don’t start changing it on the fly. Keep to it. The point of having a schedule is to follow it – otherwise, why have one in the first place? If something comes up unexpectedly, don’t just abandon whatever you’re doing in that moment. Instead, check the schedule. Can you fit in this unforeseen task later on that day or later in the week? And so, with this piece of time management advice, you can check off the last tip for surviving in the business world and find yourself better equipped to run and maintain a business. The key message in this book: Business schools do not and cannot teach you everything about making it in the real world of business. In fact what matters more than numbers and figure sheets are personal interactions and self discipline. To be successful in business you have to recognise not only the foibles of others, but also your own. If you focus on quality and timeliness you are sure to make your path to success that much easier Actionable advice: To gain insights about someone, observe them! You don’t have to go around giving people piercing gazes, you just have to notice others a bit more. What do people do that gives things away about their personality? Look at what they’re wearing and how they’re walking. Are they wearing a conservative suit? Are they walking confidently or with their eyes fixed on the ground?

At the end of the day, the sink is full of dirty dishes and the fridge is overflowing with leftovers that no one will ever touch again. Why does this happen? The culprit is willful blindness, a state in which we choose not to see what’s right in front of us. While a messy kitchen at work might amount to a minor hassle, willful blindness, both on a personal and a collective level, can lead to large-scale disasters. So how does willful blindness work and how do you overcome it? You’ll soon find out. In these blinks, you’ll learn why no one saw the housing crisis coming in 2007; why you only see naked people at the beach if you want to see them; and why one of India’s biggest employers speaks to his driver every day.   In law, willful blindness refers to the principle that a person is responsible for an action if he could and should have known something was problematic, but decided not to see it. For instance, imagine a drug trafficker whose stash gets discovered at the airport. To avoid jail time, he might say that he was never told what was in the packages he was carrying and didn’t have any intention of breaking the law. He’d be out of luck, since the law isn’t interested in the reasons you were blind to a reality, only that you chose to be, in this case by not watching your luggage. That being said, willful blindness applies to much more than crime. In fact, it’s common for humans to adopt such a position in a variety of situations, often with disastrous consequences. Just consider the housing crash of 2007. Virtually nobody saw it coming and willful blindness is to blame. In the years leading up to the crash, the US housing market was expanding at a shocking pace; people with little to no income were buying lavish homes with small or nonexistent down payments. Since everybody was doing it, nobody imagined that anything could be going wrong. Meanwhile, the financial sector was producing ever more complex financial instruments, like the credit default swaps and derivatives that eventually brought down the market. However, all of these investment vehicles were premised on the illusion of endless market expansion. People really should have known better. So, why didn’t they? It all comes back to a single human impulse: the unconscious urge to surround ourselves with people who think the same way that we do. After all, challenging our views is uncomfortable. It’s much easier to reduce our exposure to people with different ideas and values. In the case of the housing crash, the people who were pointing out the dangers had a difficult time making themselves heard or backing up their case because nobody wanted to hear a dissenting view. Love is one of the most powerful emotions a human can experience, but it also bears inherent dangers. After all, to love someone is to view them through a rose-tinted lens that necessarily hides their flaws. As a result, love can obscure the true nature of another person, leading to potentially disastrous consequences. For instance, some women will fail to notice when their partners are abusing their children. Only after such facts become undeniable, say through a police investigation, do the small signs of abuse become impossible to ignore. The willful blindness that obscures such signs is often fueled by a variety of fears, like losing the breadwinner of a household or challenging assumptions about a partner. In fact, we’ll often fight to maintain the view we hold of a partner even when such views are clearly delusional. Our own identity can depend so much on what the other person thinks of us, that once we find out something identity-shattering about the other person, our own identity is shattered along with his or hers. To put it differently, love can blind us – and so can ideas. This all boils down to the fact that the human brain doesn’t like conflict. As a result, we actively disregard any facts that might disprove our previously held assumptions. Alice Stewart offers a good example. In the 1950s, she discovered that x-ray exposure during pregnancy is linked to higher rates of leukemia. However, at the time, it was unthinkable to medics that low doses of x-rays could have any harmful consequences. Because of this assumption, people assumed Stewart’s findings were incorrect. They did everything they could to maintain their beliefs and disregard the evidence. Nonetheless, after many years of dispute, the facts could no longer be avoided. Behind this refusal to believe something patently obvious was what the psychologist Anthony Greenwald called the totalitarian ego. It looks away from threatening or incompatible ideas, even going so far as to rewrite history to preserve one’s self-image. This psychological impulse functions like an internal police state that leads us toward willful blindness. Have you ever seen an ostrich burying its head in the sand, or at least a picture of one doing so? While this phenomenon is often characterized as something ostriches do to feel safe or hide, it is actually a simple optical illusion. Since ostriches’ heads are quite small for their body size, it can sometimes look like they are burying their heads when they are merely poking around in the sand for food. But while these big birds might not hide from reality, humans do all the time. For instance, in Nazi Germany, people who lived in close proximity to concentration camps claimed ignorance of the horrific crimes taking place in their own backyard. While the carnage was obvious, these people refused to see it; reality was simply too horrific and they couldn’t stand to acknowledge what was happening. Or, consider an everyday example. Many people are oblivious to the dangers of working too much and sleeping too little. However, research has found that a single night without sleep has equivalent physiological effects to reaching a blood alcohol level of 0.1 percent, high enough to make it illegal to drive in many places. Research done by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, even found that the chances of hospital interns stabbing themselves with a needle or scalpel increased by 61 percent following a 24-hour shift. Nonetheless, most people don’t complain. Unwilling to see the dangers they face, they just keep working. In other words, it’s easy for us to bury our heads from the realities of life. But this willingness to blind ourselves increases even more when in a group setting. For example, experiments have shown that, if a person notices signs of a fire while alone in a room, she will react within seconds. However, when a group of people is in the same situation, their collective reaction time can be much slower. As a result, a person in a group might see smoke and ignore it since nobody else is reacting. Why? Well, when we find ourselves in the company of others, it becomes important to us how we’re perceived. This causes problems because, if nobody else is reacting to a stimulus, any reaction might cause conflict in the group. As a result, instead of saying something, most people simply stand by. Imagine you’re a soldier who has been given an order that, if carried out, would take thousands of innocent lives. Would you blindly obey? Even if you’re a highly moral person, you’d have to fight the natural human impulse toward obedience, a fact that regularly blinds people to their moral responsibility. For instance, during the Iraq war, US soldiers stationed in the Iraqi prison known as Abu Ghraib were ordered to “soften up” the prisoners. A massive scandal of abuse and torture followed, since in response to the command, the soldiers, along with CIA personnel, executed a series of horrific human rights violations, including rape, torture and murder. In this situation, obedience to a vague order resulted in willful blindness; the soldiers were incapable of seeing the moral implications of their actions and simply followed orders. Related to such a proclivity for obedience is the human drive toward conformity, or the adoption of the views, habits and routines of our peers. For instance, during a famous 1950s experiment, the psychologist Solomon Asch gave groups of eight college students, each of which contained only one real test subject, two cards. The first card showed a vertical line of a certain length, while the second one had three vertical lines, of which one was the same length as that on the first card, one was visibly shorter and one was visibly longer. The subjects were then asked which of the lines on the second card matched that on the first. The real subject was always made to answer last, while the seven “actors” in the experiment had been instructed to give the same incorrect answer. In the end, around 35 percent of the answers given by real subjects conformed to the incorrect answers given by the actors. Even though the subjects must clearly have known the correct answer, their drive to conform to the group was so strong that they turned a blind eye to the truth. As companies expand from fledgling start-ups to major corporations, the resultant growing pains almost inevitably include a sense that things are beyond their grasp. After all, suddenly having new teams and offices around the world, each of which specializes in specific areas of business, is a recipe for losing control that can be bad news for businesses. In fact, businesses that are spread out across the globe but also work to maintain central control can be blind to the dangers inherent in their various operations. Just take the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which operated in the Gulf of Mexico. On this deep-sea oil-drilling platform, serious risks were routinely overlooked, eventually resulting in a major catastrophe. After a fire erupted on the platform, the whole rig sank, leading to an oil spill of titanic proportions. But how was this allowed to happen? Well, the platform was under the management of the offshore rig operator Transocean, but leased by the oil giant British Petroleum, or BP. Overseeing the project from London, BP was oblivious to all kinds of problems. There was the potential for gas to leak into the drilling area, a serious fire risk, as well as the inherent danger posed by their lack of an adequate fire plan. Moreover, siloed businesses can also result in willful blindness. So, while lots of companies claim to have a bird's-eye view of every aspect of their operation, many pieces of the puzzle are routinely ignored. Take the trendy aluminum water bottle company SIGG as an example. This Swiss firm promoted its products as free of bisphenol A, or BPA, a synthetic compound used in plastic products that can lead to diabetes and erectile dysfunction. But despite the company’s claims, the subcontractor that produces the linings for SIGG’s bottles was indeed using the toxic substance. They hadn’t been honest with SIGG about this fact and the company had never asked, choosing instead to remain willfully blind. Eventually, when it came out that SIGG bottles contained a small amount of BPAs, the company was publicly tarnished, and the CEO lost his job. Have you ever heard the story of Cassandra? Her father was an ancient king, gifted in the art of prophecy. But unfortunately for Cassandra, her fate was such that nobody believed a word she said. Because of this tragic combination, when she warned the Trojans about the dangers of the infamous wooden horse, nobody listened. While Cassandra’s story may be an ancient Greek myth, there’s plenty to be learned from it – especially for whistleblowers. These brave souls fight an uphill battle against willful blindness, pushing others to see the truth. Just take Chelsea Manning. She leaked top secret US Army documents regarding operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to Wikileaks, sparking a massive scandal about the ethical dimensions of these wars. The most powerful information she leaked was a video depicting a 2007 US Apache helicopter strike in Baghdad that killed several people, including a Reuters journalist. Following the video’s release, a global discussion emerged about the ethics of this strike and the war in general. By making information about the conflict publicly available, Manning forced people out of their willful blindness surrounding the terror of the Iraq War. So, while not everyone is ready to be a whistleblower, you can challenge your own willful blindness in other ways. It may sound hard, but it really just involves overcoming the drive toward homogeneity. In other words, if you find yourself agreeing with almost everything and everyone around you, you should work to open yourself up to new ideas and perspectives. To do so, you can take a tip from one of the biggest employers in India, Ratan Tata. When his driver takes him to work in the morning, Tata doesn’t hide behind a newspaper like many CEOs do. Rather, he sits in the seat next to his driver and speaks with him, listening to his problems and thoughts. Through this process, Tata receives valuable insight and a different perspective that help him actively combat his willful blindness. You can be like Tata and find ways to challenge yourself simply by seeking out as many views as possible. The key message in this book: Intentionally blinding yourself to reality isn’t always bad, but as a general approach, it can be dangerous. In fact, many of the challenges humans face today could be resolved much more easily if people were only willing to open their eyes and see them. By seeking out other perspectives and questioning the world around us, we can avoid falling into complacency and conformity.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Some people realize they want to spend their days helping people, for others the dream is to lead a successful team. Whatever your epiphany may be, it’s rarely simple to achieve. There will be pitfalls on the way, many setbacks and long moments of indecision and doubt. These blinks show how Bill McDermott, CEO of software giant SAP, followed his own dream from humble beginnings to financial superstardom. Reading them will help you plot – and stay on – your own course to success and fulfilment. In these blinks you’ll discover why you should send your best workers to Hawaii; and which four questions you need to constantly ask to keep up your game. On what foundation do the world’s highest-achieving individuals build their success? Is it a good upbringing, full of the luxuries provided by a moneyed family? A ruthless desire to win at costs? Actually, it’s neither of these. As you’ll see in the story of the author and hugely successful CEO Bill McDermott, success derives from something else entirely. The author’s spectacular business career certainly wasn’t written on the wall during his early childhood in lower middle-class New Jersey. But it’s from this childhood that he draws the outstanding quality that guarantees success: the relentless pursuit of a big dream despite all obstacles. Among the first steps on the road to achieving this dream is an early exposure to work and a willingness to take risks. Seeing his dad getting up early every morning to work multiple difficult jobs to support the family, the author developed an unflinching work ethic at a very young age. It was then that he decided his dream was to become a successful businessman. So, from the early age of eleven, the author began working several hard jobs himself – often more than one at a time – ranging from newspaper delivery to waiting tables and taking the nightshift at gas stations. At the age of 17, the deli where he was working was robbed and stripped of all its wares. Confident in his ability to rebuild the deli, the author decided to take a chance, and bought it from its frustrated owner. In the end, his determination and steadfast work ethic made the deli more successful than before. If you want to land your dream job, you’ll need to perform better than your rivals in order to impress your prospective bosses in interviews. However, that’s easier said than done, especially if you are young and relatively inexperienced. All too often, you’ll find yourself competing against candidates who are far more knowledgeable and qualified than you. But is this cause for worry? Regardless of what is written on your résumé, you stand the best chance of success if you can demonstrate your passion for the job and your determination to land it. Quite simply: you have to want it more than everyone else. When the author was interviewed for his first job as a sales representative at Xerox, he managed to impress the sales manager with his personal story of surviving and thriving during hardship, having told them how hard he had strived to earn the mere opportunity to get the job. It worked! While the other candidates had gone in with the attitude of “testing their chances,” he had shown his determination to succeed, and was hired in the spot. But passion alone is often not enough to get you the job. You also have to do your homework. You’ll need to carefully research the job and use this newfound knowledge to create a plan for tackling the role and making improvements. Eventually, a sales manager position became vacant at Xerox – the natural next step for the author. Although according to the company guidelines he was too young and inexperienced for the job, the author nonetheless requested a meeting with the hiring manager. He came prepared. He presented a detailed action plan of the ways in which he would manage the sales department, and demonstrated great passion for the job. As a result, Xerox ignored older and more experienced candidates and the author earned his promotion. In the modern world, many people work in sales. But not all salespeople are equal; some are better than others. The author would prove himself to be a sales genius, always outselling his coworkers during his time at Xerox. But how? Was it his intricate knowledge of the products? No, it was his ability to empathize with the customer. Indeed, a successful sales career depends on your ability to put yourself in your customers’ shoes and “feel” their pain. Customers will appreciate and trust someone who demonstrates that he understands what they’re going through. The best salespeople exploit this. Working at Xerox, the author developed his own technique for maximizing this empathy: the “Feel-Felt-Found” technique. He would open his sales pitch with a story of “I know how you feel, others have felt the same way, and they have found . . . ” The author earned the trust necessary to close the deal by demonstrating that he had lived his customers’ difficulties and that there was a proven solution for them. Moreover, a true understanding of the customer and his environment helps when designing products and sales pitches that are just too good to refuse. Indeed, the best sales technique is simply to provide the customer with something they really need. To do this, you’ll need to identify that need by researching their practices and finding the weak spots. When the author got a job with the software company SAP America, he initiated a new sales strategy called value engineering. The company sent industry experts to their clients to learn their operations and business models in detail. With this knowledge, SAP could create products and sales strategies based on their clients’ actual business practices, and their sales skyrocketed. Don’t bother telling customers a “technology story” about all the features of your newest product. Instead, tell them about business case studies and how your customer can use your product to be more successful. Up to this point we’ve been discussing how to get your foot in the door at your dream job. The following blinks will show you how to lead and inspire people in order to finally realize your dream. Think back to all the jobs you’ve had that you truly hated. What was it about these jobs that you most despised? It’s a fair guess that in many of these roles, it was a bad boss who fueled your discontent. Employees don’t often quit companies. They quit managers. A good manager cares for her subordinates and ensures they are happy and efficient. But how? First, you need to get to know your employees and discover what’s important to them. This could be things like their home, family or even dreams for the future. You do this so that you can communicate and make decisions based on their individual situations, and thus make them feel valued. For example, if you know that one person often needs to work unusual hours because of their kids, you can make sure they have flexibility. Or if their dream is to become the best salesperson in the United States, you can bring them closer to it by sending them on a sales course. Second, celebrate success! Your top performers will need incentives if they are to maintain or exceed their performance. Since his days as a sales manager at Xerox, the author has done this by giving his best performers top-notch celebrations and holidays, including trips to five-star hotels in Hawaii. However, there is one important caveat: while you should treat your employees as well as possible, you shouldn’t tolerate poor performance. If you allow a poor or lazy performer to produce shoddy work, then you’ll send the wrong message to the rest of the team. Your best performers will see no point giving their all if they can reap similar rewards by doing very little. We’ve just seen how powerful rewards like lavish holidays can be in motivating your employees to push themselves to the limit. However, if you want to motivate your staff over the long term, fancy rewards won’t be enough. These extrinsic motivators may be important, but they don’t have the same staying power as rewards based on intrinsic factors, e.g., the personal satisfaction that comes with a job well done. The most common questions the author asks potential employees are: “What do you want?” and “What is your dream?” These questions allow him to discern whether a candidate’s intrinsic goals align with those of the team. Most people will answer that they dream of being part of a winning team in some capacity. For example, they might want to be the most successful sales rep team in the company, or even simply learn how to be a better salesperson. People with these kinds of goals can be motivated to help themselves to get closer to achieving them, while also helping the team in general. Another way to provide your team with long-term motivation is by continually raising the bar. People who dream of greatness realize that lofty goals and obstacles are simply steps on their journey toward their dream. Hence they see them as challenges, not burdens, and even draw motivation from them. For example, when the author became the manager of the Xerox office on the Virgin Islands – the worst performing region in the Xerox Corporation – he immediately set a goal to become “the best performing region” by the following year. At first his employees where paralyzed by his ambition, but soon they began drawing motivation and energy from this lofty goal. In the end, they managed to outperform every other region within the Xerox corporation! Nothing is more important for a business than its ability to constantly evolve in the face of innovations and fresh competition in the market. But how do you establish this in your work culture? Start by constantly asking yourself four basic questions about your business model and your market. 1) Is your core business relevant today, and 2) will it continue to be relevant tomorrow? These questions help you evaluate whether you should continue on your current path, or whether you need to find a new direction. After all, even if your strategy works now, will it still work tomorrow? When the author became co-CEO of SAP, he asked himself these same questions. SAP was selling software products worth billions of dollars to thousands of companies in dozens of industries. In other words, they were absolutely relevant. He concluded that with their current trajectory, their position was unlikely to change for at least ten years. So far so good! However, before declaring victory, you still have two more questions to ask yourself: 3) What do your customers want? And 4) what will those customers want tomorrow? Answering these questions honestly can help you discover whether there are any new opportunities you should be exploring, or whether any threats await you in the future. By asking these questions, the author discovered that SAP’s customers wanted the simplicity and elegance of applications like Facebook and Gmail in SAP’s software. He also hypothesized that emergent technologies like smartphones, tablets and cloud services would quickly transform the way people used software. So he decided to act, buying up numerous companies that already demonstrated success in mobile app and cloud design, thus adding their “DNA” to SAP. Innovating your business model and creating a long-term strategy is one thing, but it’s harder to achieve the careful, everyday implementation of that strategy. This requires discipline and, above all, a culture of trust. Many companies fail to successfully implement changes in their organization and often waste millions of dollars in the process. Often, these failures aren’t due to poor strategy or planning, but rather a fundamental lack of trust. Indeed, any change within an organization requires a culture of trust. This is partly due to the nature of proactive change. The best time to switch strategies is before a change in the market, when the business is still doing well. Unfortunately, when a company is successful, people often can’t wrap their heads around why they should change, and thus don’t trust the executives’ plan. When the author presented his bold new strategy involving new, simplified mobile software solutions alongside lofty new profit targets, people weren’t happy. SAP was doing fine: they were earning a healthy profit, and change seemed unnecessary. Plus, the proposed changes to their business model seemed unrealistic, and too divergent from the well-established way SAP did business. Getting people behind his plan would take some work. The best way for leaders to overcome this kind of resistance is by instilling in staff the big dream that drives the change, and vanquishing doubts with a carefully planned agenda, facts and certainty. So the author gathered hundreds of managers from across the corporation and held a strategy presentation, carefully outlining the necessary changes and the reasoning behind them. He and his co-CEO then personally trained a few of the higher managers, ensuring that they understood all details of their new strategic direction toward simplicity, mobility and cloud services, and sent them back to their departments to spread their insight and enthusiasm. In doing so, they were able to reach out to everyone in the organization, convincing them to work together to successfully implement the plan. At the end of the day, what does it mean to win? Is it the money, the luxurious corner office or the fancy car? No. These are just goals, specific outcomes that are part of a larger journey. A true dream is something much grander. In the end, winning is the journey, not the goal. And it is the people that accompany you on this journey that make it all worthwhile. The author knew from an early age that he wanted to be the CEO of a big company. This was his winning dream. But the people with whom he could share his accomplishments – his family and co-workers – were the ones who made his career accomplishments such an amazing and remarkable story. Toward the end of his career, this realization helped the author to understand that his true winning dream lay in his aspiration to always try his best and to help those around him to succeed alongside him. Given that the dream is all about the journey and not the end goal, corporations should strive to contribute to society and help others on their way. We can see this in SAP, which supports many organizations involved in social projects such as building playgrounds and providing software to schools and libraries. Moreover, they encourage their employees to take a “social sabbatical” to share their know-how with small business owners and NGOs. In the end, it’s not the dream itself which is rewarding, but rather overcoming all the obstacles that stand in your path. Winning is about waking up with a smile every day and chasing your dream, knowing that you’ve helped others on the way. The key message in this book: Your personal winning dream is the engine that drives your everyday performance. Without it you can’t fuel your ambition and find true success. But in the end, it’s not the ultimate goal that is the most important part of your winning dream, but the journey to achieve it.

That’s not only because of the lure of fat stock options or because it’s been voted the best place to work so many times. It’s more than that. Working at Google somehow brings to mind the idea of personal freedom, or working at your best while being surrounded by the world’s brightest minds. How did that come to be? Google’s famous workplace culture didn’t just emerge out of thin air. It’s the work of Google’s People Operations, one of the most innovative HR departments in the world. These blinks take a look at what makes Google special from the perspective of Laszlo Bock, the head of People Operations and a champion of Google’s in-house culture. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you should pay people unfairly; how rewarding employees with cash makes them unhappy; and the best way to hire and retain the very best candidates. When you hear about working at Google, you probably think about beanbags, free food and other delightful perks. But it isn’t the fun and the freebies that really makes Google so successful; it’s a manifesto of mission, transparency and voice. Google’s mission is simple and powerful: “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” It’s a profound mission because firstly, it gives moral, rather than commercial meaning to employees’ work. That is, the information workers sift and sort through actually helps everyone who uses the search engine. Second, the mission has no ceiling. A typical mission might be to become the market leader, but once this is accomplished, it’s no longer inspiring. At Google, however, employees are constantly motivated to explore new ways of organizing information. Another key tenet of Google’s successful culture is its transparency. In a traditional software company, a new engineer only sees the code from whatever projects they’re working on. At Google, however, a newcomer can access everything from product launch initiatives to another employee’s weekly status report. Furthermore, each week the CEO updates the whole company on the past week and carves out time afterward for a 30 minute Q&A session. Thanks to this update, everyone knows who’s working on what, which ensures they don’t double up and work on it too. It also makes it clear who the go-to person is regarding a particular project. Finally, Google gives every employee a voice. It values the input of everyone and gives them a say in how the company is run. In fact, most practices within the company originated from employees. In 2009, an annual Bureaucracy Busters program was launched so employees could identify their biggest frustrations. How did Google create such a thriving culture? They employed outstanding people. Here’s how they find them. There are two ways to have an exceptional employee: hire the best or train the average. As you may already have guessed, Google does the former. According to the Corporate Executive Board, the average company pays around $600 for training and $450 for hiring. But they’re doing it all wrong. The worst case scenario after recruiting a great candidate is that they end up performing at a mediocre level. But the worst case scenario after hiring an average candidate is that they drain a considerable amount of training resources and wind up performing below average! Therefore, Google invests a great deal of time and resources in finding the right person for the job. They are incredibly scrupulous; hiring only 5,000 people a year out of one to three million applicants. That’s an admission rate of 0.25 percent. Compare that with Harvard University’s admission rate, which is a rather more lenient 6.1 percent. But what should you look for in a candidate? When Google first started out, they only hired 100 people a year and the right candidate was an Ivy League graduate. However, over time, Google learned that many of their best employees weren’t the ones who attended the most illustrious schools. Instead of hiring only those with prestigious degrees, Google started looking for candidates who showed resilience and the ability to overcome obstacles. They realized that the best approach was to hire someone who was better than you, and to seek out those who can make everyone around them more successful. The Google hiring process involves slowly and carefully sifting through only the best performers in the field. Karen May, the current VP of People Development at Google, previously owned an HR consulting firm and actually turned down repeated offers to work for Google for four years. But Google were convinced of her value and patiently pursued her until she finally agreed to join the company. Traditionally, it’s the manager who controls employees’ workload, salary, promotions, sick days and so on. Yet at the same time, companies expect their employees to show initiative and autonomy in their job. See the contradiction? If you really want employees to own their jobs, do as Google does, liquidate status symbols and reduce bureaucratic hierarchy. Google’s most senior executives receive the same support, like resources and funding, as new employees and there are only four levels in the hierarchy: individual contributor, manager, director and vice president. Googlers are also trained to lead and influence through inspiration. Want a VP title? Then show how well you can lead your project and people first. But, as with any project, even if employees demonstrate ownership and influence, they still need a final decision maker. So how do you make the best decisions? Use data, not managerial opinion. That way decision-making is transparent and less biased. Thus, one of Google’s core principles is “Don’t politick. Use data.” This motto also helps address sensitive topics, especially when potentially damaging rumors are involved. Promotion is a touchy subject in every company, and this often exacerbated by gossip. But the Google VP responsible for people used her data to prove there were no biases surrounding promotions at Google. For example, although some people believed that working at Google’s HQ would guarantee a swift promotion, her data proved the promotion rate there was the same as at any other Google office. When properly managed with data and open discussion, a power handover to employees is incredibly effective, resulting in the implementation of the best ideas. Even when someone disagrees with a final decision, the reasoning behind it is clear to everyone. If you’ve worked in an office before, you’re probably familiar with the classic pattern of employee performance: a small number of top performers are responsible for most of the successes, and everyone else trails behind them with gradually decreasing performance. The best and worst performers make up the two tails of the performance curve. Both are the minority, while most employees are average performers, sitting in the middle of the curve. Most companies fire poor performers, then hire new employees who require extra training and can’t guarantee excellent performance. Even worse, companies also tend not to utilize their top performers. So how does Google use these two tails to its advantage? They place outstanding performers under the microscope and help out those who need to make improvements. Most companies also don’t think to study their best performers. This is a missed opportunity, as these are the people most familiar with best practices. How, then, do you study the best performers? Harvard professor Boris Groysberg’s research shows high performance is dependent on context. That means studying other companies’ best practices won’t help; you must study your own. Google do exactly this and study their best employees using an internal research team, PiLab or People and Innovation Lab. PiLab’s produced Project Oxygen. This showed how a great manager is critical for top engineer performance. In fact, Googlers working for the best managers performed five to 18 percent better than those managed by weaker managers. PiLab also determined the main traits of best manager practices so the company could teach them to the under-performing managers. Google also knows that in most cases, below average performance is the result of lack of skill or motivation, which may stem from personal issues or indicate a bigger problem in the team. Finally, to really reach those who need a boost, Google regularly identifies the bottom five percent of employees and offers them training, or tries to fit them into a more appropriate role within the company. $156.2 billion. That’s the annual dollar amount that American companies spent on training programs in 2011. Shockingly, though, most company expenditure on training goes down the drain. Why? Because the training is run by the wrong people, is sloppily designed, too general, or doesn’t get analyzed in a way that measures effectiveness. Training should deliver specific information that people will retain. A commonly held belief is that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in any particular skill. But research by Anders Ericsson shows that the best way to master a skill is to split the work into smaller tasks and aim for a specific improvement in one of these small tasks through repetition, feedback and correction. McKinsey, a global consultancy firm, does this particularly well. McKinsey sends all second year consultants to an Engagement Leadership Workshop where they’re trained to deal with irate clients. First, the basic principles are taught, then consultants roleplay a scenario, and observe and discuss a video of their training. This process is repeated until the desired consultant behavior is achieved. The training is intensive and expensive, but it ensures that every consultant leaves the training with excellent standards and the ability to cope in the best possible way with angry customers. McKinsey understands that the best way to measure training isn’t by time or money spent, but through an improvement in behavior. Who, then, should you hire to train your employees? The great news is, they’re already in your company. When Google needs a trainer for sales representatives, it seeks out the best sales manager with the maximum amount of total sales and asks them to instruct lower performing sales representatives. When employees train other employees, not only does it save money, but it also creates a more close-knit community. Who can understand the problems of a Googler better than another Googler? Compensation can be a contentious issue. So how does Google go about it? Most companies are trapped in pay ceilings for each position and “fair” payment, with regulations specifying that salary differences for the same position may not exceed 20 percent. Unfortunately, this practice encourages top performers to look for better compensation elsewhere. Bill Gates reportedly said that a fantastic coder is worth 10,000 times more than an average coder. Google shares this mind-set, which is why you may think it pays “unfairly.” For instance, one worker may get a stock award of $10,000, while another worker in the same position might receive $1 million. You may also witness a top performer in a junior role getting paid far above an average performer in a senior role. But Google also learned there are often more effective ways to retain employees: offer experience rather than money. In 2004, Google established a Founders Award for performance. That year, Google awarded $12 million to two teams and the next year $45 million was divided among eleven teams. But internal surveys showed that this didn’t make Googlers happy. Quite the opposite. It led people to look for other jobs where the chances of getting a generous award were higher. Their mistake was rewarding with money instead of experiences, like a dinner for two or a team trip to Hawaii. It turned out these special occasions created more memories and brought teams together far better than cash could. But Google didn’t just give rewards when they were expected. In 2009, Google announced the real-time collaboration tool Google Wave. One team worked on it for two years and agreed to forgo their bonuses in favor of higher compensation via stocks if Wave succeeded. Sadly, it failed, but Google rewarded the team anyway. Why? Because innovation means exploring the unknown, so there should be rewards for people who take calculated risks, even if they fail. We’ve seen how empowering employees, transparency, and giving workers a voice have made Google so successful. Unfortunately, sometimes these practices backfire. But when they do, Google knows how to handle it. Google suffers one major leak per year. When this happens, it’s investigated and the guilty party, who leaked it either by accident or design, is found and fired. Not only that, but the company announces to everyone what was leaked and what happened to the employee who did it. The cost of a leak is small relative to the openness and transparency that the company values and upholds. What else can sometimes go awry? Well, Google’s culture fosters innovative thinking and this inevitably results in huge influxes of ideas, which have to be adjusted or culled periodically in order to keep the company running smoothly. In fact, between 2006 and 2009, more than 250 products were launched and then discontinued by Google. CEO Larry Page is responsible for the annual spring clean where he discontinues some products that are waning, don’t have great market prospects, or are being outperformed by others. By being open and explaining the reasoning behind each cull, Google manages to maintain its focus and direction, and retains its managers instead of angering them. Finally, sometimes even company perks can go sour. Google is famous for its benefits and when it provides them, at first everyone is delighted. But after some time, some employees can start to feel entitled. One employee, who became grumpy when the cafeteria used smaller plates, started throwing forks in the trash in protest, and some Googlers even threw food at the staff. The final straw was Meatless Monday, which was launched to benefit employee health. Yet after a month, only one employee threatened in an anonymous survey to move to Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft. So Google shared the survey with its employees. Consequently, many staff were embarrassed by the person's actions and the level of entitlement and abuse fell. The key message in this book: There’s a reason why everyone wants to work at Google. They understand how to hire and retain the best staff, utilize the expertise already present in the company, give power to their workers, and keep them happy in their job. By studying these strategies, you too can learn how to lead and maintain a company that enjoys great success. Actionable advice: Hire in teams. Confirmation bias can lead an individual to favoritize information or individuals that agree with their own beliefs. In job interviews it can cause employers to only take on people who echo their opinions or who resemble them. Avoid it when you’re hiring by assembling a team to sort through and interview applicants. By having more than one opinion on prospective employees, you’ll end up with a more diverse team. Take your time. Sometimes the hiring process can be frustrating, especially when time is of the essence. But holding out for the best new employee will most likely save money in the long run, as company funds won’t be wasted on training up someone average.

Can you see them? Can you feel them? OK, relax, we’re not talking about invisible aliens. We’re talking about systems. Unlike invisible aliens, these systems really do influence so much of what we do every day. Whether it’s driving to work or running errands with the family, think about all the systems that affect you. The traffic on the highway, parking lots, fossil fuel prices, your company’s administrative processes, even the social systems of communication and language. Systems are everywhere. Once you start to see systems everywhere, you can start to think about how you can flip the script: Instead of them just affecting you, how can you work them? These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to be a better systems manager; why 100-percent-perfect systems aren’t the goal; and how systems are just as prominent at home as at work. Do you ever feel like you are just a helpless grain of sand in a dust storm of chaos beyond your control? Well, it’s not chaos that rules the world, but an underlying inherent order, even if we can’t always see it. Think about it: No one is in charge of running the world, yet everything works fine 99.9 percent of the time. How can this be? This is because systems, i.e., multitudes of diverse parts all working together to accomplish a single goal, are inherently inclined to stability and efficiency. There are all sorts of systems that work together perfectly every day without you even noticing. In some faraway place, for example, oil is extracted from the earth using carefully engineered methods and machinery. That oil is then transported to refineries by sea, road, rail or pipeline, and finally delivered to a myriad of gas stations for your convenience. When there is chaos or dysfunction within a system, it is largely the result of human flaws. Whereas systems tend to run smoothly, human beings are inclined to make mistakes. Unsatisfactory outcomes aren’t the consequence of fate or bad luck, but rather are proof of our ability to exert our influence on processes. The global financial crisis, for example, wasn’t blind bad luck. It was the result of a series of bad decisions made by people. Moreover, our assessment as to whether systems are functioning as they should is largely subjective, since what qualifies as a “positive outcome” depends so heavily on our perspective. For example, you may personally find it scandalous that gas prices are so high. An oil-exporting nation, however, will view the situation somewhat differently. The situation, however, is not unchangeable. For instance, governments could negotiate a better resource sharing scheme that benefits everyone. You see, you’re not just a grain of sand; you have influence, and can work the system to your advantage. Nearly everyone has at some stage sunk to a point where they felt that they’d never achieve their dreams because the game is simply rigged against them. This mind-set ensures that you’ll never get the change you want! It’s true: no one person has total control over all the systems that affect her life. There’s nothing you can do about it, so just accept it and move on. While you can exercise your right to vote in a democracy, for example, the overall result will be out of your hands. Your vote is just one among many, and complaining about it does nothing to change this fact. But that doesn’t mean you should scorn democracy. After all, you can still participate, and even though your vote might not singlehandedly swing an election, that doesn’t mean you are without influence. There are, however, many systems which are under your direct command. You have only to take charge of managing them to make things work in your favor. Most things don’t go the way we want because we don’t even try to change their outcomes. Consider democracy again: If you believe that you are truly powerless, then you might stop voting. That’s definitely not going to advance your cause. Or, to take a more day-to-day example, if you want to lose weight, you won’t shed any pounds through intention alone. Leaving it to chance won’t do it either. Rather, you’ll need to develop a plan – a diet, an exercise regimen or something similar – and set it in motion. So, let go of the circumstances that are out of your hands and focus instead on the systems that you can influence. This is the hand you’ve been dealt. Start playing it. How easy is it to miss the forest for the trees? It’s too easy, in fact. And yet we so often forget the obvious solution: distance. Indeed, you can only hope to understand the systems that steer your life and your position in society by stepping back and gaining the perspective of someone on the outside looking in. A cogwheel in a machine only knows about the other cogwheels that it touches. Only by seeing the cogwheels in relation to the rest of the machinery can you hope to understand how the mechanism actually works. Similarly, we often drift through our daily routines without any awareness of the different systems that we pass through and participate in each day, which can make it difficult for us to see our own role in these systems. But once you look at them from the right vantage point, you are in a better position to dissect these systems and see their interworking parts. Every system can be broken down into subsystems, and each subsystem into multi-step processes. By breaking systems down in this way, we can deal with manageable pieces and uncover the mechanisms that cause problems. Think about it this way: your mechanic would be useless if he didn’t know that a car is made of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems, and understand that these systems work together to set the car in motion. Every system is only as good as its components, so if you can step back and see the individual parts, then you’ll have a better idea of what problems need fixing. Now that you have a better understanding of what systems are, it’s time to look at how you can apply this knowledge to improve your professional and personal life. But first we have to set some ground rules. Start by defining your objectives and corresponding strategies in detail. If you don’t know what your objectives are, it becomes impossible to make decisions, as your choices will have no clearly motivated purpose. Like a ship without a compass, you won’t be able to tell whether you are drifting further away or getting closer to your goal if you don’t have a clear idea of what that goal is supposed to be. Second, realize that today’s problems are tomorrow’s opportunities. You don’t want to get into the habit of tackling problems as they arise. You want to pull out the problems at the root, thus pre-empting future difficulties. That means identifying which problems are symptomatic of flaws in your system. Your goal as a systems manager is to make systems work more smoothly. In this way, the problems that you discover are actually opportunities to improve the functionality of your systems. For example, breaking up with your partner might seem like the obvious solution for your dysfunctional relationship. That is, until you find yourself in the exact same situation with someone else a year later. You could have instead looked at your relationship as a system and identified the cause of the problem within that system. Maybe then you could have figured out what it was about yourself or your relationship style that made your relationship dysfunctional to begin with. You can influence all the systems that you belong to, whether they’re professional, personal, financial, social or biological. In the next blink, you will learn more about how to apply this to your business. A business isn’t a monolith. Rather, it is a complex organization comprised of various interoperating systems. So how can you hope to manage such complexity? Like every system, your business can be broken down into subsystems. By delegating the supervision of departments, that is, subsystems, you save yourself valuable time that can be invested in leadership instead. The head of human resources should deal with HR, the logistics manager with logistics and so on, drawing on your instructions but not requiring your input for every single decision. How could you possibly attend every HR, logistics, or sales meeting while also plotting the strategic course that each system should be following? When you are plotting this strategic course, you will need to be specific in defining objectives and guidelines. Remember the sailboat without a compass? You don’t ever want to find yourself in that position. If you don’t plot a course, then your business has no hope of producing the outcomes you want. This is your responsibility, i.e., the responsibility of a leader: setting the strategic course that guides these interoperating systems. Early in the author’s career he had set only vague goals for his company – things like making more profit – before finally discovering business mechanics. After internalizing the systems mind-set and appreciating the different systems around him, he was able to create more specific objectives and strategies that were actually useful in assessing his progress. For example, he set the specific company goal of becoming one of the top five players in the US market by increasing quality while reducing quantity. His new approach paid off almost instantly. Most people want their business to run like a well-oiled machine. But even a rusty old machine is a good starting point. By repairing the subsystems within your business, you have an opportunity to find huge value. Dysfunctional parts of your business essentially represent hidden profits waiting to be unlocked. So how should you approach their repair? Start by tackling the biggest problems – or dysfunctional parts – first, and work your way down all the way to the tiniest details. As your problem-solving becomes more specific, you’ll need less and less time to cope with dysfunctional parts, thus ensuring that you optimize your processes and increase profits as quickly as possible. But in order for your machine to run smoothly, your workers will have to know how to manage that machine. A consistent outcome is not the product of chance, but of detailed instructions. Involve your employees in writing step-by-step guides for every process, so that tasks are always carried out in the most efficient way possible. One reason computer programs are so efficient is because they perform a process the same way every single time, following a step-by-step protocol. Use this as a guide in making your systems as consistent and predictable as possible. Once you’ve put your systems in place, you can’t forget to maintain them. Every machine needs to be oiled, serviced and tuned. Don’t make the mistake of resting on your laurels. Even the best client relationship will turn sour, for example, if you neglect to give it the necessary attention. If you manage systems in a way that prevents problems and maintains a consistent quality of outcome, you will not only make more money, but also do so more efficiently. What is the right goal? Is it getting everything right? All 100 percent? When it comes to business, we’ll have to use a different logic. Here, 98 percent is good enough. Don’t waste time and money on trying to get things 100 percent right. In fact, 98 percent could be considered perfect, as achieving that last two percent requires so much additional effort that it would render the process inefficient! For example: How much time and energy would it take you to paint the fence? And how much extra time and energy would it take to paint it perfectly, without any streaks or imperfections? And would it even be worth it? Take this into consideration when you’re determining how you will maximize the efficiency of your systems. They don’t have to be perfect; they just have to be great. In the process of achieving your near-perfect system, be sure to never stop communicating. Indeed, the communication system is omnipresent in business as well as your personal life. Misunderstandings and conflicts arise from silence. If there is a problem, address it immediately. You can take steps to institutionalize communication and dialogue in your business by providing various opportunities for one-on-one and group communication, such as meetings. Beyond business, so many problems arise from a simple lack of communication. Even conflicts as huge as the Cold War were largely a result of poor communication. And it almost led to atomic war! Conversely, states that interact regularly through shared trust improve their cooperation, as is the case in the European Union. Aim to be more like them no matter whether it’s at home with your spouse or at the office with your colleagues. The key message in this book: Hard work doesn’t automatically lead to success, especially if you waste your efforts working on the wrong things. To make the most out of your work, you have to identify the systems within which you operate, and then discern, analyze and improve the dysfunctional parts in them.

Whether you’re trying to get your son to behave at a fancy restaurant or your boss to give you a raise, any situation where you try to affect someone else’s behavior is basically a negotiation. Most things in the world are negotiable. Prices at fancy department stores, mortgages or speeding tickets can all be negotiated, as long as you know how. Even notoriously inflexible entities such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will negotiate with you, because the tax officials, at the end of the day, are just people like the rest of us. Because negotiations are so ubiquitous, don’t you think it’s time you started improving your skills in that arena? Sometimes negotiating is just a matter of talking to the right person. Every organization has a hierarchy, and the lowest rungs always have the least power to grant you what you wish. So if the lackeys can’t help you, demand to speak to managers, directors, and so on, until you find someone with sufficient authority to make concessions. Once at a Mexican hotel, the author was told that this hotel had no room for him. He calmly asked for the manager, and inquired: “Would you have room for the President of Mexico if he shows up?” “Sí, Señor.” “Well, he’s not coming, so I’ll take his room.” In general, the only factors that should affect your decision to negotiate for something are whether you are comfortable negotiating for it, whether a negotiation will result in your needs being met and whether it’s worth the effort. Most things in the world can be negotiated, so you should learn to do it well. Some people see negotiations as a win-lose battle, where one party’s gain is always the other party’s loss. This “winning at all costs” strategy is deployed around the globe, but the former Soviet Union is a prime example of its use. Because these negotiation tactics are so widespread, you must be able to identify them and protect yourself against them. A clear trait of Soviet-style negotiators is that they take ridiculous initial positions and are then unwilling to make significant concessions. When the Soviet Union sought to purchase land on Long Island for its embassy’s recreational use, it initially offered $125,000 for the property worth $420,000. When the seller dropped the price to $360,000, the Soviets viewed this as a sign of weakness. Eventually, they raised their offer – to $133,000. Such stingy concessions, especially at the last minute, are typical of Soviet-style negotiators, as they hope the pressure of the deadline will make the opposition cave. Other Soviet-style tactics include using negotiators with limited authority, meaning people who cannot make concessions on their own. In this case, you will effectively be negotiating against yourself. Emotional tactics such as bullying, walking out or even crying are also often used as a weapon. Have you ever tried to negotiate with someone who breaks down in tears? You often end up giving the other side whatever they want. This particular tactic may not happen with a vodka-drinking, grim-faced Soviet general, but it is quite common in spousal arguments. If you encounter a Soviet-style negotiator, you might simply want to walk away and consider other alternatives. If you do enter the fray, however, you should be careful to adhere to limits you have set for yourself in advance, and keep a cool demeanor despite any emotional tactics. Avoid Soviet-style negotiators – they mistake negotiations for battlefields. A win-lose negotiation mindset implies that there is a set amount of “pie” to be divided up, and each party must fight for theirs. If both parties fight ferociously, the common solution is a compromise, which despite its positive connotations actually means both parties are giving up something that they want. But a true win-win negotiation is also possible. Usually people focus on the demands the other side makes in a negotiation, whereas they should really try to understand their underlying needs and unexpressed desires. Since every person has unique, differing needs, several people can usually be satisfied without anyone losing. This requires their needs to be harmonized. Consider a situation where your family is trying to decide where to go on vacation. This supposedly happy negotiation turns into a deadlock when it turns out your spouse wants to go to Texas, your son to the Rocky Mountains, while you yearn for the Great Lakes. These demands seem irreconcilable. If you look beyond the demands, you might find that your needs can all be met. Your son actually just wants to see mountains, your spouse admittedly desires a warm place with tennis facilities, and you basically just want to go to a lake where you can swim and snorkel. After you realize this, it turns out a resort in Colorado fulfills the needs of everyone involved, and the impasse is solved. The universal lubricant that allows such win-win negotiating is trust. Without trust, no party will be willing to share their true needs and make concessions. Therefore, unless you’re negotiating with family members like in the above example, you will need to build trust. Before the negotiation event, this can mean working to establish a relationship, and during the negotiation, highlighting your shared goals. Collaborative win-win negotiations are possible when everyone’s needs are identified and harmonized. In negotiations, the opposing sides usually have many sources of power at their disposal. For example, when negotiating with your boss, she usually has a very concrete form of power at her disposal: the power to reward or punish you through e.g. the tasks she assigns to you. But less obvious forms of power also affect negotiations. Say you walk into a department store to buy a new refrigerator, and you start discussing the price with the sales clerk. The alternatives you have can give you negotiating power. If you can easily walk across the street to another store stocking the same fridge, you are in a strong position. But what if your family is waiting in the car and they have told you to buy this exact fridge or else? Whether or not you can risk losing this fridge can also be a source of power to either you or your opponent. Let’s continue the example. You walk up to the sales person and invoke the power of precedent: “Look, my brother bought this same fridge and he got a discount.” Or the power of expertise and credentials: “I happen to be a fridge-expert – here’s my card – and this fridge is overpriced!” Most likely, an experienced sales clerk will counter with the power of legitimacy, typically pointing at some kind of printed sign that says, “No discounts.” Most people are in awe of such written documents, though usually they are easily circumvented if you find someone with enough authority. No matter how much power you have in a negotiation, what really matters is how much power you think you have and how much power the other person thinks you have. All power is based on perception. Successful negotiation means tapping into the many sources of power at your disposal. Imagine you’re still trying to buy a fridge at a department store. What kind of powers could you use to improve your chances of getting a discount? Instead of going straight for the model you want, you could ask the sales clerk to show you every single fridge in the store. You ask lots of technical questions, forcing him to dig up manuals for each model, and then you say that you’ll have to think about it. The next day, you come back with your brother and ask the sales clerk to again demonstrate every model in the shop since your brother “knows about fridges”. After this rigmarole, do you think the sales clerk will be more likely to give you a discount? He sure will, because he’s already invested several hours of time into you, and a discount will seem like a small cost to make the sale. Getting the other side to invest in a negotiation will make them more willing to grant concessions. If, on the other hand, you came to the store with your family, a wily sales clerk may instead try to sell the fridge to them. This is called getting commitment. Once your wife, kids and dog are in love with a particular fridge, the sales clerk knows you pretty much have to buy it. In this case, you will be the one making concessions, not him. Thus, in any situation where there are several people on your side of the table, you need to ensure every member is committed to the common goal so that you present a united front. In the fridge-example, this could mean discussing your family’s shared goal before walking into the store. Make it hard for the other side to say no, but guard yourself against this same tactic. If you know the needs, deadlines and constraints of your counterpart in a negotiation, you are always in a strong position compared to your opponent. You gather this information by starting early. Most people think of negotiations as a clearly defined event that happens at a given moment in time, like when you meet with your boss to discuss a raise. In fact, negotiations are a process and this process begins far before you actually sit down at a table. Before meeting your boss, you could consult next year‘s salary budget to see if there is leeway for another raise, and ask colleagues about your boss’s usual demeanor in salary negotiations. In addition to thorough preparation, you can glean information by asking lots of questions in the meeting itself. Some people even play a little dumb in negotiations to get the other side to reveal more facts. Especially when faced with an acknowledged expert. You can negate their advantage by forcing them to explain everything multiple times in ”layman’s terms.” Revealing information is a game of give and take: your opponent may reveal some of their constraints but expect you to do the same in return. Therefore, you should consider how you divulge information. For example, when you make concessions to your opponent, you simultaneously share information on what your true negotiation limits are. Say you make the first offer of $100 for the fridge, to which the seller angrily shakes his head. If after that you immediately jump to $500, he will know that you are probably willing to go higher still, compared with if you had just gone up to $110. The distribution and sharing of information can greatly affect your negotiation success. Time plays a key role in negotiations. Just as students tend to hand in their term papers at the last minute, so too do negotiations tend to make the most progress as the deadline approaches. If your opponent’s deadline for concluding negotiations is at noon, whereas you have no fixed deadline and could go on negotiating at a leisurely pace for weeks, who do you think has the advantage? You do because as your opponent’s deadline approaches, she will need to start making concessions to ensure a deal is reached. Once upon a time the author tried to negotiate a deal in Japan on behalf of his employer. His hosts insisted he first fully experience Japanese hospitality and culture, and serious discussions did not begin until the last day of his two-week stay. The author, desperate to not go home empty-handed, was forced to negotiate on the way to the airport. His weak position resulted in a deal his superiors called, “The first great Japanese victory since Pearl Harbor.” Whenever you feel pressured by a deadline in a negotiation, coolly consider what the consequences of not adhering to it will be. Then make an informed decision as to whether the deadline is worth exceeding or not. Also, keep in mind that your opponents always have a deadline too, and they will be more likely to make concessions as that deadline approaches. Deadlines can influence negotiations, but don’t consider them absolute. In any negotiation, you will increase your chances of success if you can make things personal by getting the opposing side to identify with you as a human being. This could be as simple as behaving decently and generally being likeable, but some skilled negotiators also try to win sympathy from their opponents by playing weak. For instance, if a cop pulls you over on the highway, you will be much better off playing the lost tourist on the brink of tears than a know-it-all big shot in a hurry. Being likeable is a powerful force in negotiations, and can even overwhelm logic. In some American courtrooms, juries will sometimes absolve someone of guilt in the face of overwhelming evidence simply because the prosecutor seems unpleasant. Similarly, if you like the sales person at a certain store, you are likely to shop there again, even if it is more expensive than the store next door. A less successful way of getting personal is to be obnoxious and offend the other person. If this happens in private, it will likely cost you a concession as you try to make up for your crude behavior. If it happens in public, you will cause the other person to lose face and you will almost certainly make a visceral enemy, meaning someone who is not only opposed to the ideas you are advocating but to you as a person. Once you make a visceral enemy, they are likely to stay that way, trying to trip you up at every opportunity. The best way to stay personal in a good way is to maintain a relaxed, cool demeanor. Try to imagine you’re negotiating on someone else’s behalf, as this will help you to not get emotionally involved. When you negotiate, make it personal – but in a good way. The key message in this book: You negotiate more often than you think, and hence should learn to do it well. The outcome of any negotiation primarily depends on the power, time and information each side has at their disposal. Though some negotiators aim to win at all costs, it is entirely possible to negotiate for mutual satisfaction. The questions this book answered: Why are negotiation skills important? Most things in the world can be negotiated, so you should learn to do it well. What kinds of negotiation strategies exist? Avoid Soviet-style negotiators – they mistake negotiations for battlefields. Collaborative win-win negotiations are possible when everyone’s needs are identified and harmonized. What factors affect the outcome of a negotiation? Successful negotiation means tapping into the many sources of power at your disposal. Make it hard for the other side to say no, but guard yourself against this same tactic. The distribution and sharing of information can greatly affect your negotiation success. Deadlines can influence negotiations, but don’t consider them absolute.

That’s a tantalizingly romantic image, but unfortunately it’s not the one that’s going to make your website help your business. What you need is a website that functions as smoothly as possible – one that works more like a motorcycle than a sculpture: It’ll have to be constantly tested and tweaked, with new pieces added or taken away, and old pieces fixed or modified to make the whole machine run better. These blinks show you how to make your website match your wider business goals by focusing on what is arguably the most important metric: conversion rate. You’ll also learn about which specific features of your website can improve your conversion rate, and how you can be sure your website is constantly improving. In these blinks, you’ll learn why SEO is your conversion rate’s friend, not its enemy; how to make visitors stay on your website longer; and how Wordpress learned to prevent its users from feeling anxious. In today’s Information Age, businesses need a good web presence if they want to succeed – even if they’re selling their products primarily offline. In fact, according to a study conducted by Experian, 90 percent of buyers research products online before purchasing them offline. Clearly, you need a website. But not just any old website! To run a successful business, it’s not enough to optimize your website in a way that nets you huge traffic. That traffic needs to convert into immediate monetary value. So your goal is to turn your site visitors into real customers, and that’s what conversion rate is all about. The conversion rate describes what percentage of site visitors complete some action that you want them to carry out, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter and so on. Simply put, your site’s conversion rate is its number of visitors divided by the number of those visitors who do the thing you want them to do. Your goal, then, is to maximize the amount of products you sell to the visitors you already have using conversion rate optimization (CRO). Not only does CRO directly affect your conversion rate, it also helps you to avoid the halo effect caused by a poorly made website. The halo effect is when a customer’s bad experience with your website negatively affects their perception of your products. The author, for example, recalls a visit he paid to BlackBerry’s website, which was incredibly slow due to their use of large images. Once the page was finally fully loaded, the author was met with a range of the newest BlackBerry phones under the headline: “Unbelievably fast. Unmistakably BlackBerry.” Irony aside, this slow loading time might make it harder for customers to actually believe that BlackBerry phones are as fast as they claim. Even though the website’s loading time is entirely unrelated to the phone, that general feeling of slowness continues to hang, halo-like, over the product. When optimizing their website, most companies look to design agencies. The problem, however, is that a good design agency can’t necessarily optimize your site for conversion rate or revenue. While they may excel at creating a sleek, aesthetically pleasing website, they usually don’t know what your website’s business goals actually are. In fact, many design agencies have no clue which criteria are most important for creating a successful website. This is apparent in the very first question design agencies ask their new clients: “What do you want your website to look like?” Clients who don’t know any better tend to look at their competitors’ websites for inspiration. But what if those websites are as poorly optimized as your own? Without access to conversion data, it’s extremely difficult to gauge the actual effectiveness of their websites. Consequently, companies are left to judge these websites based on how they look. But, really, the most important criterion is how the website works, how it affects revenue. Another huge mistake designers make when redesigning a client’s website is using the HiPPO Method for decision-making, that is, deferring to the “highest-paid person’s opinion.” When designers present their concepts to the client, the final decision is often left in the hands of one person, such as a department head or C-level executive. Yet, despite their fancy titles, such people are not always knowledgeable enough to make these kinds of decisions. Instead, designers and companies should use the Customer Tested Method, based on the scientific method of hypothesis and testing. With this method, you formulate hypotheses about which page design will produce the highest conversion rate, and then test it to see if certain designs and layouts yield more conversions. If you have a promising layout, don’t argue about its effectiveness. Test it! When companies rebuild their websites, it seems like all they talk about is SEO. In their obsession with their search engine rank, some people worry that CRO will undermine all the hard work they put into climbing up to rank number one on Google. Fixated on search engine rank, they tend to prioritize SEO over CRO. However, you need both to make a successful website, and they actually work hand in hand. For instance, one CRO goal is to keep users on your site for as long as possible and to encourage them to take action while they’re there. Sites optimized for CRO are thus more user-friendly, which is also good for SEO. To see how this works, consider that good sites have a clear content hierarchy, relevant pictures and relevant content, all of which keeps users engaged. Conveniently, these are some of the same criteria Google uses to determine a site’s ranking on their search engine. So, by removing things like complicated animation that takes 90 seconds to load, visitors won’t get frustrated with the endless loading and so won’t leave your site after only a few seconds. This, in turn, will lead to a better conversion rate, and Google will recognize the faster load-time and improve your site’s rank. Some people are also afraid that rigorous testing will result in deleted or altered site elements that were responsible for your good ranking. But this can easily be avoided with some simple tricks: First, use a proper CRO tool with JavaScript Redirect that will make your test invisible to search engines. Second, make sure that you use the same title tags, meta tags and heading content (all of which are important for SEO) from your old page on all pages you subject to CRO testing. Now that you have a solid understanding of why CRO is so important, our following blinks will reveal how to actually go about optimizing for conversion rate. Your reason for building a website shouldn’t be “just because.” You have to have a clear reason for doing so, that is, you need clearly defined goals. Otherwise, you’re simply wasting valuable time and energy. These goals need to be much more substantial than “increase sales!” Start by defining why your website exists at all. Did you build it to offer information about your company and products? Or do you want to generate leads for your sales teams? Is it for engagement on Facebook and Twitter? Or are you hoping to cultivate a special brand image? Whatever your reason, it must be clearly defined before you can actually optimize for your desired results. Next, make a list of website goals that follow from your top-down goals waterfall. Using this system, higher-order goals inform lower-order goals, which then inform your specific goals for conversion-optimization tests. For example, your list might look like this: the first goal is to increase product sales, your second goal is to increase whitepaper downloads, your third to generate more blog comments and your fourth to raise social media activity. Throughout this entire chain, the goal of optimization should be to increase product sales. This system will make your site layout simpler, too. If you know that your primary goal is to increase sales, then every website element that boosts them should be improved first. Elements that work toward your second goal are secondary, and so on. With your goals clearly defined, it’s time to figure out which website elements can actually increase the conversion rate for these goals. So how do you know which factors actually influence your conversion rate? One good way to find out is by using the LIFT model: Landing page Influence Function for Tests. The LIFT model consists of six factors: value proposition, relevance, clarity, anxiety, distraction and urgency. Each of these factors can be improved in order to raise conversion rate. Value proposition, that is, what your site offers its visitors, is the very foundation of conversion rate optimization. If they see that the benefits of your product outweigh its costs, then they’ll take action! If you have a strong value proposition but struggle to communicate it, then you’ve got the perfect starting point for optimization. However, if your value proposition is weak, it will be difficult to improve conversion rates, even with a perfect website. If the product is no good, then you’ll have to go back to the drawing board. With a strongly communicated value proposition, you can start optimizing the other factors: Relevance, meaning that visitors who come to your site should find what they’re looking for easily. When people land on your site in search of something specific, they quickly scan the site looking for signal words, so you need to consider how to best display them. For example, if they found your site while looking for fountain-pen ink, then it should be easy for them to find the section on the page where ink is sold. Clarity is all about communicating what you mean. This is simple: just make your content easy to understand. Anxiety refers to the hesitation that prospective customers have before taking action. A good way to combat this is by establishing credibility so that your visitors feel safe. Make it clear to them that you won’t send them spam or misuse their private information. Reducing distraction means removing items from your site – such as animations or large images – that could steal attention from your primary message. Finally, inspiring urgency makes the visitors feel that they have to take action right now. One way to create urgency is to make limited-time offers. Some businesses focus on only a single factor to improve their conversions. However, this is a grave mistake, as neglecting any one factor causes you to miss out on possible conversions. The more factors you improve, the better your conversion rate will be. But to start improving the factors that affect conversion, you’ll need to develop hypotheses for them. Start by assessing each factor on your current page, and think about ways they could be improved. The idea here is to transform your weaknesses into strengths. For example, imagine you assessed your wine website for relevance only to discover that your headline doesn’t even mention wine. This discovery gives you an opportunity to turn your weak headline into one that keeps customers on the page. It’s now time to develop some hypotheses. Each hypothesis is a statement following this formula: Changing [a problem or weakness] into [what you want it to be] will improve conversion rate for [your goal]. Going back to our wine example, you could hypothesize that repeating the word “wine” or other wine terms in the headline will increase the number of visitors who stay on your site, therefore improving conversions. Furthermore, a good hypothesis is testable, meaning that it can be isolated in order to confirm or falsify it. For example, “Our visitors prefer the Helvetica font” isn’t a testable hypothesis. In contrast, “Changing our headline font from Arial to Helvetica will increase the conversion rate for newsletter sign-ups” is testable, because you’ll definitely be able to say whether or not it’s true after testing. Have you ever visited a company’s website that just gave you the creeps because it felt unsafe and unreliable? That’s the anxiety that’ll kill conversion rates for even the best products. So, it’s crucial that you do everything in your power to make visitors to your site feel at ease. We’re in the age of WikiLeaks, identity theft and controversial social-media privacy policies, so people are more concerned about their private data than ever before. Companies therefore have to try hard to prove their trustworthiness to customers and justify the collection of their information. To drive the point home, consider that a 2009 Forrester Research online retail survey found that asking for too much information causes 12 percent of e-commerce shoppers to abandon their online shopping carts. One thing you can do to reduce privacy anxiety is to decrease the number of form fields prospective customers have to fill out to complete a sale on your website. Another way is to add text that explains why you need to collect data and how you’ll use it. You could either put it right in the form itself or in a special privacy policy section that you’ve added at the bottom of your pages. Customers can also develop usability anxiety resulting from the frustration they feel when they have difficulty using your website. Poorly designed forms can confuse your visitors, and even make them feel stupid. And that’s all it takes to drive them from your site for good! You should also assume that even the clearest forms will result in user error. One way to reduce usability anxiety is to point out mistakes made on forms in a gentle and friendly way. For example, if you try to sign up at WordPress.com with a username that already exists, an italicized message will appear: “Sorry, that username already exists.” By apologizing and using unintimidating lowercase letters, people won’t feel stupid about their error and are encouraged to try again. Users go through two stages when they land on a new website: the initial impression stage and the message-consumption stage. Distraction is a hazard during both stages, and when you allow their attention to wander away from your value-proposition message and your call to action, then you end up with a lower conversion rate. Distraction in the initial impression stage can cause your visitors to leave right after they arrive. The initial impression of a website occurs within seconds and is based completely on visual stimulus. During this stage, users make a quick decision about their next action: Do they stay on the page because it looks interesting or inviting? Or do they leave because it’s not visually appealing? Knowing this, it’s important to test the different elements on your landing page, that is, the page visitors see first when they enter a website. Try different layouts and headlines that draw the eye, and keep the number of images to a minimum. Be meticulous: even minor details like background textures and asymmetrical designs can cause distraction. If your page has survived the initial impression, you’ll still want to reduce distraction in the message-consumption stage. Here, it’s important to concentrate on the quality of your messages and interactions. Don’t overwhelm your visitors with messages that all compete for their attention. Instead, focus on a few messages on each of your pages. This principle is widely known – even politicians get the best results when they stick to a few talking points and repeat their position. It’s no different for advertising messages. It’s also worth reducing the number of choices a visitor has on each page. For example, if you’re selling laptops it’d be smart to present only a few basic options first, instead of presenting your entire catalogue at once. We’ve spent a lot of time talking about developing a hypothesis. But how exactly do you go about testing it? Start by building a test plan, which includes your test goals and the structure of your experiment. Your test goals will vary depending on your CRO goals. For instance, if your CRO goal is to generate more leads, then your test goals could be increasing online brochure downloads or newsletter sign-ups. To measure your goals, you’ll need to establish goal triggers, specific user actions that demonstrate that the goal was completed. If your goal is to increase brochure downloads, for example, then the goal trigger could be a “Thank you” page that appears after a successful download. By calculating how many people come to this page, you can calculate how many times your brochure was downloaded. So how long should your test last? It’s not enough to gather data for just a few days. Rather, your test should run at least 10 days over two weekends to control for random variables. For example, it’s entirely possible that your higher conversions on Sunday aren’t related to your test goal, but simply to the fact that people have more time over the weekend to shop online. Once you’ve performed your tests, it’s time to analyze the data and convert your findings into action. Be open to whatever conclusions you arrive at based on the data. You might find that changes you made to your site that you thought would be trivial end up having the biggest impact on conversions! Finally, remember that CRO is an ongoing process. It will take more than one test to optimize your website. What’s more, your customers’ wants and needs will change with the times, so you need to be ready to change with them. If you’re doing things right, then you’ll incorporate testing as a regular part of your operation in order to constantly drive and improve conversions. The key message in this book: Great conversion rates depend on a lot more than just a great product. Rather, they’re the result of an ongoing process of rigorous testing, scrutinizing and experimentation.

Moore","summary":"Not so long ago, the idea of a handheld device with the power of a supercomputer seemed the stuff of science fiction. But in 2007, Apple released the iPhone and the market for mobile devices was disrupted in a major fashion. Leaders like Nokia crumbled; others like Samsung soldiered on. So in an age of constant innovation and market disruption, what’s the secret formula to keep your company ahead of the pack? These blinks outline a revolutionary system called four zones of management. When you implement this system, you’ll not only successfully weather competitive disruptions but also learn to disrupt your market and dominate your rivals. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to keep a product relevant after a market disruption; when it’s good to focus on innovation (and when it’s not); and how Microsoft got innovative to stay afloat in the mobile market. Any surfer knows that you’ve got to catch a wave at just the right moment. The same holds for companies. To grow, they need to catch the next wave of innovation before a competitor does. In fact, the best way for a company to grow rapidly is to introduce a new product or service that turns an industry on its head: consider the innovations of online marketing, cloud computing or electric vehicles. Being an innovative market leader can be extremely profitable, often yielding 20 percent revenue growth over the first five to seven years after a new product or service is introduced. On the other hand, if you miss the wave, there’s no way to catch it later. You’re best off searching for another swell later on! Companies that experience continuous growth are experts at catching innovation waves. For instance, Apple caught not one but three waves in the last ten years: digital music, smartphones and tablets. In doing so, the company completely transformed the market for mobile technology. Disruptive innovations, however, can also throw whole industries off balance, as a disruption in one field can have far-reaching effects in others. With the release of the iPhone, not only was the market for mobile phones turned upside down but also the commercial airline sector had to adjust to the new reality. Customers suddenly wanted to use their smartphones to book trips, download boarding passes and track flights. Thus the airlines that could quickly build a strong mobile app had a huge advantage in the market. But this particular disruption didn’t just require a simple infrastructure upgrade. The introduction of smartphones forced airlines to reconsider all their processes, from check-in to lounge services to boarding – requiring substantial investments that didn’t immediately result in additional profits. So disruptive changes certainly can be difficult for companies to handle. This is why it’s essential to know how to manage disruption when it comes knocking at your company’s door. If you’re dating in your 30s, you probably know it’s not easy to compete with 20-somethings in the “dating market.” Doing so requires fundamental changes to your dating strategy. In the same vein, while established companies certainly can compete with lean, disruptive start-ups, they first have to restructure their business models. Doing so is a question of survival, as a savvy start-up can easily upend an existing enterprise. Young companies are focused on a single goal – building a new product – while established companies have to balance maintaining a current business model and handling market disruptions simultaneously. The field of journalism, for instance, has faced major disruptions with the advent of digital technology. Over the past 15 years, printed media outlets have had to grapple with the power of the internet and the rising use of smartphones. As a result, subscription numbers have plummeted, and many journalists have lost their jobs. To compete effectively in a disruptive world, established companies need to thoughtfully restructure operations into four zones. The first is the performance zone. Here is where employees who sell an existing product are located. In the automotive industry, for example, this zone would be populated by people who sell cars or who generate direct income for the company. The second is the productivity zone. This zone encompasses all activity that doesn’t directly generate revenue but provides necessary support for revenue generation. Producing cars, marketing the company brand, providing customer service and managing human resources are all found here. The third is the incubation zone. This group is responsible for seeking out innovative solutions to boost the growth of the company. In the automotive industry, this zone might focus on developing new types of energy-efficient engines, for example. And finally, the last zone is the transformation zone. This zone focuses on finding ways for the company to adapt to competitors’ disruptive innovations. If a competitor is developing a highly efficient electric engine, for instance, this zone would form a competitive response. Now you know the general framework for the four zones of management. So let’s take a closer look at how each one works. As the adage goes, sometimes you have to take a step backward to move forward. Companies eager to grow and succeed need to accept the minor setbacks that may eventually lead to innovative solutions. In fact, a company’s revenue-generating activities – located in the performance zone – are often put under stress by the firm’s efforts at innovation. Maintaining two competing priorities can be distracting. On the one hand, a company wants to create new products, while on the other, it wants to maintain revenue and shareholder confidence. At the end of the day, however, a company has to choose a priority and stick with it – and that choice should always be innovation. If an innovation disrupts a market segment successfully, the resulting revenue will easily compensate for any dip in performance during the years when the product was in development. The situation changes when you’re facing a period of disruption caused by another company. Here you’ll need to sacrifice innovation to keep your established customers loyal. Companies can find themselves with new technology still in the pipeline when a competitor launches an innovative, disruptive product. In situations like this, instead of sticking with development, the smart company will sacrifice its incubating projects to remain competitive. Let’s say you own a car company, and your competitor launches an electric vehicle – an idea that your company also has been working on for some time. While you’ve spent lots of money developing your project, you need to focus now on your existing business to protect market share. But as you’ll learn later, your transformation-zone team will help you adapt to the disruption, once your revenue stream is secured. Imagine you’re a talented home baker who wants to start a cake business. How do you go from baking one cake per day to baking and selling thousands of cakes per month? The productivity zone is where these ideas are born. This area focuses on driving efficiency and effectiveness to grow your business for success. Here’s how it works. A company starts by developing systems to improve its overall efficiency. In general, systems are standard procedures within a business that are fixed and universally applicable. For instance, most companies have a set system when a new employee is hired. That individual is introduced to the company through a standard process, including things like signing contracts, meeting with human relations, reviewing company best practices and so on. Companies use programs to improve effectiveness. In contrast to systems, programs are temporary and targeted. For example, when a new product is released, a group meets and determines how to market the product. Once a solution is reached, a program ends. One such program that’s beneficial for both efficiency and effectiveness is called the end of life program. This program handles situations in which companies reallocate resources from older revenue sources to newer, more profitable ventures. To make a switch, a company can periodically introduce an end of life program. This is often triggered amid a disruption, in which certain products become uncompetitive. One good example of this is how the music industry gradually phased out CD production in the switch to digital music. Amid a disruption, an end of life program also works to reallocate talent to new tasks, cut the older product from sales and, unfortunately, handle layoffs and shutdown expenses. The first rule of incubation is to ensure a future product meets certain standards that will guarantee a successful market disruption. First off, your innovative product should represent a new product or business opportunity for your company. Enhancing or building on an existing product isn’t enough to qualify it for incubation. Your product should also aim to produce at least 10 percent more revenue than the existing product you plan to disrupt. For example, when Apple launched its iPhone, the company’s goal would have been to earn at least 10 percent more revenue than the market leader at the time, Blackberry. And finally, your product should have the potential to increase total company revenue by at least 10 percent. If you find your projections fall short of that, your innovation isn’t worth the risk. By following these standards, your company can lower any given product’s chances of market failure. More importantly, these guidelines will help you prove to skeptical shareholders that their money is being invested in innovative and worthwhile ventures. So let’s say your product meets all the above criteria. It then can move from incubation to development, and once developers have created and tested the product, management can build a release strategy. Regarding your product release, your first step is to win over a brand ambassador for your innovation. Ideally, this individual is an intelligent, charismatic person who understands your product and will advocate its use to other influential early adopters. Entrepreneur Sean Parker in 2004 was the first person to invest in Facebook, for instance. He also served as an ambassador for the social media platform, using his contacts to help transform the start-up into a multibillion-dollar company. Once you’ve secured an ambassador, you need a strategy geared toward winning a dominant share of your expected market. To do so, you’ll need to gain the trust of product advocates who will support your product as long as it fits their business needs. Military generals need to maintain constant discipline over troops, a control that is put to the test on the battlefield. Your company’s transformation zone is only activated in similarly militant situations, such as when a competitor disrupts your market position with a new product or service. Your transformation zone is your tool as a leader to deal with a crisis. After all, a market disruption is the true test of a company CEO. During normal operations, a CEO handles day-to-day management; during a disruption, the leader’s role transforms. Daily issues are passed off to the executive team, while the CEO focuses on dealing with the crisis. So how does a CEO proceed? To handle a market disruption, a business leader must neutralize, optimize and differentiate. Let’s start by examining how to neutralize a disruption. A CEO needs to act quickly, adopting the best features of the disruptive technology and adding them to the company’s competing product. When mobile ridesharing app Uber launched in San Francisco, it disrupted the operations of the established taxi industry. To neutralize the threat posed by Uber, several companies developed an app, enabling customers to use their smartphones to order and pay for a taxi, just like Uber. Once you’ve neutralized the disruption, a CEO’s next goal is to optimize the company’s product. San Francisco cab companies might have, for example, implemented additional features to their app such as a way to rate the quality of drivers, which Uber also offers. And finally, a CEO has to consider how to create a product or service that’s truly competitive and disruptive on its own. Crucially, the product needs to be entirely different than that of your competitor! Naturally, this goal leads a CEO and her team back to the incubation zone. Are you the type of person who sorts documents, makes lists and generally keeps things under control? If so, as a CEO you’ll excel at this next step, in which you put all you’ve learned in these blinks into action.   First, divide your company into four zones. Every organization, initiative and company employee should be assigned to a specific zone and function, according to the rules of each zone. But just because you work in a particular zone doesn’t mean you can’t assign your staff to work or be part of other zones. For instance, if you’re in productivity, staff members don’t necessarily need to commit all their time to productivity goals. You might consider delegating some incubator tasks within your department, too.   Once you’ve created your zones, activate the ones dedicated to performance and productivity. Begin with an annual planning process and a corresponding budgeting session. Determine which programs and sales goals you want to see realized this year and ensure you have the money to do so. Your incubation zone requires a bit more flexibility. It’s impossible to plan exactly when projects will need to be fed into your company’s incubator. The correct timing is a matter of feel and depends on the company’s needs and market position at any given time.   However, you should decide how much money you can spend on future incubation projects and determine the members of the zone’s board of governance. The CEO and the executive board should make these decisions. Finally, determine whether a transformation zone is necessary. Decide whether it needs to be inactive, reactive or proactive this year. Once you’ve determined the zone’s status, apportion funds and resources accordingly. The experience of Microsoft is one poignant example of how a disruption can hobble even a technology giant. The company’s Windows operating system has experienced serious headwinds in the face of competition from mobile technology. The boom in smartphones has benefited Microsoft’s biggest competitors, Apple and Google, both of which have developed mobile operating systems that together dominate most handheld devices on the market today. What’s more, as the popularity of smartphones has increased, developers have focused more energy toward creating products for iOS or Android, ignoring Windows platforms. After years of dominating the market for operating systems, Microsoft Windows has fallen hard. But this disruption hasn’t crushed Microsoft completely. Instead, the company channeled energy into its transformation zone and is meeting the challenge with innovative strategies.   CEO Satya Nadella was appointed in 2014 to head an effort to regain customers in the face of increased competition in the mobile market. Microsoft decided to make Office available as a free download for smartphones that ran iOS or Android. This decision helped Microsoft retain loyal customers, those who already use Office on a home computer but who could now access the program in a mobile format. Microsoft at the same time is developing new products through its incubation zone to remain competitive. For example, its search engine Bing has made serious inroads as a Google competitor. Bing is focused on incorporating innovative, disruptive features, such as its ability to learn from daily search queries. The search engine is also working on incorporating algorithms that could, eventually, help urban planners create “smart” roads, buildings or even cities. The key message in this book: Disruptive technology doesn’t necessarily mean the end of existing businesses. By incorporating disruptive ideas and remaining open to development, established companies can still thrive.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But less is said about the many ways in which meditation can also support being a boss and even improve a small or large business. The idea of meditation being good for business may raise some skeptical eyebrows, but author Rob Dubé has put together some pretty convincing evidence that will likely win over the doubters. For starters, he charts his experiences of adding meditation to his daily routine and how it helped him turn his business around and earn record profits. Dubé also offers a lot of scientific evidence to explain why regular meditation will not only result in benefits like better attention and listening skills, but how they can help you become a better boss. As the saying goes, numbers don’t lie, and in this case, they all suggest that meditation is something that every manager and executive should consider adding to their toolbox. In these blinks, you’ll learn how listening can empower your employees; how a skiing accident led to one company saving millions in health-care costs; and how meditation can make you a better runner. In 1991, Dubé and his friend, Joel Pearlman, founded imageOne, a company that recycled toner cartridges for laser printers. At the time, sitting down to meditate was the last thing on Dubé’s mind.  Fast forward to 2004. The company now had annual earnings of $6 million and was bought by a billion-dollar corporation. The deal was supposed to allow Dubé and Pearlman to run their company as a subsidiary, with their autonomy intact, but it soon became clear that they were no longer serving their own vision. As they lost control of their company, they lost their passion for business. For Dubé, once he no longer knew what he was working for, he began to grow increasingly anxious and worn out. Fortunately, this is when he discovered the peace of mind that comes from meditating. The first time Dubé tried meditation, it was just a five-minute session that involved nothing more than sitting in his chair. But these five minutes eventually led to a daily practice that has brought him innumerable benefits. To begin with, it allows Dubé to focus on his work with a clear mind, unencumbered by judgemental or otherwise distracting mental noise. As a result, his practice has made him more productive, more capable of seeing the day’s trivial problems with a fresh perspective, and given him greater access to his innovative ideas. He’s also experienced the wonderful meditative benefit of no longer being controlled by a fear of failure, while also experiencing a newfound openness to experiencing novel situations. Meanwhile, he was finally able to relax in his spare time. While these are all priceless benefits, Dubé also has meditation to thank for getting his company to where it needed to be. In June 2006, Dubé and Pearlman jumped at the chance to buy back their company. At the time, Dubé was nine months into his daily practice, and this was instrumental in helping him manage the unavoidable stress and anxiety that took place during the re-buying process. Meditation was the tool that allowed him to slow down, take a step back and re-examine his priorities. With his added clarity, he and his partner were able to identify what mattered most going forward. This included being the kind of leaders who cared about their employees, put a high value on company culture and made a positive impact on their community. Thanks to the revitalization effort Dubé and Pearlman put into their company, a decade after they reacquired it, imageOne was featured on a 2017 Forbes list called Small Giants: America’s Best Small Companies. This honor was the result of years of hard work and overcoming one obstacle after another. And for Dubé, it was an honor made possible by meditation and the clear and calm determination it provided. One of the more memorable obstacles occurred around the summer of 2014 when it was becoming obvious that the company was on a bad trajectory. Unless changes were made, it was clear that they were not only going to miss their sales and revenue targets, they’d also be operating at a loss. What followed was a series of “panic meetings” initiated by the executives. Although the situation was dire, Dubé didn’t feel the least bit panicky. His regular meditation sessions were making him feel calm, clear and confident – so much so that he took on the bold solution of switching to the process of open-book finances. Such financial transparency would mean that the company’s balance sheets and income statements would be shared with everyone on the team. This wasn’t an easy decision to make, but with meditation helping to calm his nerves, he was able to follow through and, sure enough, the transition worked wonders: with all those extra hands on deck, it not only led to quick solutions but it also led to 2016 and 2017 becoming record-breaking years for profit. Another valuable benefit of meditation has to do with attention. Thanks to his practice, Dubé was now feeling more present in meetings and better at listening and truly understanding what people were saying.  While this is naturally useful in personal relationships, it’s also highly valuable in a company. Every effective leader needs to be fully present and hear the input of their team members and what they need. After all, people have a basic need to know that they’re being heard. So giving someone your undivided attention shouldn’t be seen as doing them a favor. Instead, it’s a basic courtesy that everyone from children to adults deserve. As Dubé discovered, listening is also an act of empowerment. By being fully present with his employees, he’s shown that he values their service and opinions. This, in turn, gives them the confidence needed to grow and become even better at their jobs. Plus, when you truly listen, you’ll be in a better position to understand someone’s strengths and weaknesses so that you may provide more thoughtful improvement strategies. Therefore, when you listen, everyone wins. If you’re still skeptical about the benefits of meditation, you don’t have to take the author’s word for it. You can also look to scientific facts. In 2015, the Journal of Management published a study from Pepperdine University School of Business. It revealed that a person’s attention and focus could be significantly boosted by just a few hours of mindfulness practice. Mindfulness is a form of meditation intended to bring more awareness to what’s going on around us and in our minds in the present moment. Since our minds are estimated to be aimlessly wandering for approximately 50 percent of our waking hours, mindfulness, which can reduce that amount, can go a long way in making us more productive. But increased attention isn’t the only scientifically proven benefit. A 2011 Harvard University study used MRI scans to show that two months of mindfulness meditation increased the amount of the gray-matter density in the hippocampus, which is the area most closely associated with memory and learning. It perhaps comes as no surprise that meditation has now become a common practice in the business world. Mark Bertolini is the CEO of the insurance giant Aetna, and according to Fortune magazine, he’s also among the top 50 World’s Greatest Leaders. In the early 2000s, Bertolini had to face some serious hardships after helping his teenage son recover from a cancer diagnosis and overcoming his own life-threatening injuries from a skiing accident that left him with a partially paralyzed left arm. Bertolini began his meditation practice during his recovery, and he credits it for helping him to heal faster. So, after he was made Aetna’s CEO in 2010, he set about sharing these benefits with his employees. This included a health and wellness program that promoted better sleep and nutrition habits as well as the practice of yoga and meditation. The program proved popular, with over a quarter of Aetna’s 50,000 employees signing up. Soon, the participants reported a 28 percent decrease in their stress levels, while their productivity increased by an additional 62 minutes per week. That added up to around $3,000 more in annual revenue per person.  But it wasn’t just the employees who benefitted. Aetna’s health-care costs also dropped by 7 percent. These numbers tell the truth: everyone can benefit from meditation.  While meditation has a proven track record for helping business leaders and their companies, there’s really no limit or boundaries to how calm focus and increased awareness can improve one’s life. For example, many soldiers have found meditation to be extremely useful for combating the stress and trauma that comes from being on active duty. The events that a soldier experiences on the battlefield often lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a debilitating condition characterized by anxiety, amnesia and repeated flashbacks. Holly Richardson and Matt Jarman teach cadets meditation at the Virginia Military Institute, and in doing so, they’re giving the cadets a valuable tool to prevent and cope with the symptoms of PTSD. Many studies support what Richardson and Jarman have experienced: When active-duty soldiers regularly practice meditative awareness, they’re better prepared for going into battle and coping with the post-combat stress that inevitably follows. As a result, the soldiers are more capable of recognizing when they’re experiencing a flashback and bringing themselves back into the safe environment of the present moment. By doing so, soldiers have been able to reduce significantly the post-combat stress that leads to PTSD. As for Dubé himself, he’s found meditation to be a great asset in helping him stay calm and clear during the 14 marathons in which he’s participated.  This calm clarity is especially beneficial during the “taper period,” which is the days leading up to the big event when runners hold back and run fewer miles than usual to save their energy. During this time, it’s common for runners to become anxious and wonder if they should be running more, so meditation has been extremely useful in reducing this anxiety and finding a calm and focused presence ahead of a big race. And then there’s the recovery period after the race when meditation can ward off the feeling of emptiness that often takes over once the high of the race wears off.  Perhaps most useful of all was the help meditation provided when tragedy struck the Boston Marathon in April 2013. Dubé’s family was at the marathon to cheer him on, and he credits meditation with enabling him to stay calm and care for his family after the bombings and the chaos that ensued. Even though he was shaken by the attack, meditation also helped him move on and run the New York Marathon seven months later, in defiance of the terrorists. Now that you’re well aware of the benefits, let’s get down to the business of how you can start reaping the rewards of your meditation practice. The first step to any successful session is to find a good place where you can practice undisturbed. This should ideally be a quiet spot at home or in the office, where you can enjoy some privacy or otherwise close the door and let others know that you’re not to be interrupted. While peace and quiet may be important early on, after practicing for a while, you’ll find that the level of noise is less important when considering a place to meditate. Once you have your location, it’s time to find a comfortable position. Many people, including the author, enjoy sitting cross-legged on a meditation pillow so that they can feel a strong, grounded connection to the earth. This isn’t a requirement, however, so don’t worry if this position feels uncomfortable for you. But keep in mind that the main priority is comfort and not relaxation. So, if you prefer a meditation bench or a chair, avoid leaning back in the chair. But if you can only get comfortable by leaning back, or even lying down on a bed, that’s OK. And if you fall asleep during the session, don’t worry, you probably needed the rest! That said, there is an ideal posture for meditation. Just like a sprinter’s starting position, this position is intended to maximize the performance by letting you be comfortably still for long periods of time. The best posture is sitting upright without too much rigidity or slouching. Your chin should be pointed toward your chest so that your eyes are aimed slightly downward. You can keep your eyes closed or open, but you should try to focus your gaze softly inward as if you’re looking out through the back of your head. Once you’re settled, let yourself feel grounded within your body by noticing how parts of your body, such as your feet, legs and bottom, are connecting you to the ground. Now, you can begin by simply noticing your breathing.  Notice each inhale, with the breath coming through your nose and down into your lungs, and then coming back up and out through the exhale. As much as you can, continue to notice your body and your breathing. Some thoughts are sure to intrude, but that’s OK. Whenever a thought arises, just gently move your attention away from the thought and back to the in-breath and out-breath. That’s all there is to it. It may sound simple, but as we’ll see in the next blink, it takes consistent, regular practice for you to experience sustained benefits. Just like any other exercise, the rewards of meditation come from regular practice. So, in a way, you can think of sitting and meditating as a way of strengthening your “presence muscles.” But if you’ve ever let a gym membership expire, then you know that being consistent at exercising is easier said than done. So here are some helpful tips to help you stick with it. First off, you should set a goal for yourself. If you’re a manager or business leader, then you know the motivational power of clear goals – they can act like a guiding light to keep progress and development moving forward. Therefore, a good goal to start with would be to sit down for 20 minutes of meditation, every day, for three weeks. As science tells us, three weeks, or 21 days, is the average time it takes to start a habit. The second tip for getting you through those crucial first weeks is to give your practice a steady and familiar context, by sticking to a regular time and place – such as in the bedroom, first thing every morning. The third tip is to start small and keep in mind that the continued practice is key. If 20 minutes proves too difficult, make it 15. If one day all you can do is take one mindful minute, that’s all right. It will still keep the ball rolling and help get you toward a regular practice. The last tip is to look at the various meditation apps that are available, such as Meditation Studio and 10% Happier. These can also help keep you on track. If you still feel like you don’t have enough time or patience for meditation, maybe Tim Ferriss can convince you otherwise. Ferriss is the author of multiple best-selling lifestyle books, including The 4 Hour Workweek and Tools of Titans. He’s also a very busy man. If he isn’t writing or researching a book, he’s likely prepping or recording his popular podcast The Tim Ferriss Show. Nevertheless, amid all these responsibilities, Ferriss never fails to find 20 minutes every day for meditation. Like many others, he sees his daily practice as giving him time, not taking it away. Ferriss believes meditation has made him at least 50 percent more productive than he used to be. He’s called it a much-needed “warm-up in recovering from distraction.”  It’s also worth noting that when Ferriss interviewed one hundred of the best entrepreneurs and innovators for his book, Tools of Titans, he found that more than 80 of them had a daily meditation practice. If you want to become a better leader, a regular meditation practice will help by making you more self-aware and attentive to your surroundings and other people. But if you want to take it a step further, you could try a silent retreat. Silent retreats offer you a way to go even deeper into your practice and have become popular for a variety of successful leaders, including Jeffrey Walker, a leading UN administrator, and Andrew Cherng, CEO of Panda Express. While people can go on silent retreats that last a day or several years, the author recommends a first-time retreat of around four to seven days. During a typical retreat, the first couple of days involve settling in and receiving instructions about how all the participants and instructors will remain completely silent. When you begin to meditate at a silent retreat, you’re likely to start out just skimming the surface of your thoughts. But then the complete silence begins to set in, and you’ll find yourself going deeper and letting go of mundane worries, like that recent argument you had with your partner or that stressful project at work.  When you’re immersed in a silent retreat, you may find some deeply buried thoughts and emotions rising to the surface, but at the same time, you may find groundbreaking ideas and connections also emerging. Once, when the author was sitting at a retreat, he noticed the hair bun of the person in front of him and became overwhelmed by tears of happiness since it connected him to cherished memories of his daughter. In the final days of your retreat, you’ll be eased out of the silence and prepared to re-enter the world. This is like being pulled from the depths back to the surface of your thoughts. But it’s done in a gentle way so that you’ll continue to feel grateful for the increased awareness, clarity of mind and fresh perspectives on yourself and the world around you. If this sounds good, you should research the many options around you. Naturally, the author recommends his four-day donothing Leadership Retreat, located in the Rocky Mountains near Fort Collins, Colorado. Along with sitting meditation, this retreat also offers mindful approaches to eating and resting, all while being in the company of other open-minded leaders eager to grow and learn. If you’re on the East Coast of the United States, you may prefer Menla, a Tibetan-inspired retreat and spa located in the Catskill Mountains, around two hours north of New York City. Whether or not you choose to take a retreat, one thing’s for sure: you won’t regret introducing a new and rewarding meditation practice into your life. The key message in these blinks: Regular meditation practice offers countless benefits, many of which are scientifically proven. It can provide you with a clear and calm mind to cope better with the daily stress of life, as well as provide you with more capabilities for being present and listening to employees. This will make you a better leader and more able to support your growth as well as the continued development of your employees. Embarking on a regular meditation practice is like any other habit; it takes consistent practice. And while this can be challenging, the rewards are well worth the effort.  Actionable advice: Divide your practice into chunks. If you set a goal for practicing 20 minutes a day, but find it difficult to sit still for 20 minutes, consider dividing that time into smaller chunks. For example, you could do ten minutes in the morning, before breakfast, and ten minutes before going to sleep at night. If this makes it more comfortable and more likely that you’ll continue a daily practice then make this your routine with the goal of eventually working your way back to a 20-minute sitting.

Whether it’s your phone buzzing in your pocket with the latest tweet, a colleague interrupting you in the middle of an important task or the daily barrage of emails, your time is constantly being stolen from you, minute by minute, hour by hour. And once you’ve lost that time, you can never get it back again. To remain focused and make sure these time thieves don’t get the upper hand, you need to keep a few tricks up your sleeve. These blinks will get you started. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the number 1,440 is so important; about the 321-Zero system; and how many books George W. Bush read throughout his presidency.   Do you ever wish you could have an extra hour in the day to read, exercise or hang out with the people you love? Well, you can and there’s no magic required! But first, you need to understand how precious time is. That’s why the first secret of time management is learning that time is your most valuable asset and that, once it’s lost, you can never get it back. A good way to monitor this precious resource is by breaking it down. For instance, there are 1,440 minutes in a day, each of which should be invested wisely. To remind himself of this fact, the author taped a “1,440” poster to his office door. It reminds him of the limited time in each day. But why use minutes? Why not think about the 86,400 seconds that every day offers? Well, there are a bunch of daily tasks that you can actually do in a minute, like knocking out 30 sit-ups, reading a poem or watering a plant. This fact makes minutes key to monitoring your time. Okay, now that you appreciate how valuable time is, it’s time to start prioritizing it. This is where the second secret comes in: determine and prioritize your most important task, or your MIT. This is the single task that will have the biggest impact on your life or work. Just take Therese Macan, a professor at the University of Missouri-St Louis. She found that one of the most important productivity determinants is the ability to identify priorities. So pinpointing an MIT is central to time management. For instance, if a senior executive sets a goal of developing a new app, her MIT might be to hire a new programmer. Or the MIT for a start-up CEO could be to prepare a great presentation to land a major investment. Research has shown that having a daily MIT, whatever it is, results in greater levels of happiness and improved focus. Lots of people are weighed down by never-ending to-do lists. Take a look at yours. How many of the tasks have been lingering there for weeks, unnecessarily stressing you out? You probably have at least a few such tasks, and the best way to deal with them is by pulling out a good old fashioned calendar. Here’s where the third secret comes into play: ditch your to-do list and pick up your calendar to de-stress your day. Research has found that an average of 41 percent of items on to-do lists never actually get completed. One of the reasons for this shocking statistic is that the tasks on such lists usually aren’t accompanied by a note stating how long it’ll take to complete them. As a result, tasks that are more difficult or less important generally get left undone. That might not be such a problem, except for the fact that the unfinished items on your to-do list will inevitably produce a lot of stress that could just as easily be avoided. In fact, researchers from Florida State University discovered that you can avoid this stress by simply coming up with a plan to complete a task. The Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller offers a good example. She succeeded at spending time with her family, completing her school obligations, training for the Olympics and even doing media interviews, all by scheduling time for important tasks. This strategy is known as time blocking or time boxing and, incredibly, all it requires is maintaining a detailed calendar. By doing so, Miller forced herself to prioritize tasks that would bring her closer to achieving her goal and, to this day, she keeps an almost minute-by-minute schedule. However, you’ll inevitably encounter tasks on your calendar that you can’t accomplish. When this happens, instead of letting them drift into the past, simply reschedule. For example, if you usually make it to the gym at noon, but have a flight to catch at the same time, simply move your workout to earlier in the day. Everyone’s been there: an important deadline is creeping up and, instead of working on the project at hand, you’re planted in front of a screen – scrolling through Facebook, texting a friend or watching your favorite TV show. Procrastination is a tough one, but, luckily, there are strategies to break free from it and start getting things done. This is where the fourth secret comes in: procrastination can be overcome by imagining your future self. After all, you don’t procrastinate because you're lazy, but because you don’t have sufficient motivation. Imagining yourself in the future can fix this problem and it’s as simple as asking yourself two questions: “What pleasure will I get by doing this thing?” and “What pain will I feel if I don’t do it?” For instance, if your goal is to work out every single day, but you can’t get yourself to exercise, just imagine having a huge beer belly and feeling totally sluggish. Such a mental routine will get you off the couch and onto the treadmill. At the same time, being honest about the actions your future self will take can also help you achieve your goals. For example, if you know you’ll be inclined to eat unhealthy snacks during a future break, you can protect yourself by throwing out all the junk food in your house. You could even go a step further by filling the house with healthy options like baby carrots and hummus. From there, you can move on to the fifth secret: there will always be more to do; you can’t do everything. And, actually, that’s fine! In fact, prioritizing and scheduling the tasks you want to do is much more valuable than crossing off as many items as possible. Just take President George W. Bush as an example. He knew there would always be more to do. So instead of trying to do everything, he made it his priority to read tons of books, since he found it therapeutic and educational. As a result, he read some 95 titles during his presidency! Have you ever had an incredible idea while shopping for groceries or walking the dog? Wouldn’t it be great if, instead of straining to remember it later, you could just jot it down right then and there? That’s why the sixth secret is to always have a notebook handy. After all, writing down your thoughts helps you hold onto them. Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson says he never would have built his business empire without his trusty notebook. He was so committed to writing down his ideas that, one time when he had a business idea and no notebook, he wrote down the thought in his passport! For him, if an idea doesn’t get written down, it could be lost forever. Taking notes by hand also helps your memory. For instance, the psychologists Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer found that students who hand wrote their notes during a TED talk were better able to recall the material than students who took notes on their laptops. Writing down your thoughts is crucial – as is maintaining control over your schedule, which is where the seventh secret comes into play. It says that you should avoid checking your email too often, lest other people dictate how you spend your time. In fact, contrary to popular belief, constantly checking emails is unproductive. That’s because the anticipation felt when checking your inbox is comparable to pulling the handle of a slot machine. Often, you check your messages, and there’s nothing new. But sometimes there is a new message. This unpredictability is addictive, and one begins to check more and more often, hoping for the hit of dopamine that a message affords. Obviously, this costs you time and interrupts your focus. A good way to untether yourself from your email is by unsubscribing from newsletters by using a program like unroll.me. But you can also adopt the 321-Zero system. To do so, just limit yourself to three email checks per day, while trying to get your inbox to zero in just 21 minutes. If you’ve ever had an office job, you know how incredibly boring meetings can be. But that’s not the only problem with meetings. The eighth secret is that most meetings are inefficient and you should only schedule them as a last resort. In fact, a 2015 survey found that 35 percent of respondents considered weekly status meetings to be a waste of time, for these two primary reasons: First, in accordance with Parkinson’s law of triviality, meeting participants tend to waste lots of time on insignificant issues. Second, extroverts usually dominate meetings, making others less likely to participate. As a result, valuable information might not be shared during such gatherings. That being said, if you absolutely have to have a meeting, opt for a stand-up affair rather than a sit-down one. This might seem odd, but researchers at Washington University found that meetings during which participants stand result in better collaboration, less attachment to ideas, higher levels of engagement and more effective problem-solving. The Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, offers another good tip: by scheduling meetings based on increments of five or ten minutes, she’s able to have up to 70 meetings a week. If she stuck with the standard 30-minute block she would never be able to accomplish this. In other words, controlling the timing of meetings will prevent people from sucking up your time. This is key since other people will constantly ask you for things, a fact that dovetails nicely with the ninth secret: achieve your immediate goals faster by saying no to most things. After all, every time you say yes to something, you’re saying no to something else. The Olympic rower Sara Hendershot is a good example. She’s a pro at saying no to social and other engagements. This hard-learned skill enabled her to keep her eyes on the prize in the lead up to the 2012 Olympics in London, where she qualified for the finals. As a cherry on top, research has even found that people who tend to say no in response to requests for their time are happier and have more energy.  By now you know that it’s essential to spend your limited time on tasks that will have the greatest impact. The tenth secret can help you do that. It says that by applying the Pareto Principle you can uncover shortcuts to success. Here’s what that means: In the 1890s, the Italian philosopher and economist Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto found that 20 percent of the pea plants in his garden produced 80 percent of his healthy peapods. He extrapolated this 80/20 rule into the general principle that now bears his name. It can be applied to a number of areas. For instance, by applying the 80/20 rule to your employees, you might decide that the majority of your salespeople should be let go since they’re your lowest performers. From there, you could focus your energy on the remaining 20 percent, who already generate 80 percent of your sales, by giving them rewards and greater levels of support. The end result will likely be an overall improvement in sales. Or you could use the 80/20 rule in your personal life by analyzing the tasks you do on a weekly basis, then identifying which of them has the greatest impact. That being said, you can also accomplish more by critically assessing the tasks in front of you. The eleventh secret is designed to help you do that. It says that leveraging your skills and delegating work will increase your productivity. Just take a 2013 experiment published in the Harvard Business Review by the professors Julian Birkinshaw and Jordan Cohen. It found that 43 percent of workers were unsatisfied with the tasks they do at work. By simply training employees to slow down and ask themselves a few questions, the study’s authors were able to identify important tasks, freeing up an extra eight hours per week. The first question they had people ask themselves was, “How important is this task to the company?” Then, “Is there anyone else who can complete it?” And finally, “How could this task be accomplished if I had half as much time?” On a normal day in the office, do you ever have difficulty focusing? Most people do and a little bit of advice here can go a long way. This is the twelfth secret, which says that grouping your work into recurring themes each week will make you more effective. A great example comes from Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square. He says that the secret to running both his companies was to have a theme for each day. For instance, on Mondays, he would focus on management; Wednesdays would be dedicated to marketing; and Sunday would be reserved for reflection, feedback and strategy for the next week. Or take the entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan. He recommends theming each week based on three types of days to stay focused and remain invigorated. The first type is called a focus day, which is for vital activities like revenue-growing tasks. The second type is called a buffer day, which is for catching up on emails, returning calls, having meetings, delegating tasks and doing paperwork. And finally, a free day is one on which no work should be done. This last type is reserved for vacation, family time and charity work. Another simple way to boost your efficiency has to do with tackling small tasks. This is the thirteenth secret, which says that you should immediately take action on tasks that’ll take fewer than five minutes to accomplish and avoid returning to the same task over and over. Just consider the straight-A student Nihar Suthar. He completes five-minute assignments right away, avoiding a long list of tiny tasks. Or take the author. His sister Debbie recently emailed him, but instead of writing her back, he called her to make sure they could talk. By scheduling a call in his calendar and thereby saving the mental energy he would otherwise spend trying to remember to get back to her, he decided to handle this task immediately. If he had instead put it on a to-do list or left it in his inbox, he probably would have never remembered to address it. Imagine waking up at six in the morning, working out for 45 minutes and then whipping together a delicious, high-protein breakfast. It might sound difficult but the fourteenth secret shows why it’s essential. It says that dedicating the first hour of each day to a morning routine will enhance your health – mind, body and soul. In fact, starting the day with a workout is a great way to get your creative juices flowing. Just consider the New York Times best-selling author Dan Miller, who starts off each day by meditating for half an hour, then working out for 45 minutes while listening to audio programs. He avoids checking the news or looking at his phone during this time, devoting his first hour to positive and inspirational experiences. He even claims that his most creative ideas come to him during this daily “me time.” From there, you can further increase your energy and well-being by eating a healthy breakfast and drinking lots of water. This is huge for the best-selling author and podcast host Shawn Stevenson. He considers energy to be everything, and so he starts off each day with what he calls an inner bath. He simply drinks 30 ounces of purified water to jumpstart his metabolism by flushing out waste. In fact, according to the fifteenth secret, energy is paramount. The secret is that productivity isn’t about time, but about maintaining focus and energy. That’s why Francesco Cirillo came up with the Pomodoro Technique – a method designed to reduce distractions and boost productivity. His approach involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, devoting your full attention to a single task for the full 25 minutes and then taking a five-minute break before repeating the cycle. Author Monica Leonelle found ample success with the Pomodoro Technique after realizing that she didn’t have a single spare hour in the day. By using the Pomodoro Technique, she recharged during her breaks, maintaining steady energy throughout the day and, with the help of other techniques, went from writing 600 words per hour to 3,500! The key message in this book: Highly successful people consider time to be their most valuable asset. By applying their most effective life hacks – which do everything from prioritizing tasks to boosting your energy and keeping you focused – you too can make the most of your time.  Actionable advice: Design a morning routine! When forming your morning routine, use the LIFE S.A.V.E.R.S system developed by the success coach Hal Elrod. This acronym will help you include the most important things. S stands for Silence to foster gratitude and meditation A is for Affirmations of goals and priorities V is for Visualizations of your ideal life E is for Exercise R is for Reading And the final S is for Scribing in your journal.

Creativity and business, however, doesn’t make for a very familiar combination. But if you want to come up with a great idea for a new business, you need to be creative; if you want to turn your idea into a great product, you need to be creative; and if you want to successfully sell a product, you ought to be creative, too. These blinks will provide you a with a number of simple but ingenious tricks to foster your creative spirit. They bring together the most important aspects of a 21-day program the author developed to think up big ideas. You will learn how to easily come up with a variety of ideas for new businesses, as well as how to reinvent old ones. You’ll also learn how many new ideas Thomas Edison had per day; why a cooked chicken in the fridge can make for a great business idea; and how to come up with completely new ideas in just 30 seconds. Blank pages are daunting. They can make accomplished novelists, brilliant illustrators and successful business leaders nervous as they embark on new projects. Luckily, there’s one method that can help us conquer that blank page: brainstorming. In fact, some of the world’s greatest scientific geniuses relied on brainstorming to kick-start their biggest ideas; this includes Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light bulb. An entry in one of his notebooks, dated January 3rd, 1888, contains a list of over 100 ideas that Edison scribbled down in hopes of finding the one invention he wanted to create. He came up with ideas for a snow compressor, artificial silk, synthetic ivory, an electric piano and many more. Brainstorming has been the go-to trick for creatives throughout history because it helps shut out internal criticism. When we brainstorm, we reconnect with our playful, imaginative selves. This, in turn, allows us to see new possibilities that we’d normally dismiss. On top of this, brainstorming helps us uncover our passions. If you brainstorm long enough, you’ll see patterns emerge that connect a handful of your ideas to deeper themes. This allows us to map out the areas that we’re passionate about, which we can then focus on and develop. We may even realize that we’re passionate about something outside of our profession or skill set. This can be confusing for some, who worry that they can’t delve into a particular field without sufficient technical knowledge. However, research into top-performing start-ups has shown that you don’t need to be a specialist in a given sector to come up with original solutions to problems. On the contrary, you may be in an even better position to kick-start innovation. When people know a lot about one specific industry, it may mean that they are too set in their ways to see new opportunities. If you’re ready to try brainstorming, where do you start? Just grab a piece of paper and write down 30 to 50 ideas. The teenage Mark Zuckerberg had a problem: no girls wanted to date him! Facebook turned out to be his attempt at a solution, and while it may or may not have made him dateable, it certainly made him wealthy. Facebook, therefore, like most inventions, began as a solution to a problem. To create your own solutions, you need to identify problems that are worth solving. Of course, the world seems to be full of problems! So how do you find the right one? Start by sniffing out everyday problems that bother you. Getting a dry mouth at night, feeling guilty after eating a sugary dessert, dragging luggage through a huge airport – these problems are just a few of the author’s examples to get you started. You can also learn to identify problems by continually questioning them. Make the question “what is the problem?” your mantra, and return to it throughout your day. This will help you pay close attention to things that are less than satisfactory in your life. With these in mind, you can start looking for solutions. Although the problems we encounter in everyday life are rather mundane, solving them isn’t. Developing new solutions can present a huge technical challenge. When done right, they can also bring significant financial rewards and benefit many people around the globe. The problem of having a dry mouth at night was actually solved by Biotene and Therabreath; they created oral rinses that increase salivation to prevent the mouth from drying out. A comparable problem was also solved by a Bruce Johnson from Minnesota – he had trouble breathing at night, and set out to solve this. By creating the Breathe Right nasal strips, he helped a lot of other people solve this problem too, creating a multi-million-dollar business in the process. Which of the following do you consider a better idea: one that’s entirely original? Or one that just borrows bits and pieces of other people's ideas? Beware – the latter type actually has the potential to be groundbreaking as well! Think about it: thousands of entrepreneurs have used the invention of the smartphone as the home for their inventions – apps! You needn’t feel shy about making the most of other people’s great ideas and hard work. For example, a company called Aerodesigns has recently created a way for people to inhale vitamins, dietary supplements and caffeine through their nose and into their bloodstream. Why not use this instant pick-me-up innovation to develop a new deep breathing diet? By combining the benefits of antioxidant yogic breathing with the new technology of inhalable supplements, you could help a lot of people be healthier and happier! The truth is that existing technology can help you dream up new ideas for services. Take a technology that impresses you, consider its strengths and then think about how you could apply them in new ways. For example, remote-controlled drones, as innovations largely used for warfare, have also been made useful in entirely different circumstances. The strength of drones lies in their ability to get from point A to point B without traffic or other obstacles stopping them; this could be just the thing for emergency situations. Drones could deliver medical kits to those who need them urgently, or they could drop life vests to swimmers struggling to stay afloat. There are countless possibilities! Before the invention of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell’s idea to send voices through a wire would have seemed like childish nonsense. However, children have also been proven to have more creative minds than adults. If we want to bring great ideas into the world, we need to help our inner child team up with our rational, adult selves. Back in 1968, social scientist George Land gave a NASA creativity test to 1,600 children and got them to repeat it every five years. The results were, to put it bluntly, a bit depressing. As five-years-olds, nearly 100 percent of the children showed creativity at the highest levels, yet just five years later only 30 percent of the children displayed the same level of creativity. The same study showed that only 12 percent of 15-year-olds displayed a high level of creativity – a similar percentage of creativity most adults display. So how do we reconnect with the creative brains we had at age five? By making wishes. What do you wish you could do? As children, we’d have answered things like “I wish I could fly!” or “I wish I could teleport to another world!” From the airplane to virtual reality, many childhood wishes have been transformed into some of the most thrilling inventions. Of course, lots of technical and rational thinking on a very high level went into both the airplane and virtual reality; great ideas come to life when our creative and rational sides are able to work together. Once you’ve discovered your childlike wishes, bring back your adult mind to work out ways to make those wishes real. Even if your ideas seem absurd, keep thinking! The solution might be right under your nose. Think of the NeverWet spray paint developed by RustOleum. If you wished you could make things invisible as a kid, from the mess in your room to the secret writing in your diary, this invention will strike a chord with you! It allows us to spray hidden messages on sidewalks and houses that reveal themselves when it rains. Can you think up a new invention in under 30 seconds? You might consider it impossible, but a simple technique might prove otherwise! Enter, the “and” technique. In 2015, the author joined the librarians of the Chicago Public Library to help them work on their creativity. He challenged them to come up with a brand new idea in just 30 seconds; he also taught them the “and” technique to help them along the way. The result? Every librarian came up with something original. The “and” technique simply entails combining two words that seemingly have nothing to do with each other. The librarians were given two sets of cards with either nouns or adjectives on them. They were then told to choose two cards and develop a new invention based on the combination of words. This led to moments of genius like the “illuminated sock,” an idea for socks that glow in the dark so you can find them easily in the early morning, or simply socks that look striking on a Saturday night out! How might you apply the “and” technique if you already have an idea of the industry in which you want to start a business? Say you’re interested in creating a floristry business; combining the words “fish” and “film” probably won’t get you far. What you can do is customize the technique to make one of the words a fixed noun. In this case, it could be “flowers,” which you’d then combine with 20 or more nouns or adjectives. You might end up with the combination of “flowers” and “celebrities,” for instance. Where might that lead you? Well, why not create a celebrity endorsement for a signature bouquet? That’s rather like what Kay Jewelers did when they asked actress Jane Seymour to design a pendant for them. You could invite a celebrity to design a beautiful bouquet in collaboration with you, which you could both proudly show off to boost your brand. How productive do you feel after sitting and surfing the web for a few hours? Chances are you don’t feel productive at all! Well, it’s time to rethink that assumption; the internet is a fascinating, dynamic source of inspiration that might just get those creative cogs turning. Today, blogs and websites are updated constantly. This makes the internet a reliable source of information about what’s going on right now, from fashion trends to current affairs. While some companies request you pay for their trend reports in certain industries, a lot of great information is yours for free online. For instance, Cassandra Daily is a company specializing in trend analysis, with a free newsletter that provides regular updates in leading innovation fields. JWT, a worldwide advertising firm, offers users a free annual report on the 100 things to look out for in the coming year. Meanwhile, TrendHunter.com creates similar updates on a monthly basis, listing up to 50 groundbreaking products that are new on the market. Once you’ve got topical trends at your fingertips, how can you put them to good use? Start by asking the following six simple questions: who, what, when, where, why and how? Let’s illustrate this by looking at the trend toward mindfulness training in classrooms. Who else might need mindfulness training? Doctors working long hours in hospitals perhaps? What kind of mindfulness has potential? Exercises designed to lower blood pressure seem promising. When, where and why do you want to teach mindfulness? Perhaps to a bride and groom at their wedding ceremony, to help them get their marriage off to a compassionate start. Finally, ask how mindfulness could become a viable business, taking into account funding, scientific evidence and popular appeal. These questions should sketch out an outline of how you could grow a new business. Do you know Bounty Paper Towels’ famous slogan? “Bounty – the quicker picker upper.” Even if you’re not familiar with it, you can’t deny that it’s catchy! Slogans like these are also a good litmus test for uncovering what’s special about your product, which is why the author recommends trying a simple method called billboarding. Billboarding helps you identify what makes your product stand out using three steps. First, be clear about what your idea is and what problem it solves for customers in their everyday lives. And don’t forget to create a catchy name for your product! Second, list all your product’s benefits or plus points. What are all the things it can do for your customers? And third, pick out the strongest plus point your product has to offer; this will be the subject of a catchy phrase that you create to sell this strength to customers. At the end of this process, you’ll have a catchy name as well as a memorable slogan that captures exactly what it is about your product that makes it so special. Let’s see how billboarding might apply to a new product idea. Take the cardboard stroller for children, for instance. This product has a whole range of plus points: it’s lighter and easier to move and transport than a regular stroller but is still secure enough for you to trust that your baby is safe inside. It’s also less likely to cause injury if it falls over, it’s cheaper and so on! On top of these pragmatic benefits, the cardboard baby stroller also has a few creative strengths. Parents and their kids can draw on the cardboard, keeping kids entertained and engaged during trips to the grocery store. Your billboard headline could be: The Playhouse Stroller: Go Shopping and Your Kids Will Have Fun Too! The key message in this book: Blank pages don’t have to be daunting. With a few helpful strategies up your sleeve, from brainstorming to the “and” technique to billboarding, you’ll soon learn to get in touch with your playful side and fill up that page with dozens of ideas for a brand new business.

You come up with a name, and maybe a logo, and you create a website. Most potential customers will find out about you by clicking on your website; many will buy what you sell online, too. Clearly your website is very important. So you need to optimize it, to use the best possible format for people to use. And how do you do this? Through A/B testing. These blinks will show you how using this method can significantly increase the number of people clicking on your site. In these blinks you’ll discover how A/B testing helped Obama get elected; why when it comes to websites, less is more; and why even a failed experiment is a good one. Thanks to the internet, companies have unprecedented opportunities to find new customers. All you need is a website, and then anyone can see – and buy! – whatever you’re selling. But although it sounds easy, creating a site that entices people to spend is difficult. Luckily, there’s a surefire way to figure out what works: an A/B test. The principle behind A/B testing is simple: By showing different versions of your site to randomly selected test groups over a short period of time, you generate data on which option is the most effective. This data offers organizations huge opportunities to increase visitor engagement. For instance, the 2008 Obama campaign website allowed users to leave their email addresses if they wanted to sign up for a newsletter or contribute to the campaign. The page displayed a photograph of the candidate in an ocean of supporters waving “Obama 2008” flags next to a field for entering email addresses, along with a “sign up” button. The Obama team wondered whether this was the best possible image and button combination. After a series of A/B tests using different images and texts, they found a winner: Visitors were 40.6 percent more likely to share their email address when the website showed a photo of Obama surrounded by his family, next to a button that said “Learn more.” For the Obama campaign, this change resulted in 2.8 million more email subscribers and an additional $57 million in donations. As you can see, A/B testing offers huge advantages. And it’s worth noting that although this testing technology used to be complicated and expensive, that’s no longer the case. In recent years, A/B testing has become an established method to improve web pages. And to facilitate this, web optimization platforms, such as Optimizely, have made it easy for anyone to implement A/B testing. Are you ready to start optimizing your website? Well, GREAT. But before you begin, you need to consider exactly what you want to test. Because without a definition of success and a hypothesis, the test won’t tell you much. So start by clearly defining quantifiable success metrics – that is, metrics which measure whatever data is most relevant to you – in order to evaluate the testing later. For instance, let’s say you’re an online magazine. Well, it wouldn’t be very good strategy to implement A/B testing that simply measured clicks, because clicks don’t indicate what readers think about the content. Instead, shares, comments or repeat visits might say more about what kind of content resonates with your readers. On the other hand, if you’re an ecommerce company, success metrics might be completed purchases, products added to cart, or product pageviews. Ultimately, success metrics will vary according to your site. But as we mentioned earlier, success metrics aren’t the only thing to think about: You should also come up with a clear hypothesis. To better explain this principle, let’s start with an example: The Clinton Bush Haiti Fund was established during the 2010 Haiti earthquake. And to optimize the text-only donation page, the organization brought in Optimizely. They hypothesized that adding a picture above the donation information field would increase contributions, but surprisingly the opposite happened. So they formed a new hypothesis: Maybe, they speculated, the picture deterred contributions because visitors had to scroll further to find the donation field, making the process a little more time consuming. Testing the theory, they placed the image beside the field instead – and this was a success! The optimized layout led to over one million dollars in additional aid. Imagine if they had just tried things at random instead of using testing based on hypotheses – they might never have found this solution. Although A/B testing is great for tweaking and refining your online presence, it can also lead you to make major, widespread changes in how you structure your site. This was what Disney experienced when it performed an A/B testing experiment on the homepage of one of their TV networks, ABC Family. When they examined their search logs, the Disney team noticed that a lot of visitors were searching for specific shows. So instead of making minor tweaks, they decided to create a completely different homepage structure which listed all the shows, making them easier to find. Disney’s goal was to increase the number of clicks on the experiment page by ten to 20 percent – which they easily surpassed. Because in fact, as a result of the A/B tests, engagement went up by 600 percent. The apparel manufacturer Chrome also used A/B testing to radically rethink their site. The company had three boxes of promotional content on their homepage, and they assumed that A/B testing would show that the left one did best because visitors saw it first. But instead, they learned that the central box always outperformed the others, regardless of content. So eventually, this insight led to a completely different website design. Along those lines, it’s important to note that when you’re undergoing a major site redesign, A/B testing can be an important element during – and not just after – the process. In fact, Netflix used A/B testing in this way when the company redesigned its user interface in 2011. The original interface suggested just four titles, each with a star rating and a play button underneath. But then the video service tested another variation, which showed near-endless rows of thumbnails with pictures and titles users could scroll through. This variation was hugely effective: It not only improved retention, it also increased engagement! Imagine visiting a website and being immediately bombarded with images, pop-ups and requests to sign up. No doubt you would leave as soon as possible and never return. This is something most of us intuitively grasp: When it comes to site design, less really is more. In fact, A/B testing has shown that removing any fields that aren’t absolutely crucial will have a huge impact on engagement. For instance, returning to Optimizely’s work on the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund’s donation page, the optimization firm noticed that there were fields for users to input “Phone number” and “Title.” However, since the charity had no use for this information, Optimizely set up an A/B test for a version without these fields. The result were impressive: This small change led to an 11 percent increase in donated dollars per pageview. So what can you do to leverage these findings and decrease clutter on your own site? Well, you can make use of hide functions and also break up longer forms onto multiple pages. By using a hide function (a feature that displays information only when you ask for it) for the promotion code and shopping options forms in their checkout dialogue, retailer Cost Plus World Market increased the revenue per visitor by 15.6 percent. Of course, there are occasions when you can’t declutter or remove fields. In those cases, you should break a longer form into more pages. This approach worked for Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. The donation page simply couldn’t be pared down any more – every element was vital. But then the campaign team had an idea: In order to make the form appear shorter, they broke it down into two separate pages – one with the amount donated, the other with personal details. Together with other similar alterations, this tiny change amounted to an extra $190 million in donations. An image says more than a thousand words, as the saying goes. And although there’s a lot of truth to that, A/B testing shows us that if you really want to engage people, you need to find the right words. And one way language can help make your website more effective is by making the meaning of clicks clearer to the end user. So for instance, with the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund donation page, instead of using the standard “Submit” button on the donation form, the A/B testers experimented with a variation that said “Support Haiti.” Their hypothesis was that this language would make the meaning of the donation clear. And they were right – it worked! The trial version made a huge difference, one that resulted in several extra dollars donated per page view. There’s another way to use language more effectively, especially if you want your website visitors to take action: use verbs and not nouns whenever possible. This principle has been borne out by A/B testing, which has shown time and time again that if you want someone to do something, you need to tell them to do it. And this requires using the call-to-action imperative of a verb rather than the more descriptive function of a noun. For example, LiveChat, a company that sells software which allows businesses to converse with visitors in real time, was hosting a free trial campaign to attract new clients. To improve the campaign’s impact, visual designer Lucy Frank wanted to test whether using a verb would increase customer action, so she set up an A/B test that pitted “Free Trial” against “Try It Free.” Changing just two words and using a verb improved the campaign click-through rate by 14.6 percent. Scientists often say that there’s nothing more exciting than discovering something that doesn’t work, because you can learn so much from failure. Well, exactly the same applies to A/B testing: Failure can be a blessing. This principle applies to every sort of failure, including the small ones. Because even dead ends that seem insignificant now can be useful later on. For example, when e-commerce company Chrome used images to promote its urban biking products, it wondered whether using videos instead would improve conversion rates. But after a three-month trial period, A/B testing revealed that using a video instead of an image had no significant impact. Although you could say that this test “went nowhere,” it was actually quite enlightening. Because now, if Chrome ever wants to implement video for future products, they can safely assume that it won’t hurt conversion rates. There’s another way failed A/B tests can help you, and that’s by giving you important information about your users. In fact, this was gaming website IGN’s experience. In order to drive more traffic to the dedicated video site (which brought in a substantial part of their ad revenue), IGN tested the effect of moving the “Videos” link in the navigation bar from the far right to the far left. As it turned out, the move had a disastrous effect: Video link clicks decreased by an astonishing 92.3 percent. But there was a silver lining! IGN quickly realized that this had occurred because most of the site’s users were return visitors, who weren’t able to find the link once it was moved. So although this test didn’t immediately improve traffic, it did teach IGN a valuable lesson about how many of its visitors were returning users, and not new ones. Just as political movements need activists and lobbyists to bring about change, A/B testing needs evangelists. And if you want to implement this practice within your own organization, you might need to become a spokesperson for it. And one of the best ways to convince other people of the impact of data-driven approaches is to communicate the results of simple tests that display the immense value of A/B testing. Simply presenting images of variations and test results on a regular basis will convince stakeholders that data-driven testing works, thus bringing enormous benefits. For example, Scott Zakrajsek, the global web analytics manager at Adidas, often uses safe bets – that is, A/B tests that are likely to quickly result in a clear win – to help others understand how A/B testing works. Doing this on a regular basis and emphasizing the value of continuous improvement via A/B testing can lead to it become part of company culture. This was Lizzy Allen’s experience. When Allen first joined IGN as an analyst in 2010, she was surprised that no one at the company had ever heard of A/B testing. She dedicated a month to introducing the concept to the company, and in order to make sure that her colleagues were engaged, she created the A/B Master Challenge. IGN’s employees were asked to vote on likely outcomes of A/B tests, and to predict which variations would prove to be the most effective. Although pretty much everyone failed at making accurate predictions, the company developed a shared sense of humility. Thus people realized that there was a lot they could learn from data-driven approaches, which led to A/B testing becoming an established part of company policy. The key message in this book: If you want to optimize your website and engage your visitors, try A/B testing. But in order to adopt this data-driven approach, you need a clear hypothesis and a definition of success. And ultimately, doing this will engage your users, your employees, and make your website more effective.  Actionable advice: Use a testing platform. If you don’t have your own A/B technology, using a testing platform like Optimizely will allow you to conduct tests simply and easily without hiring a whole department of data analysts. Suggested further reading: Contagious by Jonah Berger Contagious examines what makes a product, idea or behavior more likely to be shared among many people. The book explores the question of whether contagious things are accidents or the results of good marketing, or whether contagiousness is an inherent feature of a product, idea or behavior. It argues that, far from being merely a matter of luck, the majority of very popular products and ideas are the result of a combination of savvy planning and execution. Got feedback?

Or thought, “If only there was an English-Accounting dictionary, maybe more of us would have an idea about what’s going on in our financial statements?” You’re not alone. These blinks tackle the most basic accounting fundamentals. Why do you have to know them? Because accounting is arguably the most important source of information in business. It records, analyzes, plans and, in the end, controls your business transactions. After all, if you know how to decipher the basics of accounting, you’ll know the real story of your business – how healthy it is and where you could be spending or saving more money to help it grow. In these blinks, you’ll find out what a lemonade stand's balance sheet looks like; how to compare Google’s profits with your own; and how to calculate equity in your home. Accounting can seem impenetrable and mysterious. But it’s no dark art. In fact, a balance sheet follows a clear logical order. You just need to know how to decipher it. Let’s start with the fundamentals: An accounting equation measures financial position using assets, liabilities and owner’s equity. Here’s a refresher on what those terms stand for: Assets: Everything a company owns, such as properties, inventory and cash. Liabilities: All the company’s debts, such as loans. Owner’s Equity (also called Shareholder’s Equity): The difference between the two, meaning the company’s ownership of assets, after paying off liabilities. The accounting equation states that, no matter what, the following will be valid: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity. You can also write the equation like this: Assets - Liabilities = Owner’s Equity. This equation is applicable for any kind of company, big or small. Imagine you run a lemonade stand. Your assets are: lemonade, the stand, cups and uniforms – worth $100 in total. You took out $60 worth of loans from your sister and your mom – those are your liabilities. So here’s how we would figure out the Owner’s Equity: Assets ($100) - Liabilities ($60) = Owner’s Equity ($40). You could use the same equation to measure your financial position when buying a home. If you want to purchase a property for $300,000, you probably wouldn’t pay it all up front. You might take a mortgage for $230,000. That means your home equity would be calculated as: $300,000 assets - $230,000 liabilities = $70,000 equity. And a few years later, once you’ve paid off $30,000 of the mortgage, your home equity would be: $300,000 assets - $200,000 liabilities = $100,000 equity. One thing to remember about assets and liabilities is that your asset might be someone else’s liability, and vice versa. For instance, in the scenario above, the mortgage is your liability. But it’s the bank’s asset. As we’ve just learned, the accounting equation is fundamental. But it serves a more important role as well. It forms the basis for your balance sheet. Your balance sheet is your core financial statement. Building on the accounting equation, it uses assets, liabilities and owner’s equity to show your firm’s financial position at any given point in time. Balance sheet assets include cash and cash equivalents, inventory, accounts receivable and property, plants and equipment. So, the balance sheet for our lemonade stand would include the following in the assets column: Money in our checking/savings accounts; soon-to-be mature investments, like our investment in the lemon farm; the lemonade itself; Mr. Johnson’s payment for catering lemonade for his party last week; the lemonade stand; and your pitcher and strainer. Liabilities refer to accounts payable and notes payable. Ours would be: The amount we owe the grocer for buying us one hundred lemons and also the loan we took from our sister. And finally, common stock and retained earnings would be listed as owner’s equity. That’s the $15 we saved to open the stand and also the sum of all our income that hasn’t been distributed to others as dividends. So our balance sheet would look like this: Assets:  Cash and cash equivalents ($15) Inventory ($30) Accounts receivable ($5) Property, Plant and Equipment ($50) Total = $100 Liabilities: Accounts payable ($20) Notes payable ($40) Total = $60 Owner's Equity: Common Stock ($15) Retained earnings ($25) Total = $40 Remember, the accounting equation holds that Liabilities plus Owner's Equity must always equal Assets. And sure enough, here: $60 liabilities + $40 owner’s equity = $100 assets. Simple, right? We’ve mastered accounting equations and balance sheets. Next up: the income statement. Unlike a balance sheet, which shows financial accounts at any given moment, the income statement tracks your company’s financial performance over a specified period of time – the course of a year, for instance.   This document is organized in a straightforward way: you take what you’ve earned (revenue) and subtract what you’ve spent (expenses). Now you see why it’s often called a profit and loss (P&L) statement. So, to break it down: The top of your income statement shows your revenue, which basically means your sales. All costs associated with producing the goods sold should be recorded here as Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS). When you deduct the CoGS from your revenue, you get your gross profit. Okay, let’s see how this works in practice: Say you start selling T-shirts. You manufacture 100 T-shirts for $12 each at the beginning of the month, which costs $1,200. By the end of the month, you’ve sold all the T-shirts for $25 each. That adds ups to $2,500 – your revenue. Once the CoGS ($1,200) is deducted from your revenue, the remaining $1,300 would be your gross profit. Now we have to get your expenses in order. Expenses include rent, salaries and wages, marketing and insurance. To operate your T-shirt business, you rent a small space to make the shirts. You also need to pay a few employees and maybe buy some Facebook ads to spread the word. And don’t forget about insurance! Add up these costs to get your total expense – let’s say it comes out to $1,000. As the final step, subtract the expenses ($1,000) from the gross profit in the revenue column ($1,300). That’s how you get the net income, which in our case is $300. Congrats! You’re profitable. If the net income had worked out to be a negative number, that would mean your business was losing money. You’ve surely heard this term before: The cash flow statement. But what is it? Well, it’s a simple accounting document that records inflows and outflows of cash. It’s important to have one of these statements in addition to an income statement, since there’s often a lapse between when an income or expense item is recorded and when the cash actually moves in or out of the firm’s accounts.  Imagine your company performs a marketing service in September, but the client doesn’t pay until the beginning of October. That sale would appear in both your P&L statement and your balance sheet as early as September, but since the actual payment won’t arrive in your bank account until October, you wouldn’t include it on September’s cash flow statement.  All cash flow statements are separated into three categories: operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.  Cash flowing in from operating activities covers transactions that would be included in the net income portion of the income statement. That includes sales to customers, payments to employees and suppliers, tax payments and so on.  The second category, investing activities, includes cash movements related to investments and capital assets (i.e. assets which last longer than one year). So this part of the cash flow statement records the cash spent on or received from the purchase or sale of financial securities like stocks and bonds, and the cash spent on or received from the purchase or sale of property, factories and equipment.  Lastly, cash flows from financing activities relate to money that comes from or goes to company owners and creditors. That includes dividends paid to shareholders and borrowings.  And then, once you’ve recorded all of the relevant cash movements pertaining to these three categories, you would combine them to calculate your firm’s net increase in cash. And that’s how you get a cash flow statement. The cash flow statement is crucial, because it gives you the best idea of when you're actually going to run out of money in your bank account, which would mean bankruptcy. Once you’ve created all of these different accounting statements, you have to analyze them. One way of doing that is to learn how to calculate ratios that speak to a company’s financial health. Liquidity ratios are the first to consider, because these indicate how easily a company can meet its short-term financial obligations. A rule of thumb: the higher the ratio, the better. One type of liquidity ratio is the current ratio, which assesses your company’s ability to pay its current liabilities using current assets, that is, its liabilities at the present moment, using assets it has at the moment. Here’s the equation: Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. Let’s say your firm has $200,000 of current assets and $200,000 of current liabilities. That means your current ratio is 1. So you can pay your liabilities; you have a relatively stable company. Next up, the quick ratio calculates a worst-case scenario by excluding inventory balances from the assets. The equation looks like this: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities. For example, if your company has an inventory account of $100,000, deduct that from current assets: ($200,000 assets - $100,000 inventory) = 100,000. The quick ratio would then be: 100,000 ÷ 200,000 = 0.5. Based on that number, we can see that your firm might struggle to pay its liabilities if sales slow down and you can’t sell your inventory. Apart from liquidity ratios, profitability ratios are also important to consider, because these demonstrate a company's profitability relative to size. Even though net income tells us something about profit, you can see how it would be meaningless to compare Google’s profits with those of a small restaurant. And that’s why it’s useful to calculate the return on assets ratio, which tells us how efficiently a company uses assets to make a profit. The formula is simple: Return on Assets = Net Income ÷ Total Assets. The return on equity ratio is similar, except instead of using total assets, it evaluates investor money and shareholder equity. The equation is: Return on Equity = Net Income ÷ Shareholder Equity. Now, you can calculate these ratios to analyze your company’s financial health. You’re almost ready to prepare your financial statement. But first, let’s review the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a set of best practices that are followed by many countries, including the United States. The single most important aspect of GAAP probably has to do with double-entry accounting and its accompanying system of debits and credits. To understand what this is, let’s review single-entry accounting. You probably already use a version of it in your private transactions: for instance, when you buy a new laptop, a -$1,000 transaction is recorded in your bank account or credit card statement to reflect the cost of the computer. But in the GAAP-approved double-entry accounting system, both an increase and a decrease are recorded in their respective accounts, in order to balance out the accounting equation. For example, if you were recording the laptop transaction using double entry, you’d write it as -$1,000 for cash and +$1,000 in assets. Another crucial difference between private financial tracking and professional accounting is that the latter uses the terms debit and credit instead of “increase” and “decrease.” Like this: an increase in assets is recorded as a debit and a decrease is recorded as a credit. Similarly, a decrease in liabilities is recorded as a credit, while an increase is recorded as a debit. One critical thing to know here is that the debited accounts are listed first, and always on the left side. Meanwhile, credit accounts appear on the next line, indented to the right. Using this formatting, you’d record that laptop purchase like this: Dr. (debit) Office Equipment $1,000              Cr. (credit) Material expenses $1,000   This means our laptop purchase adds $1,000 to the value of the office equipment account but takes $1,000 from the material expenses (or cash) account. All of these transactions need to be recorded in the General Ledger, which is a company’s most important accounting document. That’s what you use to create a financial statement. The key message in this book: Accounting might seem impenetrable and mysterious, but it follows a simple logic that’s easy to understand. As long as you understand the basic terms, you can read all kinds of financial documents to evaluate a company’s financial health.

Make a business plan that makes investors believe in you but keep it simple! Delegate, but don’t delegate too much! Maybe you’ve already struggled with balancing some or all of these seemingly unbalanceable things when starting your own business. Maybe you’re feeling pretty lost. And could use some advice? In Anything You Want, that’s exactly what author Derek Sivers will give you. Based on his own personal success story and aiming to unravel the tangled threads of starting a business, he helps you figure out the answer to the question: How do you make your business anything you want? In these blinks, you’ll discover why you don’t really need that much money to start your own business; when delegation is good – or when it’s too much; and why the author refused to work with some musicians. When the author set out in the world of business he never intended to found CD Baby, an online independent music store. In fact, he’d previously attempted several other businesses only to end up unsuccessful.  So, what made this one work? A key step was realizing that the more you improve your ideas, the higher the chances are that you’ll come up with one that’s truly successful. The point is that if you’ve been promoting your “perfect” idea for years and it’s still going nowhere, it might be time for a change. That means, if you’re not getting positive feedback – and a lot of it – it’s probably best to let go of your idea.  Instead, you should try out new options and work to improve your ideas. Because if you’re always improving, you’re bound to hit on an idea that people will love. For instance, the author was totally surprised when one of his ideas suddenly caught fire among his musician friends. His hard work had paid off, and he created something that would help both himself and others.  But coming up with the right idea is just the beginning. The next step is to come up with some simple numbers and build the principles of a business plan. This doesn’t have to be a complex, 100-page document with financial projections for the next two decades, but a simple document that lays out how your company will work and how much money it’ll take to make it happen.  The key here is to keep it logical and easy to understand. That’s because the more precisely you write, the better people will comprehend and believe in your idea. It’s really not necessary to throw around complicated figures. You just need to explain how you’ll make money and if it will cover your costs.  For instance, when the author first set up CD Baby, he only used two numbers: how much it would cost musicians to list their CD on the site and how much they would make on each sale. These simple, fixed numbers were enough to calculate his projected success.  It might be hard to settle on a specific group you want to sell products to, but defining a target market is key to meeting your customers’ needs. A good strategy is to develop many small customer groups, rather than one big one, making a flexible and secure business.  For instance, imagine crafting your product or service to meet the needs of a single client with the hopes that she’ll invest more in your company. In doing so you, base just about every decision on her thoughts and desires.  But what if she suddenly changes her mind and drops out? Your business would be in ruins because you put the needs of one customer above all the others. So, it’s better to work out which group of customers is the most important and how you can satisfy the needs of the majority.  By doing so, you’ll be more flexible and independent, and won’t suffer when one client decides to move on. As a bonus, you’ll also have access to hundreds of opinions to guide your strategy.  In any case, you can’t expect to please everyone. In fact, as your business grows, you’ll likely get lots of requests from all different types of people. When this happens, it’s key to remember that you don’t need to fulfill all of them to be successful.  Actually, quite the opposite is true. Just stick to your principles and remember the promises you’ve made to your customers. So if something feels wrong, don’t do it. It’s absolutely fine to let some people’s desires go unfulfilled.  For instance, the author constantly got requests from record label execs who wanted their newest talent on the site. But he would continually refuse them since the shop was specifically designed for musicians without a label. That’s because, when the site was born 15 years ago, these musicians had no other distribution options.  When most people talk about starting a business, their focus is on securing enough money before really investing in the idea. But having zero funding can actually be a huge advantage.  In fact, there’s nothing wrong with financial limitations. You just need to start with the bare minimum. So, if you’re hard up for cash but you’ve got a grand vision for your business’s future, don’t worry. Money isn’t what makes ideas grow. Being useful to people is, and that should be your main focus.  Just use the resources available to you, whether personal or otherwise, even if they seem insufficient. For instance, say you want to start a tutoring company but don’t have the money to make it happen right away. Don’t let go of the idea, just start teaching somebody something today. You’ll begin identifying potential customers and be spreading your knowledge.  In fact, being strapped for cash actually boosts creativity. That’s because major funders can buy you the best equipment, hire a top-tier staff and rent the fanciest office, but are those the things you need? Often, lacking the money for material luxuries helps you brainstorm creative solutions to make things easier, faster and cheaper. In the best cases, you’ll even expand your own knowledge.  For instance, plenty of people are dead broke but have a great sense of style – some are even better dressed than rich people. That’s because they only buy items that they truly love that go well with what they have, and which provide myriad styling possibilities.  So, having little or no money can make your job harder and take longer, but the long-term effect will be a business based on personal knowledge and creative problem solving.  We all know the saying “the customer is always right” and it’s clear that satisfying customers is essential to a thriving business. After all, they buy your products! Knowing this, you should base decisions on your customers’ needs. That’s because a good business isn’t just about you or making money: it’s about the people you serve. So listen to what they want and make it happen.  For instance, your business began with an idea: one that would make certain people’s lives easier. And it’s key for this vision to remain central in all your business decisions. So you should be basing decisions on customer feedback rather than your wealthiest investor or your bottom line. Because if you consider what your customers would say about the decisions you’re faced with, you’ll be putting your company on a path to profitability.  But if the unthinkable happens and your business is struggling to stay afloat, don’t let yourself get trapped in survival mode. Most companies endeavor to constantly grow and expand, but sometimes the best decision is to simply give up. After all, every business idea sets out to satisfy a need or solve a problem, but what if that need disappears or that problem is suddenly fixed? For instance, if musicians found an easy way to set up their own online store, CD Baby would lose its entire business base. In fact, the author recognized this possibility, but he didn’t worry about it. That’s because his goal was to solve a problem and, if the solution was already there without him, he could move on to solving a new problem.  So, while it can sometimes be difficult to keep in touch with your customers, it’s absolutely essential to success. Just remember: as long as you have something valuable to offer, people will be happy to hear about it. What do most self-employed people have in common? They have no clue how to delegate.  This can be a major pitfall since developing a delegation mindset is an absolute must if you want to protect your precious resources from depletion. After all, if you start a business yourself, doing everything alone, it can be difficult to suddenly start sharing responsibilities. Many entrepreneurs struggle to even find the time to hire and train employees to take over certain tasks.  But failing to delegate could lead to something much worse: burning out.  Therefore, it’s crucial to find the time to formally train your employees. For instance, you could develop a training manual. It’s easy to do. Simply keep a running list of problems you encounter while starting and running your business along with ways to solve them. As time goes on, employees will learn to solve issues on their own and you’ll be free to focus on strategic tasks or other interests.  So, failing to delegate is dangerous but over-delegating can be a disaster. To stay safe, be sure your delegation is based on trust and control. Here’s how: First of all, make sure to cultivate a trusting relationship with your employees. Let them know you’re sharing responsibilities with them because you have faith in them. Second, put in place some simple control mechanisms. You shouldn’t surveil your staff, but you should develop some rules and procedures everyone abides by.  For instance, the author doled out a lot of tasks, giving his employees a great deal of freedom to choose their work style. But then he got a call from his accountant, saying that a profit-sharing plan was being put in place based on a decision made by a staff person. This particular employee had decided that all the company’s profits should be divided among the staff without the author even knowing about it, at which point the author realized he had delegated too much.  Plenty of people have dreams of being a CEO at some point in their careers while others envision it being a management nightmare. How do you feel about it? If you’re in the group that shudders at the thought of being in a conventional CEO management position, but still want to start a business, don’t do it. There are going to be tasks that you simply don’t want to do – and you shouldn’t feel the pressure to fill a position that will make you unhappy.  For instance, say you opened a restaurant because you love to be in the kitchen. But, as the restaurant grew, you found yourself with less and less time to actually cook. Now your job consists of logistics, management and running a company – a reality you never bargained for.  The same holds true for your employees. That is, they also need to take pleasure in what they do. To make this a reality, you shouldn’t ask your employees what they’re good at, but what they enjoy. And remember: you don’t need to have conventional positions like Head of Finance and Head of Marketing. You can simply let your employees choose positions and titles based on their passions.  By doing so, you’ll find that there are people excited to tackle even the most annoying tasks! And, finally, keep in mind that traditional business strategies might not work for your way of doing things. So, whatever consultants or so-called “experts” might tell you, running a business is a creative task that calls for creative strategies.  For example, if your only goal is to cover costs and you aren’t interested in growing, that’s totally fine. If you just want to run a small tech startup without any dreams of being the next Steve Jobs or being bought out by Apple, that’s your decision. Even things that seem absolutely normal, such as constantly posting to social media, are still decisions you should make for yourself, without fear of judgement.  The key message in this book: Starting a successful business is just a matter of finding a great idea, harnessing the will to satisfy your customers and creatively solving your problems. So, while it might not be the norm, forget about huge sums of venture capital and consultants; just set your mind to making your business dream become a reality.  Actionable advice: Make business choices that work for you.  The way you make decisions in business is personal. So, when faced with questions about your company’s future, make sure you answer them in the way that works best for you. For instance, while it might be the norm to start at 9 a.m., you might find that a workday that starts later is better for you and your employees.

Few nations better encapsulate that transition than India, a country of 1.3 billion people with an economy that’s been growing at a rate of over five percent annually for over a decade now. Much of this growth has come from a new generation of entrepreneurs, young go-getters who are redefining the way business in India is done. But facts and figures only tell half the story. If you really want to experience what this golden age of entrepreneurship feels like on the ground, you have to get up close and personal with the men and women reshaping the subcontinent. That’s just what Rashmi Bansal does in these blinks. Chock-full of inspiring insights and real-life tales of grit and determination, these portraits of six up-and-coming entrepreneurs whisk readers from Bombay to Bangalore and reveal how the new generation is redefining the business landscape in today’s India. You’ll also discover: how a failed beverage venture ended up launching a top youth brand to success; why businesses that solve problems close to home go on to thrive; and how a software start-up attracted the attention of Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Back in the early 2000s, “entrepreneurship” wasn’t a particularly well-known concept in India. One university wanted to change that. The National Institute of Technology Karnataka – NITK for short – was one of the few places you could find an entrepreneurship cell in the country. Its so-called Eforea “E-cell” was designed as a launching pad for talented youngsters working on the next big thing. Shashank ND, an NITK student from Bangalore, joined Eforea in his second year. Up to that point he’d been a pretty average student who’d only really distinguished himself in extracurricular campus activities. The events organized by the e-cell, however, changed the course of his life. Listening to top business gurus like rediff.com founder Ajit Balakrishnan talk about their experiences helped Shashank discover his true vocation: entrepreneurship. He didn’t have to look far for a partner, either – his future collaborator Abhinav Lal was also an Eforea member. The two would-be world-changers started small. Their idea? To create software for doctors. After borrowing 10,000 rupees – roughly USD $145 – from Shashank’s mother, they registered their company under the name Practo Technologies. Things were still fairly vague, but that didn’t deter Shashank and Abhinav. The duo organized a big presentation and invited 25 local doctors. But the event was a disaster. Shashank felt uncomfortable in his ill-fitting suit, and their business pitch largely fell on deaf ears. One medical practitioner in the room – Mohammed Ali – wasn’t quite so quick to dismiss what he’d heard. He told the two budding entrepreneurs to persevere, and even gave them an idea to work on. Ali had noticed that his patients often needed to be reminded of their regular checkups. Wouldn’t it be simpler, he wondered, if those reminders could be automated? Shashank and Abhinav got to work designing the software to do just that. Their prototype was simple, but Ali was delighted with the automated SMS reminders it sent out. Encouraged by this success, the NTIK graduates committed their futures to Practo. In 2010, their hard work paid off. Sequoia Capital, an American venture capital firm that had backed Apple and Google in the tech giants’ early days, decided to invest in the medical start-up. It was exactly the boost Practo needed. By 2015, the firm was worth almost three million US dollars, and its services were being used by 10,000 doctors across India. Sourabh Bansal’s story starts in a student dorm or, as it’s called in India, a hostel. It was one of those wide-ranging, late-night discussions that take place among undergraduates the world over. What, they asked each other, would they do with their lives? Sourabh leaped to his feet, grabbed a pencil and scribbled a number on the wall: 50 billion rupees. That, he said, was how much his company would be worth one day. How was he going to make all that cash? That’s where serendipity played its part. Sourabh’s father owned a factory manufacturing quicklime, a compound used by the building industry to make concrete blocks. Sourabh had occasionally helped out in the plant for years. One day, he noticed an unusual order: a customer had purchased thousands of tons of lime to make “autoclaved aerated concrete,” or AAC blocks. When he looked into the matter, Sourabh discovered that these were ten times larger than standard bricks and a whopping 70 percent lighter. The only issue with this wonder material was that it was prohibitively expensive. That was Sourabh’s eureka moment. Whoever figured out how to lower the cost of AAC blocks would practically conquer an entire market overnight! The wheels were in motion, and Sourabh began experimenting with cheaper production techniques. All he needed was someone to help him get his idea off the ground. In Surat, Sourabh’s hometown in western India, investors usually take the form of “uncles” – wealthy family acquaintances willing to take a gamble on new businesses. The uncle who invested in Sourabh’s company was called Rajesh Poddar. In return for a 70 percent equity stake, Poddar invested 100 million rupees in what became Magicrete Building Solutions. It was a sound decision. Sourabh’s experiments were successful: using a coal-fired boiler instead of the diesel boilers other firms relied on, he’d reduced his manufacturing costs by over 60 percent. By 2009, Magicrete’s first AAC blocks were rolling off the production line. It didn’t take the construction industry long to cotton on, and orders were soon flying in. It wasn’t all plain sailing from there, but Magicrete continued to expand at a steady clip. Six years later, it was bringing in 1.5 billion rupees a year and was well on its way to that 50 billion goal! The Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resources Development is known as the best place to study HR in India. It was that reputation that brought Prakash Mundhra to the university, but he soon decided he’d had enough and devoted himself to entrepreneurship instead. Increasingly fascinated by the business world, Prakash began working on his own ideas. That’s when he came across Business Baazigar, a TV show on which contestants submit their business plans and winners receive the funding they need to turn their dreams into reality. The format was perfect for an idea Prakash had been developing for a school competition: kits containing full sets of the items used in puja or “worship” on special occasions like the Hindu festival of Diwali. Around 200,000 business plans were submitted to Business Baazigar, but Prakash managed to squeeze into the top twenty. He was given 50,000 rupees to create a prototype and invited to appear on the actual show when filming started in February 2005. Although he was eventually eliminated after joining the final round of ten contestants, the experience played a vital role in Prakash’s career. Being challenged to produce a sample product gave him a much better understanding of the raw materials he’d need, the size of the market and the competition he’d face. Even more importantly, it gave him the confidence to continue refining his business idea. Prakash returned to school, but his heart wasn’t in it – what he really wanted to do was continue developing his business. He began applying to business plan contests at schools across India, winning five out of the six he entered. After graduating, he was finally ready to set up his own company. Named Sacred Moments, it initially specialized in Diwali “puja kits,” which sold like hotcakes. Prakash then began expanding his product line to cater to a wider range of festivities and occasions. Today, Sacred Moments has seven full-time employees and many more seasonal workers. The hours might be long, but that doesn’t bother Prakash one bit – he loves his work and believes he’s privileged to be able to work for himself and on his own ideas. Like many of the entrepreneurs we’ve met so far, Prabhkiran Singh wasn’t really sure what he wanted to do with his life when he went to university. He worked hard at the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, but he knew the subject he was studying – civil engineering – wasn’t his true calling. What Prabhkiran was sure about was that he wanted to work for himself, but he couldn’t settle on a business idea. That changed in 2009 after he happened to try a flavored lassi, an Indian drink traditionally made with yoghurt, water, salt and spices. The strawberry-flavored lassi Prabhkiran tried was a different beverage altogether. Inspired by the idea of creating a more modern style of lassi, he and his best friend pooled their savings to buy a mixer, a blender and some basic kitchen tools. They eventually rented a small space outside a cake shop for the equivalent of about USD $86. In February 2010, Khadke Glassi opened its doors. Thanks to Facebook advertising and word of mouth, news of the venture spread. Soon enough, thirsty customers were lining up to try the company’s lassis. By June, things were going so well that Prabhkiran decided to open a second location in a shopping center. There was just one catch: sales were heavily reliant on the weather. When it changed for the worse, Khadke Glassi went from selling 50 to just five glasses a day. That wasn’t sustainable, and in September the business closed its doors for good. Failure is bitter, but – as Prabhkiran would discover – it can impart useful lessons. As he was shuttering his lassi business, he noticed his friend Siddharth tinkering with a humorous website he’d created called Bewakoof, meaning “foolish” in Hindi. Prabhkiran had a flash of inspiration and decided to team up with Siddarth and make t-shirts promoting the site. Finding investors to back this new venture wasn’t easy, but his experience with Khadke Glassi had given Prabhkiran a thick skin. He persevered and eventually received seed funding from a fellow university student. Bewakoof Brands, as the company was now called, gradually established itself as one of India’s most exciting youth brands, selling over 200 shirts a day. By 2014, it had 150 employees and an annual turnover of 500 million rupees – not bad for a venture dreamed up in the wreckage of a failed business! Every young Indian who wants to study law dreams of being admitted to the National Law School in Bangalore. Not everyone makes it through the rigorous application process, but Aruj Garg did. After a brief honeymoon period, he had a change of heart: what really interested him wasn’t law but entrepreneurship. No wonder – business is all about solving problems, and Aruj was a natural problem-solver. Even better, he’d come up with an answer to a problem familiar to students across India: poor-quality canteen food. Realizing there was a huge market for tastier alternatives, he put together a crowd-pleasing menu featuring pizza, sandwiches and burgers inspired by the fast food chain Subway. He rented a small space near campus for 1000 rupees a month and opened his restaurant in May 2011. Its name? Bhukkad, Hindi slang for a food-obsessed person. It was a hit: within a month, Aruj was making between 2000 and 3000 rupees a day. The business might have been sustainable but Aruj’s eating habits weren’t. In 2013, he discovered that his cholesterol levels were dangerously high and he’d have to cut down on processed foods, including all-time personal favorites like chips and ice cream. That severely limited his options when it came to eating out. It was the start of a thought process that would culminate in Bhukkad 2.0 – a restaurant serving delicious food that was both fast and healthy. Shifting his focus to natural and fresh ingredients, Aruj came up with a new “Bhukkad Code” which banished processed meat, white bread and pre-packaged dressings and sauces from the company’s menu. These were replaced by offerings like the signature Asian green salad – a mix of beans, cauliflower and lettuce finished with a lime-honey dressing and peanut garnish. Bhukkad’s high-quality, health-conscious fast food was an even bigger hit than the carb-driven fare it had previously sold, driving sales up by 30 percent! Today, Bhukkad has three full-time employees in three outlets and is looking to expand once it finds the right investor. Aruj, meanwhile, is still in his twenties! There’s clearly plenty of money to be made satisfying students’ hunger, but what about their need for accommodation? Like canteens, student digs often leave a lot to be desired. Take it from Anurag Arora. When he started his course at the ICFAI Business School in Pune, Maharashtra, he was asked to pay 48,000 rupees up-front to live in a privately run hostel, as the university didn’t have its own dormitories. That’s a lot of cash for what he got: a shabby room in a run-down, badly managed building that didn’t even have hot water! Anurag stuck it out for three days before deciding he’d had enough and moving into a private apartment with a couple of pals, forfeiting his entire downpayment. In the summer of 2013, Anurag noticed that incoming students were posting questions about their future accommodation on the university’s Facebook page. By that point, the campus had moved to a different neighborhood in Pune where there weren’t even private hostels. That’s when Anurag hit on the idea of opening a hostel of his own. Because he was known as a good student, the school took his scheme seriously. Having been given the go-ahead, and with the new students due to arrive in just a couple of weeks, Anurag got to work. He reached out to apartment brokers and started inspecting suitable properties. But there was a snag: he didn’t have any start-up capital. Rather than letting that deter him, he used his own apartment to showcase his service and promised students that their own rooms would be just as clean and well-furnished as his. When his first client signed on the dotted line and paid the 56,000 rupees in annual fees, Anurag had enough money to cover the deposit on his first five apartments. Furnishing one of those gave him a new model for future customers. After that, things started to snowball: new clients provided more cash, which in turn paid for the deposits on more apartments. Anurag’s company, Ganpati Facilities, was soon making a net profit of 2.5 million rupees every month! That’s a great example of how far a bit of lateral thinking and lots of determination can get you. Like the other entrepreneurs we’ve encountered in these blinks, Anurag didn’t wait for the perfect job to drop into his lap – he went out there and created it for himself. The key message in these blinks: It doesn’t matter where or what you study, you can turn your dreams of business success into reality – and you don’t even have to wait till you’re through with school! As these six young Indian go-getters’ stories show, what really makes the difference when it comes to getting a company off the ground is determination, elbow grease and a thick skin. So if you’re sitting on the next big thing, get out there and start hustling!  Actionable advice: Get your product out in the world ASAP! Ideas are great, but nothing gets the ball rolling like putting your product out in the world. So once you’ve developed your product idea, don’t hesitate – hit Google and find your material suppliers and start putting your prototype together. Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to begin road-testing it – after all, no one can help you figure out whether you’re onto a winner like the people who’ll be using your product. Got feedback?

What to read next: The Entrepreneur Roller Coaster, by Darren Hardy If the lesson you’ve taken away from these blinks is that anyone can turn their brilliant idea into a money-spinner, great – that was the idea! But even if you’re 99 percent sure that you’re onto a winner, there’s always that niggling one percent of doubt to hold you back. That’s hardly surprising: going it alone can be pretty scary, especially when you’re used to the certainty of a monthly paycheck. But you don’t have to reinvent the wheel – in fact, you’re best off learning from the entrepreneurial veterans who’ve already been through the process. So if you want the lowdown on everything a self-starter needs to know about sales, leadership, recruiting and productivity, check out our blinks to The Entrepreneur Roller Coaster, by Darren Hardy.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Visitors to websites usually leave them rapidly; there’s nothing they want to buy, so they close the window or move on to another site.  The problem is that you can’t just ask people what they want and then provide them with it.  That’s where the Ask Formula comes in. The Ask Formula is a series of surveys that you can give to prospective customers and current customers. As these blinks explain, once people take your surveys, you’ll know what people’s biggest challenges are and how you can solve them.  And solving such problems is what will put your business ahead of the competition. In these blinks, you’ll learn why nobody knows what they want; how to win over people who rejected your first offer; and which email subject headings will get people to open them. The Ask Formula was conceived as a solution to a problem faced by every business owner: how to learn what customers and prospects want? Knowing what is wanted positions businesses to personalize services and answer customer needs. So how do you find out what is wanted? Well, you could simply send out a survey. Traditional surveys, however, come with several inherent problems. First, surveys are irritating. Remember the last time your dinner was interrupted by a telemarketer asking for your opinion on a thrilling topic like new soda bottle brand packaging? Exactly – irritating. Second, there’s no real incentive to answer a survey, since the customers don’t have access to the results. In general, surveys are designed by marketers to help marketers. Other approaches to asking customers fail because people are only good at two things: expressing what they don’t want and saying what they already have. Businesses want to know what people want – but those same businesses are no good at helping potential customers figure out what that thing might be. For example, if you’re browsing the shelves at a store and a salesperson asks, “How can I help you?”, she’s not helping you make a choice. Rather, she’s assuming that you already know what you want so that she can help you find it. But most potential customers have no idea what they want! Just think about the last time you tried to decide where to go out to eat with a group of friends. If you ask them what they want to eat, you enter an endless loop of suggestions and questions, and no decision gets made. But as a business you still have to find out what people want, even when they can’t quite articulate it. The Ask Formula will help you do this by using surveys in a different and unexpected way. So, traditional surveys don’t work. They annoy customers and don’t offer any useful information. So how is the Ask Formula any different?  For starters, the Ask Formula relies on a Survey Funnel strategy, that is, the combination of steps that transform your prospects into paying customers.  We’ll take a closer look at each step in later blinks, so for now, before you start the funnel, you need to construct a Deep Dive Survey. You’ll only conduct this survey once, at the very beginning of the process; it uncovers who your prospective customers really are.  The Deep Dive Survey begins with an email to your list of prospects. These could be current fans or former customers. The email should quickly introduce your company and explain that you’d like to get to know your potential customers better. For example, you might write, “Here at Home Lighting, we want to know who our customers are so we can give them the best service.” Then comes a small sample of survey questions. Remember, your prospects only know what they don’t want, so it’s not worth directly asking what they want. Instead, you have to coax it out of them with questions like, “What is the biggest challenge you’re struggling with right now?” Next, direct respondents to complete the survey on a website where you can collect the answers. Finally, collect and analyze the survey data. Look for answer patterns and sort them into buckets, that is, similar groups of prospects. For example, if you are a B2B company, one bucket could be companies that earn less than $500,000 annually, another for those with more than $5 million, and so on. By organizing respondents into buckets, you can learn the natural consumer language to use when communicating with each group. You wouldn’t want to write an email to your retiree bucket in the technical language of your software geek bucket! Once you know who your prospects are, it’s time to move on to the next step. Thanks to the Deep Dive Survey, you should have a good idea of who your prospects are. The next step is getting them to tell you more; then you can actually start solving their problems. The way you’ll accomplish this is with another survey. In order to entice prospects to take the next survey, you need to design a convincing landing page, called the Prospect Self-Discovery Landing Page. All key information should be available on this page without requiring readers to scroll down. Here’s what the page should look like: Start with a standout headline or question. As an example, the author’s RocketMemory homepage asked, “Is it possible to improve your memory in just three days using these techniques?”  Then, tell the prospects your goal and explain how the survey will help you achieve it. For example, you could say something like, “We want to help you diagnose your problem by asking a few questions, and then offer you a customized solution.” Increase participation by adding a video to your landing page. An easy way to do this is with a “talking head” video, in which you or an actor explains your company. Slides with voiceover also work. The key to the video’s success is a good hook – a compelling idea that inspires curiosity and desire. To find it, ask your viewers about their struggle. Whether it’s losing weight or improving their tennis serve, a good hook will grab their interest, enticing them to take the next survey. Not everyone is easily persuaded, however. Skeptics can be coaxed with if-then statements, like: “If you work with diverse markets but aren’t sure how to communicate with all of them, then…” Finally, introduce the survey to your prospects by hinting at your expertise. Write something like, “For ten years now I’ve asked my clients a series of questions that helped identify their biggest sales bottleneck.” Once you’ve won over your prospects, they’ll eagerly click the link and begin the next survey. So, your prospects are hooked and ready to take your survey. Now it’s time to deliver your Micro-Commitment Bucket Survey.  This survey starts with small, non-threatening, multiple-choice questions, before moving on to more private questions, such as name and email. It starts this way because people are reluctant to divulge personal information and little questions chip away at that reluctance. It’s important to phrase these questions in a highly conversational way – not a robotic one. For example, “What’s your favorite soda brand?” is a far better question than “Which market-leading soda manufacturer do you most prefer?” Your Micro-Commitment Bucket Survey should start with easily answerable questions – “How old are you?” for instance. Use this data to personalize messages by, for instance, referring to your prospects’ age in a follow-up email.  Finally, use segmentation questions to help characterize your prospects and funnel them into different buckets. Avoid the temptation to segment by demographic (age, location, etc.) and instead try to ask questions that will segment prospects according to the specific challenges or problems they want to solve.  For example, you might ask the multiple choice questions, “Which of the following is your biggest challenge right now?” with the answers “Selling to multiple sub markets,” “Making paid traffic convert,” and “Entering a new market.” Each answer gives you insight into your customer’s specific problem. Now it’s time to sort the data you’ve received. In the Deep Dive Survey, you created buckets. Using the Micro-Commitment Bucket Survey, you’ll fill and refine these buckets. For example, if you’re a car manufacturer, you could sort prospects first according to their marital status and then sub-segment these buckets with the number of children in each family. This type of segmentation is invaluable for future promotions, as it helps you introduce relevant products to your customers in a marketing language they understand. The very last thing you’ll do is send your prospects to a capture page, where they’ll enter their name and email address. After submitting their survey, prospects will land on your Post-Survey page, where they’ll receive a diagnosis of their problem and a solution to it.  This page will be nothing but a headline and a video offering personalized feedback to the concerns they shared in the survey.  If you were a doctor, this would be where you offer your patient a prognosis and walk them through the various treatment options. You wouldn’t rush them into surgery or talk about costs! Your goal here is to demonstrate that you understand what they’re going through and motivate them to ask you what they should do about it? That’s when you make your sales pitch. Like your landing page, your sales pitch should also include a video, preferably using the Problem, Agitate, Solution formula: introduce the prospect’s problem, reinforce its severity and urgency and then explain its solution. Start by providing a creatively named diagnosis. For example, you might tell the viewer: “Based on the information you’ve provided, your marketing bottleneck is caused by the Cold Traffic Curse.”  Your diagnosis should immediately spark your prospects’ curiosity and make them want to learn more. Next, explain what your diagnosis means. Demonstrate that you understand their problem and focus on its urgency and severity, while also showing that you care about the outcome. Going with our previous example: “Many websites today face the Cold Traffic Curse, preventing them from converting visitors into customers and threatening business.” Finally, explain your solution by turning education into an offer. Your offer should include the benefit, that is, what’s in it for your customers when they purchase; a description of the offer; the discount price or special deal available; and the primary reason why they need to act now (like deadlines or limited availability). Up to this point, the Ask Formula has helped you identify customer problems so that you can solve their specific problems. In our final blinks, you’ll learn how you can make the most of these new conversions. The Ask Formula doesn’t end with this first offer on the Post-Survey page. Rather, it aims to drive sales well into the future. But how?  Once you’ve generated a customer, the real benefit comes from the extended relationship you’ll have with that customer as you sell to them over time. This is where the Profit Maximization Upsell sequence comes into play. Think about your latest visit to McDonald’s. They don’t make billions in sales simply because people buy burgers. Rather, they ask, “Do you want fries with that?”  Once someone has already decided to make a purchase, they’re in a buying mindset and thus much more likely to spend more money right then and there. Thus, directly after your prospect makes their initial purchase, present them with one or more one-click upsell opportunities that don’t require them to re-enter payment information.  One option might simply be to sell more of what the customer just purchased, but at a discounted price. For instance, if you sell protein powder, you could offer three discounted tubs of powder with each new purchase. Another option is to sell a faster, easier result. If you sell a gym membership online, for example, you could target the people who expect fast results and propose a 30-day pass to a fat-burn boot camp in addition to the membership. Finally, you could offer a solution to a problem that your prospects hadn’t even thought about yet but will surely face after getting results from your initial product. To conceptualize this, imagine that you sell a salary-negotiation course, which helps people argue for higher wages. You now have the opportunity to help customers with the new “good” problem of having excess cash. Your upsell could emphasize the importance of investing their excess money wisely and offer a complementary program focused on investment. This is typically a “good” problem that your clients don’t have yet but may be facing soon. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of visitors – possibly as low as ten percent – will buy after this first round of surveys. But don’t give up on the other 90 percent! The Ask Formula has a special way of following up with these reluctant prospects to win their business. Email follow-ups offer a constant string of communication that helps optimize and improve the marketing funnel through the Email Follow-Up Feedback Loop. There are two types of email sequences: one for non-buyers and another for buyers. Let’s start by focusing on following up with non-buyers, those who didn’t immediately buy the offer presented at the post-survey sales prescription. Emails to non-buyers have to be highly engaging in order to rescue a sale. One way to keep them engaged is to tweak the offer without devaluing the product by offering discount after discount. Try lowering the threshold of commitment – by offering, for example, a one-dollar trial period with the full amount due at a later date. In addition, urgency emails can be used to remind non-buyers of your offer’s time limitation. Knowing that an offer is only valid for another hour could convince some non-buyers to pull out their wallets. Lastly, if the initial offer failed, give people the opportunity to pivot and choose their own next step by simply starting the Ask Formula cycle again, this time focusing on a different kind of product. Luckily, you can use a similar process to get more from your buyers, but this time you’ll prime them for another purchase by leveraging the joy they got from the product you already sold them. A good way to entice buyers to open your emails is to put an incomplete thought in the subject line. For example, “Where there’s a will there’s a…” tickles the reader’s curiosity and entices them to read on. In the body, you should include a link that directs them to your offer; that’ll turn these one-time customers into repeat buyers. The key message in this book: If you want to know what your customers really want, the best thing to do is to ask. The trick is to ask in the right way, using an organized system that pulls actionable information from prospects while also building trust and intrigue. In other words, you need the Ask Formula. Actionable advice: Nothing-fits-all.  There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution. Everyone’s situation is unique and thus the solutions that are best for each individual customer will likewise need to be unique.

But despite your concern and your initial impulse to take action, your second thought may have been: “I’d like to help, but I can’t just change my life now. It’s too risky!” Author Jean Case understands that taking action requires courage and that it’s much easier to do nothing or stay on autopilot. But these days we need courageous people who want to make the world a better place, so she’s decided to offer inspiration to those who need that extra push to replace those fears of doing something new with courage and fearlessness. According to Case, the five principles for being fearless are to make a Big Bet; be a bold risk-taker; make failures matter; reach beyond your bubble; and let urgency conquer fear. We’ll take a look at some examples of these principles in action and hopefully empower your inner game-changer to step forward.   In these blinks you’ll find which trailblazing woman brought cherry trees to Washington DC; why a lack of failures can be a troubling warning sign; and why overthinking has its downsides. Back at the start of the 1960s, no one knew exactly how the first human was going to set foot on the moon. But even though there were a lot of hurdles in the way, including the small fact that the technology had yet to be invented, US president John F. Kennedy made a bold promise on national TV, announcing to the world that the astronomical feat would be completed within the decade.     The author refers to this kind of idea as making a Big Bet, and it’s the first principle behind being the kind of fearless person who makes a difference in the world. A Big Bet is the kind of audacious plan that defies common assumptions and grabs people’s attention. Much like JFK did in 1961, the audacious entrepreneur Elon Musk has made the Big Bet of getting us to Mars by 2030. And while he’s at it, as CEO of the electric car company Tesla, he’s betting on revolutionizing the way people travel here on Earth. Elon Musk has had his fair share of detractors, but in January of 2018 his SpaceX program silenced some of those critics when it successfully launched its own rocket. Now, space travel is one thing, but how does balloon-powered internet browsing sound? According to Astro Teller, the innovator who oversees X, a development lab founded by Google, creating a balloon-powered internet was the craziest project of the lab so far. And it was a success, helping Puerto Rico get back online after Hurricane Maria in 2017. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to make a Big Bet. In fact, you can make one wherever you may be in life at this moment. Take Rachel Sumekh, for instance, who was just a normal student at UCLA when, in 2010, she found herself to be the only person who showed up for a food drive to help fellow students who couldn’t afford decent meals. It was just one sign of how underappreciated the issue of student hunger is, despite the fact that in some states one out of every four college students has had to visit a food bank or was not always able to buy groceries. Sumekh made the Big Bet that this long-standing problem could change, and she started Swipe Out Hunger, an organization that lets other students donate their unused food card money. Eventually, her efforts caught the attention of Barack Obama and has now spread to over 30 campuses while delivering over 1.3 million meals. There’s a good chance that at some point you’ve been frustrated by something only to have someone shrug and tell you, “That’s just the way it is!” A lot of people assume things are the way they are and there’s no use trying to change anything. But then there are the fearless people who defy these common assumptions and show us that things can change for the better. Two such people are David Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal. One day, Gilboa needed to replace his glasses and was disturbed to find that a new pair would end up costing him around $700. He felt that there ought be a way to get some decent specs without breaking the bank. Most people just assumed that the process of getting eyeglasses – which included visiting a shop to spend hundreds of dollars on an eye exam, lenses and frames – was set in stone. But Blumenthal had worked with an organization called VisionSpring, which worked with people in developing countries, training them in how to perform eye tests and run shops that sold glasses that people making under four dollars a day could afford. So there was a less-expensive way, and to prove it Blumenthal and Gilboa got just $2,500 in seed money to launch Warby Parker, an online service that offered a stylish selection of glasses priced at just $95 a pair. The response proved that you could indeed sell glasses online, with their entire inventory selling out within the first month and a waiting list of 20,000 customers soon forming. These days, Warby Parker is worth $1.75 billion, with dozens of stores and around 1,400 employees. Along with questioning assumptions, a Big Bet can also help you peek around the corner and see what the future holds. Back in the 1990s, there were people who couldn’t fathom why they’d need to create a website for their business, or even get an email account. Nowadays it’s hard to fathom how we got by without the internet. The author was among a group in the 1980s who recognized the future potential of the internet and wasn’t swayed by the many people who expressed bewilderment in her desire to work for the start-up that would one day turn into America Online. You probably like being in your comfort zone, right? Who doesn’t? But while you may be able to do good work in that zone, the reality is that you’re not going to do amazing, game-changing work while you’re comfortable. To change the world, you need to get uncomfortable. Which brings us to the second principle of being fearless: be bold and take chances. Imagine the progress that would – or rather wouldn’t – have been made if people only strove for comfort. Or how about all the exciting things we wouldn’t accomplish if we only took on the jobs we’re completely confident we’ll manage. It doesn’t sound very exciting at all, does it? Many women and minorities can speak to the discomfort of being the only one of their kind in a workplace. There’s not only the awkwardness of feeling different, there’s also the pressure of feeling like your work is representing a whole gender or ethnicity. While the author feels grateful for being the first female Chairman of the National Geographic Society, she also feels indebted to Eliza Scidmore, who was the first female board member of the society back in 1892. Scidmore was remarkable in many ways, and it’s due in part to the fact that she lived a life that embraced the risk inherent in being a trailblazer. At 19, she was part of Oberlin College’s first graduating class that allowed women. From there she wrote a popular newspaper column under the androgynous pen name of E.R. Scidmore, which earned her enough money to fulfill her dream of travelling and seeing the world. In 1885, she boarded a steamship to Alaska, a full 75 years before it became part of the US. After arriving, she wrote the first travel guide to the area – a truly daunting feat! This led to Scidmore becoming the first female writer and photographer for National Geographic magazine, a role that took her to far-flung lands, including India, China, Indonesia, Russia and Korea. As a single mom of two at the end of the nineteenth century, one can only imagine how difficult and risky such trips would’ve been for Scidmore. But she had an urge to change the world and she accepted that such risks and discomforts were part of it. It’s important to know about trailblazers like Eliza Scidmore, because the work they did and the doors they opened can make it easier for you today. While changing the world is never going to be a walk in the park, it doesn’t mean that you have to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time. Even an inventor like Thomas Edison was well aware of the importance of using what came before. People tend to think of Edison as being a genius who was repeatedly struck by so-called eureka moments, where ideas like the light bulb came to him purely as the result of his brilliant mind. But even Edison referred to himself as “more of a sponge than an inventor.” That’s because he was highly aware of the advances that others were making, and how he could offer his own resources and know-how to make these advances even better. A more recent example is Justin Knopf, a fifth generation farmer who learned about the no tilling approach to farming. The issue of soil erosion and topsoil being blown away is still a problem, just as it was back in the days of the dust bowl, and no tilling offers a way for farmers to keep more of their soil undisturbed. When Knopf heard about this he thought it may also help retain more of the natural nutrients in his soil, a topic he’d been learning about in school. Sure enough, once he started testing he saw amazing results and before long the size of his yields were growing exponentially. Knopf has been open in sharing what he’s learned and he’s now considered a leader of a full-blown no tilling movement. Changing the way you do things can be a risky proposition, but if you want to avoid regrets you’ll likely want to start taking those bold chances. The most common regret people have later in life isn’t that they chose to do something risky; it’s rather that they chose to play it safe. Just look at what happened to Kodak. Before the 2000s, the company was the leader in camera film, with around 70 percent of the total market. When presented with the decision of investing in digital film or protecting this market share they decided to stick with the status quo. By 2003, digital camera sales were outpacing film cameras, and in 2012 Kodak filed for bankruptcy. The lesson is clear: Unless you want a life of regrets, you have to take risks. Most people won’t throw a celebration when a project has failed and yet you might be surprised to find how many of the big game-changers see failure as a good thing. They know that behind every success story you’ll find failures, because they’re often an integral part of the process. That’s why the third principle of being fearless is to make your failures matter. For starters, when you have a healthy attitude toward failure, you can learn a lot. As IBM founder Thomas J. Watson once advised, if you really want to succeed, you should double your rate of failure. For example, at the author’s Case Foundation, which funds bold innovative projects, a lack of failures would be a clear warning sign that the projects are not innovative enough. After all, when every project should be pushing the boundaries of what is possible, there should be a healthy amount of failures. And remember the X lab scientist Astro Teller? He doesn’t just tolerate failure, he expects it. Teller gave a TED Talk called “The Unexpected Benefit of Celebrating Failure” and he explained how at X, they actively try to bring a project down by proving its central conceit wrong. If you can’t, then you know there’s a good chance you have a brilliant idea! Another key to accepting failure as part of the process is to always keep your eye on the bigger picture. A person who is often looked to as one of the most successful people on the planet is Warren Buffett. As a hugely influential investor, Buffett has based his whole philosophy on seeking out businesses that’ll do well in the long run. He doesn’t pay attention to fads or trends. Instead, he’s attracted to businesses with long-term potential. Interestingly enough, Buffett himself could be seen as a late bloomer. The majority of his fortune has been accumulated after his 50th birthday, and between his 83rd and 87th birthdays he earned as much money as he did in his first 60 years. As Albert Einstein once said, “Failure is success in progress.” What really matters isn’t that you managed to avoid failure your entire life, it’s that you went after your goals and learned the lessons behind the inevitable failures that came your way. Every year, the author looks forward to getting in an RV with her husband and travelling around the US. This allows her to see some beautiful scenery, but, crucially, she gets to meet people she wouldn’t normally come across. In other words, these road trips ensure that she gets outside of her bubble, the fourth principle of being fearless. First of all, looking beyond your bubble is critical to understanding what’s truly going on in the world and getting rid of any blind spots or biases you may have. For example, many people are living under the impression that certain US cities such as Pittsburgh or Detroit are dying and should be avoided. But if you saw these places with your own eyes, you’d see that there’s exciting work taking place there. For instance, Ford and Uber are both investing a good deal of money in Pittsburgh due to the groundbreaking work in automated driving going on there. The city is also home to thriving businesses in the fields of biomedicine, robotics and alternative energy. Detroit is another city on the upswing, with exciting partnerships taking place between private and public industries committed to ushering in an economic rebirth. Dan Gilbert, the man behind Quicken Loans, has relocated his entire business to Detroit. The company has around 17,000 employees and has deeply invested in the city’s real estate and start-ups. Looking outside your bubble is also the only way you’ll find that perfect yet unusual partnership that may hold the key to your future. For example, in 2010, NASA and Lego formed an unlikely partnership that found Lego sets being used in the International Space Station while classrooms of students and teachers interacted with the astronauts through a specially-designed curriculum. Thanks to this partnership, there’s a good chance some of those students will look back at those classes as inspiration for a career in astronomy, which is exactly what NASA was hoping for. Another perfect example happened during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. At the time, the hazmat suits being used were flawed. They required 30 steps to put them on and didn’t provide complete protection. So when Johns Hopkins University put out an open call for a better design, who won? A seamstress who specialized in wedding dresses! Indeed, sometimes the best solutions are found in the most unusual places, but you’ll never find them if you don’t step outside your bubble. The final principle of being fearless is to let urgency overpower your fear. Everyone is built to experience fear as a way of protecting us from danger, but it can also get in the way of taking chances, being bold and doing what it takes to make amazing things happen. One way of bypassing this fear is to let urgency take over and give into the kind of instinctual response that kicks in during times of emergency or crisis. When someone’s back is against the wall, this is when adrenaline kicks in and they find themselves doing amazing things that wouldn’t happen in normal circumstances. Fortunately, if you look at what’s going on around you or elsewhere in the world, you’ll likely find a crisis that makes you passionate in wanting to do something to help. Use this passion to your advantage! The author calls the people who take this kind of action first responders and there are many of them who’ve found success in doing amazing things for others. For example, José Andrés is a world-renowned chef with many award-winning restaurants to his name, but he’s also considered “the face of American disaster relief.” That recognition started locally, in Washington DC, where he founded the DC Central Kitchen to help hungry people in the city. But then, in 2010, his mission became the World Hunger Kitchen when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake brought widespread damage to Haiti. But that was just the beginning: after Hurricane Maria caused food and water shortages in Puerto Rico, Andrés started with one kitchen, serving 1,000 meals a day, but quickly ramped up his effort to 175,000 meals a day – eventually giving out 3.5 million meals to the recovering community. As Andrés sees it, the American dream is no longer about securing yourself a fancy house, car or high-paying job. It’s about finding success for yourself through doing something beneficial for others in the world. For Andrés, the urgency of hunger causes him to seize the moment and do what he can to help. For  David Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal, the two behind Warby Parker, it was getting people glasses they could afford, and it’s why they built in the “buy a pair, give a pair” program into their business model. So far, they’ve distributed around four million pairs of glasses to developing countries. You may have been given some well-meaning advice by someone who warned you against being impulsive, telling you to “Make sure you think things through!” The problem is, the more time you spend thinking things through, the more likely it is you’ll end up paralyzed by uncertainty, confusion and exhaustion. In short, any great idea can seem dubious if you spend enough time picking it apart. That’s why it’s helpful to let urgency propel you into action. If you find a cause that inspires passion within you, there’s a good chance it’s worth doing. Sure, there may be issues that you’ll need to deal with, but you can always figure those things out later. That’s what Bertha and Harry Holt did back in 1954 when they heard about homeless children in Korea who had been cast aside for being fathered by American soldiers. Immediately they set about trying to help by adopting eight children. If they’d stopped to think all the details through, they’d have found that this was actually against the law. But instead of letting that stop them, they lobbied Congress and got Holt’s Law passed in 1955, clearing the way for the children to be given a home with their family. The Holts then set up an adoption agency through the Salvation Army to get other children a safe home, and built a residential facility in Seoul to provide them with a safe place to live. That facility is still there today, run by the Holt’s 80-year-old daughter, Molly. There’s even a museum on the site, documenting the decades of loving philanthropy the Holt family provided for so many Korean children. So don’t wait for the perfect conditions to be in place before taking action. As Brené Brown, the author of Daring Greatly, puts it, you can waste a lot of time, talent and meaningful relationships waiting for the perfect moment. Keep this in mind: You don’t have to take a huge leap in order to get involved. Whatever it is, you can always break it down into a series of small steps instead of facing it as one massive goal. If, for instance, you’re passionate about the environment and want to launch a business redefining the way communities recycle, start by volunteering to clear trash in your neighborhood while learning more about the current recycling methods. It’s time to take action and be fearless about following your heart. The key message in these blinks: The world needs more fearless people out there, willing to go for broke in trying to help the planet and put an end to hunger and poverty once and for all. It takes fearlessness for transformative things to happen because every groundbreaking idea requires the willingness to take risks, learn from failures and to step out of comfort zones.   Actionable advice: Embrace and invest in diversity. Another way to make sure you get outside your bubble is to embrace diversity. A 2018 McKinsey report showed that businesses lacking gender and ethnic diversity underperformed compared to more diverse businesses. Plus, female-led businesses are shown to perform significantly better than male-led businesses. Yet, despite these impressive numbers, only 10 percent of investment capital goes to businesses founded by women or minorities. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: The Fear Factor, by Abigail Marsh Now that you know what it takes to be more fearless, it’s time to learn about why humans are so fearful to begin with. After all, the more you know about why these pesky feelings of fear keeping showing up, the better you’ll be at being able to control and overcome them. That’s why we recommend The Fear Factor (2017), since it takes an all-encompassing look at the wide variety of ways fear can influence your life. While it’s great to be fearless in the pursuit of your dreams, it’s also important to recognize the good side to fear, such as the role it plays in making us empathetic and altruistic.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

However, our situation is by no means unprecedented. In fact, the Golden Age of Piracy, which began in 1690, was in many ways quite similar. Back then, many were both anxious about the uncertainties and imminent redundancies of the future and fed up with an establishment that had only its own interest at heart. Sound familiar? Throughout Europe, warfare, with all its attendant injustices, was constant. And from amid these continent-wide hostilities a network of pirates arose, a band of rebels who were fed up with the status quo and ready to pick the overflowing pockets of the governments that had long been exploiting the working class. The pirates were not the drunken thugs you may have seen depicted in movies. These were highly skilled sailors, with a well-coordinated network of collaborators, who could outmaneuver and out-strategize the best minds of the combined global superpowers of the time. Not only that, but the diverse crews that worked aboard the pirate ships were part of a democratic and progressive system that promoted a level of equality that wouldn’t be seen in Europe or the United States for hundreds of years to come. As we’ll see, there is plenty we can learn from the fascinating true story, strategy and success of the world’s greatest pirates. In these blinks, you’ll discover why pirates were among the first equal-opportunity employers; that Blackbeard was a master at branding; and how blockchain technology continues the pirate tradition.

Thanks to movies like the popular Pirates of the Caribbean series, you might think that all pirates were drunken swashbucklers or murderous, scurvy-ridden thugs. Either way, it’s likely that you don’t think of pirates as politically-minded rebels fighting for justice and fair pay. Yet that’s precisely the case for many of the Golden Age pirates. Golden Age pirates sailed the high seas between 1690 and 1725, a period during which piracy thrived as it never had before. And these men and women were such innovative thinkers, rebelling against such unfair times with such progressive ideas that they still have plenty to teach us today. Specifically, there are five great attributes that Golden Age pirates should be remembered for. First is fair pay. Many pirates were former Royal Navy or Merchant Navy personnel, so they were familiar with being treated unfairly. Those in the navy were routinely paid less than promised and often much later than scheduled. In response, pirates practiced fair pay for every member of the crew. Captains and quartermasters got three to four shares of any pirated booty. Doctors and gunners got two shares. The rest of the crew got one share each. These days, the ratio between the CEO’s pay and that of the lowest-paid worker of a corporation can be as bad as 384 to 1. Meanwhile, at progressive enterprises, it can be as good as 10 to 1. But the 4-to-1 ratio that included all crew members aboard was still far fairer than anything seen today. The second amazing quality of the pirate’s life was protection against abuse of power. Navy sailors weren’t only underpaid; they also had to put up with the oppressively dictatorial ways of their commanders. So pirates, determined to keep their own captains in check, invested quartermasters with more power than they’d traditionally had. In this early example of dual governance, captains were still responsible for planning and strategizing, but the quartermaster was now in charge of keeping the crew happy and letting the captain know about any disputes. A similar two-house system of government was also catching on in England, with the 1689 Bill of Rights establishing a second house of government, which the United States would also put to use in 1776. The third of the five attributes that made Golden Age pirates a progressive and important part of history is their forward-looking approach to democracy and voting. Suffrage was extended to all shipmates, and a one-pirate, one-vote rule was established. This was another response to the harsh authoritarian rule in the navy, where corporal punishment was dished out to anyone who didn’t fall in line. The pirate’s life was one where everyone, be they man, woman, white or non-white, had a say in how things went. For the United States and the United Kingdom, it would be another 230 years or so before women were given the right to vote, in the 1920s, and another 30 years before black people got suffrage. The fourth remarkable attribute aboard pirate ships was how they handled health care and worker compensation. Pirates are often portrayed as sporting a peg leg, an eye patch and a hook for a hand, which, though cartoonish, isn’t completely inaccurate. The life of a pirate came with a certain amount of risk of injury, so, in the spirit of fairness, every crew member was given compensation for lost limbs, eyes or what have you. In the Golden Age, it was 800 pieces of eight – the popular monetary system of the time – for a leg, 600 for an arm and 100 for an eye. Also, if an injury left you unable to engage in a raid, efforts were made to find a position you could thrive in. Of course, we can’t speak of pirates without mentioning the rum. And, indeed, one of the more legendary pirates, Sir Francis Drake, is credited with being the first to mix juice and sugar into an alcoholic beverage, thus creating the world’s first cocktail – some 300 years before that mainstream mixed drink, the Old Fashioned, was invented in New York. This alcoholic innovation is attribute number five. In addition to these, there are countless other things the Golden Age pirates would deserve to be remembered for. But from these five you can already see that, far from being thuggish criminals, they were highly principled rebels who were fed up with being exploited by governments that, at the time, were colonizing and robbing other people. Next, let’s take a look at how you can put these traits to use in your own life. There are many examples of people using the pirate’s rebellious spirit to cause what’s known as “good trouble.” This is trouble that comes from noble intentions to right a wrong, put an end to injustice or simply fix an annoying problem and make the world a better place. Good trouble pushes change. Just take the digital-music pirates who paved the way for the creation of Apple’s iTunes, or the vandalism of street artist Banksy, whose work calls attention to the hypocrisy and social injustice of world governments. So the first step toward being a rebellious pirate and agent of change is to find your cause. It’s important to realize that this might take a change in your everyday attitude. Many of us prefer to shy away from confrontation. We avoid complaining or even raising our voices. But these are fears that you’ll need to overcome in order to conjure your inner pirate. To find your cause, ask yourself, “What rule do I find unfair, unjust or just plain annoying?” In the early 1960s, people in England were fed up with the limitations of BBC radio. The state-owned BBC had a stranglehold on the airwaves at the time and, for fans of the growing rock ‘n’ roll scene, there was little satisfaction in their non-rocking programming. So some industrious people launched boats into international waters and sent out their own radio signal, thus becoming the first pirate-radio DJs. This is good trouble at its best, and it prompted an overwhelmingly positive response. At its height, in 1964, it’s believed that some 15 million people were tuning in to pirate radio. And, as a result, the BBC created four new radio stations to bring listeners a more eclectic mix of programming. Of course, your rebellion doesn’t have to be so drastic as this. In fact, it might be best to start out with something small to build up your confidence. Maybe there’s a part of your job that you’re fed up with and, rather than continuing to put up with it, you could start making improvements. We’ll expand on this approach in the next blink. The Golden Age pirates didn’t just break the rules for the sake of raising hell. They were fighting back against injustice, and by offering a fair and equal workplace, they were showing that it’s possible to operate in a better way. This intention for constructive evolution is what separates true agents of change from your average scoundrels and hooligans. This is why, after identifying your cause, you should begin to formulate a replacement or new way of doing things. In other words, once you break the rule, you’ve got to rewrite it. In pirate terms, this is what a mutiny is all about. You don’t overthrow the captain without having a better captain ready to take over. One of the biggest pirates currently at sea is Elon Musk, a man who’s not only called for change in the fields of energy production and transportation but also invested his own money into improved technology and alternative fuel sources. Whether it’s the Tesla electric car, Solar City energy or the Hyperloop, a project aimed at getting people to and from Los Angeles and San Francisco in a matter of minutes, his projects all reveal his piratical instincts: to better the world by rewriting the rules. Of course, you probably don’t have a hundred million dollars to invest, so let’s look at a more everyday example with the #riotcleanup hashtag. After the 2011 London riots, the authorities were looking at the damage and scratching their collective head over what had happened. At that moment, concerned citizen Sophie Collard took to Twitter and fired off a message that ended with #riotcleanup. The message was then retweeted until it was picked up by Dan Thompson, the head of a social initiative with experience rallying people together for good causes. Soon enough, thousands of people were on the streets picking up the broken glass. Collard saw a problem and, rather than just shrugging and accepting it as the way things were, she ended up empowering thousands of people with less than 140 characters. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how pirates make the most out of limited resources. At times during the Golden Age of piracy, the Royal Navy was around 45,000 strong, while there were a mere 1,500 pirates. Nevertheless, the pirates had something the military didn’t: agility and flexibility. When looking at the establishment, no matter what era or century it is, you’ll likely find dogmatic institutions that are weighed down with bureaucracy and a very rigid power structure. And this is something any pirate should be careful to avoid. According to Belgian author and politician, Frederic Laloux, growth for growth’s sake is basically cancer. And it’s how we’ve arrived where we are today, with most consumer goods being produced by ten different megacorporations, including Coke, Pepsi and Mars – organizations that aren’t exactly famous for putting the environment and employee welfare before company profit. This applies to some of the problematic trends in digital businesses, too. One of Facebook’s mottos is, “Move fast and break things.” For Google, it’s “10X Everything.” But, these days, their size and the appetite required to maintain it are starting to make them look bloated and greedy. While many companies will blindly go after any growth they can attain, pirates appreciate the strength of making strong connections and the flexibility and adaptability that come with achieving scale. This way, they can stay small and agile, and, when the situation calls for it, they can tap into their network to scale in a sustainable way. One of the most famous pirates was Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. He had an average crew size of around 80 people, but all he needed to do was put the call out to the pirate network, and he could scale up to hundreds of people in order to conduct a big raid, like he did when he held the entire town of Charleston, South Carolina, hostage for a week. These days, pirates know that the internet has made it easier than ever to scale up or down and bring people together to solve whatever problem there is. One of the best examples is Avaaz, an online activist group run by a small and diverse crew. Despite its unassuming size, it has around 44 million users worldwide. These users can be called upon to help free journalists, protect endangered species or organize a three-mile-long handshake with the Dalai Lama. After you’ve identified your cause, rewritten the rules and organized your diverse crew, you should be on your way to facilitating change. Now the challenge is to protect and maintain that change and to avoid being corrupted yourself. When you find some success through your rebellious ways, it’s natural for the establishment, or the very institutions you’re rebelling against, to come calling and try to make you an offer. But a true pirate will maintain their integrity and avoid getting blown off course. They’ll do this by distributing the power throughout the crew and having strong principles in place to stay afloat. Pirate ships did this through the dual-leadership structure and established egalitarian rules, such as keeping the wage gap low and always giving the crew a democratic voice. It’s clear that fair pay and power-sharing are appealing to people today. Both Bernie Sanders in the United States and Jeremy Corbyn in Britain have shown that politics can be exciting to young voters when the candidate is considered to be honest and appears to authentically support progress and social change. Barry Salzberg, the CEO of the consultancy firm Deloitte, notes that, in large part because of millennials, social enterprises are coming to represent an ever-greater part of world business. These are companies that make social and environmental issues central to their mission statement. And, according to the 2017 UK State of Social Enterprise Report, these eco- and social-friendly businesses are better innovators and better performers, as well as more diverse and better paying. So, in many ways, social enterprises are today’s pirate ships, innovating at the edges and acting as predictors of future trends. A particularly impressive one is Elvis & Kresse, whose founder, Kresse Wessling, has made a hugely successful business by repurposing products that were destined for the landfill, such as broken fire hoses and parachutes, and turning them into handbags, belts and other fashion items, some of which have been featured on the cover of Vogue magazine. Furthermore, profits are finding their way back to the community: 50 percent of the profits from fire-hose bags go to the Fire Fighters Charity, for instance. At this stage in your pirate career, you’re challenging the status quo and maintaining your principles by aligning yourself with a cause that’s empowering and beneficial to society. You’ve made it this far, so now’s the time to make sure everyone knows about your message by establishing a strong brand. Pirates were also ahead of their time in their effective use of branding and storytelling. For starters, there was the Jolly Rodger; the flag pirates would fly to announce themselves. These flags were usually black and filled with fear-inducing imagery, like the classic skull and crossbones. Somewhat surprisingly, pirates were all about nurturing a frightening brand because they didn’t want to engage in violence. This was for piratically practical reasons: they didn’t want to lose crew members or have to pay someone for a lost limb. The path of least resistance was to exaggerate and come up with wild stories of just how vicious they were to all crews that didn’t immediately hand over their treasure. Pirates also knew that the most effective way to do this was to advertise their message by showing just how fearless they were. And they’d do this by charging right into the lion’s den – that is, they’d directly challenge any enemy while projecting utter confidence, even if they're truly frightened and thinking “shiver me timbers.” For example, when Blackbeard engaged the enemy, he always went the extra mile with his wild brand. Not only was he armed to the teeth with guns and swords; he’d tie bits of smoking sulfur to his beard, making him seem more like a mythical beast than a human. But the truth is that Blackbeard wasn’t the richest, most successful or most violent pirate. His name is still known all these years later, however, because he was brilliant at branding. Therefore, the three rules we can learn from pirates like Blackbeard are these: Create a singular message and make sure people notice. Be the brand – don’t just talk about it. And, finally, taking your story to the lion’s den, to critics or counter-intuitive audiences, usually creates greater waves than you could make on your own. If you’re familiar with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, you’ve probably heard about the pirate code. This isn’t a fictional concept, but, contrary to what the character of Captain Barbossa says in the movie, it’s not just a set of guidelines. They were strict rules that came with punishments if broken. If you’ve followed all the steps so far, you should already have a sense of the kind of rules that will help you stay on course, with your ship pointed toward its north star. However, while your code should reflect you and your personal values, and be designed to keep you and your crew honest, that doesn’t mean you can’t steal codes that have already proven to be helpful to others. In fact, stealing someone else’s code would just be, well, being a bit more pirate. The author has scanned today’s business landscape and offers a series of modern, successful codes that have already proven their worth and effectiveness. For example, there are groups like responsive.org that are actively looking for new ways of devising modern business plans and manifestos, rather than kicking around old business ideas from 30, 40 or 100 years ago. One particularly exciting, modern idea is the New Citizenship Project, which is about ditching the old method of creating with “consumers” in mind, and instead creating products and services for “citizens” of the world. So one of the proposed codes in the author’s Pirate Code 2.0 is to “Change the way you think about customers. They are not consumers; they are citizens like you and me.” Now, a code is only effective if it’s strictly enforced. And while you may not be a naturally forceful taskmaster, there must be consequences for crew members who break the code. This doesn’t have to mean anything as drastic as actually making them walk the plank, but it does have to include a degree of discomfort. One of the most popular punishments to arise from the workshops the author runs is for the transgressor to buy the rest of the team’s coffee for a week. With clear accountabilities in place, what a good pirate code can do is provide a concrete list that reflects who you are, what you care about and the positive change you’re trying to bring about. Becoming a pirate shouldn’t be about becoming someone else; it should be about committing yourself to the things that matter most. This is an exclusive Blink, covering content that’s not in the original book, but created by the author and Blinkist because we pirates believe in doing things a little differently now and then. If pirates are the perfect metaphor for the change-agents that the world needs, then the purpose of this blink is to see who holds the current pirate crown. Pirates kick at the edges to influence the center, and, in the author’s opinion, the defining pirate of the times is blockchain technology, which is causing waves comparable only to the arrival of the internet. To give an example of how the blockchain fulfills the pirate principles, we can look at Bitcoin and the rise of cryptocurrency: an alternative financial system built on the blockchain, where power is redistributed away from institutions and toward its users via an immutable ledger book of every transaction ever made. For some, it represents the arrival of honesty and fairness to the financial sector. For others, cryptocurrency is nothing but overblown hype. What few people see is the story behind the headlines: Bitcoin has the pirate spirit of rebellion in its DNA, literally. In 2009, mere weeks after the peak of the global financial crisis, Bitcoin was launched by a fictitious character with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Hardcoded into the “Genesis Block,” the source code for all subsequent Bitcoins, is the front page of the Times Newspaper, announcing the bailout of the banks. Shortly after this warning shot, Satoshi disappeared, laying out his philosophy in a white paper and ensuring the legacy of these disruptive shots fired at the global financial institutions. Nearly a decade later, most major banks, institutions, businesses and governments are still running to catch up with the disruption caused by that act. Breaking and remaking rules, fighting for fairness and reorganizing how things are done – the blockchain fits every element of the pirate framework for change and is now being applied in a wide range of industries from media buying to manufacturing. For example, TRUTH, the world’s first blockchain media agency, is poised to remove lack of transparency around fees in media buying, a potentially game-changing move. But whether it’s media and advertising, politics or car production, Blockchain is being applied wherever it can provide rigorous accountability in a supply chain, enabling solid auditing and the rooting out of corruption. And in true pirate spirit, this radical idea once forged at the edges is now becoming a principle adopted by the mainstream. The key message in these blinks: There are a great many lessons we can learn from the Golden Age pirates who stood up to the exploitative, war-mongering establishment at the turn of the eighteenth century. In fact, so many of their methods and principles were ahead of their time that they’re still relevant today. By taking their lead, you can become a powerful agent of change and social justice. It all starts by finding your cause, rewriting the broken rules, empowering your crew and taking your message straight into the lion’s den. Actionable advice: Ask yourself the right questions. Each step of the way to adopting the pirate mind-set, there are questions you can ask yourself. For example, when finding your cause, ask, “If I could break any rule, what would it be, and how would I rewrite it?” And, “Who out there would I most like to take down?” While bringing together your crew, plotting your mutiny and writing your pirate code, ask, “What, values or ideals am I willing to put my neck on the line for? What principles do I care about so much that I’d actually fight for them?” Don’t forget: The author has helped create this book-in-blinks, including the exclusive final blink.

In this scenario, the most exciting moments are likely to involve games of bingo. But it doesn’t have to be this way. The only thing that’s preventing your wildest dreams from coming true is fear of failure or rejection – and a lack of ambition. But once you begin to tap into the great powers and passion that come with obsession, you can use your fears to your advantage. Then you’ll be on your way to unlocking the limitless rewards that come with grand ambitions. In these blinks, you’ll discover J.K. Rowling’s secret for success; what the New England Patriots can teach you about ambition; and why haters are a sign of good fortune. Every once in a while there comes a time when you’re on the job and feeling depleted of energy. When you’re on the verge of burnout, you have two options: you can either take some time off or become obsessed. The average person will likely take the first option, but this isn’t going to help you get where you want to go. If you want to reach the next level you need to get obsessed and always push toward your goals. When this happens, you’ll find that you’re generating energy, not depleting it. However, if you do feel exhausted, check in with yourself and reaffirm your purpose. Maybe you’ve gotten off track? When the author hit 40, he began feeling tired and stressed. He realized he was constantly crisscrossing the United States to give one talk after another. On days when there was a US holiday, he’d book a talk in Canada, and it wasn’t unusual for him to wake up and not know which city he was in. It dawned on Cardone that all the travel and speaking engagements had distracted him from his real obsession. He didn’t start out to be a public speaker; he wanted to be the greatest salesman on earth. After writing down his purpose and reasserting his goals in life, he immediately felt rejuvenated. Many people think that being obsessed leads to an imbalanced life, but the author has found that obsession is the key to both unlocking your energy and achieving real balance. A balanced life isn’t about taking lots of time off to relax and hang out. It’s about having the career and money you desire as well as good health, a happy family life and strong faith. And for this, you need to work hard each and every moment, which means you need the passion that comes with obsession. With this energy, you can make the most of every second, like combining family time with fitness and taking the kids to the gym with you in the morning, something the author likes to do. Let’s say you know what you’re passionate about, but it took you a lot less time than expected to reach the goals you set for yourself. In this case, the question isn’t about getting started, but about keeping going and resisting the urge to spend each day kicking back in your hammock. And this is also where obsession comes in handy. An exceptional career isn’t one that is satisfied by achieving one goal and calling it quits; instead, it involves a whole series of goals, each more audacious than the last. Having a passionate obsession means you’re not one of those people whose goal is to retire so they’ll have plenty of time for playing golf. Your goals need to be grand, driving you toward a limitless future. This is a purpose that you feel is part of your very being and makes you excited to get out of bed each morning. For example, at one point, the author owned 100 apartments, and then his goal immediately became more ambitious: to own 500. Now, as of 2016, he owns 4,500 units. Once you earn a million dollars, why not set a new goal of a billion? Start thinking of all the charitable organizations you could fund and the safety net you could provide for future generations. With endless ambitions, you can give every day the fuel that will carry you to a truly exceptional life. Now, if you imagine your post-retirement life on a golf course, your goal might be to achieve that low handicap, but then what? Before long you might end up spending the majority of the day watching TV, and then depression sets in. If you don’t want to be miserable, you need to give yourself a grand purpose that will grow along with your career. So never settle. Stay active and keep reaching for new heights. No one can predict exactly how things are going to work out. Even billionaires don’t know exactly how they're going to make their fortune. Instead, they do what you should do, which is promise ten times more than they think is possible and then force themselves and their team to find a way to deliver on that promise. So it’s important to always aim high and make promises that will make you rise to the challenge. All the major events in your life, like getting married, having a child or starting your first business require you to dive in and figure out how to swim as you go. The same principle should hold true for the goals you set for yourself and your business. You can even release products before they’re ready, especially if it means being the first on the market. Often being first is more important than being perfect, as Apple has proven time and again. Nearly every Apple product has had its fair share of flaws, but the company knows that being big, bold and innovative is more important than being delayed in beta testing. This is why Apple is considered one of the best brands ever. Another organization you should take cues from is the New England Patriots football team. When Robert Kraft took over as owner of the Patriots in 1995, they were struggling. But that didn’t stop Kraft from making bold promises to win the Super Bowl. This inspired the players to give 110 percent each season and each game, and now they’ve won five Super Bowls since Kraft came on board. Not only that, the Patriots franchise is worth $3.2 billion, and some of the best seats sell for $500 and corporate boxes for $500,000. Just like the players, the fans are inspired to believe their team is going to go far every year. As these examples show, it’s good business practice to promise the moon and have the confidence that a plan will fall into place. While pushing the envelope can be a driving force for success, it is also guaranteed to create some fear. But don’t let this stop you. Fear needs to be understood and embraced since it goes hand in hand with success. Fear comes in two main flavors: fear of rejection and fear of failure, and both must be dealt with if you want to succeed. In 2008, J.K. Rowling addressed the graduating class at Harvard University. She said what makes you great in life is being brave enough to fail. So if you never fail, you will never live. Rowling speaks from experience. She received 12 rejection letters before the first Harry Potter book was finally accepted by a publisher. And it went on to sell around twelve million copies. If she had let the fear of failure stop her, Harry Potter might not exist today, which is unthinkable! So go ahead and let yourself feel afraid, and know that it’s OK because it means you’re pushing yourself and moving forward. If you don’t feel fear from time to time, it might mean you’re getting comfortable and becoming a big fish in a small pond, which should be avoided since it means you’re not growing. If you feel you’re stagnating, it might mean you need to move to a bigger pond. Perhaps it’s time to open a new branch in another city or explore new business partnerships that will expose you to a new market? When it comes to beating the competition, fear can also be useful. Embracing fear is all about having the right mind-set, and it’s one that can give you a psychological advantage. For the author, the biggest breakthrough came following the 2008 economic collapse. At the time, everyone was scared about the future, so he decided to use this fear as an incentive to be more aggressive in making sales and more public appearances. So, while others were running scared, he began to expand into more markets, which paid off rather nicely. Whatever your fears may be, success is always going to be measured in growth. This means the smart thing to do is to put your profits and excess energy into expansion. With this strategy, you’ll have the best chance of cornering the market. This strategy also means you should view spending as much more important than saving. Think of it this way: Money that isn’t being used isn’t very useful, is it? The only money that matters is money that is helping you grow. This also makes good tax sense. While profits are always taxed, money that’s re-invested in your company is usually not taxed, making these dollars more valuable at the end of the day. So it’s wise to always be on the lookout for growth and investment opportunities, including new markets to expand into and new avenues to explore. The author recommends spending 30 to 40 percent of your profits on expansion opportunities. But if those expansion opportunities are proving hard to find, then the next best thing is to spend that money on publicity. Generally speaking, money spent on marketing, advertising and social media is never wasted. When publicity works and you become a household name, those previously elusive expansion opportunities will soon be knocking at your door. Whatever you do, don't try to be a “one-man show.” Being a leader means guiding your team to success, and often this means having a very big team, such as Amazon’s staff of over 200,000, or Apple and Microsoft, with their 100,000-strong teams. Currently, around 75 percent of US companies are what the author would call a one-man show, and when you average out their annual profit, it’s a meager $44,000. The author learned the limits of this approach the hard way, spending ten years trying to do it all himself until he realized that being in charge means knowing how to delegate and hire people who help you earn money. That’s when Cardone started employing a lot of people, and the company really began to grow. With great success comes opposition. It’s just the way business works. But since you can anticipate competitors and critics you can also prepare yourself. Today’s social media landscape offers haters plenty of avenues to pick on you, but the best way to deal with their presence isn’t to try and shut them up – it’s to be thankful for the attention. Think of it this way: the more haters you have, the more successful you are. There’s an old saying that “there’s no such thing as bad publicity,” and in this case, haters can indeed be used as free publicity. When someone criticises you, they see you as a leading force in the market. No one picks on an insignificant business. Only those who are important are seen as worthy of trolls and vehement criticism. To put it another way: If you have millions of Twitter users hating on you, there’s a chance you could become the next president! Haters also have the added benefit of making us more resilient. Think back to all those bullies over the years. For better or worse, they did play a role in making you the person you are today. Whether it was the jocks or mean girls who picked on you in high school, the bank manager who didn’t approve your loan, or the anonymous troll who’s calling you a capitalist pig, they might be a pain in the ass but they can also help you to form a thicker skin and fuel your passion to prove them wrong. If used wisely, the words of haters can even result in you making some adjustments and creating a better product. However, it’s not just haters that can stand between you and your obsession. Sometimes, members of your own team can be the ones holding you back, and in the next blink, we’ll look at how best to manage problematic employees and create a company-wide culture of obsession. Which would you consider more important for generating profits, being nice or being effective? Hopefully, you chose the second option since it’s a fact of business that, from time to time, you need to make unpopular decisions in order to maintain leadership and ensure that everyone is staying on track. The best way to maintain control of your staff and business is to control the conversation – literally. Everyone on your team should be aware that you are both listening and observing them at all times. This means listening in on their sales calls to make sure your team is as aggressive and passionate about moving product as you would be if you were making the calls yourself. If someone isn’t up to your standards, or if the client isn’t properly advised, it’s perfectly acceptable to enter the conversation and set things straight. There are other ways to make your team aware that you recognize good work and are personally engaged in every aspect of the business. The author makes a habit of sending personal messages of gratitude to the individual workers who put all their effort into their work. Even if he’s thousands of miles from the office, he’ll record a video on his phone and send it to the team. Honest, personal touches like this will ensure total commitment. But your control really starts by being ruthless when it comes to hiring and firing. Remember, when you hire someone an agreement is made: you pay them and treat them fairly, while they perform a certain standard of work. So, when an employee fails to hold up their part of the deal and becomes dead weight, you shouldn’t feel bad about letting them go and replacing them with someone who will do the job. These days we no longer expect to work the same job for 50 years. Most people expect to have several full-time jobs over the course of their career. Millennials are especially aware of how to take advantage of short-term contracts in order to build a varied career. It’s your job to build a team that is as obsessive and passionate about your business as you are. With this in place, success is sure to follow. The key message in this book: Being exceptional means having a growth mind-set. To truly succeed, you need to set high expectations for yourself and your company that may seem impossible. But these big goals are key to motivating a tireless workforce and propelling you toward truly exceptional results. Actionable advice: Don't waste time on tasks that aren’t fuelling your obsession. Don't let household chores eat into valuable time which would be better spent pursuing your dreams. Don’t hesitate to pay someone else to clean your car, mow your lawn or vacuum your apartment. Surely there are more important things that both suit your skill set and move your plans forward. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Benioff and Carlye Adler","summary":"Every year millions of companies are started around the world. The majority fail within a few years. Multi-billion-dollar powerhouse Salesforce.com is truly one of the exceptions. So what makes them different? All success stories begin with an idea you truly believe in and the courage to go your own way when venture capitalists give you the cold shoulder and markets are in uproar. But how do you give that fledgling idea wings? By clearly differentiating yourself from others, putting the customer at the heart of your business, and by not being afraid to pick on the big dogs, you can not only pave the way to success, you can also change an entire industry. In these blinks you’ll learn how Salesforce.com put an end to the software era; why standing out from the crowd is so important; and how you become big in Japan. Even the biggest companies in the world start off as mere ideas. But if everyone could snap their fingers and manifest those ideas, the world would be teeming with entrepreneurs. So what is it that made Marc Benioff and Salesforce.com so massively successful? Let’s start with this tip from Benioff: when you notice an idea’s potential, don’t be intimidated by it, even if it means going at it alone. The idea for Salesforce.com wasn’t the culmination of an arduous journey to seek out a grand new business concept. Benioff was on sabbatical after over ten years as vice president of Oracle when he got his inspiration while swimming with dolphins in Hawaii. Around this time, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) company Siebel Systems went public with a software solution that enabled salespeople to track leads, account information and manage contacts. However, it was expensive, flawed and high-maintenance, like many other similar solutions at the time. Benioff noted the concept and thought he could improve the software using a “Software-as-a-Service” approach, specifically through a cloud computing model, so he contacted founder Tom Siebel about his idea. However, although supportive, Siebel didn’t think it would win over a significant part of the market. But Benioff stuck to his vision and decided to go at it alone. He knew he had to think big. To draw in the best engineers for his new company, he marketed his vision as “the end of software business and technology models.” He knew that this benchmark would intrigue any skilled developer. By March 1999, he had employed three highly experienced application developers who worked with him in a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco and by that summer, Benioff had ten employees and was out-growing the apartment. To accommodate his promising company, he decided to rent an 8,000 square-foot office space at the Rincon Center. Marketing: it’s the number one way to garner attention when you’re still a growing company. If you want to see the same kind of success as Salesforce.com, you must assert yourself either against the market leader or as the new market leader from the very start. The first thing you must figure out is how you can show the public that you are unique. Just six months after Benioff founded Salesforce.com, Don Clark from the Wall Street Journal wrote a front page story on the “spawning of a new industry.” This did wonders for the company and spread awareness about the “end of software” era. Benioff knew he had to offer a clear message and inform journalists about how Salesforce.com was different from other companies. Next, Salesforce.com needed branding. And for this, Benioff hired Bruce Campbell, a legendary marketer who created the “no software” logo, which consisted of the word “software” in a red circle with a line through it. Some team members were skeptical, but Benioff felt that their concerns were overruled by the number one marketing rule – stand out from the pack. He was right: after plastering the logo all over magazines and newspapers, the campaign was recognized as the Hi-Tech Campaign of the Year by PRWeek. But it’s not enough to simply stand out from the crowd, you must also pick a fight with the biggest players. Bolstered by the positive media feedback, Salesforce.com began badgering their competitors. In one instance, they paid actors to pretend to be protesters waving “no software” signs in front of a conference for their main competitor, Siebel User Group. Every visitor was given an invitation for the Salesforce.com launch party and many of them showed up! The press revelled in this David and Goliath story, adding even more buzz to the event. As Salesforce.com expanded, they found it less necessary to concentrate on attacking their competitors. Now was the right time to really market the value of their service. One of the best ways to do exactly this is to use events wisely to maximize the viral effect. There are two important marketing strategies that result in the best sales conversions: the first are editorials, which are unbiased write-ups in the press. The second are testimonies, meaning word-of-mouth created by customers enthusing about their success stories. Rather than presenting their product to potential investors, Salesforce.com started organizing a road show in a string of cities called City Tours, with events featuring keynote speakers, customer presentations and demos. This brought potential customers, journalists and analysts together to share their experiences. This way of catering to the end user made a marked difference in the company’s marketing success. Traditional software companies chased executives who, although they controlled budgets, were less likely to use the product themselves. So Salesforce.com saw more value in celebrating their real customers. They covered events with posters of them, even incorporating them into their presentations. These events became affectionately known as “love fests,” and enabled the company to close deals with a huge 80 percent of new prospects. Lastly, the company began throwing cocktail parties instead of hosting boring product demos. As the City Tours became more popular, Benioff wasn’t convinced they could keep holding such expensive events in every city. But an East Coast salesman had an idea: he didn’t really care about the presentations, but loved the after parties, where he could mingle with customers. So how about just hosting the cocktail parties? Salesforce.com decided to test this in a small venue in New York with only 11 customers and prospects. At a tenth of the cost of a typical City Tour event, the net result was almost exactly the same. Dealing in enterprise software during the 1990s meant tailored presentations, multiple negotiations and months of expensive work. But as the internet era dawned, Salesforce.com found a far better way to deliver and improve their product: they recognized that the customers themselves should be able to evaluate it. Benioff understood that potential customers wanted to be hands-on with the software before they signed anything. So he started giving away free trials over the internet, which meant customers could try it without talking to a salesperson. This isn’t unusual today, but in 1999 it certainly wasn’t standard industry practice. The software initially cost $50 per month, so the purchase was also less risky for the customer. Salesforce.com also created “bugforce,” a scaled-down database where customers could report bugs and offer new ideas for the software. With this constant feedback from customers, they were able to rework and refine the software immediately, and respond to customers’ needs effectively. This customer-centric approach helped them more than they could have predicted when the dot-com bubble burst. The dot-com craze initially boosted a lot of sites. But in March 2001, they, as well as Salesforce.com, were hit hard. Many companies decided to leave Salesforce.com and by October 2001, the company was losing up to one and a half million dollars per month, creating critical cash flow problems. Their solution was to change from a monthly to a yearly billing plan. Although this was a more conservative approach and restricted the customers’ payment plans, over 50 percent of them agreed to it immediately. Within a year, Salesforce.com went from being in the red to making a profit, all while retaining many of their customers. This was only possible because they had earned the trust and loyalty of their customers long beforehand, and the same customers now felt secure about paying upfront. Software companies such as Oracle traditionally tailored their products for each company that used their product. But Salesforce.com focused on a single service to suit everyone. They did this partly by allowing their users to share their service over the internet. The developers at Salesforce.com used a technology model they called “multitenancy.” This acted like an apartment building where tenants split costs associated with the whole building, but every tenant still had their own lock and could decorate their apartment however they liked. At Salesforce.com, this meant the user could access the software running on the Salesforce.com servers while still working with their own data. Venture capitalists saw this as a loss of control and feared they would shed customers as a result. But this was never a problem – maintenance became easier because every user received updates or new features automatically. Besides, if they went back on the idea, how could they promote “the end of software” if they began offering exactly what they wanted to destroy? In addition to multitenancy, Salesforce.com knew they had to make things fast and simple. Before their small-scale development team started writing the code, they created core principles for the system and laid them out on a whiteboard. They concluded that the system should be fast, because salespeople needed information quickly, and if they ran into roadblocks, they would quit the service. Next, they decided their code should be as simple as possible, which would make identifying and fixing bugs easier. Their principles paid off: in the first quarter of 2009, the service had a 99.9 percent uptime and over 200 million transactions per day. One pivotal decision was to make the code public for external developers, giving them free rein to create their own applications. This was put to use by the $300-million healthcare services provider, the Schumacher Group, who used it for over 90 percent of their operational programs. Salesforce.com had now laid a solid foundation in the United States, but as the need for CRM was international, Marc Benioff was keen to expand overseas. So what should you do if you want to be internationally competitive? Choose your headquarters wisely. Salesforce.com opted for Europe first, and in order to give themselves a promising start, in 2000, they set up their headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. At this time Dublin was attractive to big companies like Oracle or Microsoft, due to the English-speaking population and the favorable tax rate of 12.5 percent. They also resolved to only hire native speakers from different countries. That way, when a customer from Germany called they would think they were speaking with someone in Germany. Although they had an office for essential office work, they conducted meetings largely from luxury hotels in London, which was possible as their software was internet-based. Using hotels for meetings projected an image of success to their clients, and it was cheaper than renting high-end offices. The company also began to tailor their marketing strategy for different markets. Salesforce’s aggressive marketing strategy was hugely effective in the United States and Europe, so now they set their sights on Asian markets, beginning with Japan. After conducting a bit of research, they recognized that they would need to approach Japan rather differently, with a significant re-think on how they positioned themselves. Japanese companies are traditionally cautious about foreign products, and look for something relatable. Salesforce.com learned this lesson from their direct sales manager, Eiji Uda. Everytime he introduced Salesforce.com to potential Japanese customers, he would throw in a few references to other growing companies like Google or Amazon, with which the Japanese were familiar. Then, when two of the biggest Japanese companies – Canon and Japan Post – started implementing Salesforce.com into their workflow, many more were happy to follow suit. Getting sufficient funds together is one of the most stressful and draining parts of setting up a business. Unfortunately, even if you’re a passionate entrepreneur, the passion alone is not enough to support your new business financially. Thankfully, though, start-up capital is often closer at hand than you might think. According to one study, 79 percent of small businesses start out with a serious lack of funds. In an attempt to avoid being one of these companies, Benioff sought out interested venture capitalists. This seemed logical for a fast-growing internet company looking to land a multi-million-dollar investment. However, no one was particularly enthused by the “no software“ model. But rather than quitting, Benioff reminded himself of all the other companies, like Starbucks and Cisco, that got turned down by venture capitalists. So Benioff went to those who believed in him: his family and friends. To his surprise, he found many people in his immediate circle who totally backed his idea. Remarkably, over five fundraising rounds he managed to raise $65 million between 1999 and 2002, much to the chagrin of the venture capitalists who had rejected his idea. If they’d made an initial investment of $1 million it would be worth one hundred times that today. Benioff also decided to focus his efforts on raising revenue and expanding Salesforce.com’s customer base, rather than streamlining the firm and chasing profitability. In 2002, Salesforce.com had the goal of becoming a one billion-dollar company, and they decided to go public. However, as the market had only just found its feet after the dot-com bubble burst, companies now had to demonstrate significant revenue. Going against convention, Salesforce.com started to audit before they went public. By December 2003, after over a year of internal preparation, Salesforce.com increased their annual revenue from $25 million to $100 million. That’s more than twice as much as other companies had achieved. Not long after, on 23 June 2004, Benioff got to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange – a personal career highlight. The key message in this book: Salesforce.com is a solid example of a company who became hugely successful by following a few key guidelines: stand by your vision; know how to position yourself in different markets; keep your customers at the center of your business; pick one product or service and do it in the best possible way; and don’t be scared of the big players. Actionable advice: Don’t let expense stop you. If you have an idea you believe in, don’t let anyone dissuade you with stories of how hard it will be to raise the money to realize it. Instead of chasing down venture capitalists, look to other means to support your idea, like people you know or institutions and organizations that can back you financially.

People stopped being hunters and started being farmers. Most decided that a life of relative comfort and predictability was better than one of risk and constant movement. You might think they made a wise move, but in fact this change led to humanity’s becoming lazier and more complacent, something that affects us to this day. How? Well take a look at any business industry, and you’ll find leaders who embody farmer mentality: people too indifferent, scared or set in their ways to change. More often than not, these people fail. There are others, however, who’ve clung to the life of the hunter; they’re quick to act, ready to be brutal and never scared to take risks. These are the people you ought to emulate. These blinks tell you all you need to know about becoming a hunter, allowing you to succeed in today’s constantly changing world. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Red Bull is a success in spite of its taste; how Volvo uses a car’s ugliness to sell it; and how Blockbuster went from the top to bankrupt in no time. Every business leader thinks they have what it takes to succeed. They’re smart enough to know what needs to be done and tenacious enough to overcome any obstacle that stands in their way.  Nonetheless, failure in business is as common as dirt. And that’s because the people at the top – especially those in fast-changing industries – frequently fall into one of the three so-called farmer traps. Farmer trap #1 refers to complacency, which develops when people rest on the laurels earned from past successes.  As an example, look at typewriter manufacturer Smith Corona, a former industry giant who became complacent and failed to adapt to the changing marketplace. In 1990, the company pulled out of a joint venture with computer giant Acer, because they believed their business was too strong to be vulnerable to market change. Three years later, Smith Corona declared bankruptcy; they’d been crushed by the emerging computer sector.  Similarly, farmer trap #2 occurs when you repeat actions that brought success in the past and expect the same outcome in the present.  Blockbuster Video is the perfect example of a business that crumbled because it fell into the Farmer Trap of repetition: in 2009, the franchise boasted 9,000 locations and 60,000 employees. But just a year later, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy: the company had failed to adapt to the streaming market, continuing to direct almost all their resources into franchising and physical media. Finally, farmer trap #3 describes a state of protectiveness. This occurs when companies set up barriers that protect the status quo and inhibit evolution. For instance, film manufacturer Kodak missed some wonderful opportunities because they were overly protective of their elite status in the analog film market. But that was a big mistake: the company’s unwillingness to invest resources into digital innovation led them to declare bankruptcy in 2012. As we’ve learned, it’s easy to fall into one of the farmer traps. But luckily, it’s also possible to avoid them by cultivating the three hunter instincts.  First, don’t be complacent; instead, be insatiable. Because insatiability – constantly scanning the horizon for the next opportunity – is the core of hunter instinct #1.  Capital One Bank is a great example of a company driven by this instinct. After the 2008 financial crisis, the bank poured their resources into innovation and experimentation. As a result, they soon boasted a billion-dollar portfolio of low-risk assets. In other words, by focusing on innovation, the bank successfully adapted to the marketplace; meanwhile, most of its competitors suffered a credit crunch.  Moving on: hunter instinct #2 rejects repetitiveness in favor of curiosity – the drive to seek out new and fresh sources of inspiration. How else will you spot new trends and develop your next business success? After all, innovation happens when people take creative mental leaps, connecting fields in ways others couldn’t have imagined. And to make those kinds of connections, you have to be curious.  Take entrepreneur Ron Finley as a prime example of this principle. For Finley, his Los Angeles neighborhood was a source of inspiration, leading him to success in a variety of fields, from fashion to urban gardening to social outreach.  Finally, hunter instinct #3 reminds us that we need to have a willingness to destroy. Instead of being overprotective and cautious, you have to be ready to abandon your safety net if you want to encounter new ideas and opportunities. In fact, the willingness to destroy is precisely what explains chef Eric Ripert’s decades-long success. He’s been able to sustain the coveted three-star Michelin rating for years and years, despite the fact that he constantly throws out old menus and starts again from scratch, fully embracing the new. So now that we know how to awaken our hunter instincts, it’s time to learn how to put them into practice. And that’s what the next blinks are all about. It’s time to put your hunter instincts into practice: there are six scenarios, or patterns of opportunity, that will allow you to spot new business models and products, giving you a serious competitive edge. Let’s start with two of these patterns: convergence and divergence. The former, convergence, is about taking advantage of market chaos to create opportunity by mixing and integrating the right trends. After all, you can create a winning idea by combining multiple services and products. For instance, the successful iPhone fitness and running app, “Zombies, Run!,” employs convergence by combining three things: GPS technology, the lucrative fitness market and the highly popular zombie trend. As you can see, combining several appealing patterns and industries is a great way of providing value to customers.  The second pattern, divergence, takes a different approach by carving out a competitive advantage through a unique perspective that diverges from the overcrowded mainstream. Designing a product that taps into compelling alternative notions like rebellion, status or luxury will allow you to stand out from the crowd.  The key to successfully pulling off the divergence approach is marketing; in order to stand out from the competition, you have to turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength. And that’s exactly what Red Bull did, becoming one of the most successful beverage brands, despite their less-than-palatable product. The company succeeded by using a savvy advertising strategy that communicated an exciting and unique brand. Ultimately, the company proved that with the right marketing plan, you can harness the power of divergence and create successful products and services that stand out. Let’s move on to the next two patterns of opportunity: Cyclicality and Redirection. These two approaches are all about harnessing the power of momentum, by doing things like, for instance, forecasting trends and figuring out how to take advantage of predictably recurring elements such as retro appeal, nostalgia, economic cycles and generational patterns.  This point speaks directly to cyclicality, which requires you to foster a sense of history that’ll allow you to look beyond the moment and anticipate what’s next. This can be a powerful way of carving out opportunity: consider the fact that all sorts of companies – liquor companies and auto manufacturers, fashion brands and food products – have managed to reinvigorate their businesses by tapping into cyclical patterns and taking advantage of nostalgia.  Just look at the success of Instagram, a product that combines nostalgia with the social media photo-sharing trend. These two simple elements are at the heart of the world-famous app, which imbues user-generated photographs with a vintage-like quality.  The next pattern, redirection, aims to channel the power of a trend or behavior by refocusing, reprioritizing or reversing it. This is essentially the art of “spin” – turning a potentially negative narrative upside down, using the momentum of a trend to your own advantage and inspiring desire for your product in the process.  Through well-crafted redirection, you can create an appealing positive narrative out of something more negative. Just look at Volvo: by using the slogan, “They’re boxy but they’re good,” the auto company launched a successful marketing campaign that drew attention to the car’s safety features. By playing up the security aspect, Volvo neutralized the car’s unpopular design and ultimately increased sales. Let’s learn about the two remaining patterns of opportunity: reduction and acceleration. These are both proven methods for finding a specific market, creating a winning business idea and becoming a better innovator, decision-maker and investor.  Reduction involves targeting niche audiences with a product or service that stands out because of its extreme simplicity. Doing this gets to the core of a business concept by using crowdsourcing and localization to remove any unneeded parts.  In other words, by identifying and then skillfully removing all the complex layers of existing products, you can create value and carve out success in a small market. And that will open up many more possibilities.  As it happens, reduction explains the wild popularity of GoPro, an easy-to-use, wide-angle, two-button camera that has proven irresistible to a specific group of consumers eager to capture their adventurous exploits.   The next pattern of opportunity, acceleration, relies on the practice of perfecting, exaggerating, reimagining or repositioning key product features as a way of differentiating yourself from the competition. To do that, you have to identify a crucial feature of an existing product or business concept which you then dramatically enhance. In other words, figure out what’s great about an idea and then accelerate it; making it bigger, faster or better will engage customers.  To that end, just look at Dyson: the brand established itself as the world standard for high-end vacuum cleaners after they refined the device to create the most powerful vacuum on the market. It took 5,127 prototypes to get there, but it was worth it: in 1991, James Dyson won the International Design Fair prize for his ultra-powerful and efficient product. Wake up your “inner hunter.” Familiarize yourself with the six patterns of opportunity. Done all that? Great! Now you can start narrowing your focus and zero in on a great business idea. Of course, finding the nugget of a successful idea is easier said than done. The key is to establish a “hunting ground” and identify a cluster of opportunity – some group of products, services or concepts that have a similar approach. Then, you use the six patterns of opportunity to reframe the central idea and make it special. But don’t limit your hunting ground by only researching and collecting ideas that are obviously similar. Instead, look beyond your immediate market to find clever approaches to similar goals. That’s the way to create something truly unique.  For instance, instead of developing a simple pop-up store concept, use convergence to launch a “Double Business.” One artist, Karl Lagerfeld, did just that when he combined a pop-up fashion shop with an art gallery.  However, no matter what industry you choose to work within, you have to be able to forecast future trends before they actually happen. Luckily, whether you’re hunting ground involves movies, fashion, tech, retail, broadcast media or food, you can use the six patterns to find future opportunities.  In the fashion field, for example, retailers like Zara and H&M have reached success by providing consumers with more choice. In fact, Zara became one of the fastest-growing retailers by both speeding up their production process – they only need 14 days to get a newly-designed product into stores – and by offering thousands of different items at any given moment.  But what’s next? By applying convergence to the fashion industry, we can predict the rise of trends like wearable technology, 3D printed clothing and more. And the firms that figure out how to capitalize on those trends now will be dominant in the future. The key message: Today’s marketplace is far more unpredictable and chaotic than ever before. To be successful in this turbulent environment, you must embrace change. Do so by awakening your inner hunter and exploiting patterns of opportunity. That way, you’ll be able to adapt quickly – to not only survive, but to thrive. Actionable advice: Cyclicality is one of the most persistent and prevalent patterns of opportunity. Whatever your field, you can take advantage of this pattern by following four simple takeaways.

In the blink of an eye, all matter, all space-time, suddenly was. Today, businesses burst into markets as our universe once burst into the void, creating unforeseen market possibilities and decimating the markets that came before. These companies are Big Bang Disruptors. Obviously, it’s best to be one of these companies, but, if that’s not possible, it’s crucial to understand the process of Big Bang Disruption. And that’s what these blinks are all about. Learn about the four-stage life cycle of disruption, and along the way, become well-acquainted with the 12 rules of disruption survival. Whether you’re plotting a big bang of your own or just trying to figure out how not to get blown away, these blinks will help you in the ever-changing multiverse that is the modern marketplace. You’ll also find out when to seek out truth-tellers; what’s probably in store for AOL; and why it’s wise to relax about strategy. Remember paper road maps? Those awkwardly large, folded sheets that once hibernated in almost every glove compartment, waiting to be consulted by turned-around motorists? Today, these unwieldy guides, with their fold creases and crackling pages, are all but extinct. Analog roadmaps went out with a bang – the big bang that was the introduction of GPS systems to the driving public. In 2000, Garmin, a company whose sales had increased throughout the 1990s, sold three million GPS devices while the sale of paper road maps began to decrease. At the time, relatively inexpensive GPS was an example of a Big Bang Disruptor: an innovative product that’s both superior to – and, usually, more affordable than – competing products on the market. But it wasn’t long before Garmin’s devices were blasted away by another big bang. In 2009, after the advent of the smartphone, Google introduced Google Maps: A service that, because it was free and easy to update, could be improved at a pace equal to modern-day needs. From the moment it hit the market, it proved to be the best and cheapest navigational technology available – and it still is. But what made it possible for Google to oust Garmin just as Garmin had ousted analog maps? Well, Google took advantage of exponential technologies. For a technology to qualify as exponential, its performance and value must have a pattern of exponential increase – doubling, for instance, on an annual or biennial basis. Cloud-based computing – data-processing or data-storage software that runs online – is one example of an exponential technology. Equipped with such technologies, a Big Bang Disruptor can upend an established market. This is exactly what Google did. In fact, Google Maps leverages the power of cloud-based computing, as well as taking advantage of the internet and smartphones. All this means that Google is able to offer Google Maps for free. Indeed, it’s now the default app on pretty much all smartphones, which guarantees that it’s used by millions of people every day. It’s hard to imagine a bigger bang than that. If you don’t want to get obliterated by the next big bang, then you should learn how to spot disruptors before the disruption begins. Luckily, this isn’t so hard to do, as all Big Bang Disruptors have three characteristics in common. First, they use undisciplined strategy. Businesses of yore tended to limit themselves to a single “market discipline.” That is, they’d conduct a considerable amount of research and do a great deal of strategizing before bringing a product to market. If the analysis indicated that the potential product wasn’t superior to, or cheaper than, competing products, then it was a no-go. Today, exponential technologies enable Big Bang Disruptors to produce cheap and superior products, allowing them to be utterly undisciplined about which market segments they enter. Furthermore, creating a new product used to be a costly undertaking. Now, it’s considerably less expensive. Because of the declining cost of creation, bringing a new product to market and seeing whether or not it does well is often more cost-effective than conducting elaborate research. In this new environment, strategic discipline is obsolete. Big Bang Disruptors are also characterized by unconstrained growth. The internet and the social networks it’s spawned have made public a mind-boggling amount of information. In most cases, it costs nothing for consumers to access the information they’re after, nor does it cost much more for companies to make direct contact with these consumers. This phenomenon is called the declining cost of information, and it’s making exorbitant marketing campaigns as nonessential as strict strategy. After all, if you’re a disruptor, it’s likely that your customers use social media and other online platforms (Yelp, for instance). They probably share your content online – not to mention their opinion of your content. This works as free advertising that companies previously had to pay for. Why dish out big bucks to disrupt a market when it’s being disrupted for you? The third characteristic to keep an eye out for is unencumbered development. Thanks to the declining cost of experimentation, it’s both simple and inexpensive for disruptors to develop a product. Just as market research is becoming a thing of the past, product experimentation is also on the way out. For example, a modern app developer wouldn’t expend funds on elaborate experiments to see whether his app is going to work or not. He’d simply release the app, and if users identify a lot of problems, or don’t use it at all, then it’s back to the drawing board. If it seems like it might be a hit, however, he can begin to iron out any problems and refine its functions. Next up, we’ll take a look at the life cycle of a Big Bang Disruptor. We live in a cyclical world. The things that are today will, at some point, no longer be. And Big Bang Disruptors are no exception. Each Big Bang Disruption goes through a four-stage life cycle. It starts with the Singularity. In physics, a singularity is a point in space-time at which matter is infinitely dense. Our universe bloomed from such a point after the big bang released all the matter and space-time that this initial singularity contained. For Big Bang Disruptors, the Singularity is the drawn-out period that comes before they enter the market. During this period, incumbent companies may start to feel uneasy – something is in the air. In the meantime, the disruptor is developing and experimenting, getting ready for the next stage. The second stage, known as the Big Bang, is the abrupt and overpowering success of the disruptor. Just as the universe came into being in mere seconds, so the success of the disruptor is solidified almost instantaneously. The right technology combined with the right business model – and bang: a market is transformed or created, and customers come flocking. Next is the Big Crunch. After the big bang, the universe’s energy began to dissipate. After a Big Bang Disruption, a similar process of dissipation begins. Soon, the market is saturated, and the company’s value, which initially spiked tremendously, begins to even out and taper off. Then comes Entropy, the fourth stage of a Big Bang Disruption. According to the big bang theory, the universe will someday implode and collapse. But matter and energy won’t just vanish when this happens. Rather, they’ll combine with one another to take on new forms. The same thing happens at the end of a Big Bang Disruption’s life cycle. Assets, instead of disappearing, come together – presenting new opportunities for experimentation and development and leading to new Singularities. In the remaining blinks, we’ll look at each of the 12 rules you can follow to survive the blast of a Big Bang Disruption. If you sense that a company has entered the Singularity stage, your best defense against the impending market explosion is to simply play along and get ready to do some disrupting of your own. Doing this is a matter of following three rules. First off, hunt down and talk to the inquisitive individuals who’ve taken the time to gain an expert-level understanding of your industry. These people – we’ll call them truth-tellers – will be able to help you forecast how emerging technologies and cutting-edge strategies may affect the industry’s future landscape. Kevin Ashton, a British tech pioneer famous for coining the term “the Internet of Things,” is a paragon of truth-telling savvy. While working with Procter & Gamble, the consumer-products manufacturer, Ashton realized that scanner systems failed to indicate whether advertised products were actually in stock. He figured there had to be emerging technologies that could remedy this problem, and, after some research, hit upon an innovative method for establishing wireless connections between inventory networks. This, and other product management breakthroughs led to Ashton working with various start-ups and tech institutions, such as MIT, where he continued to develop his ideas. He’s precisely the sort of truth-teller you should seek to consult before market disruption begins. Rule number two is to intelligently time your entrance into an emerging market. Consider how Jeff Bezos, the cofounder and CEO of Amazon, timed the launch of the Kindle. Rather than jumping right into the e-reader market, Bezos held back, watching as other companies failed to satisfy customers with their products. He then identified the product’s shortcomings – insufficient storage or short battery life for instance – that had led to these failures. This enabled him to produce a superior product and perfectly time its release. When the Kindle hit the market in 2007, it sold out in a matter of hours, despite costing $399. Now, the third rule: conduct experiments that’ll increase your understanding of how to stay abreast of market disruptors. You might consider attending a hackathon, for instance. At these events, computer programmers and other people, usually those in the tech-industry, converge and collaborate on software-related projects. The authors attended one such event in 2013. Sponsored by AT&T, the hackathon focused on devising new ideas for smartphone apps that would assist people with autism. The event not only resulted in multiple app ideas, but it exposed the authors to mobile industry leaders. Boom. The Big Bang hits – and everything is changing, fast. Old markets are abandoned as customers are drawn to the new one like iron filings to an all-powerful magnet. You’ve survived the Singularity, and, luckily, you’re part of this new market. That means it’s time to start following the next three rules. At this point, you’ve got to start thinking about how to keep your company alive, because the other disruptors will be experiencing catastrophic success – catastrophic to your business, that is. The fourth rule is to be prepared for this. That means having everything in place: strategy, systems, inventory, human resources and anything else that seems necessary. After the Big Bang, when the orders and new customers flood in, you won’t have time to deal with such things. Consider making agreements with third parties prior to the market’s disruption. That way, you’ll have people on hand if you need to outsource work. The fifth rule is to do your best to seize winner-take-all markets. To create a winner-take-all market, and be the one who wins it, you’ve got to exploit all the information at your disposal. Today, this is easier to do than ever before. Thanks to the internet, a wealth of extremely specific information is available to you. Take Amazon as an example. The way it collects and uses information has ensured its dominance in multiple markets. Amazon not only considers reviews from customers and professionals alike; it runs all customer-activity data through an algorithm that’s specifically designed to generate customer-specific product recommendations. Rule number six is to slow the disruption down so you have time to think and respond to the torrent of whizz-bang changes. Like Neo, the bullet-dodging protagonist of the sci-fi film The Matrix, you’ve got to be able to enter your own sort of bullet time. This will help you make your own moves even as the market is being disrupted. If your company is an incumbent, you can slow down future onslaughts with patents. By laying claim to the legal rights of potentially disruptive innovations – be it a service, product or simply an idea – you’ll build a roadblock, albeit a temporary one, in the path of future disruptors. During the Big Bang, market disruptors will generate a great deal of value and profit. As one of them, you’ll be feeling pretty optimistic. But remember, even during this exciting ascent you should prepare for decline. The next stage in the disruption life cycle is never far off. When the Big Crunch begins, the disrupted market will reach saturation point, and all your inventory and capacity could become useless. To avoid this fate, follow the seventh rule: anticipate saturation. What’ll happen if you don’t? Well, here’s a cautionary tale: The Nook, an e-reader produced by Barnes & Noble, got off to an auspicious start, selling roughly 60,000 units in one year. Encouraged by this success, the bookseller continued production. But then the Big Crunch hit. Amazon released a new version of the Kindle, and a new array of e-reading apps were launched. In this saturated market, Nooks were no longer wanted. By 2013, Barnes & Noble had suffered more than $130 million in losses – all thanks to excess inventory. Rule number seven dovetails nicely with rule number eight: it’s also about anticipating decline, and it states that you should dispose of assets before they become worthless or impractical. Your assets are all the things your company possesses that aren’t your product, such as equipment and properties. If the market is on the verge of disruption, then it’s time to dispose of some of these assets before they depreciate in value and become liabilities. Nike dealt with this problem by outsourcing much of its production. Outsourcing is a great way to cut back on assets; after all, if someone is producing your product for you, then you don’t need to own a factory. This makes Nike, which has roughly 900 foreign partners, mostly in Asia, extremely lean. The ninth and final rule to follow during the Big Crunch is to get out while the getting is good. This isn’t always the ideal solution, but if you can’t compete, it’s better to cut your losses and move on – whether that means discontinuing a line of products or getting out of business entirely. Philips Lighting, the Dutch technology company, discontinued one of its best-selling light bulbs in 2006. Though it’d been profitable since 1891, the incandescent bulb was, the company knew, becoming outmoded. It produced a great deal of heat, and better products were already visible on the horizon. Even though the product’s track record was great, and more than a century long, Philips made the right choice and got out. So you made it through the Big Crunch. But now you’ve got to survive the final stage in the Big Bang Disruption life cycle: Entropy. There are three rules that’ll help you do this. The first – rule number ten – is to avoid black holes. After being disrupted, a market can soon turn into a black hole, as customers leave and take their business to the new market created by the big bang. Now, it’s possible to survive in a black hole market. A few customers will probably remain, and, if intelligently scaled, the business can stay afloat. But it’s usually only a matter of time before the market vanishes entirely. For instance, the internet-service provider America Online, or AOL, exists in a black hole market. Their remaining customers are mostly elderly individuals unaware that they can access the internet without subscribing to AOL. Sooner or later, these customers will be brought up to speed by their children or grandchildren, or they’ll simply die off. Rather than trying to survive in a black hole, it’s wiser to take your business apart and use old products for new purposes. That’s what rule eleven advises. Texas Instruments, an electronics producer, did just that. In the 1980s, the company had a firm and profitable position in the home-computer market. But as competition stiffened it began to suffer losses. Soon Texas Instruments was on the verge of bankruptcy with a deficit of around $500 million. So it scrapped this part of the business, shifting its focus to the production of a single processing component. Though initially intended to serve as part of a toy, this component is now used in a wide range of electronic devices, from smartphones to radars, robots to CT scanners. The twelfth and final rule is the boldest of them all: try to restart the Big Bang Disruption life cycle by finding a new Singularity. Remember that AT&T-sponsored hackathon that sought to develop smartphone apps to assist people with autism? Well, AT&T wasn’t simply being benevolent and big-hearted. By investing time and money in the event, the company gained access to a crucial group – people who might turn out to be market disruptors. By having programmers and hackers use its networks and accessories, AT&T laid claim to the apps and innovations that emerged from the event. It’s this sort of strategizing that’ll put you in a position to jumpstart the next Singularity. The key message in these blinks: Today’s innovators are in a prime position to introduce products and services that are both cheaper and better than ever before. Such innovators are called Big Bang Disruptors, and they make use of exponential technologies – things like the internet, cloud-based computing and smartphones – to break into and disrupt markets. If you don’t want to get incinerated in the next big bang, then you’ve got to understand the life cycle of Big Bang Disruption and follow the 12 rules that’ll help you live through it.  Got feedback?

Drop-outs. 4/20 and Bob Marley. When you think of marijuana, what comes to mind? Few think of the cultivation and sale of Cannabis sativa as a legitimate and legal business, yet with the decriminalization of marijuana in many U.S. states, that’s just what it’s become. In fact, with the right strategy, a budding entrepreneur can make it big in the pot business. Based on the experiences of entrepreneur Christian Hageseth, these blinks tell the story of one man’s foray into the world of weed and shows how you too can turn kind bud into green cash. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you can’t sell bud and expect a bank to give you a business account; why there’s more to product research than just smoking up; how learning the facts about marijuana will make you a better businessperson. In the 1920s in the United States, the federal government prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol. Yet Prohibition was a disaster; the greater public flaunted the law at every turn and the government lost millions in tax revenue. The laws were eventually repealed. Today, marijuana is America’s bathtub gin. While many law enforcement officials continue to demonize pot, public support for the decriminalization of marijuana has been steadily rising.   Despite prolific warnings over the dangers of using drugs, it’s clear that the so-called war on drugs in America has been a failure. Not only have thousands of people been incarcerated for essentially non-violent crimes but also drug policies have destroyed families and lives. Yet the benefits of a drug like marijuana are many. It can act as powerful medicine to ease the suffering of the chronically ill, for example. Proponents thus say pot should be made legally available to such groups. Why deny chemotherapy patients medicine that could ease their suffering? Separately, politicians have started to understand just how much money can be made from legalizing the sale of marijuana. In the few U.S. states where the drug is now legal, tax revenue is filling state coffers. In 2009 alone, Colorado, a western state that has led the charge for legalization, collected some $3 million in taxes, fees and associated costs. Public pressure, combined with the backing of select politicians, has led to huge changes in marijuana policy. While many states have passed statutes allowing marijuana only for medical use, states like Colorado also have legalized pot for recreational purposes. This more liberal attitude toward marijuana is sure to increase, giving rise to a “new world of marijuana.” Yet rather than being a business controlled by gangsters and drug cartels, it will be a normal industry with brands, business strategies and tax accountants. Attitudes to marijuana in the United States have relaxed in recent years. But this doesn’t mean that everyone believes that it should be legalized; many think drugs across the board are dangerous. Why has this negative opinion of marijuana persisted in society? One of the main issues with regard to legalization is that after so many years of being classified as an illegal drug, marijuana is still associated with street crime and criminals. If you ever used marijuana or had friends who did, the likelihood that they purchased it on the street from a dealer is high. And the fear persists that marijuana is a “gateway” drug. If you buy drugs from criminals, what’s to stop you from accessing and experimenting with other, more dangerous, drugs? These are some of the main reasons why so many people still campaign against legalization. The author himself ran into this when he set up his own, legal marijuana business.   Many friends and business associates were skeptical. After all, they said, wasn’t marijuana just a vice for stoners and criminals? Interestingly, marijuana’s inclusion on the list of illegal substances was actually done for political reasons. Even though marijuana has been a part of human society for hundreds of years, in the twentieth century, political forces found reasons to curb its use. (A marijuana pipe was found even in the gardens of legendary playwright William Shakespeare!) Politicians, looking for a scapegoat for societal problems and eager to protect their own economic interests, worked to ban marijuana. They believed that criminalizing the drug and disseminating anti-marijuana propaganda was a vote-winning and money-making tactic. What is more surprising is that such campaigns continued despite growing scientific research that clearly showed marijuana wasn’t the societal evil it was billed as. In 1972, a Senate commission report revealed that marijuana did not in fact lead to physical dependence. What’s more, the overwhelming majority of people who used marijuana did not then move on to other harder drugs. This report was, however, ignored. Since marijuana has for so long been illegal, early attempts to profit from legalization have been unorthodox, to say the least. Many marijuana sellers simply find a shop, buy some stock and try to sell it. And most fail. Achieving success in the pot business requires you to think exactly how you would in any other business niche. You need to come up with an effective business strategy. The author began his business with a clear goal in mind: to make marijuana America’s new consumer product, branded and marketed intelligently. In addition to marketing, you will also need to keep tight controls on the growing process. Marijuana plants aren’t easy to cultivate, as they require lots of light. Yet lots of light leads to heat and humidity, which is actually bad for the plants. So it makes sense to purchase an air conditioning system for your grow space. This in turn amounts to a great deal of energy use! To lower your energy costs, the best approach is to think in broad terms from the outset. One large air conditioning unit costs less to run than a number of smaller ones. To make a large unit worth the expense, however, you need to invest in a lot of plants. The author found this out the hard way. After three failed harvests, he increased his production size and found just the right balance for success. Since marijuana is still treated with suspicion, as a pot entrepreneur you need to work on creating a culture in which it’s more normalized and accepted. The author learned this firsthand after a trip to the Netherlands, where drug laws are harsher than in the United States but the culture more accepting of marijuana use. So you’re ready to light up and be a marijuana entrepreneur. Think about how great it would be to sit around and “test” your product, all day! Not so fast. Before you inhale, consider your business. You need to inform yourself about every single aspect of the market if you want to stand any chance of actually making a profit. First, learn as much as you can about your product. Marijuana can be used in many different ways. Although smoking is the most well-known method, it isn’t really the best. Inhaling the smoke of burning plant material means toxins are going directly into your lungs. Some better alternatives include vaporizers, which heat up the pot until the plant’s cannabinoids become airborne and can be inhaled. Another alternative is to bake the drug into cookies or other food items, for a delayed effect. However, this is harder to dose. Next, get to know your market. Create a brand to market your product effectively. As in any industry, if you want to sell successfully and keep customers coming back, you need to have a ubiquitous, trusted brand. The author created his own brand, Green Man Cannabis. With the desire of becoming the market leader in the industry, he took care to brand every area of his business effectively. Finally, you need to understand your customers. The author’s goal is to introduce marijuana to a wider audience while at the same time demystifying the product. To that end, he’s building a large-scale marijuana growth facility to educate others. The Green Man Cannabis Ranch, which will include a terrace, atrium, open greenhouse and a shop, will be a place where customers can better understand his brand and his product. And once you’ve put in the hours and work to grow your business in a smart way, sure – go ahead and kick back occasionally and enjoy the benefits of your product! The legal marijuana business is a business like any other. But there is one area in which legal marijuana sellers are actually prevented from participating in what should be normal business practices. While most business owners can open a bank account to safely store their profits, legal marijuana business owners cannot. As marijuana is still illegal in many U.S. states and according federal statutes, and any money deposited in U.S. banks is backed by the federal government, the feds can deny anyone involved in an industry they deem illegal from holding or depositing funds in a bank account. For those involved in the legal marijuana businesses, this is a real headache. Cold hard cash is your currency for almost everything, including paying for electricity and gas – even your taxes. It’s time-consuming as well as risky, as you’ll be carrying serious amounts of cash around with you often. It will probably take some time to overcome such discrimination on both on the state and federal level toward those in the legal marijuana industry. Police officers, politicians and judges were taught almost all their life that marijuana is bad. Thus it may be a while before these groups will be able to let go of their prejudices, even when marijuana is legalized. Keeping marijuana illegal however causes more problems than it solves. The so-called war on drugs has massively increased the number of law enforcement agencies and prisons around the country. Some 800,000 Americans annually are arrested and sentenced for marijuana crimes, which begs the question of how prisons are able to cope with all these inmates. Unfortunately, the criminalization of marijuana and all drugs is also a business for many industries, and powerful lobbies have an interest to keep things they way they are. So if you plan to get into the legal marijuana business, be prepared to face a number of obstacles. The legal marijuana business is still in its early days, yet with time, it will flourish while also changing significantly. The tobacco industry is now barred from selling legal marijuana, but this won’t always be the case. Big agriculture at some point will get involved, industrializing cultivation quickly. Thus the days when you’ll be able to pick up a pack of marijuana cigarettes at the corner store are probably not so far away! But whether that pack will be natural and organic is another question. The forces of capitalism will not be long in molding this nascent industry, as larger, better capitalized firms buy out smaller, local dispensaries and push national brands. A comeback for hemp is also a possibility. German car manufacturers BMW and Mercedes-Benz use hemp for car door panels; this is coming soon to the United States. As hemp becomes more ubiquitous, marijuana’s bad rep may also fade. And although decent-quality pot will be readily available for consumers in this expanded market, serious connoisseurs may seek out higher-quality products – another business opportunity. Today’s pot is far stronger than the weed groovy kids were smoking at Woodstock in the 1960s. Marijuana then contained about three percent THC (pot’s psychoactive component) compared with up to 25 percent today. We probably won’t see a trend for stronger marijuana, but instead for consistently dosed servings. We know that one ounce of vodka has the same alcoholic effect as five ounces of wine and 12 ounces of beer, for example. One joint, however, can’t be compared to another. This will certainly change, if not just to make recreational use more measurable and predictable. Finally, we will also see a change in U.S. federal policy. While legalization today is not a top federal priority, with greater demand and a need for increased tax revenues, the call for legalization will grow. The key message in this book: The push to legalize marijuana will continue to evolve in the United States. Already, the public’s perception of marijuana culture has changed for the better; law enforcement too is grappling with new attitudes and newer laws. As marijuana becomes a serious and legal business opportunity, society may take a more accepting and constructive look at how to market and use the drug responsibly.  Actionable advice: Consider what a marijuana tax could do for your town. The next time you’re involved in a discussion on legalization, think about the dollars and cents of both sides of the argument. Are the associated costs of keeping marijuana illegal greater or less than the benefits your community could reap were it to collect taxes on legal marijuana use?

Fast-forward just two decades to the present day, and none of those companies is in the top five anymore. They’ve been replaced by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. In the intervening time, the world economy has come to be dominated by giant tech companies such as these. The 150 most valuable tech companies in Silicon Valley alone are valued at an astounding $3.5 trillion. Many tech companies have grown from scrappy start-ups to corporate giants in just a few years. Amazon, Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Uber, Snapchat, PayPal, LinkedIn, eBay – the list goes on and on. What are the secrets of this phenomenal growth? One of the main ones can be summed up in a single word: blitzscaling. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the heck the word “blitzscaling” means; why fortune favors the bold in the modern economy; and how one of the keys to making money is often losing money. “Blitzscaling” is a recently invented word, so if you’re not sure what it means, you’re in good company! The easiest way to define “blitzscaling” is to break it down into its components: “blitz” and “scaling.” In German, “blitz” means lightning. In modern English, it’s become an informal way to describe what happens when an organization tries to achieve something at lightning speed. For example, if a company suddenly floods the airwaves with a full-throttle advertising campaign, it would be a “marketing blitz.” “Scaling,” in turn, is shorthand for “scaling up.” In business, that means two things. First, it means growing a company in a way that keeps all of its parts proportional to each other as it develops. That’s important, because to sell more products or services, a company needs to expand its infrastructure, resources and labor force, and they have to keep pace with each other for the growth to be sustainable. For instance, imagine you’re a kid with a lemonade stand, and you want to expand your empire. To sell more lemonade, you need to invest in additional booths, lemons, cups and workers. If you try to expand in just one of these areas, the expansion won’t be sustainable. After all, if you run out of cups, it won’t matter how many lemons you can squeeze! If you manage to avoid this problem and your lemonade empire spreads to every block of the city, you’ve achieved “scaling” in the second sense of the term: your company is operating on a massive scale! Put those ideas together, and you have a first approximation of what “blitzscaling” means: it’s business growth that’s not only very rapid, but also proportional, and therefore sustainable. It’s what happened when Amazon went from having 151 employees and $5.1 million in revenue in 1996 to having 7,600 employees and $1.64 billion in revenue in 1999 – a 50-fold increase in employees and a 322-fold increase in revenue, all in just three years! But there’s a caveat we need to add to our definition. Every company seeks to grow, and every successful company grows. If “blitzscaling” only meant growing rapidly and sustainably, it would be just another word for impressive business success. While blitzscaling involves rapid, sustainable growth, there’s more to it than that. We’ll find out what the missing ingredients are in the next blinks. The word “blitz” has an unfortunate but instructive history. It goes back to the German word “blitzkrieg,” which means “lightning war.” This became the name of a military strategy that the German military implemented during World War II. Inspired by British military thinkers and later adopted by the Allies, this strategy represented a radical shift in how militaries approached warfare. In the past, they would advance slowly and cautiously into enemy territory, aiming to secure their supply lines and paths of retreat before moving forward. With blitzkrieg, in contrast, an army would advance swiftly and decisively, hoping to take the enemy by storm. This strategy involves significant risks; the attacking army might run out of supplies or be cut off from retreat. But the potential reward of overwhelming the enemy often outweighs these risks. Blitzscaling also involves throwing caution to the wind. Indeed, embracing uncertainty and risk is the word’s third defining component. Like an army of the past, a traditional company would seek to secure its position on the business battlefield (a market) before advancing to expand its territory (its market share). For instance, if an American company wanted to expand overseas, it would typically set up an office in one country, wait for it to establish itself, set up another office in a second country, wait again and so on. A blitzscaling company, in contrast, charges full-steam ahead. For example, between 2011 and 2012, Airbnb’s number of international offices rapidly grew from zero to nine. This is very risky, and it would have been much safer for Airbnb to take the traditional approach. After all, if you’ve already slowly but steadily established eight international offices one-by-one, you can feel pretty confident about the ninth. But for Airbnb, the traditional approach wasn’t an option. They had a German competitor named Wimdu hot on their heels, copying their business model. If they’d waited to have all of their ducks in a row before expanding, they’d probably have been too late; Wimdu would have conquered the international market before Airbnb’s arrival. So they took a gamble – and it paid off. They nipped the Wimdu threat in the bud, which led to a ten-fold increase in Airbnb’s bookings. Traditional businesses prioritize the efficient use of capital; they seek to get the most bang out of each buck at their disposal. A coffee shop, for example, is spending wisely when it buys its paper cups in bulk – a big box of cups only costs a few dollars but it enables hundreds of future sales. But blitzscaling companies do things differently, prioritizing speed over efficiency. That’s why local taxi companies shudder when a peer-to-peer ridesharing company like Uber rolls into town. Traditionally, a company trying to grab some of its competitors’ market share might try to undercut them by lowering its own prices. This could be balanced out by lowering production costs – but that’s a long, difficult process that might only allow for a very small price drop anyway. So what does a blitzscaling company like Uber do? It drops prices so low that they don’t even cover costs – a strategy that, for traditional businesses, would amount to corporate suicide. But Uber can afford to do this because it has a huge advantage – a war chest of billions of dollars in investment capital, and no compunction about using it to its advantage. This allows Uber to lose money for the sake of conquering a new market as quickly as possible. It’s a risky strategy, but one that can offer a big payoff in the form of first-scaler advantage. First-scaler advantage goes to the company that is first to scale up and dominate its business ecosystem. Once a company has done that, it becomes incredibly hard to compete against, making competition in today’s economy, especially in the tech industry, increasingly a winner-take-all sprint to the finish line. Think back to the early years of online social networking, when Facebook, MySpace and Friendster were all competing for dominance. Now, when’s the last time you used MySpace or Friendster? That’s because Facebook successfully scaled up. Uber’s strategy is to aggressively expand, city by city, and its prioritization of speed over efficiency allows it to dominate new markets quickly and gain first-scaler advantage. Another advantage that blitzscaling companies enjoy is the ability to leverage the increasingly networked nature of our world. We'll explore that in the next blink. Growth factors are things that can boost the growth of a company, and there are four that every blitzscaling company should seek to maximize: network effects, market size, distribution and high gross margins. The first, network effects, can be a huge boost to any company scrambling to gain first-scaler advantage. Essentially, “network effects” occur when a network’s value increases for users as more people begin using it. Consider Airbnb. The more that people offer their properties on the company’s website, the more it becomes the go-to marketplace for guests seeking homestays. And the more that guests flock to the marketplace, the more people want to offer their properties on it. Network effects create a positive feedback loop. Because of this feedback loop, a start-up company wanting to compete with Airbnb will have their work cut out for them. Since its rapid, network-effect-powered growth allowed Airbnb to seize the homestay market’s first-scaler advantage, Airbnb has a virtually insurmountable head start on all would-be competitors. Where there’s a network – and networks are all around us these days – there’s the potential for a network effect, a fact that many tech companies have used to gain success. Uber, Airbnb and eBay connect buyers and sellers of goods and services to massive marketplace networks. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter connect people into multimillion- or even multibillion-user (in the case of Facebook) social networks. YouTube connects video creators and consumers into the world’s most popular entertainment network. And then there’s the granddaddy network of them all: the internet itself, along with the network of more than two billion smartphone users who can access that network anytime, anywhere. Of course, that network is also a resource that tech companies are eager to tap into. For them, it represents the ultimate marketplace, open 24/7 and located everywhere at once without the need for expensive brick-and-mortar shops. Of course, potential customers don’t necessarily equate to sales. For that, you need people who are willing and able to buy – in other words, a market. That’s the idea behind market size as a growth factor. For a company to blitzscale, its market needs to be sizable. Otherwise, there just won’t be enough money to fuel or motivate its funding and growth. Gross margins are a pretty simple concept. They’re a measure of how much money your business takes in after costs are covered. Let’s say that your product costs you $0.50 to produce and sell. That’s your cost of goods sold, or COGS. Then you sell the product for $0.75 per unit – that’s your revenue. Well, $0.75 revenue minus a $0.50 COGS equals $0.25 – that’s your gross margin, the money you have in the bank after each sale. It’s distinct from profit, since you might use it to cover other expenses like taxes. It’s important though because it’s a ready source of funding for any new initiative you might want to pursue, from expanding your operations to developing a new product line. And when you want to rapidly grow your company to a massive scale, high gross margins become crucial. Gross margin is usually represented as a percentage, calculated by dividing it by revenue. Dividing our $0.25 gross margin by $0.75 in revenue, then, gives a gross margin of 33 percent. That’s higher than General Electric’s margin of 27 percent. But most tech-industry giants have gross margins that start at 60 percent and can be as high as 90 percent. Google’s is 61 percent, and Facebook’s is 87 percent. High gross margins give you more than money. They also make it easier for you to fund expansion, because the higher they are, the more investors will notice you. Imagine that company A has a gross margin of 66 percent, while Company B’s is 33 percent. That means that B brings in half as much money per sale as A, and has to generate twice as many sales just to end up with the same amount of cash. That’s going to require more resources, more infrastructure and more workers than its competitor – not just for manufacturing, but for things like handling customer service phone lines for twice as many customers. To investors, it’s clear that A has a much better chance of growing than B and, because of this, they’ll choose to invest in the former. This leads to another positive feedback loop: with more investment capital to spend on expanding its operations, A will grow even more easily than B. When investors see that growth, even more of their money will flow A’s way, leading to yet more growth. Thus, high gross margins allow companies to accumulate the massive war chests of capital required to pursue growth on the equally massive scale of blitzscaling – and, as we’ll see, tech companies have a natural advantage when it comes to achieving high gross margins, and therefore attracting capital. You might have a brilliant product and a well-defined market clamoring for it, but getting it into the hands of customers isn’t just a technicality. Distribution is also a growth factor, and distributing a product or service on a massive scale can happen in two ways. The first is using a distribution network that already exists, like the US Postal Service (USPS). Netflix tapped into this when it launched its original rent-a-DVD-by-mail service. Amazon takes advantage of it, too, striking a deal with USPS that allows it to ship small packages for only about $1 each. The other method is viral distribution. First, you infect one customer, then she infects more customers. Each of them infects even more customers, and so forth and so on. There are two kinds of viral distribution, organic and incentivized, and the early days of PayPal provide an example of both. Back then, every time a buyer wanted to send a payment via PayPal, the seller had to set up a PayPal account to receive it. This organic viral distribution naturally led to more users of the service. PayPal’s incentivized distribution, meanwhile, actively provided users with an incentive to spread its service: get a friend to sign up for it, and both you and your friend receive $10 each. Combining these two varieties of viral distribution, PayPal was able to grow at an astonishing rate of between 7 and 10 percent per day. Imagine, then, the kind of growth that’s possible when there isn’t a need for physical distribution, nor for the infrastructure, resources and workers that distribution centers entail. To do without such things, you’ve got to go digital. Consider a software company whose demand doubles overnight. To meet that demand and double sales, the company will need…nothing. It costs essentially zero to duplicate a piece of software that merely needs to be copied from one set of circuits to another. But digital companies aren’t only extremely scalable; they also enjoy high gross margins. Because they can easily plug into the internet and its online marketplace networks, digital companies can reap all the rewards of network effects and gain access to large markets for their products. These perks, combined with ease of product duplication, are a perfect recipe for excellent gross margins. That’s why so many successful examples of blitzscaling come from the tech industry; having a digital product and service allows companies to take advantage of all four of blitzscaling’s growth factors. It also helps minimize the two big growth limiters – both of which we’ll explore in the remaining blinks. To generate the level of sales and revenue that blitzscaling requires, you need to identify a good market and offer a product that satisfies that market – in other words, you’ve got to achieve product/market fit. This fit is the first of two growth limiters that blitzscaling companies need to watch out for. The greater the product/market fit, the greater the chance of rapid growth. But immediately achieving perfect product/market fit isn’t easy. To improve the fit, most companies have to adjust their product to make it better suit the market’s demands. It’s easier for a tech company to be nimble with regard to product/market fit, of course; tinkering by bringing out a new version of software or testing out a new app feature requires less infrastructure than redoing a physical commodity. You just have to edit some code, not buy new machinery. Tech companies can also pivot much more easily than companies with a physical product, switching from trying to achieve one product/market fit to another. Consider PayPal. In its first year of operation (originally under the name of Confinity), it went through four pivots – shifting its service from cell-phone encryption to cell-phone payments, then to PalmPilot payments, then to email payments and finally to eBay transactions. Now imagine that you’ve achieved an ideal product/market fit and generated high demand, but you haven’t got the mass-production capabilities to fulfill that demand. You’re losing out on potential sales, which means you’ll need to scale up your operations to get to the necessary level of mass production. Navigating the challenges of the second growth limiter of blitzscaling, operational scalability, can make or break a company. This limiter isn’t as daunting for tech companies, which rely less on physical infrastructure. But even a digital-only company has some physical infrastructure to expand in order to scale up – and failure to do this can be devastating. For example, remember Friendster? It was a serious contender for the social network crown, the first of its kind to break through into the mainstream. Friendster went viral in 2003, gaining millions of users in just a few months. But the company’s computer servers couldn’t keep up with the demand, with users waiting up to 40 seconds for the website to load. Within two years, a speedier competitor called MySpace had left Friendster in the dust. The challenges of scaling up are complex – and they become increasingly complex as a company grows. Consider just one of the challenges: company organization. If you start a company with three friends, organization can be pretty informal and based on one-to-one relationships. After all, there are only six pairs of unique relationships between the four of you. But if you add just two people, the number of relationships shoots up to 15. Add another 20, and you’re up to 325. When you have 25,000 employees, as Facebook does, you’re at more than 312 million relationships. More formal organization quickly becomes necessary, meaning that departments need to be created, and these departments need managers and submanagers. Growing complexity brings with it thorny questions of management philosophy, organizational hierarchy and company culture. These questions are especially challenging for a blitzscaling company, since it has to continually answer and reanswer them in the midst of rapid, massive growth. Having a management strategy in place to handle this process is crucial. Uber found this out the hard way in late 2016 and early 2017, a period of management problems and turmoil from which the company is still recovering. Sexual harassment allegations emerged. The Verge reported a scheme that involved Uber creating fake accounts with its rival Lyft. Eight vice presidents and department heads left the company in just half a year. A management strategy won’t mean much without a business plan that secures long-term growth, however. Initially, a blitzscaling company with the right investment backing can afford to lose money for the sake of rapid expansion and market dominance – but only for a while. Once it achieves dominance, those losses need to turn into profits. Otherwise, you’ll have displeased investors who may cut off the flow of investment capital that’s been powering your growth. But for a company with a digital product or service, transforming losses into gains can be a challenge. That’s because people generally aren’t willing to shell out much money for such products and services. If Facebook charged you a quarter every time you logged in, would you check your timeline multiple times per day? Even if your company has maximized all the growth factors it takes to blitzscale, it won’t generate huge profits long-term without the right business plan. Look at Craigslist or IMDb (the International Movie Database). They fit the profile of blitzscaling companies, optimizing network effects and product/market fit, and they’re valuable in their own, nonmonetary ways. But they don’t earn much. So how can tech companies make money? We’ll look at some ways in the next blink. For a company that wants to be successful at blitzscaling, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for developing a business plan that can convert massive growth into equally massive profits. However, there are seven general patterns that successful companies have followed. Three of these relate directly to the advantages of doing business digitally. The first pattern involves the advantages of selling a product that is purely digital. For example, consider an extra, purchasable outfit, or “skin,” for a character in a video game. Since it only exists virtually, a skin costs practically nothing to make and sell. This means gross margins of nearly 100 percent. Purely digital products have become a very lucrative line of business for many tech companies, especially in the video game industry. Of course, if you’re a company with physical products, you can’t just magically turn them into digital ones – but you can still harness the power of going digital. This is the second pattern. For example, Amazon is heavily invested in physical products – to wit, the millions of things you can buy from its online store. That’s a lot of things to manage – but Amazon has turned to digital-management systems to make the most efficient use of its inventory. It’s also been increasingly turning to its software-as-a-service (SaaS) division, Amazon Web Services, which generated 150 percent of Amazon’s revenue in 2016. SaaS revenues were so high that they covered the losses of Amazon’s retail business! What is SaaS? Well, that’s the third pattern. It basically means selling software on a subscription model, rather than on a one-time-purchase or licensing model. The latter used to be the traditional model for selling enterprise software, which is software meant for organizations rather than individuals. To make that model work, the licenses for the software had to be sold for thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars, which priced out small and medium-sized businesses, and therefore limited the software’s market size. With the subscription model, however, a cloud-computing software company like Salesforce can sell its products and services at a much lower cost, greatly expanding its market size in the process. The more a company can do business digitally, then the greater the potential for outsized profits. And facilitating other companies’ digital endeavors has huge potential all its own, as we’ll see in the next blink. If you’re buying or selling a product in the current networked age, then you’re probably familiar with the go-to platform for conducting your business. For example, if you’re a music label, an ebook publisher or a movie distributor, the iTunes store has become one of your go-to selling platforms. That’s the fourth successful pattern – leveraging the power of platforms. If you can establish your product or service as the standard platform for buying and selling products, creating documents or doing any other kind of revenue-generating activity, you yourself stand to capture a large share of that revenue. Apple, for example, takes a hefty 30 percent cut of the proceeds from products sold on the iTunes store. It’s closely related to the fifth pattern, which is taking advantage of the growth potential of online marketplaces. These are a specific type of platform – platforms that not only bring buyers and sellers together, but also let them set their own prices through the market forces of supply and demand, just as Airbnb and eBay do. For profit seekers, the attraction of marketplaces is the same as normal platforms: you can take a cut of the transactions. The sixth pattern involves tapping into the eyeball-capturing power of online content-sharing feeds, like Twitter or Facebook’s timelines. Because feeds are so effective at captivating people’s attention, they’re very attractive to advertisers, who will pay premium prices to insert their ads and sponsored content into addictive streams of information and entertainment. Advertising also brings us to the seventh and final pattern, which is to offer your product or service for free and try to make money some other way. Advertising is an option here, too. Another is offering a premium service and hoping users upgrade to it from the free one. For example, DropBox offers people 2 gigabytes of cloud-based storage for free. If you like the service and want more storage, you have to pay for it. These seven patterns aren’t recipes, but each has been used as a guideline by many massively profitable businesses. As with all the hallmarks of blitzscaling, they’re new (or relatively new) and they’re bold, and they have the potential to lead to outrageous success. Let them inspire you, and watch your company grow at lightning speed. The key message in these blinks: Blitzscaling requires an outsized ambition and a tolerance for taking big risks in the hope of a big payoff. Increasingly, though, there are some patterns to guide this kind of ambitious thinking. Embracing uncertainty and risk while prioritizing speed over efficiency, taking advantage of four growth factors and navigating growth limiters can all set a company up for rapid and massive expansion that will be sustainable in the future. But the hands at the helm also have to be realistic about what they’re steering their company into, with management strategy and a business plan that anticipate the changes and challenges of rapid growth. With a clear vision, blitzscaling can help a business dominate an ecosystem for a long time to come. Actionable advice: Look at blitzscaling success stories outside of the tech industry.  In these blinks, we focused on companies in the tech industry because they provide the clearest illustrations of how blitzscaling works. However, blitzscaling can happen outside of the tech industry and even beyond the business world altogether. The clothing company Zara, the nonprofit educational organization Khan Academy and the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama are all examples of companies and organizations that implemented elements of blitzscaling outside of the tech industry.

That is, do you look at problems analytically and rationally, or instead, creatively and emotionally? Regardless whether you trend right or left, the key is not to let either side of your brain completely own the other. Even in business, where left-brain thinkers tend to rule, you can’t possibly hope to succeed without a good dose of intuition, creativity and empathy – things the right side of your brain controls. These blinks discuss not only how you can ensure your “right-brain” has its say in your business, but also how creative people can tackle left-brained tasks – so you too can successfully juggle mundane administrative work while thinking creatively about your next business project! In these blinks, you’ll find out why customers are like honeybees and you are the honey; how to know when to offload administrative tasks; and why you should think of your products as gifts. Countless business books stress the importance of strategic thinking, analytical skills and detailed planning. Sounds sensible, right? Well, entrepreneurship isn’t strictly about just being sensible or rational. There’s no reason for you to only focus on your left-brain qualities when creativity and other right-brain qualities are just as vital. Just as an artist crafts his masterpiece, the entrepreneur crafts his business model. Building a new solution or new product takes a ton of imaginative thinking, and the process isn’t linear. A truly creative process is one that winds along a path of trial and error, of sudden inspiration and “eureka” moments. Think about how a painting takes shape. At first, there’s just a vision in the artist’s head. That idea is sketched, and the canvas is filled with paint and life. Maybe one color doesn’t fit, and it’s painted over. The forms and shapes that appear trigger new inspirations. In the end, the final product is almost always different than the artist’s initial vision. That’s exactly what happens when you start tinkering with your business or start a new one. Indeed, some of the most important business skills are located in the right hemisphere of your brain!   It’s widely accepted in neurological studies that that traits like intuition, non-linear thinking, creative problem solving, empathy and imagination mainly take place in the right hemisphere of your brain, while the left hemisphere is more responsible for structural and logical thinking. While accounting, scheduling and strategic planning is obviously of value in business, right-brain skills are important too. Just think about marketing messages and how they are based often on making an emotional connection with a potential customer – certainly the strength of the right-brained talent! Let your brain’s right hemisphere run wild for a bit, and imagine your business as a flower, one that is blooming and filled with nectar to entice honeybees, or specifically, potential customers.   A flower’s blossom sprouts from within, and that’s exactly how you should see your business: a great business idea begins with your inner passion. When artist Melissa Gazzaneo travelled to Bali to help her mother teach English to children, she discovered that children there loved her handmade arts and crafts. As Melissa grew more and more passionate about the idea of helping children pursue their creativity, she realized she could build a business around her idea. And that’s exactly what she did, turning her passion into a business that made bags from recycled gear while at the same time, raising funds to deliver art supplies to disadvantaged children around the world. Now that you know the source from which your business should bloom, how do you attract honeybees? Easy: by communicating your passion with a core message. This should be nothing more than an authentic expression of who you are and what you stand for. Melissa’s core message, “Repurposed for a Purpose,” says loud and clear that providing aid is her key motivation in leading her business. But what good is a core message if nobody hears it? Consultant and facilitator Laura Burns took this to the extreme by tattooing her core message on her chest, “Married to Amazement.” Granted, you needn’t take your commitment this far – think about your own way of communicating your core message to customers clearly and in a way that’s as unique as is your product! But if you’re concerned that your business isn’t reaching potential customers worldwide, don’t worry. It’s not important to attract all the honeybees in the world, just the ones with whom your core message really resonates. These are after all the customers who are more likely to understand the value of your product. Unlike flowers, business owners don’t have to hang around waiting for honeybees – we can go out and find them! The more people you connect with, the wider your pool of supporters will be. In your network of supporters, everyone has value: some may become your customers, some may help encourage business decisions and others may assist in spreading your message. So how do you make these connections? Personal and direct communication is what gets people listening. Imagine that selling your product to a customer is like convincing your sweetheart to take you out for a date. Write every email newsletter like a love letter, complete with a touching headline.   Parent-coach Sheila Pai starts her promotion emails with the introduction, “Dear Hardworking Parent, Parenting is hard, hard, HARD work.” In doing so, she shows empathy and understanding for her customers’ feelings and needs. Talking to people and spreading your message is of course great. But you can increase your impact when you address exactly the right people with the right information at the right moment. Imagine you’re launching a new coaching program. You can start by building excitement with tantalizing teasers, perhaps recording a behind-the-scenes video that reveals preparations for the course. When your launch date approaches, widely open the doors and invite your audience to take action. You could publish a Q&A covering the most important information in your course, dish-out event invitations and make sign-up forms available online. After your first session, you can use weekly reminders and gentle nudges to keep your offer in the heads of those interested and to attract late-comers. This way you’ll be drawing people in at every stage. Remember the last surprise gift you received? How good did it make you feel? A gift comes from the heart, and sharing a gift is way more fun and gratifying than simply selling something. The author once had a college friend with whom she shared a passion for getting each other just the right gift. Whenever they saw a perfect goodie, they grabbed it and surprised each other just because it brought them joy. That’s the kind of mind-set which helps you empathize with your customers and anticipate their wishes and needs. Life coach Kerri Richardson for a long time had an awkward feeling that she was “begging for money” when it came to her work. A shift in her mind-set from selling to sharing helped her become more customer-oriented. Kerri now sees her training sessions as worthwhile opportunities for people to meet like-minded people and to get support to realize their dreams. Just think: when you give a gift, you’re considering basically the same questions as when you design a product. Who is the recipient? Why is this a good gift for this person especially, and how will she benefit from it? Is the price appropriate? And, how can you wrap the gift so it looks good? Just like a present is more fun wrapped in brightly colored paper and ribbons, so too will your product benefit from you paying attention to the little details. For example, when selling a handmade leather bag, you could gift a unique accessory, or even offer a free subscription to your online leatherwork courses. Most entrepreneurs are driven by their passions. But chances are that they’re also in business to earn a living – in other words, to make money. Service-oriented business models, such as coaching, swap time for money in a direct way. The same goes for artisanal work, where you sell an individual product that you make with your own labor. Such models eventually reach a financial ceiling. In these time-for-money models, there are three paths to making a profit: attract new customers, sell more to existing customers or raise your prices. As a coach, you might offer a face-to-face hour session and receive payment afterwards. However, the number of sessions you provide depends on how much time you have. You can’t serve an endless stream of customers, for example, because you don’t want to overwork yourself! On the other hand, there’s also a limit to the amount of money people are willing to pay. What should you do? Think creatively! You could turn individual coaching sessions into group sessions, for example. This would allow you to increase your number of customers, earn more income and even allow you to eventually lower your prices to attract even more customers. Jane, a holistic health consultant, offers a good example of creative problem-solving. In ten hours, she was able to create a six-module home study course that she delivers online. From this point forward, she is able to earn money with almost no additional hours or labor. But what if you offer products and not services? As a leather artisan, you could begin to offer services, perhaps in the form of group lessons in leather work or by distributing patterns or tutorials. Even if you’re passionate about sharing your gifts with the world, there still might be something stopping you. Any guess what that might be? If you’re put off by the idea of administrative work that is time-consuming but still “needs to be done,” don’t despair. Nobody expects you to shoulder all the work alone – so why not simply ask for help? In your dream business, you might have the urge to control everything yourself. But in the long term, you’ll burn out and lose your creative energy. Before this happens, try to determine which tasks you should outsource. Ask yourself the following questions: What are you not good at? What takes too much time? What comes easy but bores you? What drives you crazy? For a long time, fiction-writing coach Beth needed to do everything on her own, until the point when she found herself overwhelmed with work. Beth then bit the bullet and hired an assistant to manage her online tasks. This allowed Beth to focus again on the work she truly cared about. There are several options for you in recruiting support. When it comes to administrative tasks, bookkeeping or web management, you can hire outside specialists for fair payment. Or instead of hiring someone, you could team up and create a strategic partnership with any of the countless creative entrepreneurs who are caught up in similar situations. Life coach Tiffany Han, for example, collaborated with 12 artists. Together they worked as a team to create a product package, combining art prints with a coaching exercise. In doing so, they not only developed an attractive product but also minimized their marketing workload, as they were able to draw on a much bigger network. Your head is probably bursting with ideas for new courses, innovative creative solutions or unique art pieces. It’s no wonder that you lose focus from time to time! But if you find yourself off-track more often than you’d like, consider doing some long-term planning. This doesn’t mean you need to bury yourself in Excel spreadsheets. You can just as easily get your hands dirty and sketch out your work horizon and income plan using a huge wall calendar and colorful markers. For example, the author usually launches one new seminar program every quarter. For each launch, she notes down the main tasks, deadlines and expected earnings on her wall calendar, so she can keep everything literally in sight. Writer and web designer Mari Pfeiffer uses mind maps to visually document the important tasks in her business processes. With the actual task placed in the middle of the map, the branches around it explore how often the task occurs, what processes it requires, who needs to be involved and which questions typically arise. Consistently mapping out your work this way can also give you insight into patterns. You may see that a lot of tasks recur periodically; these are the ones you can plan to execute with less effort next time. Documentation of previous work can even be used as templates for upcoming projects. The author once was unexpectedly invited to present an offer for a workshop with a popular live broadcast show. The task seemed impossible, until she remembered to look at her old sketchbooks, and was able to craft a proposal using bits from earlier work. Her proposal was a hit and it earned her extra cash and customers with hardly any effort. No matter which approach you take, give it your own creative twist and adapt your routines as you see fit – so you can keep both sides of your brain happy! Know the saying, “When it rains, it pours?” The author sure does. Her decision to move to a new home was put on hold when her boyfriend had a bike accident and her dad took a bad fall and spent weeks in the hospital. Your left-brain tendencies may aspire to control everything, but it’s simply not possible. The right-brain alternative is to let go of the urge for control and face life with ease. This way, you’ll be able to sustain the business that you worked so hard to establish. If doing things “with ease” sounds vague to you, don’t worry – here are three helpful strategies to put you in the right frame of mind. The first strategy is to seek out simple solutions. The author herself would often get stuck in her own complex plans, and achieve nothing. Finally when she stopped overthinking and simply jotted down some notes for a book, she found herself on the road to two major projects! The second strategy is to take time off. It’s as straightforward as blocking off some space in your schedule for relaxing, perhaps in the form of work-free evenings. And the third strategy is to create a work environment that cares for you. Start by sticking small positive notes on your desk to give you strength when times get tough, and then create your own specific routines that make you work well and feel well, too. Yoga teacher and life coach Sharon Tessandori places self-care at the top of her business agenda. When swamped with emails and admin work, she takes a seat on her yoga mattress first and centers herself before taking it all on. Like Sharon, remember that you are the most important person in your business. So why not make things work for you? The key message in this book: Creative thinkers who want to turn their passion into a business work best when they use the strengths of the right hemisphere of their brain. By turning an entrepreneurial idea into something that is visual, playful and deeply human, you’ll be able to sustain the imaginative spark that drew you into the world of business in the first place.  Actionable advice: Paint your plans with the right markers!  The next time you want to sketch out a plan for your new product launch or campaign, use bold and colorful markers. A marker’s thick lines make it hard to get obsessed with small details, and will keep you focused on broader concepts. Save your ballpoint pens for filling in the details afterward!    Suggested further reading: Everybody Writes by Ann Handley Everybody Writes (2014) gives you invaluable advice on how to create great content, from using correct grammar to crafting engaging posts, tweets and emails.

They are companies with long track-records for success and widely admired as the crown jewels of their industries. What’s more, their success is enduring – they prosper even as great leaders retire and individual hit-products become obsolete. To properly study and learn from these companies, the authors first had to identify them by surveying hundreds of prominent CEOs for the names of companies they considered visionary. The 18 most commonly mentioned firms – including such venerable names as the Walt Disney Company, Marriott Hotels, and Merck – were included in the study. The visionary companies were then paired up with comparison companies: firms that shared similar products and markets but which, while not being outright poor performers, were called “visionary” far less often in the CEO survey. Both groups of companies were then examined across their considerable life spans (the average founding date lay in the 1890s for both groups). Based on massive amounts of data from interviews, annual reports, financial statements, news articles and many other sources, all aspects of these corporations were studied, ranging from their ownership structures to their cultures. To understand the extraordinary success of the visionary companies, consider this fact: if you had invested a dollar in their shares in 1926, that dollar would have been worth $6,356 by 1990. Compare that to $955 if you had invested in the comparison companies, and only $415 if you had invested in the general market, and you’ll see just how impressive the visionary companies’ performance is. No wonder that all manner of Fortune 500 companies have been fascinated by the findings of this study. Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. Contrary to what most people believe, the success of a visionary company is not dependent on great ideas. The founder of Sony, for example, had no specific idea of what products his company would make. He actually held a brainstorming session after founding the company to evaluate business ideas ranging from sweetened bean-paste to miniature-golf equipment. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard also had no specific idea in mind when they founded Hewlett-Packard (HP). They experimented with almost farcically diverse ideas, such as automatic urinal flushers and bowling foul-line indicators. Hence, it seems that great ideas are not necessary for the start of a visionary company. Nor are high-profile, charismatic leaders. While visionary companies did have superb individuals at the top of their organization, they were often down-to-earth, reserved and modest people. But then, what is the secret of enduring success? Many comparison companies had great ideas and strong leadership, yet they all fell behind the visionary companies eventually. Why? Instead of focusing on a single product or a single leader, the visionary companies studied built themselves into outstanding organizations that constantly churned out great ideas and great leaders. The real creation of the founders was not a product at all but the company itself; constantly advancing independently of any one person or idea. Think of a clock on the wall. Having one great idea or visionary leader is like getting a glimpse of that clock and being able to tell the time in that instant. But building an organization that constantly generates great ideas and leaders is like building your own clock: a reliable machine. Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies have a higher purpose for their existence than to merely chase profits. Together with the companies’ core values – enduring tenets that guide their every decision – this purpose forms their core ideologies: a set of stable principles that guides the company through generations, much like the “truths” of the American Declaration of Independence. Consider for example the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J&J). In 1935, the CEO, Robert W. Johnson Jr., wrote out the company’s core ideology in a document called “Our Credo,” which listed the company’s responsibilities: first to their customers, second to their employees and so forth. Finally, fifth and last on the list, after all the other responsibilities had been fulfilled, Johnson said that shareholders should receive “a fair return.” Likewise, most visionary companies studied were not primarily after profit. Nevertheless, while some ideologies may seem soft or idealistic, visionary companies managed to find a way to stay pragmatic in their business decisions and make profits without ever wavering from their core ideologies. A core ideology is important not only when visionary companies prosper but also when they hit upon trouble. For example, when Ford faced a dire crisis in the 1980s, instead of just fighting fires, its management team stopped to discuss and clarify what the company stood for and how they could espouse the values of the founder, Henry Ford. Ford’s comparison company, General Motors, made no such effort. Though every visionary company studied had a core ideology, their content varied greatly. What counts is not the content of the ideology but rather that an authentic ideology exists and is rigorously acted upon.  Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. The real heart of what makes visionary companies so successful is that while they jealously guard the permanence of their core ideologies, the manifestations of that core ideology are always open for change and progress. For example, Wal-Mart’s drive to “exceed customer expectations” is a stable element of its core ideology, but the customer-greeters at the entrance to their stores are a practice that can change. Similarly, Boeing’s core ideology is to be a pioneer in the field of aviation, but building jumbo jets is a manifestation of that ideology that can change. This flexibility demonstrates how visionary companies refuse to abide by the so-called tyranny of the OR, whereby a company must choose between staying true to its core ideology or stimulating progress. Instead, visionary companies use the genius of the AND – experimenting and developing – while still adhering to their core ideologies. Visionary companies have their core ideologies to guide them, but they are also relentless in their efforts to continually improve their products, business and organization. They never settle and never become complacent. Consider the founder of the Marriott Corporation, J. Willard Marriot, who lived by the motto “Keep on being constructive, doing constructive things, until it’s time to die… make every day count, to the very end.” This sounds rather depressing, but is also a great commitment to constant progress. Just like their core ideologies, this drive for progress is innate and unquestioned in visionary companies. Progress is stimulated both by setting bold goals and by creating concrete mechanisms that encourage people to innovate and improve. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. To drive progress, visionary companies often set themselves extremely bold objectives – so-called big hairy audacious goals (BHAGs) – to which they commit utterly and completely. BHAGs are so ambitious that they often seem unrealistic, especially to outsiders. Nevertheless, they’re also clear and tangible enough to energize and focus the organization. A well-known example of a non-corporate BHAG is the one set by John F. Kennedy in 1961 when he proclaimed that the U.S. would take a man to the moon and back safely by the end of the decade. At the time, this was an almost ludicrously bold commitment, but it did get the U.S. moving vigorously forward. Boeing set many BHAGs during its history, including its commitment to developing the 747 jet. Boeing pursued this goal single-mindedly, without ever even considering the possibility of failure. The CEO stated that they would complete the jet even if it consumed the entire company, which it nearly did: at one stage roughly 86,000 people – some 60% of their workforce – were laid off as sales of the plane did not meet expectations. Similarly, Thomas J. Watson Sr., the founder of the Computer Tabulating Recording Company, set a BHAG by renaming his company – which sold coffee grinders and butcher scales – to reflect his ambition for global status. The new name was audacious at the time: International Business Machines (IBM). BHAGs often take on lives of their own. Just as the space program continued after Kennedy’s death, the visionary companies studied pursued their BHAGs even as new CEOs and directors came and went. Once a BHAG was achieved, new ones were set – always in line with the company’s core ideology. Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations pursue their core ideologies so single-mindedly that their corporate cultures are almost cult-like. For example, new employees quickly find themselves socializing primarily with their colleagues, and they are encouraged to be secretive about the inner workings of their companies. Employees often become completely immersed in the core ideology. Consider IBM, for example, where future managers in training would rise and sing songs from an IBM songbook: “March on with I.B.M., Work hand in hand…” Similarly, the Walt Disney Company expected its employees to live and breathe its core ideology of wholesome family fun. For example, men with facial hair were not accepted as employees at theme parks, and anyone heard uttering a four-letter word in the presence of Walt Disney himself was fired immediately – no exceptions. There is not much room in visionary companies for people who do not meet their tough expectations and standards. New employees often find that either they fit right in and thrive, or they perform poorly, are unhappy and exit the company quickly. In this regard, there are no compromises at visionary companies. Conversely, because the employees are confident and can be counted on to adhere to the company’s core ideology, they can also be given the leeway to experiment. This stimulates progress and enables the company to avoid the dangerous group-think endemic in many cults. Note though that visionary companies are not personality cults, centered around a charismatic CEO or founder but rather around the core ideology of the company. Though charismatic personalities can also drive passionate work, such “cults” invariably collapse when the person leaves. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave. While the visionary companies studied often had outstanding CEOs at their helm at one time or another, what was even more impressive was their ability to continually produce such high-quality leaders. The organizations focused hard on cultivating managerial talent within the company so that new leaders could be counted on to continue in line with the company’s core ideology. At the same time, visionary companies engaged in timely succession-planning to ensure continuity in leadership even if something unexpected were to happen. Consider for example the General Electric Company (GE), whose most famous CEO is without a doubt, the legendary Jack Welch. But actually thanks to the company’s fervent emphasis on internal management training and CEO succession, GE has enjoyed a century of Welch-caliber CEOs. In fact, more GE alumni have gone on to become executives of American corporations than the alumni of any other company. And Welch himself outlined his plan for succession seven years before retiring, though even this seems last-minute compared to Bob Galvin, the former CEO of Motorola, who began planning for the next generation a quarter-century before finally leaving. In contrast, the comparison companies often hired external CEOs who were unfamiliar with the company and who sometimes began steering it in new, wholly ill-conceived directions. Also, the CEOs at comparison companies were often near-tyrannical and engaged in very little succession planning, which left gaping holes in the companies’ leadership when they left. Some comparison companies even had CEOs who actively hindered succession planning and sabotaged would-be candidates. These companies then stumbled when the troublesome CEO finally left. Visionary companies produce a continual stream of high-caliber leaders. Charles Darwin discovered that evolution is a series of successful “experiments” in which slight variations are introduced to a species and the strongest new variants survive. Similarly, the visionary companies studied understood the need to stimulate a similar evolutionary progress within their businesses. They encouraged their employees and management to experiment with new ideas, products and practices, some of which became great successes. Consider for example J&J’s famous Band-Aids. They were born when an employee put together some surgical tape and gauze to quickly bandage his wife’s fingers after she accidentally cut herself with a kitchen knife. When he mentioned the idea to the J&J marketing department, they embraced it and eventually, Band-Aid products became the company’s best-selling category. Or consider 3M, which directed its employees to use 15 percent of their working time to work on any pet projects they felt like. Two such projects by two separate employees eventually collided to produce the famous Post-It Notes. This would never have happened if 3M hadn’t actively encouraged experimentation and allowed its employees to continue with their pet projects, even when early market studies were negative. Contrast this with 3M’s comparison company, Norton, which actually discouraged the pursuit of opportunities outside of its traditional product lines. One aspect of evolution is that some – or even most – variations fail; the same is true in business. J&J experienced some very prominent failures too, for example, its colored casts for children with bone fractures. The casts quickly turned hospital bed sheets into something resembling modern art and threw hospital laundries into chaos. Visionary companies understood that failed experiments are the necessary price to pay for evolution and must not be punished lest further experimentation be discouraged. Visionary companies stimulate evolutionary progress by encouraging experimentation. While many companies claim to adhere to idealistic values, encourage experimentation or embrace constant progress, very little is seen in practice. The visionary companies studied, on the other hand, managed to translate their values into reality by creating concrete mechanisms that affected the daily lives and decisions of employees. 3M did not merely say, “We want our employees to be more innovative.” Instead, it implemented several mechanisms to encourage this idea, one example was allowing employees to use 15 percent of their time on pet projects and dictating that 30 percent of each division’s annual sales must come from products less than four years old. Likewise, visionary companies did not merely talk about constant improvement; rather, they created mechanisms to ensure it. Wal-Mart, for example, spurred constant growth with so-called “Beat Yesterday” ledgers, which were used to compare each day’s sales to those of the year prior. Similarly, Hewlett-Packard instituted a grueling process of ranking its employees annually to stop those who gained a high status from just coasting. The visionary companies also took concrete actions in the long run. They invested far more than comparison companies in creating new technologies and business practices, training and developing their human capital, as well as in supporting research and development. For example, when Merck wanted to become a force in medical research, it deliberately modeled its labs on academic ones and allowed its researchers to publish their findings in academic journals – very unusual for private companies at the time. It also decided the product-development process should be driven by research rather than marketing as it was in many other companies. This attracted top scientists to Merck’s labs. Visionary companies don’t just talk – they take concrete actions to implement their values. The key message in this book: Visionary companies are able to attain their phenomenal success by staying true to their core ideologies while still relentlessly pursuing progress. A company’s core ideology comprises its core values but also its purpose, meaning the reason it exists beyond profits or shareholder value. To supplement their core ideology, visionary companies also stimulate constant progress by setting bold goals and by instituting grassroots mechanisms to realize their policies.  The questions this book answered: Why should we study visionary companies? Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. What are the main principles that visionary companies use to thrive? Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. What are the specific policies and mechanisms that visionary companies use to preserve their core ideology and yet stimulate progress? Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave.

Making it a reality, though, is a whole different ballgame. To attain your goal, you will likely have to work very long hours for a quite a few years. But even hard work does not always yield fruit. Start-ups often go bust after three to five years of continued efforts, while many dedicated business professionals end up spending long hours in the office without having anything to show for it in the end. This happens because success must be carefully planned. These blinks will show you that you’ll need short-term, intermediate and long-term goals, and also identify the right tools to reach your goals. You’ll also learn how to stay excited about big hairy audacious goals; how to recognize the best opportunities in your business environment; and how to create a focus for your company that will ensure its success. Have you heard the term Big Hairy Audacious Goals, or BHAGs? It was coined by Jerry I. Porras and Jim Collins in their book Built to Last. To qualify as a BHAG, a goal needs to meet four criteria: It needs to be very big, take years to accomplish, be a little bit elusive in terms of the best way to attain it and must be easy to identify if it’s been achieved or not. Consider Wal-Mart. Following World War II, the company’s founder, Sam Walton, set a remarkably bold goal; he wanted to turn his tiny variety store in Newport, Arkansas into the most profitable one in the entire state. Since he was primarily selling cheap T-shirts and fishing rods at the time, this was a pretty audacious goal. It also wasn’t something he could achieve in a matter of months, and it wasn’t immediately clear how he could set about doing it. Finally, in terms of verifying his potential accomplishment, it would be easy to check the size and profit of his growing business against other stores in Arkansas. By 1948, Walton had achieved his incredible vision – his store was the most profitable of any variety store in Arkansas. From there, he just kept setting goals and, decades down the line, by 2002, Wal-Mart had become the largest company on the face of the earth. So, do as Sam did and identify your own BHAG. But a BHAG is not necessarily about growing your company; it can also be related to a specific product or project. In 1934, Walt Disney set out to create the very first animated, feature-length film. No one in the industry believed in this bold project because animation was only considered suitable for short films. History proved them wrong. Disney reached his goal when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released in 1938. People loved it. And even though Disney’s original goal hadn’t been revenue, the film did generate massive returns. Next up, you’ll learn about two key concepts that are at the foundation of your business. Imagine your dream is to build a cathedral. To achieve this incredible goal, would you hire people who simply know how to lay bricks or people who are wholeheartedly committed to building a stunning architectural masterpiece. Probably the latter, right? After all, having a unifying purpose is essential to forging commitment and building a thriving business. This central motivation is called a core purpose and it’s key to reaching your goals. For instance, as an architect, your core purpose might be to beautify cities or to build environmentally sustainable houses. Simply put, your core purpose infuses your work with meaning, while gathering energy and solidifying commitments in the process. This is an important factor since the more committed a team is, the more likely they are to achieve extraordinary results. In fact, the employee research firm ISR found that companies with an engaged workforce are more productive and profitable overall. So, your core purpose is a fundamental aspect of achieving your stated goals, but so are your core values. These values constitute your company’s moral compass; they ensure consistent decision making and guide your hiring and firing practices. In other words, your core values dictate how your company operates. Say you run a taxi company. Your core values might be summed up by the phrase, the right route is the right route. Such a value will indicate that your team doesn’t take detours to jack up fares. By stating this up front, you’ll keep your team on solid moral footing and ensure that they are committed to making the right decisions. But your values will also guide who is on your team in the first place. If it turns out that an employee doesn’t believe in the values you stand for, it is clearly the right decision to let them go. Imagine you’ve invested every last drop of your ingenuity into creating a deli that only sells broccoli jam. Your business could be perfectly organized and seamlessly run, but it wouldn’t matter if nobody wants what you’re selling. So, how do you determine which products will sell? By scanning your environment with a PEST analysis. This acronym, which stands for Political, Economic, Social and Technological, is a tool to define external factors that will impact your industry. To begin with, consider political circumstances that might impact your business, both today and down the line. From there, ask yourself, given the political opportunities and threats you can identify, which strategies should you adopt to succeed both in the present day and the future? For instance, in the 1960s, Sam Walton analyzed the environment Wal-Mart was entering. He realized that the US government was making a number of infrastructural investments, one of which was the creation of more roads. He therefore knew that it would become easier for customers to reach his stores and that it was a good time to open new locations. Next, you should consider economic factors that’ll influence your business and ask yourself the same question about the economic climate as you did about the political one. Sam Walton remains a good example as, in the years following World War II, he saw the economy surging and knew it was an opportune time to launch a new business. From there, it’s essential to take into account social elements that’ll impact your company. To do so, consider how people, your employees and, in particular, your customers act and think. Ask questions like, is the population getting older or younger? When Walton was starting out, it was clear that more people were having children. He saw that the baby boom would eventually result in more potential customers and was another cue that the time was right to grow. Finally, consider technological changes that might occur and how they could affect your business. Which technologies are currently trending? If a new technology like, say, flying bicycles was to hit the market tomorrow, how would it affect your business? Now that you’ve asked the right questions and set the stage, you’re ready to make some bigger decisions – which is exactly what you’ll learn about next. If you want to stand out in a crowd, all you’ve got to do is dye your hair pink and spike it into a mohawk. But standing out in the world of business requires a bit more thought. To do so, you need to identify your value discipline, the thing that makes you different from the competition and guarantees you a leading role in your industry. There are three different value disciplines to choose from and it’s up to you to pick the one that fits you best. First, there’s operational excellence, which basically means that you have low costs. Second is product leadership, which is all about creating the newest and best products. And third, there’s customer intimacy, which implies that you produce solutions that are perfectly tailored to the problems your customers face. But regardless of which approach you choose, all three of these value disciplines should keep you focused on the unique difference that makes you stand out. Let’s return to Sam Walton. Back in the early 60s, he began building his empire and decided to focus on offering the low-cost option. Specifically, he made the decision to spend some of his own savings to be able to offer rock bottom prices to his customers. His goal was for Wal-Mart to be the store that everybody could afford; in the end, that’s exactly how the company differentiated itself and became such a resounding success. Then, once you’ve chosen your value discipline, you can use it to identify your core activities. These are the strategic actions you take to keep yourself on the path toward your goals. Imagine you decide to focus on low prices as Walton did. Other factors like product development and customer service will soon become less important, as they’re not essential to reaching your goals. Identifying this will allow you to deliberately allocate fewer resources to these unnecessary elements and instead focus on getting better deals from wholesalers to lower your retail prices. By doing so, you’ll be syncing your core activities with your value discipline. Now that you’ve got the basics in order, you’re ready to build the messages you need to bring in prospective customers and beat out the competition. You might be thinking, what’s a good goal to set for your business? Well, it’s actually a difficult question to answer, since words like “good” are quite abstract and can mean entirely different things to different people. This is precisely why it’s crucial to come up with concrete ways of measuring your business’s progress – and numerical targets are an ideal method. Numbers make progress more tangible and, therefore, easier to monitor. Say two of your targets in the coming years are to build two more branch offices and acquire ten more resellers. Once you’ve set such goals, you can track the numbers you’re putting up and have your whole team monitor the progress. But that’s not all. You’ll also need to identify your key performance indicators, or KPIs. These all-important markers of success keep track of performance in essential areas and help you predict financial success. For example, if you’re in the construction business and notice a correlation between higher numbers of proposals and an increase in income, you might want to track the number of building proposals you submit as a KPI. Or, if your industry is pharmaceutical sales, you might track the number of weekly physician's visits that your sales representatives make because you know it has been a key indicator of your business success in the past. By now you have some strong strategies for business success, but if you want to reach your BHAGs, you’ll need to be serious about maintaining progress. In that fight, losing focus and wasting time are your biggest enemies – so here are some tactics to overcome them: First, conducting meetings is central to maintaining forward momentum, as they establish a clear rhythm for your business. While the idea of holding many meetings can be daunting, in general, they give you time to pause and reassess your direction; these regular moments of reflection can quickly become essential to a thriving business. One meeting that’s particularly important is the quarterly strategic review. It should happen every three months to give your team the opportunity to look back on the work you did and assess the last quarter. It’s a time to consider what you’ve achieved, review new projects on the docket and take a look at any surprises that came up. By assessing all these factors, you can double-check that everything you’re doing is in line with your goals. From there, you can use this information to perform what’s called a SWOT Analysis, which is a convenient way to map the current status of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. For instance, one of your strengths might be an expert on your team, while a weakness could be your failure to make enough sales. An opportunity might be the bankruptcy of a key competitor, which opens the door for you to bring in more customers, and a threat might be a pending merger between companies that, together, could poach many of your customers. From there, you can use your quarterly review and SWOT analysis to plan for the future and choose the projects you’ll be launching in the next quarter. Imagine you identify a few threats and weaknesses during your SWOT analysis. It’s probably in your best interests to address these in the next quarter; then, once you’ve gone through damage control, you can look at which new projects you want to take on to stay on top of your overarching, ultimate goals. The key message in this book: Creating a successful business requires a winning strategy that enables you to set the right goals and actually reach them – but that’s easier said than done. To pick the right strategy, you’ll need to do some careful thinking and analysis first, after which you’ll have to monitor your progress carefully. Actionable Advice Involve your entire team in strategic research. When analyzing your business, including the PEST analysis, ask everyone in your team for their opinion. With more minds involved, it’ll be easier to identify the most important aspects in need of consideration and pin down a winning strategy. So involve everyone you can in this process and don’t go it alone – you might miss something important. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maybe you attend a heavy metal concert, strike up a conversation with a fellow fan, discover he’s an entrepreneur and, months later, find yourself working for his start-up. Or perhaps you feel exceedingly lucky to have sat next to Todd in lectures because he’s turned out to be the man of your dreams. But, in reality, a lot of these apparently lucky outcomes have totally predictable causes. For instance, sociability is a predictor of opportunity (you wouldn’t have landed that job had you been too shy to talk). Similarly, proximity is a predictor of acquaintanceship (you fell for Todd because you met him, not because he was the dreamiest guy in the lecture hall). You can’t control everything in life. But luck is often more predictable than you might think, and we can all adapt our behavior, prepare for randomness and nudge the system so it works in our favor. So let’s dive in and find out why lucky people are lucky, and how you can learn to be lucky yourself. In these blinks, you’ll learn how looking the part and making a good first impression will increase your luck; why figure skaters who perform last are more likely to win; and how to overcome your natural inhibition and be more confident and curious. You’ve doubtless heard someone account for a serendipitous event – be it a job opportunity, a promotion or a romantic encounter – by saying, “I was just in the right place at the right time.” Well, it turns out there is a lot of truth to this cliché. At the very least, the “right time” part is crucial. Counterintuitive as it might seem, luck often depends on coming last. In any situation where a number of people, objects or performances are judged against each other, being among the last to be judged increases your chances of success. For example, an analysis of European figure-skating championships between 1994 and 2004 found that the first skater to perform had a 3 percent chance of winning, whereas the final performer had a 14 percent chance. The same pattern has been found in everything from synchronized-swimming championships to the Eurovision Song Contest. Why is this? Well, the human brain is wired to work this way. It relies on context, on the information and emotions that are currently available to it. Just consider house hunting. The first properties you view will be judged against your ideals because your mind isn’t yet stocked with real-life examples of real estate to compare them to. But, over time, as you see more properties, your brain will receive information about what is actually out there. You’ll start to think, “Well, this house seems pretty good compared to the first nine I looked at.” House hunters viewing their first property never say, “This house is perfect! We’ll take it!” They wait until they’ve seen a number of houses before settling on one they like. In the same way, figure-skating judges are reluctant to award an early competitor a 5.9 or a 6 (the highest marks available) because this will make it impossible to give later competitors a higher mark. By the end, competitors are more likely to pick up those high marks, however, since the judges know there is no one else coming who could trump them. So going last is lucky. If you can choose a job interview slot, go last. Want to pick up that hot guy at the bar? Make your attempt late in the evening. A social psychologist named Robert Zajonc once ran an experiment in which he exposed Westerners to foreign characters – Chinese logograms, for example – and then asked them how much they liked each character. Overall, the participants favored those characters that they had seen most frequently. This experiment is a demonstration of the exposure effect, which predicts that people will like things they’re familiar with. This effect has an obvious evolutionary explanation. As Zajonc put it, “If it’s familiar, it hasn’t eaten you yet.” So we tend to like what we know, and, in general, we’re most familiar with whatever we regularly get physically close to. For instance, one classic study shows that the physical proximity of two police recruits during training classes is positively correlated with the likelihood of their later becoming friends. Another study reveals that school children sitting in the center of a classroom make more friends than those on the edges because their central location makes it easier for other students to talk to them. So if making connections doesn’t come easily to you, don’t linger on the edges of that party or networking event. Get into the thick of it! But merely being around other people isn’t sufficient to spark friendships or profitable business connections. You also need to look the part. That’s because people instinctively use first impressions as a guide to decision-making. A study once examined whether musicians’ appearances affected how they were assessed. Judges were shown a series of videotaped violin performances, each by a female artist. Some of the violinists wore short skirts and tight tops, while others wore formal concert dress. The trick was that each performance was dubbed with the same musical recording. Nonetheless, judges consistently rated those in formal concert dress to be more technically proficient. Other studies show that doctors can increase their trustworthiness ratings simply by putting on a white coat over their suit. We can’t help but use our gut feelings to guide our decision-making. Thanks to years of observation, we simply feel that doctors wearing white coats can be trusted and that violinists in formal concert dress are the real deal. More often than not, our estimation of a person’s trustworthiness is based on a lightning-fast mental assessment – a first impression. So, whether with your Linkedin profile, your clothes or the strength of your handshake, try to make that first impression a good one. It really does matter. Most of us can think of people we know who are beautiful and seem to find success with ease. We all have that good-looking friend who was the college quarterback, always got the girls and is now raking in millions at Goldman Sachs. Beautiful people simply seem to have all the luck. And, in truth, beautiful people do have a lot of luck because humans are predisposed to favor attractive people. Since we can’t directly assess the quality of someone’s genes, we tend to make guesses based on the information that is available. An attractive, symmetrical face and nice, shiny hair are indicative of solid genes, so we tend to prefer people who possess such qualities. Our brains seamlessly make a series of logical leaps – from “this person is beautiful” to “this person must have good genes” to “this person is likely to be smart and well-adjusted.” If you’re of the opinion that beauty is a cultural construction, consider this. According to multiple studies, people of different genders, cultures and races tend to agree on who's hot and who's not. What’s more, babies do, too. When shown two faces – one that’s stereotypically beautiful and one that’s stereotypically ugly – six-month-olds spend more time looking at the attractive face. So attractive people tend to be favored by others, which really does make them luckier. This starts at an early age. One study found that parents with attractive babies – as judged by other people – are found to be more nurturing toward their children than the parents of less genetically-blessed offspring. The beautiful get extra help throughout life. In one study, researchers left university applications in phone booths, as if they had been left there by accident. Some of the applications, which included photos and addresses, were from attractive applicants, while others were from plainer candidates. Significantly more applications were mailed back to the attractive students than to their plain counterparts.   So how can those of us who aren’t physically stunning improve our luck? Well, we have control over our clothes, how much time we spend at the gym and whether we use makeup, of course. However, getting too worked up about your appearance can cause poor self-esteem. And as we’ll see in the next blink, confidence is also important when it comes to luck. If you have the confidence to get up and talk to that cute guy across the bar, you’ll be more likely to get lucky than if you sit in the corner, nursing your mojito. Confidence is about focusing more on reward than risk. Now, our brain has both an activation system, which encourages us to do things based on potential reward, and an inhibition system, which uses stress and anxiety to stop us from doing things based on potential risk. When we shift from activation to inhibition, we go from “go and talk to him – you might get a date out of it!” to “you’ll only embarrass yourself – it’s time to accept that you’ll die alone.”   People who are able to push activation over inhibition are luckier because they are more likely to get into the situations – talking to potential partners, demanding a promotion – that create opportunities for luck. However, for many people, this switch is easier said than done. The world is full of hierarchies, and there is plenty of evidence that people’s behavior conforms to their perceived place in the hierarchy. Consider why the rich guy from a successful family tends to be outspoken and confident. Research shows that, in the first four years of life, a child born into a professionally successful family receives 560,000 more pieces of encouraging feedback than discouraging feedback. In contrast, a working-class child receives just 100,000 more. And if a baby is born into a family on welfare, it’ll receive 125,000 more discouragements than encouragements. Low standing in the social hierarchy can mean low confidence and, therefore, less luck. But it’s possible to escape this trap. Girls are often told that they are less good at math than boys, and studies of women often find worse math results than for men. In one study, however, women about to take a math test were told to imagine themselves as “a stereotypical male.” This caused discrepancies in male and female performance to almost disappear completely. The women’s newfound confidence resulted in an obvious increase in mathematical ability.    If you’re naturally confident, lucky you! If not, here’s a trick that can help. Students who wrote for 15 minutes about one of their strengths – independence, say, or creativity – went on to perform better, over the course of a year, than a control group. Take time to remind yourself of your strengths. You got this! A Swedish psychologist named Karl Anders Ericsson once found that the world’s best musicians had, on average, practiced for 10,000 hours. This has led to a rather simplistic idea that’s been popularized by the writer Malcolm Gladwell – that you can become an expert in any field by practicing for 10,000 hours or more. It’s a seductive theory. You, too, could have been a world-class performer, if you’d only stuck with those oboe lessons instead of drinking Pinot Grigio with your friends! But it’s not really true. Hard work and practice aren’t enough. You also need the right genes. Researchers exploring the link between genes and athletic performance have found that genes can account for anywhere between 31 and 85 percent of variation between athletes. So the difference between an Olympic medalist and an “also ran” doesn’t depend on practice alone; it’s also genetic. You need the right resources, too, not to mention the right location. It’s entirely possible that someone with the perfect genetic makeup for competitive skiing is living in a favela in Brazil. Of course, that person would be unlikely to ever hit the Winter Olympic Games, for geographical and financial reasons. Studies of top swimmers show that they tend to come from families with a decent income. If they didn’t, they’d be unable to travel around to competitions. They also tend to come from places like southern California, where the sun shines all year round and there are plenty of pools. To add to genes, resources and location, you also need mental toughness. Reaching the very top in any field depends on never saying, “I quit.” The likes of Tom Brady, a superstar quarterback, are capable of looking at a loss and criticism as a learning experience time and time again, relentlessly focusing on improvement and exercising unyielding self-control. Master this, and you’ll be that much closer to becoming a five-time Super Bowl winner. It’s easy to believe in hard work. A gold medalist is more likely to talk about her years of training than her superior genetic makeup, and she may neglect to mention that she grew up next door to a track and was raised by parents who paid for exclusive coaching. Sure, hard work is important. But it’s not enough on its own. How do you spend your downtime? Working tirelessly on a side project that, someday, may lead to major success? Or watching Netflix in your sweatpants? Self-control, and investing time and effort in activities that are only rewarding in the long-term, is a great way to generate successful, apparently lucky outcomes. Meet Derek Sivers. He’s a millionaire who set up a company called CD Baby back in the 1990s. Sivers had created a credit-card account to sell CDs of his own music. CD Baby was born when a friend asked him if he would help set up a website for independent bands to sell their CDs. The site was created over the course of a weekend and later sold at a value of $22 million. What luck! A chance conversation that led, decades later, to a multimillion-dollar payout! Except it wasn’t really luck. Among his friends, Sivers was known as “the robot.” He had a long attention span and was happy to block out the world and work nonstop for a weekend if he wanted to master a new skill. When, in 1993, he first heard of the internet, he didn’t just start exploring it; he taught himself HTML so he could create his own websites. Unfortunately, it’s hard to improve your ability to self-regulate your behavior, so don’t get too despondent if you struggle with willpower. Our brain finds it easier to do things that we’ve done many times before – that’s why adults who have tied a tie every morning for ten years can do it on autopilot. Doing things that don’t come naturally, like tying a tie for the very first time, or teaching yourself HTML instead of watching old episodes of Friends, requires us to use the most energy-demanding part of our brain, the prefrontal cortex. If learning new skills feels like hard work, that’s because it really is. The good news is that, though arduous, self-improvement isn’t impossible. We can all get better at self-discipline by employing tricks like physically moving short-term temptations away (no more cookies in the cupboard!) and picturing the eventual reward of long-term decisions (do I want another cocktail now, or a house in ten years?). So cultivate your self-discipline, and when a lucky opportunity pops up, you’ll be well placed to capitalize on it, just as Derek Sivers was. Who you know is more important than what you know. Yes, it’s a cliché but for a good reason as it contains an element of truth. You may be the best in the world at what you do, but if you don’t make the right social connections, you won’t get any lucky breaks. In 1989, sociologist Katherine Giuffre tried to get an idea of how social connections affected success by examining the people and relationships within the New York fine art photography scene. She found three groups. First, there were strugglers – people who were unsuccessful in their careers. Second, there was a group of photographers with stable, long-term connections with the same curators and artists. They were doing okay, but their careers weren’t taking off. And then there was the third group – successful photographers regularly receiving attention from major art journals. This group was different. Its members had more social ties and knew more people, who, in turn, knew still more people. In short, they had a huge network. Giuffre noted that a lot of art delivered by the first two groups was simply filtered out into obscurity. The art wasn’t necessarily worse – in some cases, it was mind-blowing – but the photographers lacked the right social connections to get ahead. So a fine art photographer who can strike up a positive, engaging conversation with anyone is more likely to get ahead, and the same goes for all of us. But most of us can’t effortlessly chat up a journalist at a gallery opening. We enter into social interactions with nervousness or inhibitions, or we misinterpret the meaningless gestures of our interlocutor. We see them cross their arms and interpret it as “stay away,” not simply “I forgot my sweater today.” This kind of caginess can easily inhibit real connections, so, to get around it, you should demonstrate expressive interest in other people. Make crystal clear that you are genuinely interested in the other person. Send unmistakably friendly signals, like smiles and leaning in, and make open, welcoming gestures. If you are unmistakably pleasurable to be around, people will open up and warm to you quickly. Remember that humans are social animals. Just as we’re hardwired to enjoy sex and food consumption, we’re instinctively drawn to friendly smiles and welcoming body language. Tony Hsieh’s first business failure came when he was nine years old. His business plan was simple. Acquire a box of worms. Let them reproduce. Sell the new worms for a profit. Sadly, his due diligence didn’t identify a risk: all the worms might escape, along with any prospect of profit (this happened). But Hsieh wasn’t deterred from an entrepreneurial life. He was relentlessly curious and loved to explore new opportunities. He started a newsletter as a child and sold advertising space. At Harvard, he learned about bartending and – less conventionally – how to milk cows. He turned a profit by buying McDonald’s burgers for $1 and reselling them in dorms for $3. Hsieh never set out to be CEO of an online shoe retailer. In fact, when an entrepreneur first pitched him the idea of Zappos, Hsieh demurred. He wasn’t particularly passionate about or interested in shoes. But, as ever, he was curious. The market opportunity intrigued him. And it’s good that it did, because, by 2008, Zappos was turning over $1 billion in sales. Eventually, Amazon acquired the company, making Hsieh a multimillionaire. Many people aren’t curious, and, as a result, they neither get nor take any shots at success. As we’ve seen, our default mental setting is to stick with the familiar. The unknown – for instance, turning up at a party where we don’t know anyone – often feels threatening. Our brain switches to inhibition mode and we do nothing. Being cautious, or curious, about new things is self-perpetuating. If you don’t go to that party, you are missing a chance to get better at handling new things, and your commitment to the status quo strengthens. If you do go to that party, perhaps you’ll meet someone new, who will invite you to another party, and then another, until you eventually meet someone special – your future spouse, perhaps, or a new friend or an entrepreneur with a great business idea. So try to recognize that while your brain’s default is to stick to the familiar, you can make the decision to do something new. And there are ways to make that easier. You can build your social network because friends often help us do new things. Or you can save money, so you have a cushion if you want to take some risks. Or you can reduce your stress levels and work on your confidence so that taking that leap into the unknown feels easier. Say yes to things. Stay curious. In the end, you might just get lucky. The key message in these blinks: Life often feels random, as though luck is what separates the best from the rest. And it’s true that many events are outside of our control. But when we start to understand how our brains work, and how invisible biases and patterns influence our behavior, we can learn how to be luckier. So do your best to position yourself for luck. Expand your social network, stay curious and say yes to new opportunities. Actionable advice: Maximize your lucky opportunities by regularly trying new things.   Try out and learn different activities as much as possible. Learn computer programming, study French or try out a new sport. Maybe you’ll stumble upon a world-class talent you never knew you had, or meet your next business partner in class.

In most cases, a job interview at a consultancy is not just another job interview with an assortment of questions about your endeavors and prior experiences. You have to be ready to answer questions that can be both quantitative and qualitative, and that can take the form of a case, such as what’s the current market size for product X? And that’s where these blinks can make a big difference. They’ll help you get an overview of the different types of questions that you’re likely to encounter and, more importantly, how to answer them in order to get the job offer you’re looking for. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to perform complex arithmetic estimates, precisely and quickly; when proxies come in handy; and why you should expect that your interviewer might act somewhat aggressively. Have you ever gone for an interview at a major consulting firm? If so you’ll know that it won’t just be a conversation about your qualifications; rather, it will entail solving hands-on business cases. These are called case interviews and they tend to feature quantitative questions that come in two types. The first is math questions – problems that involve some sort of arithmetic, percentage calculation or interpretation of data. An example of such a question would be, “if the total innovation capital of company A is X and it were to grow at five percent per year, which of the following is the minimum annual growth of human capital necessary for the firm to represent more than half of total innovation capital within ten years?” Questions like this can be daunting. But the key is to answer them as quickly as possible, which takes lots of practice. No matter how much of a math whiz you are, your brain is a muscle that needs regular training to perform optimally. In fact, even candidates with PhDs in physics or the highest marks in college math classes can fail at these questions if they don’t practice enough. So, it’s essential to take on daily drills that improve your speed and confidence. But how? One way is to practice old interview questions. For instance, you can become faster by searching for the types of questions asked by firms like McKinsey or the Boston Consulting Group. By doing so, you’ll begin to “automate” your reasoning and be able to respond to such questions in a snap. But keep in mind that test questions are always changing, and it’s important to get the most recently administered tests so that you’re up to date. Now that you know about math questions it’s time to learn about the second style of quantitative questions: computational-level estimates. So what exactly is a computational question? It’s a problem wherein you’re given a few facts and tasked with using them to make estimates. Answering such problems successfully requires precise arithmetic using large numbers – no easy task. But as a matter of fact, performing complex mathematical equations in your head can be done precisely and quickly if you break them up. For instance, you might be asked: “You have a market of 3 million customers, assume a 15 percent market share and revenue of $200 per customer. What is your total revenue?” To break this down you could first find the total value of the market, which is 3 million buyers x $200 = $600 million. Then, to calculate 15 percent of 600 million, you can break the 15 percent into 10 percent and 5 percent to find that 10 percent of 600 million = 60 million and 5 percent of 600 million = 30 million. Now all you’ve got to do is simple addition: 60 million + 30 million = 90 million. But arriving at an exact number isn’t always necessary. In fact, in many cases you’ll simply need to reach a rough estimate, and you can do so by cleverly rounding numbers. This is helpful because rough estimations will let you perform equations much more quickly. So, take a variation of the above question in which the market is 42 million customers, the market share is 12.7 percent and revenue is still $200 per buyer. What’s the total revenue? Obviously, there’s no way to arrive at a precise answer rapidly in your head, and this is where precise estimates come into play: Begin by rounding 42 million buyers to 40 million. Then, round 12.7 percent up to 15 percent. It’s important that you round this number up to counterbalance your rounding down to 40 million. Now you can just solve the problem like before to come up with $1.2 billion in revenue, a close approximation of the precise answer of $1.07 billion. So, rounding can help you solve complex math problems easily – but what about determining a product’s market size? It’s a piece of cake, and here’s how: First, remember that the purpose of such questions is to see how you approach them. In fact, arriving at the correct answer is more or less irrelevant. With that in mind, your next move is to find proxies, that is, other factors that can help you arrive at your answer. Say you’re asked the question, how many hamburgers does the average drive-thru sell per day? In this case, your proxies will be things that help you calculate hamburger sales. For instance, your initial proxies might be the number of cars that visit the establishment daily and the average number of burgers each car orders. But once you’ve found your proxies, it’s important that you carefully identify and keep in mind their limits; after all, a proxy is merely a rough estimate to guide your prediction. For instance, during peak hours, it might be that the drive-in can’t serve all its potential customers. It’s essential to account for this imperfection and break sales into peak and off-peak times. During peak times, sales are limited by the number of hamburgers the staff can churn out; to determine this, you need further proxies like the number of counters and the average time an order takes. But for off-peak times, your calculations will only depend on the number of cars and the average size of their purchase. For example, say you make the following assumptions: every day has four peak hours and eight off-peak hours. A hundred cars pass through during every peak hour and 30 cars visit the establishment during every off-peak hour. The drive-in has two counters and each car takes three minutes to make the average purchase of two hamburgers. Therefore, all off-peak customers can be served given the shop’s 40 car per hour capacity. Given these assumptions, you can determine off-peak sales by multiplying 8 hours x 30 cars x 2 hamburgers per car = 480 hamburgers per day. Then you can find peak hour sales by multiplying 40 cars x 2 hamburgers per car = 320 hamburgers, which brings the daily total to 800. If you find yourself at a case interview, you might be confused as to why interviewers ask you to make so many obscure estimations. How could somebody possibly determine how many hamburgers a drive-thru sells? Interviewers test prospective employees with these kinds of questions to simulate what clients will ask you if you become a consultant. In essence, case interviews are test runs for your future job as a consultant – and you ought to act like it. To do so, you need to know what your interviewers are looking for and why they ask the questions they do. For instance, if you know someone who has already had an interview at a big consultancy, they might have mentioned that the interviewers can be aggressive at times, constantly asking you to make estimations. Why? Because that’s what clients do. As such, the best way to approach an interview is to think of the interviewer as a client and yourself a professional consultant. Simply answer the questions as you would to best represent your company’s reputation. But consultants don’t just need the ability to answer questions with laser precision and demonstrate strong analytical skills. They also need top-notch interpersonal skills. In fact, even if you answer a question perfectly, if you’re nervous and fidgety you likely won’t get the job. Clients simply won’t trust recommendations from a nervous consultant. Say a consultant advises a client to let go of 3,000 employees while the consultant himself is sweating and shaking. Would the client really want to take this pivotal advice from such an anxious source? Probably not, which is why it’s crucial to emanate confidence. Now that you’ve found this important piece of the puzzle, you can easily approach case interview questions like “how can I boost my profits or turn around my failing business?” So, you’ve learned how to tackle quantitative questions. But your interviewer might also throw some general business questions your way, like “why am I losing money?” or “should we merge with this company?” Handling such questions is no problem as long as you utilize frameworks. For instance, you can use the profitability framework to conduct a quantitative analysis. It works by breaking profit into two groups based on its components: revenue and cost. Once you’ve done this you can do the mathematical operations one at a time to find the core of the problem. Say you are asked “why is the company losing money?” You simply break profit into revenue, the price per unit x the number of units sold, and cost, the cost of production per unit x units sold. You can even split the cost per unit into fixed and variable costs. By utilizing this framework you’ll be able to see the business quantitatively. Doing so might lead you to discover that the variable costs are too high, causing an increase in total cost and, therefore, decreasing profit. But figuring out that variable costs are too high isn’t much help if you don’t know why. To figure that out you’ll need the business situation framework. You can use this framework to analyze a client’s business, industry and market. It dissects these qualitative facets by uncovering information on four sub-segments of business: customers, product, company and competition.  The first, customers, is about who buys the product and whether the base breaks into segments with different needs. When it comes to a product, you need to define what is being sold as well as how it’s packaged and produced. Defining the company means identifying its distribution channels, organizational structure and other relevant parts of the business. And finally, competition is about how much market share competitors hold and whether they’re doing things that your client’s company isn’t. By applying this framework you might discover that your client’s firm has high costs because of, say, a new package design that is overly complicated and wastes lots of material and money. The key message in this book: Most interviews at consultancies break down into two types of questions: quantitative questions and cases. Keeping a few simple tricks in mind, you’ll be well prepared to tackle both of them and land your dream job at a major consultancy.  Got feedback?

These companies are now among the most influential in the world; it would be hard to exaggerate the enormity of the role they play in the lives of most westerners. But, like many success stories, it’s not all rainbows and sunshine. A closer look at how these companies actually work reveals a stormier picture. In these blinks, you’ll find out why foreign workers for tech companies put up with really bad conditions; how Google has left most of the work to non-humans; and why being smart isn’t necessarily the most important thing for Silicon Valley success. When Europeans were trying to reach America in the eighteenth century, many paid for their passage by submitting to several years of indentured servitude. While tech geeks seeking work in twenty-first century America don’t have it quite that bad, they still face a pretty rough deal. Being allowed to work in Silicon Valley isn’t easy for an immigrant, and the process often leads to exploitation. One solution is to obtain an H-1B visa: a nonimmigrant visa for foreign workers. However, only a limited number of these are available. In 2013, 200,000 foreign workers hoping for employment in Silicon Valley applied for an H-1B visa, but only 16,000 were approved. And the ones lucky enough to be approved are then totally at the mercy of their boss. If they’re fired or the company shuts down, their visa is no longer valid, a state of insecurity that often results in their feeling forced to accept a smaller salary than their American colleagues. As a result, the corporations are the big winners. They get highly skilled employees who will work for less, and these employees have to endure five years of this exploitation before they can apply for a green card, which gives them better rights and permanent-residence status. It’s no surprise that immigrants want to avoid all this. And the easiest way to do that is with a fake marriage. The US immigration system is friendlier with those who are trying to start a family. In fact, immediate-relative or family-preference visas account for two thirds of all successful immigration applicants. Surprisingly, for this method to work, you don’t even have to marry an American citizen. Stanis Argyris is a Greek computer specialist who wanted to join the author’s start-up team in 2008. So Argyris married a Turkish woman who, under a student visa, was studying at Stanford University. Now Argyris could obtain a student-spouse visa, stay in the country and finally work at the author’s company. Sure, life would be a lot easier if you could print your own money. But since this is a highly punishable crime, the next best thing would be to create a company like Google. One of Silicon Valley’s greatest success stories, Google is a sensational money-making machine. Every year, Google generates around $70 billion in revenue, a number so staggeringly large that you might be wondering, “How can a search engine generate that much cash?” For starters, it offers answers to many of life’s pressing questions, from “What’s the best camera under $300?” to “Who’s a good divorce lawyer in the area?” But Google also generates ads for companies related to your searches – and earns money every time someone clicks on one. The amount of money Google earns from a given click depends on the keyword being used and how many companies are bidding on it. A popular one like “insurance” can be worth as much as $54 per click. Perhaps even more remarkable is that Google hardly breaks a sweat dealing with all the bidding companies since they have an ingenious way of letting computers do the work for them. This, of course, makes good sense. There are billions of different keywords people search for, and figuring out how to sell individual ad space for each one would be virtually impossible. To solve this problem, Google holds an automated, instantaneous and lightning-quick auction. It starts the moment a search is initiated: Google’s computers quickly scan through all the pre-placed bids that advertising companies have made for this keyword. When this happens, two things are being taken into consideration: the highest bids and who has the best chance of being clicked on. The ad that best combines these two criteria will be featured at the top of the search results. This is why multiple searches for the same term might produce different results. If you search for “London Furniture” today, the winning bid might go to the handcrafted furniture company Swoon Editions; next week, however, it might go to the luxury furniture providers Unum Design. If you’re a thrill-seeker looking for a risky adventure, you might try bungee jumping or whitewater rafting. Or you could evade travel and the risk to your body by investing in a start-up. Chances are, you won’t have any trouble finding an opportunity, since start-ups are always looking for risk-friendly investors. A start-up begins its search for funding with what’s called a seed round. This is when the company’s entrepreneurs collect money from friends and family, while hoping to land big-time investors. These early investors are in a risky position for two reasons: The company could either fail and they’ll never see their money again, or the company could become too successful and they’ll end up with a microscopic share. Let’s say a friend offers $100,000 in seed money, and that this original loan is turned into an equity investment after the company, which has done well, decides to go public. And let’s say the start-up is valued at $10 million: since 100,000 divided by 10 million equals 0.01, the friend who invested $100,000 would now be the proud owner of one percent of the company. Obviously, one percent isn’t a great outcome, so to help prevent the phantom of such scenarios from scaring off potential investors, start-ups offer special deals. One attractive offer is to place a cap, or a maximum amount, on the company’s valuation. This prevents an investor’s share from getting too small. Let’s return to the friend who invested $100,000, and say the company agreed to place a $3-million cap on their initial valuation. This would give the friend 3.3-percent ownership when the company launches. Even if the company were to eventually be valued at $100 million, the friend’s initial percentage would grow alongside the company. While this offer can make one risk seem less troublesome, the fact that the company can still fail remains an unavoidable concern. Many parents dream of having children who’ll grow up to be both successful and truly kind. These parents might not want their children to enter the start-up world. There, success is most definitely not the result of niceness. As we’ll see, both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs used rather ruthless methods on the path to riches. Coming from a wealthy Seattle family, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University before starting a small tech company called Microsoft in 1975. Around this time, some trusty connections at IBM told Gates that the computer giant was looking for a new operating system. And Gates knew a guy perfect for the job: the IT genius Gary Kildall. But to Gates’s surprise, Kildall refused to agree to the terms of IBM’s contract. This is when Gates stopped playing nice. Knowing Kildall was sitting on a gold mine, he had a Microsoft programmer copy Kildall’s operating system and rename it IBM’s Disk Operating System (DOS). After Gates registered the copyright under his own name, the innovative system, which made it possible for computer hardware to be interchangeable, became the property of Microsoft. Hence the well-known acronym: MS-DOS. As a result, both Kildall and IBM saw not a cent of the billions that began pouring Gates’s way. Steve Jobs was also known for his unkindness, even when he first started out. Jobs began as an unpopular employee at Atari, the company behind the table-tennis-like video game, Pong. In 1975, the company’s CEO, Nolan Bushnell, offered a reward of several thousand dollars to anyone who could create a single-player version of Pong. Eager to win, Steve Jobs enlisted the help of his friend Steve Wozniak, who could solve just about any technical problem. Jobs pushed hard until Wozniak finally cracked the problem. Jobs won the prize money. Then Jobs told Wozniak that the prize was only $700 – not a few thousand – and handed him just $350 for his troubles. Okay, so billionaire tech giants like Gates and Jobs also do have a reputation for being rather smart. But if you want to make it in the world of Silicon Valley, there are other qualities that trump intelligence. One of these qualities – perhaps the most important when launching a start-up – is obsessiveness. Before the author founded AdGrok, a start-up that optimizes GoogleAds, he was at the bottom of his PhD class, even having to retake a number of exams. He envied many of the computer programmers around him, people who were far brighter and more talented than he was. Though not as intelligent as some, Martinez was obsessive. And this is the quality that brought him success in Silicon Valley. While working on the AdGrok project, he was so focused that nothing else mattered. Life was simply one tech event or company retreat after another; he worked ridiculous hours each day; and he watched his daughters growing and changing on Skype rather than in person. Work eclipsed his life. He gave up family life. He gave up his hobbies. He stopped reading books and watching movies, and removed all distractions until AdGrok launched. It’s not a pleasant way to live, but Martinez was rewarded for his obsessiveness. In 2011, AdGrok was purchased by Twitter for over $10 million. Another extremely important quality that can help launch a start-up is a refusal to give up. Some people, like the author, develop this quality early on. Martinez attributes his success to having made it through a tough childhood that included a sadistic older sister, a bullying father and frequent schoolyard fights. By persevering through a harsh childhood, Martinez developed a never-give-up attitude that he later applied to the time he spent on the Wall Street trading floor and the endless challenges he faced during AdGrok’s launch. The kind of determination and will-to-win shown by Martinez is contagious. And, in the history of start-ups, there is perhaps no better example of an obsessively dedicated team rising to a challenge than what happened at Facebook’s headquarters in 2011. That was the year Google challenged Facebook’s status as the premier social platform with the launch of Google Plus. It was a serious challenge. Google had lost some of its most talented employees to the younger start-up, and now it was time to finally go on the offensive. Google already had many popular products, like Gmail and YouTube, that promoted Google Plus. And when it launched, its design, photo- sharing features and ad policies were all superior to Facebook’s. But Facebook wasn’t just going to roll over; their reaction was immediate and showed that the company had cultivated a loyal and dedicated team of employees. All they needed was the right motivation, and that’s exactly what their leader, Mark Zuckerberg, provided. Once he heard about Google Plus, he immediately put the company on “Lockdown,” ordering all employees to remain on-site and work 24/7 until the threat was neutralized. Zuckerberg isn’t a naturally gifted speaker, but to rally his employees, he rose to the occasion and delivered a rousing speech that demanded Facebook’s quality be improved in record time. For the climax of the speech, Zuckerberg quoted the Roman senator Cato the Elder by declaring, “Carthage must be destroyed!” Obviously, Google Plus was Carthage to Zuckerberg’s Rome. His employees responded. They turned the challenge into an event by whipping-up Roman costumes and posters and quickly redesigning Facebook’s functionality and photo-sharing options to be in line with Google Plus. So, in the end, Facebook’s customers saw little reason to leave. And Zuckerberg showed that a company with a loyal corporate culture eager for motivation can rise to the toughest challenges. Some of Facebook’s major battles have been widely reported on. But, behind the scenes, there is a constant series of skirmishes, and a team of employees who are always in the fray, protecting Facebook’s customers. If you have Facebook, you probably use it to keep in touch with friends and play games and stay abreast of current events. But you’re probably unaware that, while you’re checking out photos and chatting with pals, Facebook’s security team is shielding you from disturbing content. Online security is one of the biggest challenges for internet start-ups, and security teams must review all ads and be on the lookout for an array of online threats: scammers, sexual predators, pornographers and so on. Since this work is done largely in the shadows, it is a thankless job. It tends to be recognized only when something goes wrong or slips through the cracks, in which case the security is thrown to the wolves. In fact, most of the time people get angry about the work they do and call them out for censorship when they accidentally flag something like a breast-feeding photo. Since users often forget to show gratitude for the accurate and beneficial flagging of harmful content, and perhaps also to make up for their usual anonymity, Facebook’s security team created a Facebook group called Scalps@Facebook. Here, the photos and profiles of the criminals they have taken down are listed alongside a description of the crimes they’ve committed. But aside from this group page, there are good reasons for Facebook to keep the team’s work under wraps. The biggest reason is that if people knew the sordid details of all the many crimes and attempted crimes, it could very well deter people from using Facebook. Many users are already concerned about their online privacy and safety, and if they were notified of every sex offender and scammer that was caught on Facebook, they might think twice about using it. While the security team would be honored, parents would likely make sure their children stayed away altogether. In the end, it’s another example of the many exciting – and unsettling – things that are going on behind the scenes at Silicon Valley. The key message in this book: Silicon Valley can be a ruthless and competitive place. Yes, friends have been known to stab each other in the back to reach the next rung on the ladder of success, but Silicon Valley offers some fun and inspirational stories as well. For those willing to sacrifice everything for a shot at becoming the next start-up millionaire, Silicon Valley might be just the right place.  Actionable advice Develop your grit.

Thinking about success this way can make it seem rather daunting. After all, your chances of starting the next industry-conquering giant, creating the next viral product sensation or becoming the next multibillion-dollar start-up founder are pretty slim. But do you really want to be that big? Do you want your life to revolve around making money, finding new markets and managing large organizations on an ever-increasing scale? Or would you rather be able to enjoy the independence of owning your own company without having to sacrifice your life on the altar of the “bigger is better” definition of success? Would you rather be able to work a limited number of hours per year and spend the rest of them doing other things you care about, such as enjoying quality time with your family, traveling or pursuing hobbies? If these questions leave you intrigued by the notion of thinking smaller about success, then these blinks are for you! In them, you’ll learn how to turn a side gig into a profitable, sustainable small-scale company; how to find a sense of satisfaction with your work; and how to do all of that without needing loads of money to get started. The ethos of modern capitalism can be summarized in a single word: “more.” On one side of the economic equation, there’s the average consumer, who’s continually seeking to buy more products and services to consume. On the other side, there’s the average business, which is continually seeking to sell more products and services to grow its profits. The moment it reaches one revenue goal, it sets the target even higher – $1 million, then $10 million and so forth. In short, nothing is ever enough. Consumers and businesses alike are driven by an insatiable desire for evermore consumption and growth – generally speaking, at least. There are exceptions. Joining the chorus of consumers who are trying to limit their consumption, some businesses are also starting to say “enough is enough.” In lieu of endless expansion, they’re seeking a more stable, satiable, and sustainable approach to growth. By exercising self-restraint, these businesses can pursue a financial goal that turns the traditional corporate model on its head. That goal is simple: to earn just enough revenue to enable their owners and employees to secure the amount of comfort, autonomy and free time that they want their lives to have. By turning that desire into the center of gravity around which their operations are focused, these businesses are able to revolve around the individuals who run them, rather than the other way around. Those individuals become the businesses’ unit of measure – a unit of one. Whether they consist of a single owner-operator, a team of a couple hundred employees or something in between, we can therefore call them companies of one. Counterintuitively, whereas most businesses set ever-escalating growth targets, companies of one set firm growth limits to keep themselves small. For example, Sean D’Souza runs a company of one called Psychotactics, which provides consultancy services. His growth limit is $500,000 in profit per year. Even though he could make more money if he wanted to, he purposefully chose to restrict his company to this profit goal. Why not more? Well, to borrow a famous line from rapper the Notorious B.I.G.: more money, more problems. Generally speaking, more profits require more production, sales and customers, which, in turn, require more employees, infrastructure and bureaucracy. That means more exhaustion, oversight and work time, which means less comfort, autonomy and free time. And that defeats the whole purpose of starting a company of one! For his part, D’Souza would rather be playing with his kids and taking three-month vacations. If you feel a similar way, then a company of one might be the way for you to go as well! A “company of one” might sound like a fancy way of calling oneself a small business or a freelancer – but there are important distinctions between these three forms of self-employment. When a small business stays small, it’s usually considered a limited success. Some small businesses are OK with that, but many would like to expand their operations, grow their profits and be more successful, in the “bigger is better” definition of success. If given opportunities to become bigger, many small businesses would seize them in a heartbeat. In contrast, companies of one would decline them if they’d already reached their growth limits. For them, staying small isn’t a mark of failure; it’s part of their very definition of success: achieving and sustaining a self-defined level of income. However, a small business and a company of one do have one important thing in common: they both seek profits. They invest a certain amount of time or money in their operations, and they eventually get more money out of them, if all goes well. Usually, that investment requires an upfront expenditure of labor. For a company of one, that could mean designing t-shirts, developing software or producing an online learning course. Once the products are finished, the company can start reaping money from them without needing to do much further work – especially if they’re data-based ones that can be reproduced with virtually no additional labor. In contrast, a freelancer generally stops earning income the moment she stops working. She gets paid a certain amount of money either per hour or per piece of work, which requires a certain amount of time to complete. Either way, her time is money – and her money requires time. Unlike a company of one, a freelancer generally doesn’t get to profit off her product after she’s done working on it. A freelance web designer, for instance, doesn’t get to design a single website and then sell it to multiple buyers; she just enters into a one-time transaction with her client. When it’s done, it’s done, and she moves on to the next client or project. Meanwhile, a company-of-one owner might be off surfing while he’s still earning money for work he did months ago! So freelancing is very different from running a company of one – but the former can be a good stepping stone to the latter, as we’ll see in the next blink. From this point on, we’re going to examine the process of starting a company of one from beginning to end, step by step. Along the way, we’ll look at some of the distinguishing features, goals and strategies of a successful company of one. The first step involves not doing something: namely, don’t quit your day job. Like many companies of one, your new business is probably going to grow out of a side gig. It needs to develop into a sustainable enterprise before you can turn it into a full-fledged company of one and devote yourself to it full-time. Consider Tom Fishburne, who worked in marketing for 20 years. In his free time, he pursued a hobby he’d loved since he was a child: cartooning. At first, he just did it for fun. Then he started taking side gigs, drawing for clients on the weekends and evenings. He didn’t quit his job to pursue cartooning full-time until he’d built up a solid roster of clients and saved up enough money to create a runway buffer – sufficient savings to cover one’s living expenses in the event of a slow month or two. That was seven years ago. Since then, he’s been making twice or even thrice as much money as he ever made as a marketing executive, while enjoying plenty of time with his family and doing something he loves – drawing cartoons for other businesses that want to use them for marketing. This work is part of running Marketoonist, a company of one based in his peaceful, sunny home in Marin County, California. Tom runs the company with his wife, and they sometimes employ freelancers on an as-needed basis – but that’s as far as their expansion has gone. They have a waiting list of clients, so they could definitely make more money if they expanded their operations further. But Tom and his wife don’t want to become the next corporate giant. They just want to enjoy their lives. For Tom, that means cartooning – not managing a gigantic workforce or a network of satellite offices. Tom’s story brings up an important lesson: if further growth would entail making sacrifices that are unacceptable to you, then that’s a clear sign that your company of one has reached its growth limit! Of course, at this point, when you’re just developing a side gig, you’re still a long way off from having to worry about achieving too much growth. So while keeping Tom’s lesson in mind, let’s take a look at the next step in your journey. Now that you’ve resisted the urge to quit your day job, what’s the next step in pursuing a side gig that can grow into a company of one? Well, first you need to find the gig, if you don’t have one already. At this point, your initial inclination might be to listen to the standard advice of business writers and speakers: follow your passion. There’s just one little problem with that advice. Unless you happen to be passionate about something that’s an in-demand, marketable skill, pursuing your passion is probably not going to be a financially viable option. Most people’s passions are out of sync with the demands of the market. Consider a 2003 study by Robert Vallerand, a professor of psychology at the University of Quebec. He asked the students of his university, “What are your passions?” Rather than their majors, most students answered “sports, music or art.” Yet these fields represent only 3 percent of all jobs, so it would be impossible for most of them to successfully pursue these passions. This truth is as sobering as it is vital to remember. You might have a passion for playing tennis – but you’re probably not going to be the next Serena Williams. The same goes for other passions involving activities that only a tiny percentage of people can earn a living from doing. You have to be practical. Ask yourself, what’s something that you’re already good at doing and that other people will pay you to do? If the answer is “nothing,” then what could you get better at doing and turn into a marketable skill? For the author, it was web designing. He didn’t feel passionate about it; he just worked at a design agency, and he’d gotten good at his job. In the course of leaving the agency and starting a web-design company of one, he refined his skill set and became better and better at solving his clients’ problems. This brought him a feeling of satisfaction and enthusiasm for doing the work and seeing the results – a feeling that’s a form of passion! In other words, don’t wait for a financially viable career path to magically materialize from your passion; instead, focus on identifying and developing a marketable skill set now, and allow your passion to emerge from the process of refining, mastering and helping other people with it. In identifying and refining a marketable skill set, you might make a common assumption: the more people who want the product or service that your skill provides, the better. After all, the bigger the market, the bigger the number of potential customers. But by trying to appeal to everyone, you can end up appealing to no one. That’s because aiming yourself at the lowest common denominator means making your product or service as broadly appealing and therefore as generic as possible, which diminishes your brand’s allure. Even large companies can suffer from this. For example, Starbucks originally positioned itself as a chain of stores that offered people the experience of visiting a local, boutique coffee shop. But, around the mid-2000s, with ever more Starbucks stores sprouting up on seemingly every street-corner, and with ever more products on offer within them, the experience of visiting a Starbucks became rather bland. High-quality coffee began to be overshadowed by sandwiches, CDs and a profusion of fancy drinks, and its former semblance of local charm was belied by its ubiquity. Overstretched, the company began to flounder. By the end of the decade, it had closed about 900 stores. Since then, it’s scaled back and refocused on its original mission, having learned the hard way that you can’t be everything to everyone. If that’s not enough to dissuade you from chasing after a mass audience, consider the fact that larger markets attract larger hordes of competitors, which makes it even more difficult to stand out. So look for a niche instead. The smaller and more specific your target audience is, the easier it’ll be to connect and build trust with them. And the more distinct their needs are, the easier it’ll be to learn how to meet them. This will allow you to charge premium prices for your highly tailored, superlatively delivered products or services. That’s what successful e-commerce consultant Kurt Elster has done. Instead of offering general consulting services to all e-commerce businesses (an extremely mass audience), he’s increased his revenue eightfold by positioning himself as a consultant who works exclusively with businesses that use the Shopify e-commerce platform. Think about it this way: if you ran a business on Shopify, who would you rather hire as a consultant, a generalist who claims he can work with anyone – or a specialist like Elster who’s intimately familiar with the platform you use? To tighten the focus of your product or service even further, there are two more strategies you can pursue. The first is to adopt the virtue of simplicity. To see its power in action, consider the small company Casper, which sells mattresses online. Now, mattress companies are a dime-a-dozen – so what sets Casper apart? Well, to begin with, its audience isn’t everyone; it’s the mostly younger people who want a better night’s sleep but don’t want the hassle of visiting a physical mattress store. Then, there’s the way it offers its products: whereas many of its competitors present customers with an overwhelming number of options, Casper makes only three styles of mattresses. Having both narrowed its target audience and simplified their options, Casper then presents a straightforward proposition: upgrade your sleep by buying a better mattress online, avoid the headache of visiting a physical store and rest easy in the knowledge that you can return it for a full refund if you don’t like it after 100 nights. The second strategy involves further amplifying that uniqueness by leveraging your most powerful asset: yourself. You’ll need all the help you can get from it, because even within the smaller pond of a particular niche, you may still be a small fish compared to your competitors, who may be larger, established companies. Fortunately, you can use your apparent disadvantage to your advantage. Yes, you’re just a person – but, by the same token, you have a unique personality, which allows you to brand your enterprise, product or service in an equally unique way. To do this, take an aspect of your personality and integrate it into both your work and the messaging that surrounds it, so that it’s there in everything you do – from your product design or service delivery to your emails, tweets and conversations with your customers. Again, simplicity is the key; you should be able to describe your personality-driven brand with simple adjectives, such as “youthful,” “rebellious,” “sincere,” “competent,” “elegant” or “exciting,” which you can then put a unique spin on – one that’s an authentic expression of who you are. Remember: your competitors can offer similar skills, products or services, but they can’t replicate your personality, and your personality is what’s going to allow you to stand out from the crowd – so let it shine! Assuming you’ve identified your target audience and developed a marketable skill set, you’re now in a position to provide a product or service for which they would be willing to pay money. You just need to convince them to take advantage of your talents! Of course, that’s easier said than done, and there’s a whole process involved in reaching that point. First, you need to connect with your audience and learn about their needs, so you can know how to fulfill them. One way to do that is to reach out to potential clients and offer them free, no-strings-attached consultancy. For example, if you were trying to establish a web-design side gig that could turn into a company of one, you could begin by finding people who were looking for a web designer or had already found one. By having conversations with them about their experiences, you could learn a lot of useful information, such as the manner and places in which they’re searching for web designers, the factors behind their hiring decisions, the objectives they’re trying to fulfill, the problems that lead to bad customer experiences and the questions they have about the web-design process. By answering those questions, you could then begin to position yourself not just as a consultant, but as a trustworthy authority in your field – someone with valuable expertise from which other people can benefit and on which they can depend. But again, you’re not charging any money at this point; you’re not even offering or trying to subtly push your services. You’re genuinely just trying to help your audience, in small but meaningful ways. The word “small” is crucial here. You’re not redesigning someone’s entire website for free or anything like that. You’re just offering answers to questions, as well as advice, second opinions, brainstorming sessions and so forth – mini-consultations, you could call them. By doing all this, you’re both learning about your audience and building a reputation – and developing mutually beneficial relationships with them. Indeed, by the end of your mini-consultations, they’ve already helped you, and you’ve already helped them, and you haven’t even done any paid work for them yet! Having established these relationships and demonstrated their value, who do you think your audience will go to next time they need to pay for a web design service: a stranger – or you, the person they already know and trust as an authority in the field? In the author’s own experience, the answer was the latter; nearly everyone with whom he consulted went on to want to hire him. Once you’ve established your reputation, authority and relationships with potential clients, you’ve reached the point where you can start doing “real” business and actually make some money. So now it’s time to put the pedal to the metal – quitting your job, renting an office, ordering fancy business cards and so forth, right? Well, hold on. You should keep your job until your embryonic enterprise is more grown-up, and you should seriously reconsider making any large investments in it. They’re probably unnecessary. A slew of technological developments allow you to bypass large investments that would have been necessary in the past. A remote contractor can provide you with the services of an IT department. Free analytics software allows you to gain valuable insights into your website visitors without hiring a cyber guru. If you actually do need to make larger investments, then your plan is probably too grandiose. You should be thinking and behaving smaller at this point. As a future company of one, your goal isn’t to act like a traditional start-up that makes huge upfront investments in the hope of earning even huger profits in the distant future. Your goal is to become a profitable business as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. That’s because unlike a traditional start-up, you can’t rely on external investors pumping enormous injections of capital into your company. Ultimately, that’s a good thing, because it allows you to be much more independent than a start-up, which is beholden to its investors and needs to gain their approval before changing directions. But it also means you don’t have the luxury of burning through cash while you take months or even years to become profitable. The more time you spend getting set up to make money, the more time you’re not earning income from your business. And the more money you spend on establishing it, the more difficult it becomes to make an income. After all, the greater your upfront costs, the greater the revenue you need to generate to break even, let alone make a profit. It’s therefore imperative to roll out a sellable product or service as quickly and inexpensively as you can. It doesn’t need to be perfect – just good enough to get the ball rolling! Once it’s rolling, your business can then start to grow through a gradual snowball effect, which we’ll look at next. Your initial product or service will probably be a pretty modest affair: just a few clients, projects or sales from a small-scale product run. But those few clients, projects or sales can lead to more clients, projects or sales, which can lead to even more of them, and so forth and so on, leading to a snowball effect. That’s what happened for Alexandra Franzen, who left her career in radio broadcasting to become a professional writer about ten years ago. She didn’t succeed overnight; at the beginning, she landed only three projects. But each of those projects led to another and then another, as her initial clients hired her again or referred her to new clients. Fast-forward to the present, and she now has so many clients and projects that she has an almost year-long waiting list! A similar thing happened when Jeff Sheldon founded Ugmonk, a small and highly successful clothing company. With the help of a $2,000 loan, he created just four t-shirt designs and produced a small run of only 200 shirts, which quickly sold out. The success of this first run led to a second and then a third run, and he was able to pay back his loan and turn a profit almost immediately. While continuing to live off the income of his day job, he invested that profit back into his company, which allowed him to finance further production without further cost to himself. For the first two years, he ran Ugmonk out of his apartment. Only when he needed more space did he invest in a warehouse, which brings us to another important point: it’s OK to make larger investments in a company of one – but only when the time is right and they’re necessary. Instead of trying to anticipate everything you might need someday and invest in it upfront, just add new equipment, infrastructure, software, contractors or whatever the case might be as your needs arise and your revenue allows. But remember that, as a company of one with a purposefully limited size of operations and level of profit, you’re going to have to fulfill many of your business’s needs yourself. For example, unlike a large company, you can’t just delegate your marketing to a marketer or your customer service to a customer-service representative. You’ll have to become a jack-of-all-trades and take care of most of these things yourself. When you start off on the path of establishing a company of one, your main competitive edge is the extreme smallness of your enterprise, which allows you to be very personable with your clients and to focus on providing them with fantastic customer service. As your company grows, you might be tempted to scale back on that personableness and service – but you do so at your peril. After all, your personableness is a large part of what makes your company likable – and it’ll be hard to convince people to keep sending money your way if they stop liking you! Customer service, in turn, is crucial to succeeding in today’s economy. According to a recent survey conducted by the marketing research firm Harris Interactive, nine out of ten Americans are willing to spend more money on companies that provide excellent customer service, and 79 percent of them have declined a purchase because of bad service. Larger companies also run a risk of losing customers due to their lack of personableness and service, but many of them are fine with that because they adopt a churn and burn approach to their customers. This approach can be summarized as follows: get as many new customers as you can, and wring some money out of them as quickly as you can. If they get dissatisfied with you and leave, oh well – just find more customers to replace them and wring some more money out of them. Besides the questionable ethics of that approach, it’s also just not a viable strategy for a company of one. When your budget is small, customer retention is essential, because consumer research conducted by Econsultancy and Responsys shows it can cost five times as much to add a new customer than to keep an old one. Plus, there are the opportunity costs of customer attrition. On average, a loyal customer’s subsequent purchases make him worth ten times the amount of his initial purchase, according to a study conducted by the White House Office of Consumer Affairs. Finally, the happier you keep your customers, the more likely they are to refer you to other people – and such word-of-mouth referrals are the number-one way that small businesses acquire new customers, according to a study by Verizon and Small Business Trends. Indeed, they’re so powerful that they’re five times more effective than paid online advertisements in terms of boosting sales. So embrace your company’s smallness and continue to treat your customers like friends; as your greatest potential allies, they’ll more than return the favor! Companies of one are small-scale business enterprises that purposefully stay small in order to provide their owners with a sustainable income, a high degree of independence and a healthy work-life balance. Freelancing can be a good stepping stone to starting such an enterprise, and you can develop one by leveraging the power of a marketable skill set, a niche audience, mutually beneficial relationships, simplicity, personality, technology and great customer service.  Actionable advice: Apply the lessons of a Company of One to other areas of business.  You don’t have to be an actual company of one to act like a company of one. Large-scale companies can adopt some of the same principles, and individuals within those companies can apply them to their work as well. For example, the idea of getting a viable product or service to the market as quickly as possible will benefit both a tech-industry giant as a whole and a particular programmer working within it. If you work for a larger company, ask yourself: How can the other principles of a Company of One be applied to your organization or job? Got feedback?

In these blinks, you’ll learn how Andy Schneider turned his backyard poultry interest into a great entrepreneurial success; how Matthew Patrick combined his acting skills and a passion for mathematics and gaming to create great content on YouTube; and how to generate revenue from your content right from the very beginning. If you have a product you want to share with the world, then you have to attract buyers. Now, the traditional approach to marketing mainly focuses on advertising – but, these days, people are all but buried under an avalanche of ads. This makes it hard for advertisers to stand out. So, if advertising isn’t as effective as it used to be, what’s the best way to get your product noticed? Today’s customers are drawn to creative content, not advertising. The Content Council is a global non-profit organization focused on content marketing. Their studies show that 61 percent of people are more likely to buy a company’s products when that company provides content that is uniquely tailored to a specific audience. These statistics are supported by the marketing hub, Content+, whose research indicates that 70 percent of consumers prefer becoming familiar with a company through articles and content rather than advertisements. While this shift from advertising to creative content is a significant change from traditional marketing practices, it’s actually great news for small business owners and start-ups. Back in the day, if a company wanted to reach millions of people, they’d have to run a costly advertising campaign. But today, even the smallest companies have access to the technology and platforms needed to create and use the kind of content that can build a large and loyal customer base. These methods also afford you the opportunity to get a competitive advantage by better understanding your customers’ needs. Unlike traditional advertising, content offers important and immediate insight into what your potential customers connect with. Pay attention to how potential customers engage and respond to your content by, for instance, reading the comments they leave and tracking how they share it. You can even do this during the production phase of your product. By creating content and keeping an eye on what your potential customers are most excited about, you can focus on those aspects. This will help ensure its success when it goes to market. Before you can put content to use, you need to identify what you want to write about. So, the first step on the path to success is locating your sweet spot: the combination of something you are especially skilled at, or knowledgeable about, and something you are passionate about. Passion is important. If you’re starting a business, you should be prepared to stick with it for the long haul – a task that will be easier if you’re truly passionate about it. To figure out your sweet spot, try making two lists. First, list all the things you are knowledgeable about, and then everything you’re skilled at. Finally, consider what you are passionate about and what gets you motivated; it could be anything, from cooking tasty meals to helping others. Entrepreneur Andy Schneider’s passion is teaching and his unique skill is raising chickens in his backyard. Before long, Schneider realized he wasn’t alone; a lot of other people were interested in raising their own chickens and regularly asked him for information. Schneider saw an opportunity to put his passion for teaching into action by holding regular meetings about backyard poultry in Atlanta. Five years later, Schneider had a radio show, a magazine and a book. Today, he travels around the United States, leading workshops and helping others. Schneider found his sweet spot by combining his knowledge of chickens and his passion for teaching. But he also found the right audience. Finding your audience is a crucial part of getting a business off the ground. You need to know whom you’re trying to connect with if you’re going to create relevant content. When you’re starting out, it’s best to try to focus on just one audience and worry about the rest later. Andy Schneider could’ve tried connecting with students or amateur farmers, but he wisely focused on a perfect audience: homeowners with an interest in raising their own chickens. His success even earned him an apt nickname – “the chicken whisperer.” Once you’ve discovered your own sweet spot, which is also your business niche, there’s just one more step before you start producing content. First, you have to create your own content tilt. This will help make your content different from all the other content that’s already out there and, hopefully, make it unique, memorable and valuable. There are several ways to go about this. Let’s say your sweet spot has led you to the business of home-office decoration. To pinpoint your content tilt, you could peruse social media platforms to see what your target audience is talking about and then figure out what new and unique perspective you might be able to add. You could also be more direct and come up with an online survey to find out what your potential customers are looking for or even ask them face-to-face. Once you’ve found your content tilt and put your business or service out into the world, you should be prepared to put your expertise to work. Your unique content should attract people who are interested in what you have to offer. And your knowledge and skill should make you a go-to person for information, thus growing your audience and helping you achieve expert status. But, for this to happen, you need to do three things: focus on your niche, highlight the special knowledge and skills that you can offer and let your target audience know what they can expect. The last item is something you can write down and share with your audience in the form of a mission statement. For example, Darren Rowse, the founder of the Digital Photography School, has a clear mission statement on his website, where he also offers amateur photographers some simple tips to get the most out of their cameras. Rowse’s content attracted visitors and had them coming back for more. Eventually, he became an in-demand resource for his niche audience of digital-photography enthusiasts. The right kind of content should attract customers like bees to pollen, but for your target audience to find that content, you need the right platform. Your choice of platform should be a channel that is perfectly suited for your target audience, one that makes it easy for them to connect with your content. So, what is the right channel for your audience? A blog, a podcast? Or maybe a YouTube channel, a WordPress website or a printed magazine? These are the questions you need to ask yourself. Matthew Patrick found the right platform for his audience in YouTube and has since become a famous internet personality with a series called Game Theory. Before that, he was a struggling out-of-work actor with a background in neuroscience. Patrick had a sweet spot – science, acting and a passion for gaming. So, he decided to combine these things and make a video series on YouTube to prove to the entertainment industry that he could find and hold on an audience. And it worked: he quickly had a regular and loyal following of young gaming fanatics. Once you have the right platforms in place, you’ll need a content calendar to keep your channel active. It can be overwhelming to keep your audience hooked, so a content calendar will help you stay organized and on track to deliver creative content over a long-term period. You can also keep track of your goals on the calendar by writing down the desired outcome for every piece of content and giving yourself a date to check back in and see if you’ve hit the mark. For example, you might want to see if your content got the right amount of positive feedback, or if it increased sales over a certain period of time. By keeping track of such things, you’ll be able to learn and adjust. Once you’ve found the best way to reach your target audience, the next goal should be to turn that audience into loyal subscribers. There are many ways for you to contact your target audience, including through social-media sites like Facebook and Twitter, but the best method is via email. Email subscribers are more important than social media followers; in fact, if you were to create a list of the most important people in your audience, they would be at the very top. For this top-tier audience, you’re not just another person in their feed or business competing for their attention. With email you get total control of the content they receive and the ability to reach out to them whenever you want. For example, you could send them a daily newsletter that highlights your original content or a weekly newsletter that also includes information about exciting trends in your industry. Another way to build a loyal audience is to make sure your content can be found by someone who’s looking for it. Among the different ways to do this is to practice good search engine optimization (SEO). Using good SEO techniques will increase the chances of your content getting picked up by search engines and thereby attracting more people. Without it, a search engine won’t know to include your content about home-office decoration when someone does a search on the topic. Essentially, good SEO means remembering to tag your content with helpful keywords, like “home-office decoration” and “useful tips,” and formatting your content to highlight what it’s about. You can also include relevant links to other websites to help raise your search engine profile. A final way to increase your audience is to work alongside influencers. Bloggers or media sites that already have an audience that naturally overlaps with the group you are trying to attract are perfect influencers. They can help you get more email subscribers by posting content that mentions your website or includes links to your content. Another key to making the most of your content is diversification. The goal is to position yourself as an industry leader, who offers his audience more than just one blog or YouTube channel. So, the first option for diversifying is to simply add different channels. But remember, you should only expand to another channel once your first channel has secured a loyal audience. Many successful entrepreneurs offer content digitally, in print and in person by running a blog, writing books and offering public speaking engagements. So, covering two or all three of these channels could serve as a good goal to reach. If you want to keep things purely digital, another successful way to diversify is to simply add more channels to your current platform. For example, creating a podcast is currently a very trendy way to diversify your content stream. And, to return to the Digital Photography School, Rowse diversified his website by adding a page called Snappin Deals, which highlights sales on photography equipment. Simple moves like this can really help you come across as an industry leader to your audience. A third way to diversify is to buy a content asset. These are content providers who already have a platform as well as an audience in the area you’re looking to expand to. If you want to expand quickly, it makes sense to buy an existing asset and absorb their existing audience, rather than building a new one from the ground up. This is what the photography supply store Adorama did. They purchased the magazine JPG when it was about to go out of business; since the magazine had 300,000 subscribers, this diversification deal was a tremendous boost to their audience. At this point you might be thinking, this is all well and good, but how do I turn these helpful tips into money? While any good business needs to patiently research and find out exactly what their audience wants and needs, there are ways to bring in money from the very start. Once you’re up and running you can experiment with different revenue streams to figure out what works. Game Theory’s Matthew Patrick, for example, was able to immediately generate an income by using ads on his YouTube channel. Over at the Digital Photography School, Rowse used an affiliate-marketing approach to generate income. This method directs Rowse’s audience to the websites of partners who then pay the Digital Photography School for the amount of traffic that is generated through their links. As you get going, you’ll find ever more ways to make money from your content. While most people have one or maybe two sources of income, a successful entrepreneurs has a veritable nexus of income streams. And this is the model you should aim for as well. So, always be on the lookout for additional ways to monetize your content, whether it’s through selling content to advertisers or news outlets, or generating income through magazine or podcast subscription fees. You could also look to crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter or cross-media offers like hosting a webinar or taking part in someone else’s podcast. The most important thing to remember is to keep your eyes open, as new and unexpected ways to make money are constantly popping up. And don’t forget to listen to your audience. Opportunities can come from customer feedback or from someone who heard you speak at an event. As you can see, there are plenty of ways to experiment with earning revenue right from the start. And as your audience grows and you continue to diversify and expand, those opportunities will only become more plentiful and lucrative. The key message in this book: The potential payoff from content management can be huge. It takes time to build a loyal audience, but with the right tools, a good strategy and the right kind of content, you can pull it off. And once you do, you’ll have the asset that all businesses need: a loyal audience.  Actionable advice Use the Google Trends tool to help you find your content niche.

Do you live for taste, savoring each and every new flavor you come across? When you taste a food product, do you think: I could do better than this? If you have dreams of becoming a food entrepreneur, these blinks will help you fulfil them! Based on the real-life stories of other foodies who went on to build successful businesses, these blinks show you just what it takes to get out of your kitchen and into the market.  One thing is for certain: we all need to eat. Starting your own food business can make you rich only if you successfully meet the many challenges along the way. So heat up that pan and sharpen that knife – and take the advice of these seasoned professionals to heart.   In these blinks, you’ll discover why fresh food products face tons of official regulations;  how just a few freebies could bring you instant success; and why when it comes to food products, it’s all about need. You’re constantly told, whether by inspirational books or close friends, to chase your dreams no matter what. But what if you want to start a food business and you’re short on cash? Lacking funding isn’t a dead end. Rather, it’s an opportunity to put your creativity and resourcefulness to the test. Take Maddy D’Amato and Alex Hasulak, founders of Love Grown Foods. While still in college, they cooked up the idea of building a food business using Maddy’s family’s delicious family recipes for granola. Of course being students, they didn’t have much in the way of financing. By day, the two young people lived at their parents’ homes and worked hard at their regular jobs. But by night, for hours they cooked and hand-packaged batches of granola in a catering kitchen, watching movies at the same time to keep them going. This initial phase was tough, but fun! D’Amato and Hasulak proved that with hard work, they could start their business with very little start-up cash. As well as working with limited resources, you should also feel comfortable with selling your product before you actually make it. This sounds risky, but will help you avoid unnecessary spending. The first clients for Love Grown Foods were two neighborhood coffee shops. A great place to start, yet D’Amato and Hasulak had bigger dreams. Hasulak soon managed to close a huge deal with the Aspen City Market. They were worried as they had yet to produce such a large amount of granola – but with many long hours, they made their deadline. Then D’Amato and Hasulak landed a deal with King Soopers, a supermarket in Denver that brought their product to 40 stores. Quickly the chain wanted to sell their product in 80 stores! With this, D’Amato and Hasulak realized they could start working on Love Grown Foods full-time. In an impressive example of scaling, Love Grown Foods was stocked in 1,300 stores a mere 18 months after the duo’s first supermarket deal! It goes without saying that to start a food business, you need to know what your product is. Right?  Well, not necessarily. The best ideas often emerge from trial and error, especially in the food industry. Zak Zaidman, for example, knew that he wanted to support organic farmers in Costa Rica. But it took him a while before he found an actual product to sell successfully.  Zaidman had fallen in love with the Costa Rican landscape, and saw that the use of pesticides in banana farming was destroying this beautiful land. Working conditions on banana farms were also poor, and this inspired Zaidman to do something to improve the situation for workers.  Simply importing bananas wasn’t enough to support the farms and give them an edge in the larger market, so Zaidman considered selling banana vinegar, a local product.  Additionally, Zaidman also imported chocolate and dried fruits. To his surprise, the vinegar didn’t catch on but the chocolate was a hit! Today his company, Kopali Organics, stocks its products in every Whole Foods Market in the United States.  Although Zaidman’s first product didn’t succeed, his backup idea combined with a genuine brand story – organic, fair-trade products – resonated with customers.   Similar to Zaidman’s experience, entrepreneurs Shannan Swanson and Liane Weintraub started their food business without a clear product in mind. As young mothers, the two women wanted to provide children with organic baby food. They knew they wanted their company to lead the market. But how? After meeting with brand strategist Susan White, Swanson and Weintraub decided that their company would be based on three core attributes: genuine, all-organic and most importantly, fun.  Though they eventually switched their product from baby food to kids’ fruit snacks, they remained true to their original brand values.  Many successful food entrepreneurs start their journey with a recipe cooked in their home kitchen. Yet scaling a small recipe from the kitchen to a multi-state business is no easy feat.  Mary Waldner learned that staying personally involved in production is crucial when scaling. She was inspired to start a business for gluten-free products as she had a gluten allergy herself – a condition that in the 1990s was still mostly unheard of.  Waldner made gluten-free crackers. Her friends loved their taste, and encouraged her to take the product further – and Mary Gone Crackers was born. As Waldner’s crackers became increasingly popular, her team decided to open a co-packing operation. Though this was a considerable step forward, it presented other problems. Waldner had less control over her product, and her crackers weren’t being produced to the standards she expected.  So she decided to change tack. After securing venture capital, Waldner opened her own factory. Although she couldn’t produce as much stock, Waldner did have more control over the production process. This raised the quality of her product, and Waldner was happy to let her brand and company grow at a slower but more steady pace.  While sometimes businesses can scale too rapidly, some food entrepreneurs have a tough time scaling at all. Phil Anson wanted to sell fresh burritos as a wholesale product, but struggled with tough food regulations.  As Anson moved production from his Colorado cabin to a commercial kitchen, he realized that fresh wholesale products containing meat were legally required to be made in a USDA-approved facility.  After five years of struggling with cost, distribution nightmares and shelf-life issues, it was clear that his fresh food product was too hard to scale for the wholesale market.  So he did some research and switched to frozen food, as frozen products are far more easily scalable than fresh. Anson’s Evol brand of frozen burritos is now stocked in 7,000 stores – a huge improvement on the 400 that stocked his fresh product. While funding is a challenge for any start-up, it’s a particularly tricky problem for food businesses. With costly manufacturing processes and shelf-life issues, not to mention the constant search for suppliers and transport, it’s often some time before a food business turns a profit.  So how can you make sure your food business survives this tough initial stage? One strategy involves selling your product to retailers before you purchase supplies. For example, Cameron Hughes Wine buys surplus wine in bulk from producers who don’t want to bottle or sell it themselves. The wine is then sold under the Cameron Hughes Wine label.  This sort of business strategy in the wine industry was established in ancient times, and such a wine reseller is called a négociant in French. But how could Cameron Hughes Wine afford such large quantities of stock in the first place? The company makes use of a second strategy. Cameron Hughes sells its wines to bulk retailers. These retailers provide a short-term line of credit that Cameron Hughes uses to purchase the bulk wine.  Once Cameron Hughes Wine delivers the stock, this credit is paid back in full. This sort of strategy is a great way to scale up your business without much initial capital.  Another way to make up for a lack of capital is through equity, or offering shares in your company. When entrepreneur Justin Gold of Justin’s Nut Butters wanted to grow his business, he decided that he’d need the expertise of a senior businessman.  Lance Gentry was his guy, chosen by Gold for his track record, as Gentry had turned another smaller company into a $25 million enterprise. While Gentry was talented, Gold could hardly afford to pay him the high salary he was used to. Instead, Gold gave Gentry shares in his company as remuneration. Gold and Gentry then teamed up to find more investors and distributed the shares fairly between them, so that Gold always had the final word in the business. This network was just what Gold needed to boost his business. In theory, a food entrepreneur can turn any kind of food into a product. But are there certain types of food that are best suited for a business?  Well, there’s really no formula, but more than anything else, success comes when you identify a need for your product to satisfy. Even the simplest products can sell well if they fulfill an important need.  Food entrepreneur Kara Goldin wanted her family to consume less sugary foods. The problem was that most flavored drinks contained artificial sugars. But drinking water was just too boring, especially for her children.  Through her own experience, Goldin had stumbled upon a need for a tasty and refreshing flavored drink made without sugar.  By adding a few pieces of fruit to basic water, Goldin created a subtly flavored drink that she loved, which became the prototype for her product, Hint.  Goldin’s story is a great example of how basic needs can give birth to simple yet desirable products.  Luxury products can also be great at fulfilling certain customer needs. Katrina Markoff had a successful career working at several world-class restaurants. She was fascinated by dynamic flavors, and traveled the world to taste as many flavor combinations as possible.  Yet once home she realized things just didn’t taste as good as they used to. Chocolate manufactured in the United States was too sweet and tasted artificial. She recognized the need for a chocolate that a refined palate would appreciate.  Markoff experimented with recipes herself, inspired by the flavors she’d experienced in India. With some great recipes under her belt, she decided that Vosges Haut-Chocolat, her brand, also needed luxury treatment. The packaging, marketing and eventually the look and feel of her own stores all reflected the luxurious taste of her product.  Who can resist free samples at a store? This type of marketing is simple, and it works. Think about it: experiencing a new, great taste is a quick and easy way to convince a customer to buy.  So why not offer a potential customer a sample before they break out their wallet? Sample promotions are one of the most effective ways to get customers engaged with your food product and the story behind it.  Each of the food entrepreneurs we’ve met in these blinks used sample promotions to get people talking about their product. The duo behind Love Grown Foods even spent their early days traveling from supermarket to supermarket across Colorado to offer granola samples! Yet a campaign like this can be time-consuming. As an alternative, you could advertise your product with a directed campaign. This means that you present samples at locations where you know your target audience spends time or shops.  Keith Belling did this to launch his product Popchips, a low-fat alternative to baked and fried chips.  He began his campaign on the West Coast, knowing that his nutritious snack would fit well with the health-conscious lifestyle in Los Angeles. But once in New York, he knew he had to modify his approach to suit this tougher market.  Belling handed out sample bags not just at grocery stores but also at high-profile events such as Fashion Week. His chips became popular as he targeted influential celebrities personally, by sending them sample packages with a personal handwritten note.  In the course of a year Popchips was stocked in more than 2,000 stores in Manhattan alone! This goes to show that calculated marketing moves can give your business the buzz it deserves. The key message in this book: If you want to turn your passion for locally grown food, healthy eating or fair trade into a business, then dive in! A food business presents plenty of challenges, however. Whether grappling with funding or scaling, if you’re resourceful, creative and hold firm to your brand’s values, you’ll soon taste success as the world savors your innovative product.

Chances are you’ll feel sad and you may give a donation, but that’s it. You’ll soon forget about it, the celebrity will go home and the poverty will remain. So what can we do instead?  Well, you can trust the thinking of an expert in the field. Someone who has spent years battling poverty in the third world. These blinks, based on the author’s real-life experiences, show how poverty can be ended, for good. They show how instead of relying on traditional charity, we should look to local entrepreneurs to create wealth and progress. In these blinks, you’ll discover how one man used his hands and the clay under his feet to get himself out of poverty; how the author’s platform survived someone embezzling $100,000 on it; and why microlending could be the solution for global poverty. Designer suits, expensive cars, cash to burn: that’s how most of us picture the life of a successful entrepreneur. But not all entrepreneurs are enjoying life in the fast lane. Some of the most ingenious, resourceful and innovative entrepreneurs live and work in the poorest areas of the world.  In recent years, entrepreneurs from developing nations have become beacons of hope. Far from widening the divide between rich and poor, the entrepreneurial spirit could help us close it.  Entrepreneurship may even be a far better solution to poverty than any other current method. Why? Well, consider how the average charity works. A person donates a given amount of money knowing that it’s for a good cause. They don’t know how that money will be spent, who it helps or the quality of the charity’s assistance.  Individuals that want to feel more involved in a charity’s activity may volunteer. The author herself volunteered in many organizations. But no matter whether she was helping out at a hospital, at a sports club, in a soup kitchen or a halfway house for teenage mothers – she couldn’t help feeling like she wasn’t making a lasting impact.  Moreover, seeing the same people return every day for assistance with little motivation to change their own lives is disheartening to many volunteers. Charities, of course, are an indispensable part of society. But there are more ways to make a difference.  As the saying goes: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” The author understood the significance of this after gaining firsthand experience in East Africa with Californian nonprofit Village Enterprise. After interviewing local small business owners about their lives and the positive impact of Village Enterprise’s financial sponsorship, one thing was clear:  These people had the ideas, motivation and aspirations to fight their way out of poverty. All they needed was a little financial support. This gave birth to a revolutionary way of improving conditions in developing communities. The following blinks will tell you more about how it happened. A few billion people around the world live in poverty today. The global situation seems to worsen every time we turn on the news. In a world where so many people are struggling, what can we do to help? We can donate to charities and raise awareness, but it’s clear that a lot of money is the only thing that will improve the lives of the poor. Or is it? It’s impossible to eliminate all poverty at once. But what if we focused on lifting individuals, families and communities out of vicious cycles, one at a time? This approach is far more realistic, and a much smaller amount of money is needed to make it work. How? Through microloans.  Microlending is a system that emerged a few decades ago thanks to the work of Dr. Muhammad Yunus and his Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. By giving budding businesses small loans with low interest rates, Yunus assisted thousands of village entrepreneurs in starting their businesses.  Grameen Bank has since been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and has over 7.5 million borrowers today. Dozens of new organizations around the world have adopted Yunus’s approach to microfinance in the fight against poverty. Kiva, the author’s microlending platform, is one of them.  Drawing on her firsthand experience of witnessing poverty in Africa, the author developed Kiva and revolutionized microlending. Kiva connects entrepreneurs in developing nations with lenders in developed nations. Whether they need funding to purchase new equipment, farm animals or other investments in their business, entrepreneurs receive financial support from voluntary sponsors.  The progress of their business is shared with the lenders, whose loans are paid back in manageable chunks. Since 2005, Kiva has distributed more than $600 million in microloans to entrepreneurs around the world.  The founder of a tech start-up in Silicon Valley and a craftsman selling building materials in an East African village may not have much in common at first glance. But, while there is a stark contrast between the resources they have access to, both share the same entrepreneurial spirit.  No matter where or how you start out, it’s your resourcefulness that makes you a strong entrepreneur. Patrick from Uganda started out with nothing at all. Having lost his family when rebels attacked his village, he escaped with his surviving brother to live with distant relatives.  Patrick was an orphan with no education and no money. All he had was his bare hands and the ground beneath his feet. And those are exactly what he used to make a living for himself. How? By digging for clay to create bricks, which he could then sell to builders.  His bricks were rough and poorly made at first. But it didn’t take long before Patrick improved his technique and began to make small profits. He used his profit to buy new tools. After years of hard work, Patrick had gotten a small but prosperous business off the ground. As well as providing much-needed building supplies to the community, he was able to create a livelihood for himself, his brother and several employees.  Patrick’s business emerged from the bleakest years of his life. In this way, his story illustrates that there’s no time like the present when it comes to starting a project. When the author founded Kiva, the only real resource she could rely on was her practical experience. She didn’t have contacts or a reputation, and had just received an initial rejection from Stanford Business School.  With no MBA and little disposable income, the author was still determined to carry out her vision. Her husband joined her and together they began work on the ambitious project. Kiva was born one year later after a handful of loans were brought together to build a primitive website.  The author could have waited until she was in a better position to start a business but is glad she didn’t. Looking back, she knows that waiting for the right moment to start Kiva might have prevented her from building the business altogether. Starting your own business venture is rather like sailing out to sea. You may have a route planned, but it’s inevitable that strong currents will pull you in different directions. In order to get yourself back on track, you’ve got to keep your destination firmly in mind.  In the early stages of Kiva, the author was approached by two entrepreneurs with a similar idea. They were ambitious, had friends in high places and wanted to join forces. Their goals and values were a little different to the author’s, but she agreed to cooperate.  However, the partnership didn’t last long. The founders of Kiva were being treated like inferiors, while the two entrepreneurs were determined to tap into new markets. The project was straying from its original goal: connecting entrepreneurs with the sponsors they needed to make a change in their community.  Kiva broke off the cooperation with the two entrepreneurs and returned to their original course with great results. The two entrepreneurs continued in their direction, and ended up creating a rival platform that paled in comparison to Kiva. It was the author’s clearly defined mission that helped her know when to stop and change track.  Whether it’s posting that glowing graduation picture on Instagram or proudly presenting stunning quarterly figures to your investors, most of us can’t resist the opportunity to show off our successes. Of course, we’re not all successful all the time. We just don’t share that side of the story.  It’s easy to see why: we don’t want to look like failures, especially to those who support or follow us. Yet, the reality is that people don’t place their trust in a successful exterior. It’s honesty and transparency that attracts loyal and committed customers.  Direct contact between lenders and entrepreneurs is a cornerstone of Kiva. Sponsors receive regular updates on the progress of the budding businesses they support.  This transparency is what sets Kiva apart from the anonymous approach of conventional charities. The inspiration it offers users keeps them coming back to Kiva as sponsors and telling other people about the platform.  Transparency also helped Kiva regain its footing after facing their first PR crisis. Kiva was informed that a partner organization in Uganda had embezzled over $100,000 in loans by creating fake profiles of borrowers.  The money had disappeared and Kiva was at a loss as to how to handle the catastrophe. Management decided that their only option was to be completely open. Lenders were informed and received an apology from Kiva, who admitted they had been too trusting.  Users were understanding, appreciating the honest response and declaring their continuing support of Kiva. In a dilemma that could have cost Kiva its existence, the business stuck to the truth and came out even stronger because of it.  Building a new business is one of the toughest challenges you can take on. So why go it alone? Two heads are always better than one, and surrounding yourself with supportive team members will allow you to overcome even the trickiest obstacles. So don’t be afraid to collaborate! Clay, founder of a candy store in Honolulu, found strength in teamwork during difficult financial times. A passionate entrepreneur, Clay treated everyone that walked into his store like ohana (the Hawaiian word for “family”). He had a loyal customer base, but he still struggled to make ends meet.  Enter Clay’s nephew Bronson, a young and enthusiastic business student. He convinced Clay to join forces with him to give the store a makeover. With the help of crowdfunding platform ProFunder, the duo raised over $50,000 from family, friends and fans, rewarding sponsors with exclusive tasting sessions and personalized treats.  The campaign was a success, and Clay’s store received a new interior and a powerful marketing strategy. Today, Uncle Clay’s House of Pure Aloha enjoys a fantastic reputation and financial success.  The author herself also benefits from the power of teamwork. But it took a little convincing before she warmed up to the idea. Following the overnight success of her platform Kiva, the author needed several skilled helpers to keep up with demand. Together with her husband, she gathered trusted friends to form the core team of Kiva. This team was nothing less than a family, many of them having quit their jobs to dedicate themselves to the project full time.  This was quite the shift for the author. Having worked on the project independently, Kiva was truly her “baby.” Her energetic team was full of new ideas and suggestions, and the author was quite reluctant to take these on.  But, soon enough, she saw that it was the team that gave life to her project. Each team member brought something special to Kiva: whether it was programming, branding expertise or invaluable business contacts. Bit by bit, the author gave up responsibilities and let her team do the things they did best. Kiva flourished as a result, and the author’s team continues to grow.  When the first iPhone came out, it was a revolutionary piece of technology. But compared to the most recent model, it looks incredibly underdeveloped. That comes as no surprise – not even Apple gets it right the first time. And Apple is constantly improving the iPhone’s technology.  The best projects aren’t the result of a stroke of genius. Rather, they’re borne out of innovation and refinement over many years.  That’s something Shona learned in the early days of her business. The young mother was determined to design custom appliances to help her severely disabled daughter Shelly perform basic physical tasks. In Shona’s homeland of South Africa, the range of equipment to assist the disabled was limited.  This made simple activities like sitting upright at a table impossible for Shelly. Shona was determined to change this.  With some experience as a sculptor under her belt, Shona began to develop primitive designs that offered makeshift solutions for Shelly’s difficulties. With Shona’s tireless work, these improvised contraptions gave way to equipment that changed her daughter’s life.  Word began to spread about Shona’s expertise and other caregivers with similar needs approached her. It wasn’t long before Shona took her skills to a professional level, leading to the beginning of her enterprise Shonaquip.  Today, Shona is the employer of dozens of technicians and therapists, and her intuitively designed inventions have improved the lives of 70,000 disabled children. Having started from scratch and worked through countless versions of designs, Shona has years of expertise that provide a solid foundation for her business as it grows and prospers.  While every entrepreneur’s journey is full of unique challenges, there’s one tough decision they’ve all faced: the decision to risk it all and start a business. By investing time, money and effort into starting a business, entrepreneurs voluntarily dive headfirst into the unknown.  Take Katherine, a student from a Village Enterprise workshop in Tororo, Uganda. After learning basic business techniques, she felt pretty sure that selling fish was one of the most promising business strategies. Demand was high, and she decided to give it a try herself by buying fish from a local middleman.  Her profits were limited because of the high price she paid for the fish. Katherine knew that if she wanted to really make it, she’d have to start buying her fish closer to the source. This meant taking the expensive and dangerous journey alone out to the lake by bus. A risky move for Katherine, but one that gave her a shot at success.  With her $100 sponsorship from Village Enterprise, Katherine was able to safely take the bus out and return with a load of cheap and fresh fish. Her profit was maximized, and she had found a new strategy that would allow her business to grow and thrive. Without taking that first risk, Katherine wouldn’t be running her business today.  Taking risks and succeeding in those early stages of business also encourages entrepreneurs to keep taking calculated risks as their business evolves. Most entrepreneurs find that they exceed their own expectations to push their business ventures further than they had ever imagined.  The key message in this book: Microlending has allowed aspiring men and women in developing communities to not only change the way we see entrepreneurship, but make a difference in the global fight against poverty. With integrity, risk-taking, persistence, transparency and, above all, resourcefulness, budding businesses can achieve success against the odds.  Actionable advice:  Admit your mistakes.  Whether a project failed, a deadline was missed or big losses were incurred, all businesses mess up sometimes. If you’re responsible for a mistake, there’s no sense in hiding it. You’ll only make the burden bigger for yourself! Instead, admit that you took a wrong turn, apologize and ask for help. This is the only way that your business will be able to get back on track.

Why did you buy it? Did you need it?  Usually, we buy things because we think we need them, but even that explanation isn’t waterproof. After all, why do we choose some things over others? In fact, the real reason we buy things has to do with the way we relate to other people and how we want them to perceive us. It comes from psychology and evolution. That interaction, that desire to seen a certain way, sits at the core of our consumption, and it’s been around forever (way before the word “cool”).  So let’s dive into the psyche and explore our desires, anxieties and rebellious instincts that drive us to want to buy things and be the coolest cat around. In these blinks, you’ll find out why cool products are the human equivalent of a male peacock's feathers; what part the medial prefrontal cortex plays in our desire to be cool; and why punk and rock n’ roll isn’t as cool as it used to be. You make decisions every day. Even just a banal trip to the supermarket is full of choices and decision-making. But our behavior – including deciding what to buy – isn’t just a single set of actions. It’s actually in motion, swinging between three pleasure machines within the brain. You’re not necessarily conscious of these pleasure machines. They’re subconscious, and affect our behavior in their own particular ways.  Let’s look at how they work: The first is the Survival pleasure machine. Quick and inflexible, this force operates based on reflexes that instinctively jump into action without a thought.  Say you’re having lasagna for dinner. You heap a huge serving onto your plate and, while chatting with your partner, help yourself to another one. You don’t even consider it. Why? Well, we humans are wired to eat as much as possible to survive! The Habit pleasure machine is the second force. It’s the one that guides your routines and day-to-day life. You probably have habits you undertake so often, it’s like the habit dictates your behavior. For instance, many people have a cup of coffee every morning right after waking up. As opposed to an instinctual decisions, habit decisions form slowly over time.  Finally, there’s the Goal pleasure machine, the rational and conscious force. It allows you to weigh the pros and cons of a decision, and then make an informed choice. For example, you might habitually always buy Italian salad dressing, until one day you see an ad for Caesar salad dressing. The next time you’re at the store, you change your routine: you find the Caesar dressing, compare it to Italian dressing and decide which to buy.  But the Goal force also has a social component. When you’re evaluating the two dressings, you’re actually doing so based on who you think you are and how you think others see you. In other words, you might go with whichever is organic, or locally produced, because you want to show that you care about healthy food and the environment.  Do you remember being a kid and being so excited about a new piece of clothing? Most people know that feeling of strutting into class, looking forward to their peers’ compliments, hiding the fear that their fresh new jacket isn’t that cool after all. In fact, people consume cool products precisely because of the need for social recognition and a fear of embarrassment. Even in the 18th century, economist Adam Smith recognized that we consume more than we need to survive. We consume to socially assert ourselves.  That’s because cool products, like some hyped new Nike sneaker, aren’t necessary for us to exist. Nothing about the shoe’s coolness is necessary for its wearer to walk or live. But legendary sneakers like Jordans or Chuck Taylors didn’t become so popular because they revolutionized athletics or the way we walk. They became famous because of their effect on street fashion – on a new standard of cool. So, how does your brain decide what’s cool?  By activating the area responsible for thinking about yourself and others. It’s actually located right behind your forehead and it’s called the medial prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for evaluating how others will perceive you.  Therefore, you might think you’re buying some sneakers because of you like the way they look, but unconsciously, your brain is telling you that the shoes will have a positive social effect. They’ll make you appear cool, boost your self-esteem and make you happy.  Interestingly enough, this quest for social standing and status affects the economy in ways you wouldn’t expect. But before we get into that, let’s see where this compulsion for cool comes from. Let’s get into the fundamentals. If humans have a need for status – and consuming cool things helps us get that status – we should first figure out where this need for status originally comes from. Well, up until this point the dominant perspective on consumerism held that it’s a product of unnecessary and artificial needs. That’s because the American economist Thorstein Veblen made the argument that a meaningless competition for social status drives our consumption. In his view, products are essentially trophies. For instance, if your friend buys the new iPhone, your desire to keep up in the contest will make you want it too.  But another economist, Richard Easterlin, made the argument that what really matters is relative income. In his view, we spend money and consume more than we need because we’re constantly trying to gain position in society relative to the status, or rank, of others. Other consumer critics hold that consumption is an unethical arms race in which we strive to outdo others in the battle for coolness and social status. The result is a modern society that irrationally wastes resources. But there’s another perspective, this time from evolutionary biology. It says that we instinctively seek status as a means of connection to others. Humans have been competing and cooperating forever, right? So products and consumption are just new ways of sending signals about ourselves to others in society.  For instance, just like peacocks use their tails to attract a mate, humans use cool products to gain positive responses from each other. We’re social animals by nature and rely on this positive feedback for our well-being.  So, while you think your friend bought a pair of Jordans because you have them, in reality his purchase was driven by a biological need for social belonging. It’s hard to gain status in a group if you’re not interesting to its members. This premise leads naturally into the next idea, which explains that, if you’re not interesting to a group’s members, you’ll jump at the opportunity to attain a socially-rewarding position in another group. That’s how new cultures are formed. In the course of forming new cultures, consumption becomes a form of opposition to the predominant social order. Consuming certain things and not others can help one group forge a new culture.  For example, in the ‘50s, an entire subculture emerged around blue jeans and leather jackets. Like James Dean vs. the square businessman, members of this group were seeking an escape from the conformity of the then-dominant culture.  Brands caught on and began manufacturing jeans and leather jackets, marketing them as cool. The result was the fragmentation and rapid increase of styles, each of which abided by a different understanding of cool and status. Hence the mods, rockers, punks and goths.  Actually, this impulse is not unlike Darwin’s concept of natural selection, in which species diversify to beat out competition. Instead of competing for the same resources – or status, in this case – we break into subcultures that provide a different opportunity for recognition. What’s considered cool also shifts depending on our standards and norms. Today, for instance, punks aren’t as revered in the media as highly educated tech-geeks sporting flip-flops and generic light gray hoodies. They’re definitely not punk rock, but they’re cool today because we’re obsessed with education and sustainable business models.  So, instead of standing in opposition to society, contemporary cool is all about changing society for the better. Consumption today is driven by innovation, creativity and unconventionality – not by rejection or transgression. Just take the success of the Toyota Prius. It couldn’t be further from the classic cool of a Mustang or Ferrari, but that doesn’t matter. Today something can be cool because it makes the world a better, cleaner place. The key message in this book: Contrary to what some believe, consumerism is not a sickness of capitalist society, but an impulse etched into our brains. In fact, we purchase items we think of as cool to seek recognition from other humans and gain acceptance in society.  Actionable advice: Test the power of a cool brand. Try buying one can of Pepsi and one of Coke. Pour each into a clear glass and serve them to a friend in sequence. Then ask if they prefer Pepsi or Coke and which tasted better. You might be surprised that they prefer the taste of the soda that isn’t their brand of choice, a testament to how our brains attach expectations and the associated emotions to brands.  Suggested further reading: Hooked by Nir Eyal Hooked explains, through anecdotes and scientific studies, how and why we integrate certain products into our daily routines, and why such products are the Holy Grail for any consumer-oriented company. Hooked gives concrete advice on how companies can make their products habit-forming, while simultaneously exploring the moral issues that entails. Got feedback?

Your dream might revolve around one day starting your own company, to finally achieve true independence and importantly, the freedom to pursue something you’re truly passionate about. So what’s stopping you? In short: it’s scary. The risk of leaving a cushy job to take on something completely new can seem daunting. In fact, you could say you need to be a little bit crazy to take the leap. These blinks can help you smooth the road and minimize the risks in realizing your dream. You’ll gain wisdom collected from hundreds of others like you who have made this leap. You can then put this advice to good use in your venture, whether you’re still in the planning stages or well on your way to world domination! In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: how Starbucks raised its stock price tenfold by closing all its stores; how running an under-four-minute mile went from impossible to easy in a few months; and which entrepreneurial type you are: a Steve Jobs, a Bill Gates or a Martha Stewart. When facing important life decisions, most people eagerly consult their friends, family or partners for their opinions. But in fact, this could be a big mistake. Why? Because you need to get rid of so-called psychological limiters: the beliefs that say you are incapable of reaching your goals. These limiters arise from a basic fear of everything that’s unknown and uncertain. Your family and friends can actually exacerbate these limiters. For example, if you’re a bit doubtful about quitting your job and starting your own company, and then talk to your parents about it, they may be horrified as they’ve been accustomed to holding down the same 9-to-5 job for 50 years. Their attitude will naturally discourage you. So what can you do to overcome psychological limiters? For one, you need to understand that the only reason you’re facing negativity is because you’re pushing the limits of what’s thought to be possible. This is much more difficult than staying in the realm of what’s already been done. Before 1954, everyone thought that running a mile in under four minutes was physically impossible for the human body. But then, after Roger Bannister accomplished this “impossible” feat, 16 others accomplished it too in the following three years.   A second option in avoiding psychological limiters is simply not sharing your ideas with family and friends. Your ideas are fragile when in their infancy, and you can be thus easily discouraged by negative feedback. And somewhat counterintuitively, the people you trust the most can be the least trustworthy when evaluating your ideas. This is because their responses are by nature emotional: people may offer negative feedback because they secretly hate you, or because they’re worried about the consequences of you pursuing your idea. Or they might applaud you, just to give you an ego boost: “Oh wow, a hotel for pet iguanas is the best idea I’ve ever heard!” Both of these approaches are harmful, because they give you a warped view of the quality of your idea. Everyone knows that starting your own company is risky. Thankfully though, it’s possible to minimize your risk level so you’re not left completely vulnerable. How? First of all, ensure a single failure can’t ruin you. Never take risks that could be catastrophic for you personally if the risk is realized: don’t jeopardize your ability to provide for your family, for example. Thankfully, most entrepreneurs seem to know this: of those people the author talked to, 80 percent had saved up enough to cover their living expenses for at least a year. Second, don’t rush in, but take smart risks: incremental steps where you have the chance to get feedback and adjust accordingly. This was the approach taken by Zappos founder Nick Swinmurn. He started his venture by simply walking into local shoe stores and asking if he could take pictures of the products for his online shop. If he then made a sale, he would come back to the store and buy the shoes for his customer at full price. This was a very low-risk tactic, as he could test the feasibility of his idea without having to invest in inventory of his own. Another great way to offset risk is to take advantage of crowdfunding, or raising small amounts of capital from a large number of people online. The most well-known sites for this are IndieGoGo and Kickstarter. Using crowdfunding comes with a number of benefits. Most importantly, it requires you to pitch your idea to a large number of people, which generates valuable market input. If no one wants to invest in your product, this is a signal that you need to change something. Another benefit is that the pitch simultaneously functions as marketing, bringing your product to the attention of funders and their friends. When you start your own business, you can be sure that things will get chaotic – this is unavoidable. But to be successful, you must learn to deal with chaos. One key component is getting creative. When things get chaotic and you feel frustrated, try to see opportunities around you: chaos can often lead to great chances for improvement. This is what J.K. Rowling, the world-famous author of the Harry Potter books, did. In the 1980s, she was working at Amnesty International, but her heart wasn’t in it: while she was supposed to be researching human rights violations, she secretly wrote stories. While she was fired for this transgression, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as it freed Rowling to do what she really wanted to do – keep writing. Amid chaos, you also need to stand your ground. Most entrepreneurs panic and totally abandon their previously well-thought out plans and start doing whatever they can to survive when chaos strikes. Don’t make this mistake. Instead, look back to your original plan and core principles, and stay true to them. They will guide you forward. The actions of chairman and former CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, offer a great lesson in standing one’s ground. In 2008, Starbucks was in trouble, its stock value having plummeted by 50 percent. Many companies would have panicked and grasped at whatever new trends were hot at the moment, but instead Schultz decided to go back to the company’s core values: great coffee and a strong barista-customer relationship. This is why he closed all 7,100 Starbucks outlets in the United States for an entire Tuesday afternoon to retrain baristas in the “art of espresso.” This risky move upset stock analysts and investors greatly, fearing a further stock slump. But instead, Starbucks share price skyrocketed, demonstrating the importance of staying true to your core principles even in turbulent times. Just as people have different personalities, so too do entrepreneurs. There are several different entrepreneurial personalities, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Let’s examine the four basic ones. First, there are diamonds: visionaries who dream big ideas that can revolutionize people’s lives. Though their brilliance is unquestionable, these diamonds can often be incredibly self-centered as well. Examples of this type would be Apple’s Steve Jobs, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sergey Brin. Second, we have stars: charismatic leaders who can inspire deep loyalty within a large, diverse audience. They have the potential to quickly create a global success, but unfortunately, stars often operate alone, and such a “one-man show” is prone to the whims of the star. Examples of this type are Oprah Winfrey, Martha Stewart and Jay-Z. Third, there are transformers: change catalysts who typically work in an old, potentially stagnant industry in which they aspire to transform and revitalize their company. Examples include Starbucks’ Howard Schultz and the founder of McDonald’s, Ray Kroc. Finally, there are rocketships: analytical thinkers who want to make strategic efficiency improvements, making everything faster, better and cheaper. Typically, such people are great at math and science, but as entrepreneurs, they will also need to master areas like customer service and management. Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos are notable examples of this personality type. Now that you know the basic entrepreneurial types, you need to figure out which one you represent. Knowing this will help you understand your entrepreneurial instincts and inclinations, and this will help you be more effective. You can study well-known entrepreneurs who share your type, and try to overcome their flaws. For example, if you’re a diamond, you might look to Steve Jobs. His weakness was that he often took his employees’ ideas and claimed them as his own. But since you know there’s a danger of this, you can ensure you always give credit where credit is due. Similarly, looking to fellow diamonds might show you some strengths you hadn’t realized you had. So you’ve just launched your company and you run into an issue you don’t know how to deal with. Now what? Based on research of common issues entrepreneurs face, the author and her team compiled a list of advice that can help address the most-likely obstacles you’ll encounter as a new entrepreneur. First off, close some doors. Life is about making choices, and it’s impossible to keep all options open forever. Once your business is up and running, go ahead and quit that day job so you can focus on what’s important. Then, fire your mother-in-law. When you’re just getting started, you might need friends and family to work for you because you can’t find or afford anyone else. As soon as possible though, end this and find people who truly are best for the job. Don’t be afraid to “minnovate.” Rather than spending months trying to come up with a massive innovation in how you do business, seek continuous but incremental improvements. Be open to change, but not too open. Data shows that start-ups that pivoted – or changed their core business idea – once or twice managed to raise two and a half times as much funding as companies that either did not pivot at all or did so more than twice. And don’t forget to dream big, but execute small. Many entrepreneurs are so busy plotting their world domination that they neglect to lay the more mundane groundwork for success. And even if you’re hungry to conquer the world, remember to eat the elephant one bite at a time. Whenever you face a dauntingly large undertaking, chop it up into smaller, more manageable chunks. One final piece of advice is that whatever issue you’re trying to solve, examine it closely and in isolation from others. This will often yield solutions to even tricky problems. You could even consider hosting a brainstorming session where you try to list every single issue your venture has. Then you can go down the list and solve each issue one by one. For example, if your material costs are over budget, customer service is overloaded and the office has recently been broken into, examine the first problem and put everything else out of your mind. Track every penny of your material costs and you’ll surely find out what the precise problem is. Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of thinking that once a business is off the ground, leading the day-to-day operations will be a walk in the park. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. To run a business well, you need to be an effective leader, which is a skill most entrepreneurs initially lack. So how do you get started on your path to being an outstanding leader? Try to abide by these simple management principles in your company. Keep your organization agile: divide workers into small teams with individual areas of responsibility, in which they can experiment and meet daily to review progress. Be accessible: today, every leader needs to be accessible, from their closest business partners to the lowest-ranking employees. Even U.S. President Barack Obama makes himself accessible through social media platforms, like Twitter and Reddit. Being open to the thoughts of others is also a great way of soliciting feedback, which can help you improve how you lead. Be self-aware: don’t be blind to how others perceive you and adjust your leadership style accordingly. Also, admit your own flaws once in a while, so you never forget the danger they pose. Be authentic: it’s okay to show your softer, more human side as a leader once in a while. Exposing vulnerability will help people relate to you better and help you forge stronger bonds. To accelerate the process of becoming an effective leader, try to find yourself a mentor, or a more experienced leader who can give you advice. Mentors are particularly valuable because they typically never sugarcoat issues. This is why you should pay special attention to their concerns, as they may be precisely the ones your employees are too scared to bring to your attention. Because mentors are so critical, you’ll probably need a number of mentors throughout your career to get the most benefit. If a mentor grows disinterested or your expertise surpasses theirs, it’s time to move on and find someone else. As you’ve seen, leadership is a crucial element in the success of your company. But it’s not enough. For your organization to function well, you need to create an environment that also makes your staff feel a sense of employeeship: an entrepreneurial instinct of their own that drives them to constantly improve and innovate. So how can you instill this kind of attitude? First of all, it has nothing to do with money. Author Dan Pink found that most employees actually don’t consider their salary to be the most important part of their compensation. Rather, employees want rewards that are impossible to place a monetary value on, such as having a job title they can be proud of and the autonomy to make their own decisions. Second, you should also be a flexible employer, as this can translate into a serious competitive advantage. Cleaning supply company Clorox was able to attract top-caliber talent by offering working mothers flexible hours to better accommodate family concerns. Third, make your company a “culture club,” where the binding element is that every member fits in perfectly within the organization’s culture. This will forge strong bonds among your staff. Naturally, this means you need to let go of people who do not fit in. Zappos, for example, does this as quickly as possible. After a new employee’s first week, the company offers an employee $4,000 to quit. The reasoning is that those who feel like they don’t quite fit with the company culture will most likely take the money and leave. Finally, you should also try to act like a regular employee yourself. Take vacations and put photos of your children on your desk, just like everyone else. This shows your staff that it’s okay for them to have personal lives too. These days, there’s a lot of discussion around the concept of work-life balance. But “balance” itself is misleading, as it implies that to gain more of one, you need to sacrifice some of the other: go big with your venture or go home to your family. In reality though, you can do both. So how can you go big and build a large-scale enterprise? Simply, you need help. You can’t run a large business on your own, so you need to learn how to work effectively with others. This has its benefits: other people can refine your raw ideas or take the ones that you’ve long since lost interest in pursuing to create something dynamic. Other people can also bring their own creativity into play, helping you solve problems more efficiently. All this translates into a significant competitive advantage as long as you know how to work with and lead a large organization. Yet with such responsibility, how can you ensure you remember to go home to your family? Use technology to your advantage. You can set up a home office, conduct virtual conferences and try to keep your mornings and evenings clear of meetings so you can spend more time at home. It’s important you make this possible throughout your entire organization, as it shows your employees that they don’t have to choose between career and family either; they can have both. One person who embodies this approach is Tina Fey, who has a brilliant career as an actress, writer and producer, while still being a dedicated mother. You should be similarly undaunted by the prospect of pursuing your career ambitiously while making time for your family. The key message in this book: To make your company successful, keep your cool: take only smart risks and when chaos strikes, find the golden opportunities it presents. Try to understand your own strengths and weaknesses and cultivate your leadership skills to work around them. Actionable advice: To generate creative ideas, organize a hackathon. Many companies develop stiff hierarchies as they grow. To stay fresh and innovative, consider organizing occasional hackathons, where you form cross-functional teams and let them spend a day or two working out a tricky problem or a project of their choosing – this process can generate innovative solutions in a surprisingly short time span. For example, in one hackathon, 100 Silicon Valley entrepreneurs came up with several innovative ways to improve education, all during one long flight from San Francisco to London!

Moore","summary":"All innovative technological products take time to be absorbed by any community. Due to differences in attitudes to new technology, this adoption process tends to happen in stages, one group of people at a time, according to the aptly named Technology Adoption Life Cycle. The first to adopt a new technology are the technology enthusiasts, for whom technology is a central interest in life. They simply want the hottest new technology before everyone else, even if it is still bug-ridden and faulty in places. Next in line are the visionaries. Rather than the technology itself, they are interested in the strategic competitive advantage it could provide. They seek breakthroughs, not minor improvements to the status quo. The above two groups constitute the relatively small early market, which is followed by the vital and far larger mainstream market. Once a technology has proven itself and a clear market leader has emerged, the pragmatists, constituting roughly one third of the entire market, feel safe enough to jump on board. Unlike the visionaries, they are not looking for big changes, but rather incremental benefits gained from standardized, well-supported products. Pragmatists make for extremely loyal customers and thus winning their support is the key to long-term market dominance. The fourth group, the conservatives, is as numerous as the pragmatists, but suspicious of high-tech. They want simple, high-quality, low-cost products with no hassle involved. Finally, the skeptics are a small high-tech resistant group who are most often ignored as a customer segment, but who can provide valuable feedback on how your product is failing to meet their expectations.  Ideally, as a product moves through the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, each group of customers will provide references for selling to the next, more skeptical group of adopters. Thus, like Tarzan swinging from vine to vine, the product sustains momentum. The problem is that in the case of discontinuous or disruptive innovations, meaning products which demand substantial behavioral changes from their customers, this process does not unfold smoothly. Such products face a wide and unforgiving chasm that divides the early and mainstream markets, i.e. the visionaries and the pragmatists. The reasons why visionaries and pragmatists buy high-tech products are radically different: visionaries want to provoke major changes, championing a technology even against resistance in their own company; pragmatists, on the other hand, want to minimize discontinuity, and seek incremental productivity improvements rather than major innovations. Due to these dissimilarities, customer references from the visionaries will not impress the pragmatists. This poses a dilemma, since the pragmatists demand existing references and a comprehensive support infrastructure. They will only buy from established vendors, but without them a company cannot become an established vendor. This catch-22 is the chasm, and products caught in it tend to languish and die. While companies can still sell to their existing early-market customers, these sales demand a lot of effort in customization work and are hence low-volume. The high-volume mainstream markets remain just out of reach, and revenues come to a standstill. The company’s value is diluted and the original management team may even be ousted by investors. To avoid this gruesome fate, every company launching an innovative product must have a plan for successfully crossing the chasm. Unlike early-market customers, mainstream customers abhor products that require them to hunt for additional products and services. Hence, they only want what are known as whole products, meaning products that completely satisfy their buying objectives. Pragmatists love Microsoft products, for example, because they know there is a wide infrastructure of supporting products and services available for them already. In addition to the product that is shipped in a box (the generic product) they also demand things like installation, support and any additional soft- or hardware needed to fully meet their expectations. Whole products are the arena where the battle for mainstream markets is won or lost. To reach the pragmatist group and cross the chasm successfully, you must provide a whole product for your chosen target niche. While a good generic product is a great asset, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to become a market leader. Some of the components needed for the whole product will inevitably fall outside the core competence of your company, so you may need to find partners to address those needs. Such alliances should have the sole aim of developing and marketing a whole product for a specific customer segment. Consider, for example, a company selling aggregated data on pharmaceutical research. Its customers will expect to have access to multiple sources of data, and to fully meet these demands, the company must partner with a number of data providers like public health agencies, managed care organizations and individual scientists. Entering the mainstream market is an act of aggression: you are invading the existing players’ territory, hence you should plan your attack as you would a military invasion. You start by securing a beachhead. This means targeting a specific market niche within the pragmatist group and becoming its undisputed market leader. From this base you can then expand to other segments until eventually you can dominate the entire market. The niche is the kindling with which you light the fire. But pursuing a niche requires focus: you must have the discipline to not sell outside the niche. Many companies in the chasm simply cannot resist additional revenue opportunities elsewhere. They wind up selling all over the market without establishing a credible position anywhere, and exhaust their resources on endless customizations to suit each market segment. A small target niche helps you satisfy the pragmatists’ preferences for buying products which are well-supported, well-referenced and sold by market leaders: First of all, the smaller the niche, the easier it will be to win the majority of new orders within it and thus become the de facto market leader. And a larger proportion of customers in the niche will be talking about your product and positive word-of-mouth references will circulate faster. Lastly, operating within a niche allows you to develop a standard product specifically for that niche, including the additional components, services and support infrastructure that the pragmatists expect. Choosing the right target niche to invade first usually means making a risky decision without having reliable information to base it on. Hence, it calls for informed intuition rather than analytical reasoning. A tool to assist in this decision is a process called target-customer characterization. This means developing a variety of scenarios in which your product might be used by various customers. You consider the buyer, the end-user and how the product would actually improve the customer’s current situation. Thus one possible scenario for e-books would involve airline maintenance directors buying them for their repair crews. The crews could then access up-to-date repair manuals even on the tarmac, thus resulting in fewer costs from delays. The goal of this exercise is to come up with a variety of potential customers so you can compare them and find the customer segment with the most compelling reason to buy your product. If your product doesn’t solve a dire problem in a given segment, pragmatist customers will tend to postpone their buying decision, thus greatly complicating your entry. Time is your enemy in the chasm. Within your intended niche, you must be able to find necessary partners and field a whole product that fully addresses customer needs within three months. Finally, consider the existing competition in that niche. If a competitor has crossed the chasm before you, they will have the exact same advantages you were hoping to gain. Once you have picked your beachhead, there is no looking back. While it is possible to succeed by invading the wrong niche, hesitation almost always results in failure. The positioning of a product is the single largest influence on a customer’s buying decision. Positioning means the attributes associated with that product in customers’ minds, e.g. “Mercedes is a top-of-the-line car.” But different groups of customers value different things. For visionaries, the features of a product, like its speed or size, are key, but for pragmatists the main evidence of a product’s value is its position in the market relative to competitors. As a newcomer without competitors or a market position to boast of, this places you in a quandary. The good news is that you can always define your competition yourself by giving customers two existing competitors as reference points. For example, imagine you are running the company Silicon Graphics, which has just introduced the first digital film-editing tools. First, you must identify your intended customers by stating a market alternative: a competitor which your customers have been using for years. For Silicon Graphics, this would be old-fashioned method of cutting and splicing film. You then differentiate yourself with a product alternative: a competitor that has also harnessed a new, disruptive innovation, similar in some way to yours. For Silicon Graphics, this could be SUN workstations, which are leading edge, but not meant for editing film.   Using these two competitors you can make a claim to market leadership by showing that you operate in a new kind of niche. This claim must be powerful yet short, preferably no more than two sentences. Here’s what those two sentences might sounds like: “For film editors who are unhappy with traditional editing (market alternative), our workstation is a digital editor which enables you to modify images any way you choose. Unlike workstations from SUN (product alternative), we provide all the tools for film-editing.” Before launching your invasion on the target niche, you must choose the distribution channels you will invade through and the pricing strategy you will attack with. This basically means deciding who will sell your products then slapping a price tag on them. Pragmatists are very picky about which companies they buy from. Hence, when crossing the chasm, the number-one priority is to secure a distribution channel that pragmatist customers are already comfortable with. Direct sales is usually the optimal channel for crossing the chasm, since it actively creates demand, works fast and facilitates cooperative relationships with customers. Typically, this channel means having a dedicated sales force working directly for you and interacting extensively with major corporate customers to make sales. Once you have become the market leader in your target niche, you can then transition from direct sales into a channel more capable of fulfilling high-demand volumes. Depending on your product, this could mean selling through retail stores, the internet or even large networks of value-added resellers who bundle your product with, say, software and sell it onward. Selling an unknown new product is a demanding and risky task for distributors. Thus, in the chasm, the primary goal of your pricing strategy must be to encourage them to sell. This means initially giving them a disproportionate share of the price margin as a commission, and phasing it out gradually as you gain market leadership. Your second goal in pricing is encouraging the customer to buy. Since the pragmatist group prefers to buy from market leaders, you should price your product as the market leader would.  Most successful chasm crossings happen in business markets because it is extremely difficult to do so with a consumer product. Businesses usually have the economic and technical resources to adopt even immature products, whereas consumers do not. Though technology enthusiasts exist in consumer markets, too, they tend to rapidly move on to “the next cool thing.” At the same time, you are unlikely to find true visionaries to champion your product and underwrite your R&D. Also, unlike businesses, consumers usually lack a truly compelling reason to buy your product; they don’t have critical processes that only you can fix. Consider, for example, Quicken, a financial-management application produced by Intuit. It faced the following problem: consumers were perfectly happy using pens, paper and checks for their financial management. Their processes were not so much broken as bent, so they lacked a truly compelling reason to buy. Eventually, Quicken crossed the chasm by effectively positioning itself as a combination of a savvy financial-management tool and the old-fashioned pen-and-paper method.  After emerging from the chasm, companies often find they have inherited a number of commitments from the pre-chasm organization. These could, for example, involve the returns promised to investors. To successfully manage these challenges and leave the chasm behind, difficult and profound financial and organizational choices must be made. First and foremost, profitability becomes the focus of the post-chasm organization. In general, the sooner this happens, the better. Instilling a discipline of profitability early on helps companies avoid a “welfare mentality,” and teaches them to be careful about which customers and projects they pursue. Second, the post-chasm company goes through profound organizational changes. The few powerful pioneers who fuelled growth in the early markets can become liabilities, as they tend to have little interest in administration and “business as usual.” What the post-chasm company really needs are settlers, people who diffuse authority and build standardized, well-documented procedures. The pioneers find this dull and alienating and are often unable to operate successfully in this new environment. Disputes arise almost inevitably, often regarding the fair division of compensation and sales bonuses from the vastly different early and mainstream markets. As this transition happens, the company runs the risk of losing early-market customers and neglecting the product enhancements demanded by mainstream customers. Thus, two new jobs must be created, both of them temporary: The target market segment manager must transform every visionary customer relationship into a potential beachhead to enter the rest of that customer’s industry. For example, if the customer is Intel, the industry is semiconductors. The whole product manager is in charge of managing the ever-growing list of product-enhancement requests and bugs to be fixed, ensuring retention of pragmatist customers.  The key message in this book is: To achieve mainstream market success, high tech products must cross the chasm between early and mainstream markets. They must focus on finding a single target niche where they can fully address customers’ needs and become the market leader.    ","headers":["Technological innovations are absorbed in stages by different groups.","Between visionaries and pragmatists lies a chasm where products languish and companies die.","To achieve mainstream market success, you must address your customers’ needs fully with a whole product.","Crossing the chasm is like launching an invasion – you must first secure a niche as a beachhead.","Choose your first niche by finding the most attractive customer segment.","To effectively position your product in customers’ minds, use a powerful claim to demonstrate market leadership.","Find a distribution channel pragmatists are comfortable with and motivate that channel to sell.","The chasm is even harder to cross in consumer markets than in business markets.","To address post-chasm challenges, a company must secure profitability and realign its organization.","Final summary"],"category":"Entrepreneurship","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/509d222ce4b0a13d41357e9e/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"Crossing the Chasm (1991) examines the market dynamics faced by innovative new products, particularly the daunting chasm that lies between early to mainstream markets.","avg_rating":4,"rating_qty":7},{"title":"Crushing it!","author":"Gary Vaynerchuk","summary":"The world has changed. Twenty years ago, if you wanted to get discovered as an actress, you’d maybe need to move to Hollywood. If you wanted to get ahead in business? You’d go to business school. Broadcast to millions? Well, it sure wasn’t easy getting a primetime TV or radio slot. The internet and social media, by essentially doing away with industry gatekeepers, have all but destroyed the barriers to success, whether you’re an entrepreneur, a performer or any other kind of content producer. Top podcasts are streamed by millions every day. Actresses, artists and all kinds of creative professionals are discovered on YouTube and Instagram all the time. And entrepreneurs across the globe are realizing that social media gives them unparalleled opportunities to communicate directly with potential customers. As you’ll see in these blinks, building a personal brand and cultivating it through social media is a route to success accessible to all. And that’s equally true if you’re a frustrated accountant, a food enthusiast ready to share your love of homemade preserves with the world or a fashionista seeking to monetize your sense of style. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a father and son became famous for cutting things in half; why Snapchat is a great training ground for marketers; and why altruism beats self-interest if you want to succeed as an entrepreneur. Ask a kid today what she wants to do when she grows up, and there’s a good chance she’ll say, “I want to be a YouTuber.” Many adults might respond with a patronizing, “That’s not a real job, sweetie.” But maybe those kids are on to something. The explosion of social media is a game changer that’s made it possible for anyone to broadcast to a mass audience. Let’s look at a few stats. Worldwide, people watch 1.25 billion hours of YouTube video every day. They post 66,000 photos or videos on Instagram every single minute. And, on average, 20 percent of the time people dedicate to mobile is spent on Facebook. The scale and power of social-media platforms make it possible for any of us to earn money from a personal brand. With only 1,000 followers, someone on Instagram can earn $5,000 per year, from just two posts a week. Not a bad side income, right? Now think if you were posting more than twice a week. For those that really want it, the potential to monetize a personal brand is unlimited. Consider the author, Gary Vaynerchuk. He transformed his family wine business from a $4 million to a $60 million operation. His approach was simple: he built a strong personal brand by talking straight to customers.   He ran an unusually honest video blog, doing tastings to the camera and giving frank advice. He spent hours every day replying to every single message he got on Twitter and Facebook. He helped people and, in turn, they came to like him, trust him and buy from him. He built a one-on-one relationship with his customers – the kind of relationship that, previously, you could only form with small, neighborhood stores. And after that? He took what he’d learned about online marketing and advised others. Today, Vaynerchuk runs a huge digital agency with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chattanooga and London. And all because he embraced the power of his personal brand. What could a wine retailer, a fashionista mom and a frustrated artist have in common? They all used a strong personal brand to lead a more successful life. The author used his brand to sell a product – wine. But many people have no obvious product, and yet are successfully monetizing their personal brand. Brittany Xavier’s Thrifts and Threads blog and Instagram were, in the beginning, just a fun way to showcase photos of her young family’s life. But she noticed accounts like hers were tagging brands, and so she started doing the same. Six months and 10,000 followers later, she started to charge brands $100 for a post mentioning them. She discovered that she was aiming too low when a jewelry business proposed a single blog and Instagram post for $1,000. Today, Xavier focuses on her family lifestyle brand full time, earning plenty, traveling and having fun. But what if, instead of revolutionizing your life, you just want to make it a little better? Will a personal brand still help? Absolutely. Louie Blaka was a full-time art teacher and frustrated artist. He didn’t want to give up his job, but he did want to have more success selling his art in his free time. After learning about Vaynerchuk’s experiences, he started to consider how he could market his work differently. He hosted free wine and paint classes, and posted pictures of the events on Instagram. What started as one class of ten people became many classes of up to a hundred – and a combination of Instagram and word of mouth continued bringing in more people. The result? Well, he used to sell the occasional painting for $200, and this year he hopes to hit $30,000 in sales. That’s a pretty hot side-hustle for a full-time teacher. So, whether you want to attain riches or just make some cash on the side, a personal brand executed on social media can make it happen. A house built on weak foundations will fail, and the same is true of your social-media content. So what really matters? It’s pretty simple: there are seven principles you need to nail. The first is authenticity. People can always smell a fake, so don’t disrespect your audience. Be real. You also need to be passionate. Whether for your product, your life or the process of being an entrepreneur – it’s passion that will keep you going when things get tough. Patience is a virtue, goes the old saying. And it’s true here – building something new takes time. Accept that. What else is virtuous? Hard work. If you want to crush it, you don’t have time to spend your lunch break watching cat videos on YouTube, or your evenings bingeing Walking Dead. Get on Twitter and make some connections!   The world is moving fast, so you need to pay attention, and move with speed. What are the latest trends? Is there a new platform you should be on? Look forward and don’t waste time. Finally, you need the right intent. All great entrepreneurs have one thing in common: they’re not only in it for the money. It might seem counterintuitive, but it’s true. All the best influencers and entrepreneurs are altruistic. They are driven by providing service and value, and they love teaching and helping others. Listen to Jenna Soard, founder of a brand-advisory service called You Can Brand. She says her “truest love is watching the ‘ahas’ go off in people’s minds” as she helps them solve a problem. When your intent is self-interested, customers won’t tell others to come buy from you, and they won’t come back. So center your activities around altruistic values. Think about what you can give and how you can help. That’s the only sustainable way to be a success in the long run. And hey – it feels good, too! The idea of creating engaging content for social media might seem daunting. Sure, you love sports cars. But do you really know enough about them to run a weekly video blog on YouTube? Well, don’t let your misgivings stop you. Focus on documenting rather than creating. Rich Roll was an overweight, unhappy, 39-year-old lawyer when he decided to give up the junk food, embrace veganism and take up running. Years later, after becoming an endurance athlete, he thought it could be fun to film and share his training for the Ultraman World Championships. His five-minute YouTube videos, showing training, or talking about diet, started to get thousands of views. That led to a CNN interview, which, in turn, got him a book deal. He launched a hugely popular podcast, blogged like crazy and kept YouTubing. Now with a second book deal and regular speaking engagements for the likes of Goldman Sachs, he is regarded as “an influencer’s influencer.” Now, there’s a lesson to be learned, here. Roll didn’t wait till he had it all, and that’s why he attracted so much interest. People enjoyed going on that journey with him, following as he documented his progress and watching him learn. So, rather than stressing about how to create unique and creative content, embrace the possibility that you are the unique content. Vaynerchuk employs a videographer who films his every working moment – bathroom visits and confidential meetings aside. The content it generates is a great learning tool for other entrepreneurs. Why not regularly share your world with Snapchat, or Instagram stories or Facebook Live? Document moving into your new apartment, or brewing your first batch of homebrew. Maybe it doesn’t work out, but maybe you’ll build an audience that earns you $50,000 a year through advertising, brand endorsement and affiliate marketing. You might even land a book deal. Now that we’ve explored the potential of building your personal brand, let’s look at the platforms that you can use. In 2015, the music producer DJ Khaled got lost, in the dark, on a jet ski. Attempting to get home in the dying light, he snapchatted his disorienting ordeal until finally reaching shore and safety. Already popular, his personal brand exploded. Khaled was one of the first Snapchat stars, because he was authentic, and Snapchat is all about unvarnished authenticity. Khaled didn’t overthink things or edit too much or seek a perfect shot. He was just himself. Sure, the content was a little goofy, but it was real. In contrast to Instagram, which is often so curated that it seems fake, Snapchat offers an authentic peek into a person’s life. Now, this can make Snapchat a little tricky for marketers. But if you’re already present on other platforms, Snapchat offers a great opportunity to show a more human side. It’s where Sarah, a realtor, can admit that, despite her diet, she has a weak spot for fries. And where Shaun, a sports-store manager, snaps himself playing foosball with his kids. There’s another reason Snapchat is tough, and why it’s such a great training ground for marketers. With no hashtags and no sharing, Snapchat offers no discoverability. So to go big on Snapchat, you really have to be offering value.   Sharing a picture of your cappuccino isn’t enough. Lauren of The Skinny Confidential, a lifestyle blog, explains that, when she snaps a picture of her coffee, she also gives some value, saying something like, “I’m enjoying an iced coffee on this hot day. I’m using a silicone straw because it doesn’t contain BPA , and I put cinnamon in there because it’s good for your blood sugar levels.” Snapchat forces you to give a little extra, to show your personality, to add some value – and that’s good practice! Ultimately, Snapchat is a space to be human. You might not make lots of quick sales there, but you can reveal a little bit of your personality. What’s not to like about that? Back in the day, the watercooler was the place to catch up on the latest gossip about news or a hit TV show. Now, people chew the fat on Twitter, and that conversation is taking place 24/7, with input from every corner of the globe. But Twitter offers more than just chatter. It’s also a great platform for getting noticed. Why? First, on Twitter, you have more chances to spark word of mouth: no one posts 50 times a day on Instagram, but tweeting fifty times? Totally fine. Second, the retweet function is an incredible way to generate awareness. Imagine you’ve made a video mash-up of rap artist Drake’s work. He’s probably not going to see it, even if you tag him. But share it on Twitter, and, if it’s good, it might just get retweeted until Drake – and everyone else – notices. Twitter is also an easy way to build your profile for a particular target audience.   Maybe you’ve always dreamed of being a sports presenter. Here’s how you could use Twitter to achieve that dream. First, check out what sports topics are trending. Then start tweeting: write a quick comment, or post a short video. Use the right hashtags, so anyone searching for that topic will pick up your tweets. Chip in to conversations. Reply to some big influencers, and ask if they want to check out your blog. On day one, nothing’s going to happen. You’ll tweet all day – and nada. But keep going. On day five, a journalist might retweet you. This could give you 200 new followers and, in a month, a sports blog might ask if you’d like to write a guest piece. After 12 months of doing this on, ideally, a daily basis, your local sports station might reach out to see if you’d like to come in for a chat and a possible job. Being a hit on Twitter takes a heck of a lot of work. But if you put in those hours, you’ll see what doors it can open. Did you know young adults watch more video on YouTube than on any TV network at prime time? And while you probably won’t get on NBC anytime soon, you could be on YouTube today. Many people hold back from YouTube because they think, “I’m no expert, and besides – I’m not that interesting!” You should banish such thoughts. First, remember documenting is as interesting as creating. You don’t need to be a whisky expert to launch a whisky vlog. Launch a “learning whisky with Bob” vlog and you and your audience – everyone put off by experts talking fancy language and drinking $200 malts – can learn together. Second, however niche your interests, they’ll find an audience on YouTube. Take garage sales. Not so exciting, right? But, on YouTube, there are garage-sale videos with 400,000 views! The best way to get on YouTube is simply to do it – just start. If your videos aren’t great, so what? Nobody is watching them to start with, apart from your mom. They’ll get better with time. If they don’t and you never attract viewers – hey, at least you’ve learned it’s not for you, and you can try something else. And on the flip side, really great content usually cuts through. Take Dan Markham. When his son needed a school project idea, they decided to see what’s inside a baseball. They filmed themselves cutting the ball open, and uploaded the footage to YouTube. A year later, Dan realized people had been watching it – enough people to generate ad revenue. So he and his son made some more videos of themselves cutting things open. A football, a Rubik’s Cube, even the rattle of a dead rattlesnake! To date, their “What’s Inside?” videos have been watched over 550 million times, and they’ve worked with brands including Nike and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.   Pretty cool for a school project! Maybe you’ve heard people criticizing Facebook recently, saying it’s where baby boomers share photos of their grandkids, and that young people aren’t there anymore. Well, in reality, Facebook is still the biggest show in town. Two billion monthly active users don’t lie. From a business perspective, Facebook’s great advantage is its flexibility for both content and distribution. Facebook offers a versatility that no other platform can. Want to pump out a twelve paragraph blog entry? That’ll work. Ten-second video? Sure. Twenty-minute video? No problem. Some simple photos? Get ‘em up there! And it offers incredibly rich targeting. Want to target people between 18 and 25 years old who live in downtown California and are interested in skateboarding? No problem. Spend $12 and several thousand of them could see your post of a cool skate T-shirt that you designed.   So that’s all great, but can you do anything really innovative on Facebook? Sure – with Facebook Live. Live lets you broadcast in real time to your followers, take questions and get instant reactions. Now, it’s not for everyone. There are only a few live TV shows for a reason: they’re hard to do. But if you’re experienced with video, it can be very powerful. Brittney Castro of Financially Wise Women is a great example of someone with a fresh personal brand in a stuffy old industry – personal finance. She first attracted attention for a finance rap video – the exact opposite of the marketing you’d expect from a financial advisor. These days, she’s a hit across all channels. But her favorite is Facebook Live. She loves the way she can answer women’s financial questions live, bringing them real value and talking directly to her potential customers. And by doing Lives with her brand partners, such as Chase Bank, she is bringing her offer to a huge audience. So for all the doubters – yes, Facebook is still innovating. And so should you! People usually don’t complain when there’s too much beauty. But this was actually an issue for Instagram, until the site launched its Stories function, where people can post spontaneous photos and short videos, knowing that they’ll only be up for a day. Now Instagram doesn’t suffer from being too polished – it has a perfect mix of curated and ephemeral content. The day Stories launched, the site’s CEO admitted he hadn’t posted for six days because “none of the moments seemed special enough.” Now, users can post stunning shots for posterity and snap their morning coffee with a cheery caption and stick it on Stories, knowing it’ll be gone in 24 hours. Stories is now hugely popular, and savvy users are employing it to show a little behind-the-scenes personality. So the site’s new balance is one reason its thriving. But, even more important for us, Instagram offers some super simple ways to do business development. Here’s a hypothetical success story that demonstrates the point: Tom is an ambitious manager of a clothing store in Kansas City called EnAvant. He starts instagramming as much as possible. He posts photos of everything: clothes on hangers, shoes on shelves and tons of customers wearing their new outfits, all nicely filtered. Every post has the right hashtags – #EnAvantwear #Kansasfashion #falltrends #fallfashion. On his lunch break, he starts to reach out to stylish locals by searching “Kansas City” and seeing who pops up. He direct messages some of the more popular and fashion-oriented people, saying, “Hey I manage EnAvant, we love your style! Come by and we’ll give you 25 percent off your purchase.” Of the 40 people, he reaches out to, six post on their social media about this nice guy who complimented them and helped them out. Tom then invites his influential locals in for a fashion night with a 30-percent discount, and makes the event so fun that he doesn’t even have to take photos anymore: all the guests are uploading to Instagram themselves, #EnAvant. Sales are up – and so is Tom’s personal brand. What’s next for him? His own fashion line? A successful blog? Thanks to his work on Instagram, the choice is his to make. Ever tried watching video while cleaning your bathroom? It’s not so easy. But listening to something? That works. By selling the ability to multitask, spoken-word media will always have a huge market. Podcasts can be a great place to find and nail your niche. John Lee Dumas was a podcast fan and a wannabe entrepreneur. But when he searched for a podcast about entrepreneur’s experiences, he found nothing. So he thought: Why not do it myself? He had little experience, and he started out by talking to relatively unknown entrepreneurs. But by running the daily show Entrepreneurs On Fire, he learned fast and built a presence. Within months, he was hitting over 100,000 downloads. His guests got better. He started getting invited to conferences, building his credibility further. Today, he’s become the entrepreneur he always wanted to be: earning millions from his podcast and his branded products and services. Maybe you’re thinking, “Good for John, but the podcast market is crowded now.” The great news is a whole new platform is opening up, and fast. Content delivered by digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant in super-short, spoken flash briefings is the next big thing. The author already produces a daily flash briefing that you can subscribe to. Before you brush your teeth in the morning, tell Alexa to “give me my flash briefings,” and you’ll be able to hear his one-minute daily motivational message. So there is a new platform with huge potential and few leading influencers right now. Let’s say you’re a landscape gardener. Wouldn’t a one-minute “Ted’s Daily Garden Tips” be a nice fresh way to boost your business’s brand? Five years from now, quick audio updates won’t be easy to launch unless you market the hell out of them. But now – do something interesting and it could take off. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and crush it. The key message in these blinks: If you are stuck in a job you don’t like, or have a business but don’t feel it’s going anywhere fast, then have the courage to change something. Build a life and a business around something you truly love, whether that’s helping people learn about fashion or custom-made tree houses or garage sales – whatever your passion may be. Document your journey on YouTube. Use Twitter to catch the eye of fellow tree-house enthusiasts. Distribute your fashion ideas on Facebook, and share across Instagram. And always keep one eye out for the next big platform. Actionable advice: Reach out to others but do it right.  Reaching out to influencers – people with a large following on social-media platforms – through direct messages is a sure-fire way to build collaborations and get advice, so don’t be shy. Be sure that you offer something of real value in return, though. If you can’t offer exposure, then think of something else you can trade. If you’re a graphic designer, offer to make some custom filters in exchange for advice. Make pizzas? Offer free slices in return for a collaboration. This approach can be hard work – you’ll send a lot of messages before getting a single reply – but that’s why most people won’t persevere with it. If you do, you’re already winning. Got feedback?

Doing business across borders is simpler than ever before, and the internet provides everyone with easy access to the tools they need to go it alone as a solo entrepreneur. In short, it’s a golden age for startups. But most young companies still fall at the first hurdle. So what’s going on? Well, here’s the thing: even if you have the greatest idea in the world, you’ll still go bust if you’re not applying a couple of basic business rules. In the end, it’s the simplest – and most common – pitfalls that snuff out so many startups. That means it’s not a bad idea to make like a greenhorn and seek the advice of a grizzled veteran or two when you first arrive on the frontlines. And that’s exactly who you’ll be meeting in these blinks: savvy business minds who’ve seen it all and know the startup scene like the back of their own hands. However, their essential field manual for founders isn’t just a survival guide. Start putting their tips into practice, and you’ll be well on your way to thriving in one of the most exciting industries in existence. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should seek out investors who bring more to the table than just cash; how to kick the micromanaging habit; and why hiring people is like giving away Super Bowl tickets. If you’re reading these blinks, chances are you’re thinking of going it alone and starting your own business – but have you asked yourself, why? Is it because it’s the thing to do these days, or are you just in it for a quick buck? If you’re not sure, it’s time to ponder some key questions and a couple of sobering facts! First things first: a lot of startups fail. That’s statistically proven, but it also makes intuitive sense. After all, there’s only so much money, attention and support to go around. A couple of startups enjoy meteoric success – just think of Google or Facebook – while the rest fight for crumbs. That’s not supposed to deter you, but it is important that you keep it in mind. If you’re going to make it, you’ll need to be extremely hardworking and make smart decisions. Still game? Great, now’s the time to answer that all-important question and clarify your aims. Whether you want to make a ton of cash or change the world, having a clear idea of your goal will see you through tough times. You’ll also want to make sure you’re firmly committed to your project before jumping in. Remember, adversity is virtually guaranteed. Success is all about sticking to your guns, even when the situation looks all but hopeless. That said, you should put a couple of numbers to that commitment so that you know when to hit the eject button. You might, for example, say that you’re willing to put $200,000 of your own cash into your startup and that you’re going to stick it out for a year. If you realize there’s little to no chance of your making it after 12 months, it’s probably a good idea to quit before you end up throwing good money after the bad. And here’s the final thing you’ll need to keep in mind: although you’ll be dependant on your own resources, you’re much more likely to come out on top if you have the support of others. That’s why it’s so important to make sure your friends and family are on board with your project and understand the risks. Your life is going to be hectic, unpredictable and full of long shifts – you don’t want that to cause grief in your relationships! Fundraising is vital, but it’s a hard slog. At times, it’ll seem pointless and leave you feeling like Don Quixote – the mad Spanish knight who charges down windmills he’s mistaken for giants in Cervantes’ eponymous novel. But here’s the thing: if you’re struggling to make headway, it might just be because you’ve forgotten a couple of basic fundraising rules. The key to raising money is finding the right contacts. That means you need to be discerning when it comes to putting together a list of potential investors. So what does that look like in practice? Well, a good start is to make sure you’re targeting people who know your industry. If you’re launching a pharmaceutical product, for example, you don’t want to be calling investors who specialize in the music industry. That’s because you don’t just want money – you also want people who can support your business with advice, experience and access to their network. The best investors open doors for you, so focus on finding a small number of genuine industry experts, rather than hitting up anyone with a checkbook. Chances are, things will move much more quickly that way. Right, so you know who you’re aiming to get on board – now you’ll need to make sure you’re maximizing your chances of convincing them. That all comes down to two things: sound planning and excellent listening skills. Let’s start with planning. Proper preparation is essential when you’re fundraising. You’ll want to turn up to meetings with a clear idea of where you’re at right now and where the money you’re asking for will get you. Ideally, you’ll be doing this far enough in advance so that you’re not making your pitch when you’re already desperate for funding. It’s also a good idea to ask for an amount that fits with your startup’s stage of development. If it’s still early days, for example, you’re probably best off keeping your request modest. Finally, you’ll want to make sure you’re listening to investors even when they turn you down. So if the tenth potential investor in a row tells you your project doesn’t seem to be fully fledged, you’ll want to take some time out from fundraising to consolidate your business plan. As an entrepreneur, it’s natural that you’re protective about your business – after all, it’s your baby. That’s sometimes a problem, though; like an overprotective parent, the urge to micromanage every little detail can be irresistible. But that’s ultimately counterproductive. Running everything yourself won’t just stress you out – it might even kill your beloved company. Luckily, there are plenty of simple tools you can use to increase your employees’ efficiency without constantly hovering over them. The key is to create a company culture that encourages excellence. That’s all about communicating your goals clearly and motivating people to accomplish them by rewarding achievement. And remember to be generous; if your team completes 80 percent of what it set out to do, chalk it up as a triumph. A great company culture is also proactive about solving problems. Here, you’ll have to lead by example. Encourage people to come to you with their problems, and earn their trust by going out of your way to resolve them. Ideally, you’ll be assessing the relevance of the issue the same day it’s been brought up and taking steps to solve it within 24 hours. Put those two policies into place, and you can be sure your employees will become increasingly self-reliant, freeing your time up for other important tasks. And here’s the good news: when your workers show initiative and autonomy, your company is much more likely to prosper. That’s something author Maynard Webb learned firsthand while working with clients like Yahoo and eBay. Take just one striking example from his time as a manager at eBay. Webb’s team was dealing with a massive logistical headache. Users’ sales adverts were flooding in at such a volume that the company’s infrastructure simply couldn’t keep up. It was taking 24 hours before new posts were properly indexed and appearing online. Customers who were paying premium rates for greater visibility were naturally furious about this logjam. Normally, it would’ve taken up to 18 months to resolve such a serious technical hitch. Webb’s team, however, were used to working self-reliantly by this point. It was, after all, a vital aspect of the company culture he had cultivated at eBay. As a result, they set about resolving the issue themselves without passing it up the hierarchy. Within six months, they’d created a brand new indexing process, and the bug was fixed! Webb knows all about how hard delegating tasks can be. Take the case of one his managers. He was getting great operational results from his team, and the sales figures looked great – but the people under him were constantly criticizing his tendency to micromanage employees. The manager was exhausted, and the team was frustrated by its members’ lack of autonomy. In the end, the manager decided to stop micromanaging. When the author later asked him how his project was doing, he told him that he didn’t know. He’d delegated the task to his team and washed his hands of the matter. Needless to say, that isn’t exactly a shining example of great delegation!   So what does effective delegation look like? Well, the most important thing is getting the balance between managerial oversight and responsibility right. You want to make sure your project is being executed correctly without constantly stepping on your employees’ toes. To do that, you’ll need to decide which team members are most capable and willing to complete essential tasks, and you’ll need to communicate your goals clearly. The second step is to make sure that you’re regularly checking in to see how things are going and that you’re rewarding good work. Easier said than done, right? Not quite – in fact, there’s a simple tool you can start using today to help you effectively delegate work. It’s called the RACI Model. Here’s how it works. When you’re delegating tasks, you’ll want to ask yourself four questions. First off, who is Responsible? Here you’ll be identifying the person you’ll be putting in charge of making calls. Ideally, he’ll be as far down the hierarchy as possible – otherwise, you’ll end up micromanaging him! Next, who Approves? This is the person who’ll have veto powers over the team member you’ve made responsible. Typically, this is the delegator – that is, you. Third, who is Consulted? This is about identifying people who have no final say in the project, but whose input is vital to its success. Finally, ask yourself, who is Informed? These are basically stakeholders: people interested in, and affected by, the decisions that will be made. Remember, when in doubt, it’s always better to tell more people, rather than fewer. When Webb was interviewed for his first job, a position at IBM, he was asked how he’d feel about firing someone. Webb replied that he reckoned he’d be able to do it but couldn’t imagine it ever being necessary. The interviewer laughed out loud. Webb would soon understand why. There’s no getting around it: some people just aren’t cut out for their jobs. Ask the average manager how many employees he’d hire again after having seen them in action for a couple of years, and he’ll likely tell you that 80 percent of his calls were correct. That leaves the 20 percent: serial underperformers you’d be better off replacing.   Established companies have a bit of leeway when it comes to mediocre workers – they’re usually large enough to carry a bit of dead weight. That’s not true of startups, however. Faced with smaller budgets and limited resources, they simply can’t afford to spend a cent on anyone who’s not pulling their weight. That’s why it’s so important to act swiftly and decisively when there’s no alternative to letting someone go. Unfortunately, lots of managers hesitate when faced with making such a dramatic call. That’s an issue. Have you heard the saying that a bad apple spoils the barrel? Well, underachievers have just that effect, undermining the morale of high performers who resent having to cover for someone who isn’t doing his fair share.   Acting quickly avoids all that trouble. You might even be able to save the employee: a well-timed, supportive intervention sometimes gets him back on track. If that’s not possible, however, you’ll have to reach for the metaphorical axe and give him the chop. The best policy, though, is to prevent that uncomfortable situation from arising in the first place by taking your time when it comes to hiring. Think of taking new people on as giving away a limited number of tickets to the Super Bowl – you’d really want to think about who deserves them, right? So if two applicants are pretty much evenly matched on paper, take into account their intangible qualities, like a willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty and provide excellent customer service. Stress lurks around every corner when you’re an entrepreneur. Take it from Webb. He remembers getting up one morning at 5:00 a.m. because he had a two-hour drive ahead of him to get to an 8:00 a.m. meeting in San Francisco. Before heading out, he sat down to quickly shoot off a couple of emails. When he fired up his laptop, however, disaster struck: he couldn’t log in to his account, even though he was using the correct password. Reloading the page didn’t help, either. To top it all off, Webb had a nasty bout of the flu and was feeling awful. It was the worst possible start to an already pretty intense day. It’s in moments like these that you’ll have to take a step back. Sometimes, all it takes is a moment of calm to make things look a whole lot better. Webb took a couple of deep breaths and thought about his situation. He rebooted his laptop and found that the problem had been resolved. These sorts of stressful situations are pretty commonplace when you’re a startup founder. The key is to remind yourself that the situation is temporary; no matter how bad things look right now, they will improve – especially if you put your mind to solving them. Remember, panicking only makes things worse. It’s when you’re in headless-chicken mode that you really start falling behind. What you need to do when you find yourself in a jam is follow this simple, four-step plan: slow your pace, figure out the immediate cause of the crisis, come up with a solution and, finally, proactively implement it. To do that, you’ll need to put some distance between yourself and your operational work so you can really look at the issue in detail. It’s also a good idea to give a moment of thought to anticipating problems that might interfere with important tasks. Next, make a list of priorities, and work through them in order. Finally, give yourself ample time to complete these tasks so you don’t find yourself scrambling to hurry them across the finish line at the last minute. A couple of years back, Yahoo began developing a flight search tool called Hipmunk. The project looked set to become a success until Google dropped a bombshell: it was working on its own competing service. It was a blow for Yahoo. No wonder: competition, especially from a giant like Google, always makes fundraising a lot tougher. But that kind of challenge doesn’t just frighten managers and employees; it also tends to scare investors. In fact, it’s usually when they ask you if you’re worried that you know you’d better start worrying! So what can you do when a rival moves onto your turf? Well, the place to start is by reassuring your backers. That’s because there’s a real risk of a snowball effect: losing just one investor can spook others, eventually leading to a mass exodus. The second bit of advice is to stay calm yourself and try to wait it out. Hold back while you figure out just how big the threat is, and don’t worry too much if you’re raising less money during this period of insecurity. If keeping your cool sounds all well and good in theory, but hard to put into practice when you’re looking down the barrel of a crisis, just remember this: At the time of writing, Yahoo’s Hipmunk still ranks ahead of Google Flights on the product recommendation website Slant! And here’s another thing to keep in mind when you’re anxiously surveying your rivals: competition isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Take an example from the travel industry. When Google decided it was going to enter the market, existing companies like Expedia and Priceline banded together to retain their position. They teamed up with Hipmunk and put their own financial might and expertise at the latter’s disposal, transforming an inexperienced new kid on the block into a powerful agent capable of blocking the Silicon Valley giant’s takeover bid. That would never have happened if Google hadn’t announced itself as a competitor! Imagine a bomb scare on a subway system. The authorities have to react, but they also need to make sure they’re reacting in the right way. In other words, the best thing they can do is make sure they’ve assessed the situation correctly. That’s also true in business. If you find yourself in a crisis, the most important step is analytical: determining whether the crisis is real and, if it is, finding out just how bad it is. To do that, you have to make use of a key managerial skill: listening. After all, it’s usually your employees who’ll first notice something’s wrong. If you want to anticipate issues, you’d better keep your ear close to the ground! Once you’ve heard that ominous rumble in the distance, you’ll need to put a system in place that allows  you to understand how grave the threat actually is. When Webb was at eBay, for example, he used a scale ranging from one to nine, like the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes. Small, low-priority niggles ranked lowest; large-scale problems that could undermine the whole company ranked highest. In practice, that meant an eBay user who couldn’t access the site due to a bug on their computer would rank as a one. It wasn’t a serious matter and, in any case, the company couldn’t do much to fix it. The eBay backup program failing to run during a power outage, however, was a code-red, level-nine kind of issue. So what do you do when you’re faced with those kinds of crises? Well, you only really have one option: sound the alarm, summon all hands on deck, and try to resolve it as quickly as possible. If you want to know why speed is so vital, just think of the popular saying about frogs and boiling water: put the amphibian in a pot of scalding water, and it’ll jump right out – but put it a vat of lukewarm water and slowly bring it to a boil, and it will stay in the water until it’s too late! For a real-world example of a company not waiting around for the water to come to a boil, look to the electric car manufacturer Tesla. In 2015, the company discovered a potential security problem related to their seatbelts. Tesla immediately sprung into action, recalled all affected automobiles and got to work finding a solution. If they hadn’t, they wouldn’t have just put their customers’ lives at risk – they’d also have exposed themselves to serious legal issues. So, remember: whether you’re dealing with fundraising or delegation issues, there are always ways to up your game as a founder and steer your company toward success! The key message in these blinks: There’s no sugarcoating it: launching a startup isn’t for the faint of heart. More startups fail than succeed, and the only way of avoiding their fate is elbow grease, fanatical determination and a willingness to work impossibly long hours. That’s why it’s so important to make sure you’ve got the essentials down before you jump in. Whether it’s effective fundraising, firing underperformers or motivating your employees, these are all skills you can learn. Pair that with a can-do attitude and an ability to keep calm in the face of crises, and you’ll be set for success!  Actionable advice: Aim to be great – don’t content yourself with good.  Ask the average manager how her company is doing, and she’ll usually compare its current performance to last year’s or the competition’s. That’s not good enough; if you’re not comparing yourself to what you can become or the greatest successes in your field, you’re on course for mediocrity at best. So start setting your sights a little higher than usual. As they say, if you shoot for the moon and miss, you’ll still land among the stars. Got feedback?

Realizing your passion is important, because it makes all the decisions that follow easy. Because you always know what you are aiming for, your ultimate goal. For instance, if you know you are passionate about running your own business, and you love the satisfaction and fulfillment it gives you, the decision to turn down an offer to sell it for a large amount of money becomes easier to make. Creating, doing, and making things that you are passionate about is more important than making a lot of money doing things you can’t stand. Before you go any further, you need to decide if you are going to be true to yourself and, “stop chasing the money and start chasing the passion.” One way to find your passion is by trying many things to see what works. Along the way, you might find that one thing through the process of elimination, by realizing what it is you don’t want to do. The more things you eliminate from your list, the easier it becomes to find your real passion. And the closer you get to finding your passion, the less likely it is you will end up chasing the wrong dreams. Rapid growth for your company can be exciting, gaining investment dollars and hiring new employees every week. But beware of hypergrowth and take it as a warning sign. Growing too quickly and hiring the wrong people can diminish your company’s culture. No matter how many positions you think have to be filled, always take the time to carefully consider each new hire. You have to ensure every person on your team shares your vision and wants to be a part of the company culture you’ve created. Conversely, making quick hires can be seriously damaging to company culture if they are out solely for personal gain and career advancement. Make these hiring mistakes, and you are bound to wake up one morning realizing that you no longer enjoy your workplace and the people in it. This is exactly what happened to Tony Hsieh and his first company, LinkExchange, when they began growing so quickly that he realized he didn’t even recognize the people in his own office. Caught up in the rush and excitement of the company’s success, the company culture suffered, because the new hires weren’t passionate about LinkExchange’s mission. They were just looking to make a lot of money and retire. In the end, Tony learned the valuable lesson that it’s best to grow a company slowly to carefully monitor the hiring process and ensure that everyone on board is contributing to the culture you wish to create. Short-term sacrifices to protect company culture and stick to core values are a long-term benefit. The culture of a company is one of its most important characteristics. Your culture is your brand, your employees are your brand ambassadors. So make it a point that each new hire joins the team for more than the skills and experience listed on their CV. Only hire people you would happily go out for drinks with. Connectedness, and feeling like part of a tribe makes people happy and creates a sense of fulfillment. Both are strong motivators. When a group of people feels connected, like a family, there is a strong sense of obligation to the whole team, to work harder and treat each other better. However, simply feeling connected is not enough. Your team should also have a shared purpose and shared passions. Hire only people who emulate, live, and breathe your core values. If you have a strong company culture, formed by people who have a common goal, your company’s core values will form naturally. Company culture is even more important than customer service, because if the culture is right, great customer service will naturally develop from it. For Tony Hsieh, the process of finding a great culture involved much trial and error, but mainly boiled down to spending time together as a team outside the office. When the entire Zappos team moved to Las Vegas together, it forced them to rely on each other and grow closer. A team doesn’t need to move to a new city to do that, but it helped Tony and the Zappos team hunker down and think about what was collectively important to them, and out of this came their core values.   To build a great company, you have to pursue growth and learning. Continual growth should be a goal for your overall business and for all the people that are part of it. Create a culture that fosters both personal and professional development. Build an office library, offer classes for developing new skills. Employees should feel like their work is part of a greater purpose, and that learning and growth are not only allowed, but appreciated. It benefits your business to constantly present all employees with new challenges and opportunities to grow. They won’t feel stagnant, but can develop and take on more tasks and responsibilities as they grow with you.    The Zappos team has a goal of helping employees unlock their potential by constantly taking on new challenges. The overall business is constantly facing new challenges, so it benefits both them and the company if employees are taking on new responsibilities and developing new skills to tackle whatever issues Zappos faces. They learned that the best expertise someone could bring to the team is an ability to learn, grow, and adapt, and they aim to give employees the freedom to pursue new challenges as they feel ready to take them on. One Zappos employee, inspired by her freedom within the company to propose new ideas and go after more challenging projects when she felt ready, became so confident that she started speaking about Zappos at conferences. And the growth carried over to her personal life as well, inspiring her to pursue more reading and a healthier lifestyle. Essentially, a happier, more fulfilled life!  Having one thing your company aims to be the best at is helpful because it allows you to focus and specialize, and thus become really great at something rather than being merely adequate or good at several things. Tony and the Zappos team decided that customer satisfaction and creating a WOW experience for their customers was the one thing they wanted to become great at. They wanted to focus on extraordinary customer service, and on delivering happiness to people through great service. Since a company’s culture and its customer service are closely tied together, delivering great customer service and making your customers happy is only possible if you start by treating your employees well and making them happy. Happy employees will be passionate about their jobs and make customers happy through great service. Tony Hsieh’s most important piece of advice is to never outsource the one thing you want your company to be best at. From his experience with his former company, eLogistics, he learned that if there’s something you want your business to be a leader in, it must extend throughout the company. It can’t be up to just one department. A radical way that Zappos stuck to their commitment to extraordinary customer service was by moving headquarters to Las Vegas, where they wanted to build their customer support call center. It was their way of making customer support their utmost priority, as an entire team.  Attempting to create buzz around your brand is counterproductive when you could just be putting your effort into doing what you do best. Instead of stressing over how to get media attention, focus on delivering a great customer experience and service. The rest will follow, and your buzz will self generate. The goal of your customer service should be to create positive emotional associations with your brand. Every interaction with your customers is an opportunity to further your brand. Great customer service builds your brand and drives word of mouth advertising. Let loyal customers do your marketing for you. When you’re doing something that naturally creates interesting stories, people will want to get in on the action and talk about it. Word of mouth is a powerful thing. Press will follow. Zappos has developed a following thanks to great customer service interactions over the phone, in particular. Creating a great impression over the phone will not only result in word of mouth advertising from the customer, but will also increase the lifetime value of the customer. Zappos uses the money they would have spent on traditional advertising to pour back into their customer experience instead. That means customer perks like free shipping on every order, a 365-day return policy, unexpected next day shipping for customers, and authentic interactions on the phone when customers call for assistance. Because Zappos goes above and beyond to wow their customers in these ways, buzz has naturally generated around their brand, and they have received a great deal of media attention for it.  Having a vision of a higher purpose means being about something bigger than whatever you are selling. It means having a goal that goes beyond making profits and growing a company. Even though Zappos is a shoe business by technicality, that’s not the real thing they’re selling. There’s a higher purpose–namely, making people happy. By delivering great customer service. WOWing people by going above and beyond their expectations. Whether this means surprising a customer by upgrading their shipping or offering free return shipping, Zappos always has the longer term goal in mind which is about more than bringing in revenue. Having such long term goals, in life, and in business, means asking yourself why you are doing something. And knowing you do what you do for a higher purpose will make you happier. This is where it all comes together. For Tony Hsieh the whole point of building a company based on customer satisfaction, of creating a culture he and his employees believe in–is happiness, both for employees and customers. Company culture and customer service are the keys to a successful business. Ultimately, happiness is what everyone is looking for in life, and a company can be successful by finding ways to make its employees, customers, and partners happy. This is achieved through extraordinary customer service and a company culture that is unique, one that employees believe in. Got feedback? We’d love to hear what you think about our content!

Probably not. Most of the time, we buy products based on price or simple convenience. If something else came along that was cheaper or easier to find, you’d make the switch without a second glance. But there are a few brands about which people seem to feel deeply. Services like Airbnb, companies like Apple and social media sites like Facebook have a devoted fan base made up of passionate people who are indeed loyal to the company and all it offers and does. Yet what is it about these companies that inspires such love? And how do you create the same sort of buzz for your own brand? As you will find out in these blinks, these brands take the traditional “Ps” of marketing and add one more important element: people. They place us, the customer, our problems and our lives, at the center of everything they do. And in return, we love them for it. In the following blinks, you will discover why innovation doesn’t start with a product, but with a truth; how Airbnb changed the way we travel completely; and why charitable giving can help a company sell more shoes. In the past, the path to creating, developing and marketing a product was straightforward. First, you had an idea: a new teapot. You'd develop your teapot, deciding on the curve of its handle, the color of its glaze. Then you'd try to start selling your teapot, targeting your advertising to areas or demographics where you might find some potential customers. But this kind of thinking doesn't work anymore. You can't just rely on your fantastic teapot eclipsing all your competitors. There are so many products available today that it's nearly impossible to truly make your teapot stand out! If you want to be successful, you've got to think in a new way. You can't just try to be different; you've got to create difference. Creating difference isn't about beating the competition but about doing something they've never done before. It's about reinventing your industry. You have to think about what people really need if you want to create difference. You have to solve a problem for them and truly make their lives better. A new shiny teapot alone won't do that. This means your creative process has to be different, too. Your product doesn't come first; what you need first is a truth. A truth about someone's problem. Then you think about solving that problem. Creating and launching the actual product comes at the very last, after this period of empathetic thinking. This is how you make your company stand out in an overcrowded market. Warby Parker, an eyewear retailer, found success by finding a truth about eyeglass wearers and solving it. The company founders realized that people who might not have hundreds of dollars to buy name-brand, stylish glasses still had the real desire to wear them. Yet there were no affordable options on the market for these customers. Warby Parker recognized this and became successful by solving this problem – creating stylish and affordable eyewear – for this market segment. How many advertisements do you think you've come across today? Probably hundreds. While we’re surrounded by ads, it's never been clearer that traditional advertising just doesn’t work anymore, as there’s too much competition. Why should we pay attention to any given ad? Moreover, traditional ads usually don't give a potential customer reason to really care about whatever a company is advertising. Messages are generally designed to appeal to the largest number of people possible, without targeting specific groups or personalities. Such ads don’t try to solve our problems or fulfill our desires, they just shout at us. “Buy this! We're slightly different!” If everyone is shouting, it’s easy to ignore the noise, and most people can tune it out. What’s more, you’re an individual, and you want to be treated as one. Thus companies need to appeal to people in a personal way, if they want potential customers to tune in and listen. Effective, modern marketing isn't about yelling, but instead about telling stories potential customers can connect to or identify with. If your story shares something meaningful about someone's life, for example, your potential customer may be much more likely to listen. Companies that tell a story with which their customers can empathize are more often than not successful! The online vacation rental company Airbnb, for example, tells a great story. The company knows that hotels are expensive and impersonal. Thus Airbnb doesn’t just offer cheaper hotel rooms, they offer a whole new experience, encouraging customers to explore the world in a new way. So how do you create a story your customers can connect to? You need to follow the difference model, which focuses on the six P’s: principles, purpose, people, personal, perceptions and product. We'll look at each of these elements in more detail in the next blinks. The first step in following the difference model is to focus on your principles. Your principles are the fundamental truths behind your business, market and customers. First, you have to identify these truths. What are your strengths and weaknesses? How can you take these into account and use them to reach your goals? Let’s look at Airbnb again. The company recognized the truth that it had very little capital to build a business. Yet it did have a wealth of creativity and design skills. The company founders also had a real desire to change people’s lives. So Airbnb’s founders built their company on the skills they had, playing to their natural strengths. You also have to recognize the truths behind your industry. What determines exactly how your industry works? How can you use these truths to your advantage, or how can you change them? Apple’s Steve Jobs did this when considering a design for a new phone. He recognized that an important principle of the industry was that mobile phones had to be functional. He exploited this by developing a phone that could function not only as a mobile phone but also much more. Finally, you need to analyze your customers' principles. Think about the people whose lives you want to change. What truths lie behind their behavior? What truths limit them or make them unhappy? What do they desire? After you are able to answer these questions, you can work on making a difference in their lives. Entrepreneur Sara Blakey did just this when she designed her line of undergarments, called Spanx. She recognized the truth that many women were unhappy with the visible lines caused by poorly fitting underwear. So she developed a range of body-shaping clothes that eliminated these lines, and quickly became enormously successful. The most important thing you have to identify in business is your purpose. In short, your purpose is the very reason your business exists. So the second step in the difference model is to carefully analyze what you want to achieve. Think about the impact you want your business to have on the world. By the Way Bakery – a small, old-fashioned bakery in New York – built its business in this fashion. The bakery only serves gluten and dairy-free desserts, creating top-quality products even though the ingredients they can use are obviously limited. Importantly, the bakery founders wanted to give customers a great experience and feed them delicious food, regardless of their dietary restrictions. Having a strong purpose like this gives you and your company direction and keeps you on track. When you think about the impact you want your business to have, remember to focus on the people. Don't think of your customers as some abstract demographic or a bunch of numbers in a customer data chart! Treat both customers and potential customers as actual humans with emotions, desires and problems. You can't do anything to help them unless you understand them as the complicated, multifaceted beings they are. Online bank Simple.com built its success on understanding its customers and their needs. The company founders understood that traditional banks often make people feel powerless, or worse, stupid. They also understood that people often dislike or distrust institutional banks, and thought that perhaps customers might feel more comfortable banking online. Thus Simple.com was born as an online banking service to address exactly this problem, and this purpose is what made the company stand out. It's vital to understand your customers' thoughts and wishes, but this alone won't make your business successful. You also have to ensure that people care about what you're doing. Thus the next steps in the difference model is to make a personal connection with customers to ensure that they perceive the difference in the quality of services or products that you offer. Whatever your product or service, it has to resonate with the lives that your potential customers are living. That is, people should feel good when they're using your product or service. The shoe company TOMS offers a great example. TOMS promises that for every pair of shoes you buy from the company, they donate another pair to a child in the developing world. The company calls this their “one for one” model. This model definitely makes people feel good about buying TOMS shoes, as every time they put their shoes on, they remember how they've helped a child in need. So think about people’s beliefs and ideas, and make your business match those ideas. Offer people a product or service that they can feel good about! Taxi service Uber became successful in this way. The company realized that people had grown frustrated with taxi services, as they are often unreliable and expensive. In short, people distrusted the taxi industry. So Uber set out to offer a transportation service that people could actually enjoy, and more importantly, come to trust. The customer’s perception of the honesty and integrity of the company made a difference. The company didn't just set out to solve entrenched problems with the taxi industry but essentially changed the way we use transportation in general. Uber has in turn changed people’s ideas about the industry at large. People now expect cheaper and more reliable taxi services, because Uber set a new standard for the industry. So after you've spent time researching and thinking about your customers, your business and your industry, you can finally move to the last step in the difference model: developing your product. Remember that your product has to fill a particular void in people’s lives, giving them something that they really need. This means you shouldn't create a product just because you think it could somehow plug a gap in the market or compete with similar products already out there. Your product has to make a real difference for people. It has to change something about your customer’s life! Airbnb again offers a great example. The company could have operated just like a hotel, but instead of hotel rooms, offer rooms in private homes. You could simply book online, stay and then leave. Instead, the company went further. Airbnb made it so travelers could interact and connect with the owners of the house or flat, and both sides could talk to each other, offering feedback. The company offered a great customer service experience with the chance to comfortably explore the world. Airbnb didn’t just make it easier to find a place to sleep, the company changed the way we travel! There's never been a better time to figure out what people need and make a difference in their lives. So what are you waiting for? Social media is an incredible tool to help you get your message across, allowing you to make meaningful and empathetic connections with strangers in all sorts of unprecedented ways. Doing your research on social media is a great place to start. Get a feel for how people live their lives, see what kinds of problems they're talking about and then focus on how to help them. Solving real problems is the key to your success! The key message in this book: Traditional marketing is dead. You can't get attention anymore through having flashier ads than your competitors! You’ve got to connect with people in a more meaningful way. When you figure out how to solve a problem for people, you won't just make them happier – you'll be more successful too. Actionable advice: Don't try to appeal to the masses. People don't respond when you treat them as if they're all the same. You have to appeal to your potential customers as individuals, with unique feelings and thoughts. Tailor your marketing to the people you're really trying to help. If you try to appeal to everyone, you'll end up appealing to no one Suggested further reading: The Brand Gap by Marty Neumeier In The Brand Gap, you’ll get the inside scoop on how a strong brand can give your company a competitive edge.

Rogers","summary":"It seems that at any time and in any part of the world, you’ll find an innovation beginning to take hold. Whether it’s a new technology, like the now-ubiquitous smartphone, or an idea and practice, such as safe sex, innovations spread throughout a society in a systematic way. This process is what author Everett M. Rogers calls “the diffusion of innovations.” In this groundbreaking book, the author describes the process in which an innovation comes to be adopted, whether an idea, a practice or an object, and identifies the five stages in the process: Knowledge, Persuasion, Decision, Implementation and Confirmation. The potential user’s path through these five stages essentially determines whether an innovation will succeed or fail. You’ll learn what happens in each of these stages and find valuable advice about how to increase the chances that your innovation will be adopted. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: why some people in the German Democratic Republic filled their washing machines with fruit, why people in countries such as China or Japan are more likely to adopt a certain innovation just because others are already using it, why there are fewer and fewer smokers these days, and why the elderly are always the last social group to purchase a smartphone. Think back to the last time you decided whether you were going to use a new product or service. Do you know what motivated your decision? We may not be aware of it, but our decision making always follows a certain pattern, which comprises five stages. The first is the Knowledge stage, the moment that we first learn of a new technology or innovation. But what leads us to enter this stage? Is it that we have a specific, prior need for a particular technology? Or, is it simply that we have become aware of the innovation? Some people actively seek out a particular innovation, such as a specific technology, because they have a certain need for it in their lives. In this context, a need is a state of frustration or dissatisfaction which arises when an individual’s desires exceed the currently available resources. This need will drive that person – who has a specific problem and a desire to fix it – to ask around and seek a solution. For example, imagine that you’re a farmer and that your crops are being destroyed by a particular pest. In such a case, you’ll likely actively seek out a pesticide to deal with that bug. Other people, however, enter the Knowledge stage not because they were actively searching for a particular innovation but because they were made aware of the innovation’s existence. Sometimes, the release of a new product into the market is communicated via channels that don’t target you specifically. However, you might learn of a product by word of mouth: perhaps a friend informs you about a new device they think you’d be interested in. For instance, when the latest version of Apple’s iPhone is announced at a developer conference, many technology magazines will provide details of its release and new features. As a result, one of your friends – perhaps a tech expert, always on the lookout for new gadgets – will read one of those magazines and, knowing you’d be interested, tell you all about the new iPhone. However your knowledge of a product’s existence comes about, once you have learned of it, what happens then? Do you simply decide, without bias, to use that product? In a word, no. After the Knowledge stage, you form a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the innovation. This is the Persuasion stage. First, you either like the product or you don’t. If you do like it, you then have to research the product and find credible information about it. But the problem is, in the Persuasion stage, we’re always selective about the information we seek, to the extent that we might ignore information that challenges our initial feelings about the product. For example, if you find a product you believe makes you look cool, you might choose to ignore a review that discusses how unreliable the product is. Following this, we then reconcile the attributes of the innovation with our own attitude toward it, and try to anticipate its future evolution. In other words, we balance our feelings about the product against aspects such as price, complexity and operation. If we are still uncertain about the product, we try to anticipate its evolution. For example, if you purchase a new model of camera, you may feel uncertain as it’s impossible early on to know whether the camera will be used by other people, or even whether you are using it correctly. To handle this uncertainty, we anticipate our future use of the camera and we consider how much it costs, how hard it is to use and how our friends will perceive it. Then, after doing your research and dealing with your uncertainties, if your attitude toward the product remains positive, you’ll most likely start using it. However, some innovations don’t require that an adopter have a positive attitude toward the innovation. For instance, most people, including smokers themselves, have a negative attitude toward cigarettes. Yet most smokers will not give up their cigarette habit. Having sought out information about the new product and formed an attitude toward it, you’re now going to decide whether to use it. In other words, you’ll either adopt the innovation (choose to make full use of it) or reject it (decide not to use it). This is the Decision stage, and there are a few factors here that are pertinent to an innovation being adopted or rejected. First, innovations that can be tried out before purchase are more likely to be adopted. And if they are found to have a relative advantage over other similar products – for instance, better functionality – they’ll be adopted more quickly. For example, in 1930s Iowa, corn seed salesmen handed out bags of a new seed to farmers, enough to plant approximately one acre of corn. Because this new seed was proven to be superior to that which they currently used, the farmers were convinced to purchase it. Second, rejection can happen actively or passively. In an active rejection, an individual has considered adopting the innovation and has possibly tried it out, yet decided to not adopt it. For example, a software developer considers switching to a new development kit to build his tools. However, after some testing, he finds the kit to be unsuitable for his needs and far too complex to use, so he actively decides to reject it. A passive rejection, on the other hand, occurs when an individual hasn’t actually considered adopting the innovation or has simply forgotten about its existence. Third, the decision to adopt a product is influenced mainly by cultural norms. People living in collectivist cultures – societies that value community and collective action over individual needs, such as China, Korea and Japan – are more likely to adopt an innovation if some members of their group have already adopted it. For example, if a critical mass of Korean women decide to get an intrauterine device (IUD) fitted, it’s likely that all women in their social group will follow suit. So far, the decision process has mostly involved thinking about the innovation and deciding whether to adopt it. But once the decision has been made to adopt, things change. Now, in the Implementation stage, an individual has to physically put an innovation to use. But what does implementation actually involve? Fundamentally, it involves a change in the user’s behavior. Because the new product has to be put to use physically, the individual must actively change their behavior, in that they must learn and apply the methods that correctly using the product necessitates. To implement an innovation, you have to obtain it, learn how to use it and find information about any potential difficulties or side effects. For example, a patient who begins taking a new drug to regulate high blood sugar must change her behavior – she cannot drink alcohol while taking the new drug, she must take it for several weeks before the drug will have any effect, and so on. Interestingly enough, during the Implementation stage, many adopters “reinvent” the product or service by using it in ways not intended by its creators. For example, in the former GDR – the German Democratic Republic – some people used the WM66 washing machine to preserve fruit, because the machine could be heated without having to start a wash cycle. Moreover, a higher degree of reinvention can extend the lifespan of a product and lead to it being used more actively than expected. For example, take Lego Mindstorms. In its original incarnation, its software wasn’t open source, but after it was hacked by a few programmers, Mindstorms’ active and dedicated fanbase were able to change it constantly, thereby extending its life significantly. Ultimately, Lego would embrace the opportunity by providing software development kits to Mindstorms fans. Say you’ve started putting an innovation to use. Does this mean you’re going to use it forever? Perhaps some innovations are so great that they will last forever, but others you will stop using at some point. Why is that? After an individual has made a decision to adopt a certain innovation, he begins to seek assurance that he’s made the right decision. In other words, he’s entered the Confirmation stage. This stage is marked by internal dissonance in the individual – an uncomfortable state of mind that he wishes to diminish, and one which arises both before and after adopting a product. Consider, for example, the early incarnations of Microsoft’s operating system, Windows. When Apple built its own operating system, which was easier to use, those people who switched from Windows to Mac probably experienced internal dissonance prior to switching, as they were dissatisfied with Windows. To sustain positive feelings about their decision, adopters of a new product often will try to avoid experiencing this dissonance by filtering out any information which disconfirms their decision. (This is called selective exposure.) Instead, adopters seek positive affirmation of their decision: for example, sales data that suggests the increased popularity of Macs, positive product reviews and so on. Sometimes, in the Confirmation stage, adopters reverse their decision and stop using the innovation. Because there are always drawbacks to adoption – such as the possibility of disconfirming information reaching the adopter, or difficulties in using the innovation outweighing its anticipated benefits – an adopter might discontinue using a new product or service even after having implemented it. Another reason might be that the innovation is replaced by another idea that is perceived as better. Yet another reason is that the innovation loses its luster because adopters are dissatisfied with its performance. Take, for example, smoking, which was once a popular lifestyle choice. As more and more studies began to confirm the serious risks of smoking, the number of smokers decreased. This was mainly because governments and non-profit organizations began to inform the population about these risks and proceeded to establish barriers to smoking – such as smoking restrictions on airplanes, no-smoking areas in bars and special taxes on cigarettes. As a result, the number of smokers has fallen drastically. When it comes to people adopting and making use of an innovation, there are always some individuals ahead of everyone else. Why is that? One reason is that certain individuals are simply more innovative than others. For instance, innovators – the first to adopt a new product, idea or practice – make up just 2.5 percent of all adopters. They are people always on the lookout for new ideas, and part of a network of likeminded individuals from whom they receive news. Take, for example, a person who loves watches – let’s call him John. John and his friends are so interested in watches that they participate in online forums and devour magazines dedicated to their obsession. John’s an innovator: he’s aware of the latest trends in watchmaking and knows which are the best new watches on the market. But, like all innovators, John is in the minority. The remainder of adopters comprise Early Adopters (13.5 percent), the Early Majority (34 percent) and the Late Majority (34 percent). Those that adopt an innovation much later than the majority are called Laggards (16 percent). For example, when it comes to smartphones, elderly people are usually Laggards: those last to purchase and use such a device. Another reason that innovators are ahead of the pack is that they have a wealth of resources and knowledge about a given idea. To be an innovator, an individual must have the financial resources to compensate for any losses incurred from purchasing previous innovations. Equally, they need the ability to understand and apply complex technical knowledge. Also, this individual has to cope with a high degree of uncertainty about the future of the innovation. For example, people who purchased the very first mobile phones in the early 1980s had to spend a lot of money, understand when and how to use the phones and deal with the uncertainty of not knowing whether everyone else was going to be using the phones too. We have seen how our own attitudes and behavior influence whether we adopt or reject innovations. But the innovation itself plays a role, too: its attributes clearly impact whether people will adopt it. First, innovations must have a relative advantage over other, competing innovations. In other words, relative advantage represents the perceived superiority of an innovation over the original idea that it supersedes. It doesn’t matter whether the field of the relative advantage is economic, social or otherwise. What does matter is that a sizeable gap exists between the original product’s attributes and those of the superseding innovation. For example, the Iowa corn farmers mentioned in an earlier blink saw a clear economic advantage to using the new seeds they were given: their yields grew, as did their profits. In contrast, for people interested in buying fashionable clothes, it’s not economic factors that matter but rather the social prestige they acquire by wearing those clothes. Second, to improve the odds of it being adopted, an innovation should be compatible with the existing values and needs of users. This is because innovations that are compatible with users’ values, and effectively fulfill their specific needs, are more likely to be adopted. Take, for example, a new technology – like the wildly successful social networking site, Facebook. This innovation has a high compatibility with users’ values, beliefs, ideas or needs: it meets the needs of people wanting to stay in touch with old pals and friends abroad. Incompatible innovations, on the other hand, will probably fail to be adopted. For example, for two years a public health worker in a Peruvian village tried to convince inhabitants there to boil their drinking water. However, the campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. Why? The local tradition of the area connected the consumption of hot foods with being ill. The hotter the food or water, the more suitable it was for the sick to consume. The very idea that hot water could be associated with good health was incompatible with the beliefs and values of this village’s people. Why were MacBooks, iPods and other Apple products so readily adopted by consumers? Certainly Apple’s marketing efforts, and the brand name itself, played an important role. But the primary cause of Apple’s rapid success was the simplicity of its products. Indeed, the more complex an innovation is – the more difficult to understand and use – the slower people will be to adopt it. Therefore, products that are easy to grasp and use will be adopted more quickly than those that are complex. Of course, this depends on the kind of adopters we’re talking about. For example, the very first people to adopt home computers were hobbyists who were competent in their use of technology, such as engineers or scientists. The adopters who followed them, however, found computers difficult to understand and use as they lacked the required knowledge. These people had to ask friends, experiment themselves or join a computer club. Ultimately, in time, computers became more user-friendly and thus far more popular. Moreover, easy-to-use innovations often have an edge when they also have a relative advantage – for example, if they are cheaper than existing products, or they confer social prestige. When, for instance, the first cellular phones were introduced, they operated in the same way as regular phones. Eventually, however, SMS (short messaging service) became a standard feature, one that was simple to understand and use. Thus it was no surprise that SMS was so quickly adopted by young people. Texting was a cheap, quick and easy way of interacting with friends. What was the last product you bought? Did you test it before you decided on the purchase? It’s a fact that innovations that can be tried before purchase spread much faster. This is called trialability – the degree to which an innovation can be tested prior to adopting it. By trying and testing a new product, potential adopters can dispel uncertainty about an innovation. However, not all innovations can be devised for trial. For example, when buying a car, you can go to your car dealer and test-drive different brands and models. But when you’re deciding which airline to use, you can’t “test-fly”! In addition, trialability is more important to earlier adopters – those that purchase and use an innovation before the masses adopt it – than later adopters. This is because earlier adopters have no precedent to follow, whereas later adopters can always refer to the trials of earlier adopters; they don’t always need to try it out for themselves. Furthermore, later adopters – such as the Laggards – are quicker to commit to adopting an innovation. Take, for example, those who bought a smartphone when nobody else had one. These adopters probably visited trade fairs or shops to see for themselves how the technology works. But, now that almost everyone has a smartphone, new adopters don’t need to test the technology (at least as intensively). Instead, they can simply trust product reviews or recommendations from friends. As this shows, for innovators who begin to use an innovation when it initially comes out, trying it out first is very important. If, in contrast, you’ve purchased the product once everybody else has already used it, a trial session is less important. Why is that? Partially it’s because you have observed its functions through others – and you’ll find out how much this matters in the next blink. While trialability allows you to test a product, thereby increasing the likelihood of its adoption, what also helps is allowing people to observe the product in action and communicating to them how a product works. This is because explaining and showing a new product to others enables them to better understand its functions. Some ideas are easy to observe and communicate to peers, which can help to dissipate any doubts they might have and enables them to assess the idea’s complexity or its relative advantage. For example, the way in which people use Facebook is easy to observe and communicate, because one can see the activity on a user’s profile. However, there are innovations that are unobservable or difficult to communicate, such as the notion of religious salvation. Moreover, certain technologies have both observable and unobservable aspects; for example, the hardware and software of computers. The hardware aspect is the material or physical form of the tool; the object itself. The software aspect is the information base for this tool. A computer’s hardware, for example, is the electronic equipment, whereas its software is the operating system. Because the software aspect tends to be less observable than the hardware, those innovations that have a dominant software aspect usually have a slower rate of adoption. Take the idea of safe sex, for example. This is a rather vague idea because the focus is on software elements: abstinence, sexual monogamy and other safe sex recommendations are hard to observe, and are not hardware-dominant. This is why safe sex campaigns have had only middling success. As we can see, it is sometimes difficult to explain and communicate an idea. When you do, try to make the idea tangible by highlighting its hardware aspect. As we’ve seen, people adopt innovations in their own way and at their own speed. But one other factor makes a big difference to whether an innovation is adopted: the change agent. What is a change agent, and how does this individual influence the adoption process? Change agents – such as teachers, consultants, public health workers and so on – make potential adopters aware of a particular need for change, and they build rapport. These agents have strong ties to, and communication channels within, the social system that will adopt an innovation. Also, they can identify new solutions to existing problems and, in doing so, change behaviors. They can communicate the importance of a problem and can convince individuals or whole groups that they are capable of tackling their challenges. For example, Jen – who has lived in Kenya for five years – is a public health worker with close ties to schools and government officials. She has made a great effort to present the impact of cervical cancer to teachers and officials, and to discuss with parents the need to get girls vaccinated. Due to this effort, and her status within the community, an increasing number of girls are vaccinated. A change agent should be an empathetic person and act always in the interests of the client. To be effective, she should focus on her clients’ needs instead of the change agency’s demands. (A change agency is the agent’s employer, which can be a non-profit organization, government or consultancy.) Such empathetic change agents are more feedback-minded, build closer rapport with individuals and enjoy higher credibility. For example, a salesman who tries to convince a potential client to purchase his company’s new fertilizer has a greater chance of selling if he points out how the product can solve an existing problem that the client has. If, on the other hand, the salesman is not focused on the individual’s needs and thus cannot provide a solution to his problems, his efforts will fail. Imagine you’ve created a new, innovative website. Once the site is up and running, you want your target audience to find it and start using it. But how do you do that? One way is to seek out an opinion leader – a person who has a great influence over other individuals’ attitudes and behaviors. Opinion leaders have an extensive interpersonal network of followers, and are more active in participating within their social groups. They also have more extensive access to mass media than their followers. Opinion leaders also often have a higher socioeconomic status and are recognized as competent and trustworthy experts when it comes to innovations. For example, an opinion leader in the field of internet media could be a prominent blogger and expert who covers new websites and evaluates their functionality. Because of his position, this opinion leader can reach out to his followers and encourage them to visit the site. Another reason why it’s worth seeking out an opinion leader is that the success rate of change agents (discussed in the previous blink) is even higher when an agent works in collaboration with opinion leaders. This is because a change agent working alone usually can’t address all potential adopters individually. Yet, by working with an opinion leader, the agent can reach many more individuals. For example, in certain parts of Latin America, there are agricultural extension workers responsible for introducing ideas and products to 10,000 farmers. Reaching this many farmers was effectively impossible for a single extension worker, but by getting support from a few opinion leaders, the extension workers were able to achieve their goals and to get farmers to implement the ideas they proposed. So, when it comes to your website, you should try to convince opinion leaders of its value – in this case, the leaders are high-status bloggers who have a strong relationship with your target audience. If you are able to convince them, others will follow! The key message in this book: There are five stages of the innovation-decision process that every potential adopter of a new idea goes through: Knowledge, Persuasion, Decision, Implementation and Confirmation. Every innovation has certain attributes that influence its rate of adoption, such as relative advantage, complexity and trialability. Change agents should be client-focused and make use of opinion leaders to increase the rate of adoption of an innovation. Actionable advice: To get more people to adopt your product, make sure they can observe it in action. If nobody recognizes your brand or your product, how will they know to buy it? Making your product observable can mean something as simple as allowing others to see it in use – for example by giving product demonstrations, or allowing potential customers to have a trial period with the product. And if you use social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, you’ll be able to show the product in use to a much larger audience.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Once a popular and profitable retailer, Blockbuster ended up at rock bottom when the traditional DVD rental model collapsed. It’s a sad tale and a warning to others. No business owner wants to be the next Blockbuster.  Blockbuster is just one example of a business that failed to stay ahead of the curve. These blinks offer a lot of advice to help today’s businesses avoid a similar fate. As they point out, we’re currently in the middle of the digital era. Businesses which fail to adapt to this digital age will be left behind. This includes all those businesses which merely pay lip service to the digital world, without fully embracing it. Digital Darwinism requires you to integrate the digital era into the DNA of your business, not just to add a website with a virtual tour of your business. It’s only a matter of time before digital technology becomes like electricity and is a seamless part of our daily lives. So this is what tomorrow’s leading businesses will need to embrace. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you don’t want to be like Heathrow Airport; why the traditional understanding of disruption is all wrong; and why adding a chat bot to your business won’t get you very far. We often think in terms of “survival of the fittest.” But what does that mean for businesses today, when rapid global change is an ongoing concern? You may think that the most successful companies will always be the massive ones with teams of experts and billions to spend. But, as the author sees it, darwinism in the digital age is about being able to flourish by taking advantage of that rapid global change – it’s about being able to adapt quickly to whatever the uncertain future may bring. Big businesses with a global reach that have been around for 30 to 50 years are no longer the most successful companies out there. In fact, these businesses may be at a disadvantage. After all, they can easily end up so stuck in their ways that they find it difficult to make any changes at all.  For example, Sony invested greatly in making devices such as the Walkman and Discman to play music on cassettes or CDs. This helped them become the market leaders. And then MP3 and digital music happened. Sony could have moved into this new, and potentially very lucrative market. But if this digital music really took off, what would happen to all the Walkmans and Discmans? They’d be outdated. They wouldn’t sell. So, Sony saw the move to digital as a very risky act of self-disruption. As a result, the company was hesitant to move in the new market and it lost its leading position to more disruptive rivals. Instead, too many businesses are only willing to make small gestures toward embracing new technologies. The author refers to this as a “bolted-on” approach. An example of this is when a bank creates an app that allows a check to be deposited by snapping a photo of it, rather than rethinking the need for using paper checks in this day and age. They’re simply wedging technology into a dying system. A good analogy is Heathrow Airport, London. Bucket-loads of money have been spent trying to update Heathrow, despite the fact that it’s located in an area that makes it difficult for planes to maneuver and will be an unwieldy mess no matter how many alterations are made. At some point, a new airport will be built with room to grow in a practical location using modern technology at its very core. In other words, simply trying to update a burdensome, outdated system is unsustainable.  For legacy businesses, it’s essentially the same situation. Instead of tweaking an ailing system, you must be willing to make fundamental changes in order to truly adapt. If there’s one thing for certain, it’s that the future is uncertain. Sure, there are a lot of people willing to sound foolish by trying to predict the future, but no one can be truly certain of what lies ahead. That said, we can look to the past and learn a lot about what to expect in the years ahead. If we look back over our recent history, we can recognize three important eras that demonstrate a pattern in how businesses respond to new technology. By looking at the advent of electricity and computers, we can see that we’re in the middle of a very similar era regarding the internet. In each of these eras, people were, on the whole, reluctant to embrace a new technology and fully incorporate it into society. Time and time again, people applied the technology to their traditional ways of doing things. Old and new would bump up against each other in chaotic ways until, inevitably, the new technology became accepted, fully integrated and so commonplace in everyday life that it was practically seamless. This happened with electricity, but it took a long time. Starting in the 1830s, when its potential for businesses and homes was first presented, it took around 100 years for electricity to become commonplace. For a long time, there was no standardization and factories that had relied on steam power were hesitant to change their ways.  It also took a long time for electricity to be used for truly innovative purposes. For the most part, companies spent decades simply making electrified versions of machines and appliances that already existed. It took an age for companies to learn that they didn’t need updated factories; they needed new, electricity-focused factories. A similar process happened with computers and digital technology, though in both cases the time it took from introduction to mass acceptance took half as long as before. For computers, there was a 50-year mid-period between arrival and full acceptance. In this period, cautious businesses tried to computerize just a few processes while holding on to as many of their traditional processes as possible. Some of the conflict of the computer era was resolved with the introduction of the digital era, which included the internet. PCs and Macs, which had been incompatible, were now able to connect with one another over the internet. But once again, we find ourselves with many businesses just applying modern technology on the fringes of their business.  Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School academic, described disruption in the business world as a new company that comes along with a new technology and a lower price to undermine the legacy companies. But this description doesn’t quite fit.    When you think of some of the biggest disruptors in recent years, like Uber or Airbnb, you can see that these businesses didn’t have a lower price and nor did they just bring along some new technology. After all, Airbnb customers might spend more than they would for a traditional hotel. What disruptors really do is completely rethink the way of doing things, be it running a car service or operating in the hospitality industry. In other words, they shift the paradigm and fundamentally change how people do things. In order to truly disrupt an industry you have to do more than bolt-on some new technology and offer a cheaper price – you have to go beyond the outer layers of your business and have bold innovation at the core of your being. The outer layers of a business include how you communicate with your customers, your marketing efforts, what your product or service is and how your business functions. Most businesses have added technology to these layers, such as using emailed newsletters and Instagram accounts as marketing tools. Few have put technology and truly innovative ways of doing business at their core. Take the car rental company Hertz, for example. It’s made it possible for you to send a recorded video of your customer complaint, rather than having to fill out an online form. It’s using technology as a tool while remaining committed to its traditional car rental business plan. If Hertz were to really embrace the digital age, it would change that core business plan to resemble something similar to how Zipcar, the rental service, operates, and make the entire process app-based. One of the keys to coming up with an innovative plan is to think of ideas that aren’t boxed in by the assumed parameters of your industry. Companies like Uber and Airbnb removed the assumed parameter that a company had to own physical assets, like cars and rooms, in order to connect customers with a ride from point A to point B or a room to stay in during their vacation.  When your idea finds a solution that changes those parameters, you may be on your way to shifting the paradigm and causing real disruption. You don’t necessarily have to be a new business in order to disrupt your industry. In fact, there are essentially four ways for any established business to change and be innovative. The first is self-disruption, which means investing in a technology or way of doing things that would, if successful, make your current process obsolete. This is also referred to as “cannibalism” in the business world and, while it can be risky and difficult, it can also pay off big time. Just think of how Netflix pulled off a remarkable act of self-disruption when it shifted its focus from DVD rentals to streaming. In 2007, after investing $40 million dollars in new data storage, Netflix allowed existing members to stream a limited number of hours of content at no extra cost, while their library of streamable content steadily grew. Then, in 2011, Netflix made the subscription plans for renting DVDs and streaming content separate. Not only that, they made the streaming plan cheaper and moved the DVD plan to a service called Qwikster. Within months, stock prices plummeted from $42 a share to below $10, and Wall Street was calling for CEO Reed Hastings to step down. But Netflix knew streaming was the way of the future. After weathering the initial storm, it became apparent that a lot of new subscribers were attracted to the lower subscription fee, and the library of content continued to expand. Now those shares are selling at over $100. This leads us to the second way of changing: continual reinvention. Instead of making a rigid and inflexible operation plan, make having room to adapt an essential and fundamental part of your business. Think of how Facebook naturally evolved from a place to reconnect with an old friend to being the most powerful media company in the world. It’s no coincidence that Facebook spends millions every year on research and development. The last two ways to cultivate change are making measured and hedged bets. A measured bet is like BMW making a relatively small number of electric vehicles in their BMWi series. BMW don’t count on these cars to be its main source of profit, but the venture allows it to develop new technology. Maybe one day BMWi technology will be used to improve the company’s other car models. Hedging is what companies like Google, Dell, Cisco and Intel do when they invest in other businesses that may develop cutting edge ideas that could be beneficial for them. This is the whole idea behind Google Ventures, or why a plastics and chemical manufacturer like DuPont invested in General Motors when the car manufacturer was just getting off the ground in 1914. Just as it was clear that streaming video was the way of the future over a decade ago, we can also make some safe assumptions about the future growth of other emerging digital technologies. When exploring what the next big thing will be, it helps to try and see one or two steps down the road. For instance, when smartphones emerged, the real innovative minds looked to the further implications of this technology, like the apps and emojis and all the different secondary business opportunities that the smartphone would unleash. One area that is being explored today is known as the Internet of Things. This is what people are calling the advent of the 5G internet service. 5G will make it possible for more and more devices to be connected to each other in real time. This is not only about being able to process more data than ever before, it’s also about allowing seamless transactions to take place. An early example of what the Internet of Things will look like is the digital thermostats being made by Nest. The Nest thermostat makes it easy to program the heating and air-conditioning in your home. It shows us that it’s just a matter of time before you can have your home’s temperature, lighting and background music ready for you when you walk in the door. The Nest thermometer is the kind of forward thinking that more businesses should be moving toward, as it’s making digital technology a seamless part of modern living. This is exactly what happened with electricity and computers. Tomorrow’s leading businesses will be the ones making this seamless interaction happen in digitally connected homes. You could also look at facial recognition technology as an example. Soon, your face could be just as valid a form of ID as your passport. So the idea of being able to travel without a paper passport, or being able to pay by doing nothing more than showing your face, is very much a possibility. Is it that hard to imagine your bank account and travel permissions being linked to one paperless source of ID? Of course, facial recognition technology and other possible aspects of the Internet of Things lead to questions about privacy and data security, which is why businesses need to focus on being secure and transparent about how they treat people’s data. From what we can already see, it’s very likely that the benefits of a seamless digitally assisted life will, for most people, outweigh these concerns. Therefore, it’s up to future companies to give people security as well as great value in return for their data. One of the reasons Amazon’s one-button-purchase option is so impressive is that it understands the difference between shopping and buying. While businesses can try to make shopping a memorable experience, more forward-thinking businesses should consider what Amazon has done and make the buying experience as quick, painless and unmemorable as possible.  If a buying experience is memorable, it’s usually because it was a bad experience. A good buying experience is effortless and easy, like taking care of the entire process with one push of a button. The world is still filled with digital disappointments, like businesses not accepting your preferred online payment method or not being able to stream your favorite BBC show outside the United Kingdom. Basically, the only time we really pay attention to technology these days is when it isn’t working. The leaders of tomorrow will be the businesses that make things like buying products and streaming content easy, no matter where you are. Ultimately, making things seamless and easy isn’t about knowing which technology is the most cutting edge. It’s about empathy and knowing what people want and how to make it simpler for them to achieve that goal. So forget about buzzwords like “interactive” and “digital” and think about the tools that people are already using and how to make those tools more connected. We can see that the digital era is moving us toward a hybrid world, where bluetooth speakers are also portals that can help us buy things or access information. Soon enough, there will be no regional restrictions to content and things like national currency will be less of a concern. It’s time to think across all boundaries and how we can help people everywhere have better, more frictionless experiences with the technology that is already making its way into every part of our lives. For one last example: a lot of people are pointing at AI, or artificial intelligence, as one of the big technologies of the future, and that will likely be the case. But how many businesses are just bolting a chat bot onto their website as a way of saying, hey, we use AI?  The real innovative and disruptive companies will be the ones that use this kind of technology to do new transformative things. They’ll always have the latest tech at the core of their business plan as a tool for helping people in innovative ways. The key message in these blinks: Digital darwinism isn’t about being the strongest or wealthiest business. It’s about being agile and capable of quickly adapting to the changing global marketplace. Companies can stay ahead of the pack by putting innovation and a willingness to change at the core of their business plan. They can also concentrate on looking beyond accepted parameters toward new ways of doing things and helping people to live in the digital era in a more seamless way.  Actionable advice: Create new forms of value. Often, when visiting his parents, the author is willing to take a slower train ride because it offers reliable wi-fi and plenty of places to plug in his devices. By providing these services, the train line created a new form of value by embracing the digital age. In other ways, businesses can create value by saving the customer time and effort, whether it’s a bank that stores all of a customer’s receipts digitally or an app that lets you skip the long checkout line at a store. So start thinking about how your business can create new forms of value for customers by being more integrated with the digital era and your customers’ needs.    Got feedback?

But how familiar are you with the text that first brought the idea of Darwinism to the world? On the Origin of Species is a classic that forever changed the way people look at the natural world. Darwinism is about more than just “survival of the fittest,” and there’s no better way to understand the principles of adaptation and evolution than to go to the source and discover the ideas of Charles Darwin himself.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

But this fantastic public facade masks some sobering private practices. In these blinks, you’ll follow the story of author Dan Lyons who, jobless and in his fifties, entered the start-up world at HubSpot, a company specializing in inbound marketing and sales. While working there, the author witnessed weird business practices and poor working conditions – and discovered the truth behind the hype. You’ll also learn what it takes to be truly “HubSpotty”; that some people think talking to a stuffed animal is innovative; and what a “bozo explosion” is. In 2012, journalist Dan Lyons, who’d previously been employed as the technology editor at Newsweek magazine, was in his 50s and desperately looking for work. He’d just been fired and was now facing a radically different job market. He wasn’t alone. The internet-technology boom of the 2000s was causing many older professionals to reevaluate their positions in the media industry. During the early 2000s, new internet-based tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Zynga and Groupon, were on the rise. Meanwhile, traditional media industries, such as newspapers and magazines, were struggling to survive and adapt. These newly ascendant companies were offering products and services that were changing central human activities – how we shop and socialize, how we get our news and information. Instead of relying on newspapers and magazines, readers could now get all the information they needed with a simple click. Print magazines like Newsweek were in free-fall as advertisers began moving to online platforms and people began canceling their subscriptions. All of this led to Lyons being let go, just after Newsweek – the very company he was working for – published an article entitled “The Beached White Male.” Ironically, it was about a generation of experienced, older professionals who were suddenly finding themselves bereft of work due to company cutbacks. To find a new job, Lyons needed to reinvent himself – and his attempt at transformation led him to the new world of start-ups. Lyons was married, had two young kids and was the sole breadwinner, all of which made a steady job and good health insurance imperative. His first new job took him to San Francisco, where he worked for a tech-news website called ReadWrite. It was okay, but not ideal, since his family was rooted on the other side of the country, in Boston. However, while in San Francisco, he also got a first-hand look at the booming start-up businesses of Silicon Valley. This got him thinking: Maybe he could reinvent himself as a writer in the marketing department of a start-up? As a tech writer for Newsweek, Lyons was familiar with companies like Twitter and Facebook. He had interviewed many of these businesses’ CEOs and knew that the people who were on the ground floor when these companies took off reaped huge financial rewards. But, despite his familiarity with their products, Lyons was surprised by the strange business practices of start-ups. Lyons landed an interview for a position at HubSpot, a software start-up based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after he responded to a post on LinkedIn. The interview went well enough, but Lyons was puzzled when he was offered the vague position of “marketing fellow,” which hardly seemed like a job title at all. This hazy way of doing things continued when he spoke to Shah and Halligan, the two founders of HubSpot, about what they’d like him to do. Even though they had a lengthy conversation, it was never made clear what exactly Lyons’s role at HubSpot would be. Lyons understood that they liked the idea of hiring a journalist who could assist in making HubSpot a “thought leader” in the world of marketing. But Lyons was never given any clear indication of how they imagined him accomplishing such a task. They came closest to outlining a specific task when Halligan talked about providing “missions” for Lyons to go on – but this just sounded like they wanted him to improve their blog to raise brand awareness. While his initial meetings at HubSpot were confusing, Lyons was willing to adapt and tried to remain open to new ways of doing things. He was actually quite excited about the possibilities of this new start-up and felt ready to learn about marketing, a department he’d never worked in. And although the job came with a rather small salary, he was given stock options for HubSpot and he knew that these would pay well if the company became a success. Lyons became an official HubSpot employee in April, 2013, and it was then that he was introduced to the company’s odd, cult-like practices, and a new world of missions, culture codes and spiritual leaders. He quickly learned that HubSpot wasn’t just out to make money; it was on a “mission” to change the world through unique marketing software. He also learned that HubSpot’s co-founder, Dharmesh Shah, was being referred to as a “spiritual leader” by some employees and clients. During his first days, Lyons was emailed a manifesto that contained 128 PowerPoint slides and was called The Hubspot Culture Code: Creating a Company We Love. The presentation pitched HubSpot as a utopian society where the team is more important than the individual and people don’t care about a work-life balance, since work is life. While much of this seemed strange, it wasn’t utterly alien. Many Silicon Valley employees at companies like Google and Apple are famous for “drinking the Kool-Aid” and transitioning from a regular employee into a devoted believer of shared values and “world-changing” missions. At HubSpot, employees were encouraged to adopt a strange lingo and dress code as a way to inspire uniform happiness. This meant that if an employee was truly “HubSpotty” they would apply the principles of HEART to “make magic.” At HubSpot, HEART stands for humble, effective, adaptable, remarkable and transparent. The most HubSpotty people also regularly wear orange and religiously obey fearless Fridays, a monthly ritual where employees do something they’re afraid of, unrelated to work. The language at HubSpot is so confusing that the company created a Wiki page to help newcomers decipher the jargon. People in meetings might talk about SFTC, getting an SLA or ask about the KPI, rather than talk about solving for the customer, service-level agreements or key performance indicator. And employees who are in GSD mode “get shit done.” Employees not in GSD mode might be heading for \"graduation,” which happens when employees leave HubSpot, regardless of whether they’re fired or they quit. While they might be odd, the practices at HubSpot were meant to inspire teamwork and unity. It wasn’t long, however, before Lyons began feeling like a misfit. As an older man, Lyons wasn’t used to open-plan offices that afforded employees zero privacy. The long tables packed with employees reminded Lyons of the working conditions in Bangladeshi sweatshops – only, instead of hunching over sewing machines, the people at HubSpot were hunched over laptops. But more than that, Lyons had never worked at a company where so much emphasis was placed on forcing “fun” upon employees. This was definitely the case at HubSpot, which featured multiple areas of the workplace that resembled playgrounds. They had a “nap room” that contained a hammock; an area with musical instruments intended for spontaneous jam sessions, though the instruments were never used; and the conference room doubled as a game room, with ping-pong, foosball, pool tables, as well as video games. Lyons was particularly taken aback by how proud HubSpot was of its so-called “candy wall” – an entire wall in the cafeteria composed of glass cases containing a variety of candy bars and junk food. But this perhaps wasn’t as odd as the time when HubSpot asked its employees to talk to a teddy bear. Lyons was especially bewildered when his boss claimed to have come up with an innovative management breakthrough. Alas, the idea was nothing more than bringing a teddy bear named Molly into meetings to represent the customer they were always trying their best to serve. This was a bit disheartening for Lyons, whose previous boss was the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham. Now he was working for a man who thought that talking to a stuffed animal was an innovation. Three months into his new job, Lyons was still trying to figure out what he was supposed to do in his role as marketing fellow. And when he tried to bring some new ideas to the table, he was disappointed to find that the company wasn’t really interested. Lyons was under the impression that he’d been hired to improve HubSpot’s company blog. So, with this in mind, he wrote blog posts that would appeal to venture capitalists, CEOs and people that might be interested in investing in HubSpot. Unfortunately, Lyons soon learned that the people his blog posts were supposed to appeal to were fictional characters called “Mary the Marketer,” “Enterprise Erin” and “Ollie the Owner.” These were small business owners who were looking for blog posts with helpful marketing tips like “15 Free Stock Photos You Can Use” and “How to Create a Facebook Brand Page.” HubSpot wanted these people to click on links at the end of the posts that would take them to an online form that would give HubSpot their personal information. Lyons was especially disappointed when they asked him to actually dumb-down the blog. Frustrated at the idea of having to write a purposefully dumb blog, Lyons pitched the idea of starting a separate blog with high-end content called Inbound. Conflict began when Lyons took the idea to the company founders after it was initially rejected by middle management. The founders loved the idea – but, at HubSpot, a CEO’s approval doesn’t mean it will really happen. Middle management ensured his idea remained squashed. But Lyons put up a fight and it was eventually decided that he could run a small “sub-blog” that would allow him to write articles that were a bit more sophisticated. However, he would have to work in the noisiest room in the company; the dreaded telemarketing room, which employees referred to as “the spider-monkey room.” It eventually became clear to Lyons that good management was nowhere to be found at HubSpot. After being kicked down to the telemarketing room, he saw how bad the working conditions could really get. Lyons realized that management issues at start-ups are often the result of a phenomenon called “the bozo explosion.” Steve Jobs coined this phrase to explain how the initial employees at a start-up might not be the sharpest tools in the toolbox, but they’ll still end up rising through the ranks due to their seniority. These bozos are then in a position to hire other people and they’ll tend to hire even more mediocre bozos, people whom they can feel superior to. This is how a start-up like HubSpot can end up with such exceedingly poor management. Further, when mediocrity is rewarded, you can end up in some bleak situations. For instance, Lyons was once asked to do an all-night “hackathon” in order to create a surplus of purposely mediocre blog posts. Mediocre management is one thing, but when Lyons moved into his new working environment in the telemarketing room, his eyes were opened to a whole new situation. Here, Lyons discovered many recent college graduates, nicknamed “spider monkeys,” tightly crammed into a large room, making old-fashioned cold calls to potential customers. They were hard at work because they would be fired if they didn’t meet the required number of successful sales. To make these stressful conditions more tolerable, the spider monkeys were given an unlimited supply of free beer. These telemarketers were actually very important to HubSpot at the time since the company was about to launch its initial public offering (IPO), at which point it would issue its first shares of stock. So, HubSpot was desperate to grow as much as it could, as quickly as possible, because initial buyers don’t care about how much profit a company has made; they only care about how quickly it’s growing. The people toiling away in the spider-monkey room, desperately trying to meet a monthly quota or else lose their jobs, weren’t the only people that Lyons felt the company was mistreating. And Lyons was surprised by how many people put up with these conditions. But ever since Google rewrote the book on how tech companies treat their employees, places like HubSpot have followed their lead by removing any sense of job security and treating employees as temporary workers. This means many start-ups offer no long-term contracts, pension plans or employee union, not to mention showing little loyalty to employees.   This attitude also applied to the employee benefits HubSpot offered and the low wages it paid. While HubSpot offered employees the perk of “unlimited vacation” time, this was just a way for them to spin the fact that they didn’t have any vacation plan at all. Then, if an employee was fired, HubSpot didn’t need to justify the firing and didn’t owe the employee any money for accrued time off. Lyons understood that these policies were made in an effort to cut costs ahead of the IPO. Since growth, rather than turning a profit, is the most important thing leading up to an IPO, it was more important to raise sales numbers by using a poorly paid telemarketing team than to worry about pensions. Lyons also understood that employees put up with it because HubSpot created an atmosphere that made them feel special. He was surprised that employees didn’t seem to be concerned about the lack of job security or the low wages and stressful quotas, and that they were quick to tell him they were on a mission for HubSpot. Further, the company kept them distracted with free beer, candy and games, and made them feel like part of a team, even though a member could get fired at any moment without explanation. You might be wondering how a company like HubSpot can become successful. It’s all about the buzz, which can be so powerful that both employees and investors may fall under its spell. Even companies that make a poor product and fail to turn a profit can succeed; if they have positive buzz on their side, they can have a successful IPO. And HubSpot did indeed have a poor product. There’s a definite irony in the fact that HubSpot was trying to sell marketing software that could help a small business. HubSpot certainly didn’t use it; they relied on old fashioned telemarketing and cold-calling techniques. But none of this mattered – as long as they created enough buzz to attract investors at the public offering. In the business, creating buzz is compared to “making a movie.” This means they create a mythological narrative for their business. In HubSpot’s case, it was the revolutionary story of changing people’s lives through its software. They cast one of their young co-founders in the role of attractive leading man and made his story into a hero’s journey, giving the impression that he was overcoming impressive obstacles. When the IPO rolled around, investors were lined up like it was opening night for a blockbuster. Even a weak prospectus won’t get in the way of good buzz. It was clear in HubSpot’s IPO prospectus that they had a history of losses and there was a good chance that the company wouldn’t become profitable anytime soon. But HubSpot had built such a strong buzz, and crafted such a compelling story, that the IPO was a roaring success and led to the co-founders becoming multi-millionaires. Lyons actually played a significant role in helping HubSpot create its buzz leading up to the company’s IPO. As the former tech editor for Newsweek, many tech blogs took note and helped generate buzz by reporting on his move to work for HubSpot. And during his time at HubSpot, Lyons also began working as a writer on HBO’s critically acclaimed television series, Silicon Valley, which only added to the company’s interesting story. This was a good thing for Lyons, since this added buzz helped him keep his job in the face of HubSpot’s prevailing ageist attitude. The fifty-something-year-old Lyons never really fit in with the HubSpot crew, the majority of whom were in their twenties and clinging to a frat-culture frame of mind. But he did need the health insurance. So, they put up with each other despite HubSpot’s ageist attitude, which was well stated when one of HubSpot’s co-founders was interviewed in the New York Times: He mentioned that experience and gray hair was really overrated in the tech world and that the company wanted to build a culture that was specifically designed to attract “Gen Y’ers.” Lyons posted these remarks from the interview on his private Facebook page and in response, received a flood of support from his followers. As it turned out, many people had their own stories to tell. They’d experienced ageism in the tech world, too, and were baffled that such remarks, which would get a CEO into hot water in most other industries, were tolerated. HubSpot and Lyons eventually parted ways when HBO’s Silicon Valley was doing so well that he was offered a job to write for Gawker Media’s Valleywag. Strangely enough, HubSpot worked hard to put a negative spin on Lyons’s exit, wording the memo that was circulated to give the impression that he was fired. Stranger still, when word of Lyons’s book got out, one top manager at HubSpot resigned and another was fired after an attempt at illicitly obtaining the manuscript ended up requiring the involvement of the FBI Cyber Division. The key message in this book: The business practices at a tech start-up are not as transparent as you might think. Companies routinely push their company to reach an IPO without regard for making profit or a good product. On top of this, only a few investors and founders really hit the jackpot when the companies actually make it. Meanwhile, the average employee gets the short end of the stick, with little or no job security and a poor life-work balance. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You’re very passionate about something in your life? Well then you might be the right candidate for growing a business and becoming a successful entrepreneur. Of course, having an idea and being passionate aren’t guarantees of success: you’ll need more than just that. These blinks will tell you about everything else you need to succeed in business, including how to turn your passion into your vocation, refine your product and reach out to investors. You’ll also find out about who to hire and who to fire, how to address the basic legal questions you’ll face and, finally, how to keep your personal life afloat while getting your business off the ground. You’ll also learn   how one man turned his passion for comics into a successful business; why emails should be no more than three sentences long; and why meetings on bicycles can be extremely productive.     Ever felt that all you needed to get your new business off the ground was one great idea? Well, the reality is, a fantastic idea isn’t the main prerequisite for making it in the business world. There are probably other people out there who have the same or similar ideas, and there’s always someone who could pull it together before you. A good idea doesn’t guarantee an investment, either. Investors don’t necessarily look for good ideas. What they look for is people with passion. Ideas are powerful, but remember: they can always be improved. Don’t settle on doing things a certain way. That’s why you should be getting feedback about your project’s strengths and weaknesses from other entrepreneurs, potential customers and investors, and using it to make your idea even better. If you don’t listen to feedback, you might create a product no one really wants or needs. Even the best ideas are still secondary to the most important ingredient in business: passion. The story of Kevin Mann, the founder and CTO of Graphic.ly, is a good example. Graphic.ly is a digital distributor of comic books. Mann had the idea for the company after he once drove 100 miles to a comic book store just to buy a new release, only to find it had already sold out. He realized how passionate he was about comics and decided to help make them more accessible to fellow fans. In other words: aim to create a business around something you truly care about, like Mann did. Passion – not just detailed business plans – is what keeps people going when they’re starting out. Humans are social creatures. Don’t forget that when you build your company! Never try to start a business by yourself. There are a few reasons why it’s not possible, even if you have all the necessary skills. First off, you’ll go through a lot of rough times in the beginning. Important investors could turn you down or the market could undergo unexpected changes. Positive team members help you stay motivated during such struggles. If you’re on your own, you’ll probably be more tempted to give up. There’s a lot of work to be done when you start your business, too. You have to refine your product, attract customers and investors, set up your work space – and that’s just the beginning! You’ll move a lot faster if you have a team to help you with these tasks. When you have a lot of people on board, you also minimize your risk of running out of money before your project is ready to be launched, because you can execute important tasks faster and make your product ready for the market. But you have to hire the right people. There’s a simple rule that can help you here: always hire people who are better than you. Find team members that can challenge you. Business partners should work together like athletes: athletes constantly work to stay in shape because their performance suffers if they don’t. It’s easier for them to finish a race or win a game when they maintain their fitness routine and work together. So take time to look for the right people. Don’t rush your recruiting decisions. You’ll work with your team for long time, so it’s important to get people who are talented and driven. What do you prefer: making decisions in small or large groups? If you’ve experienced both, you probably know it’s usually easier in small groups because they’re more flexible. You might assume that large corporations have an edge on you, but that’s not necessarily true. Large companies have a major drawback in efficiency: bureaucracy. Their bureaucratic procedures make them slower to adapt to any changes in the market. After all, they have multiple departments and management layers, so it harder to keep everyone on the same page. Start-ups are completely different. Smaller start-ups function better for the same reason: a small group of people can make and execute decisions more efficiently. Flexibility isn’t everything, however. You also need a good product. So when it comes to designing your project, put quality over quantity. Keep it simple. You’ll make your product more difficult to use if you overload it with features. A product with just a few, high-quality features is much easier to market than a product with a lot of complicated features. Think of it this way. Which would you prefer: an iron that flattens out wrinkles perfectly or a so-so iron that’s also a kettle and an answering machine? Customers want something that can get the job done, not something with as many uses as possible. Once you have a flexible team and good product, it’s time to look for an investor. A key part of finding the right one is perfecting your emails. So remember the three sentence rule: keep the bodies of your emails down to three sentences or less. Long emails discourage busy people from reading them. If they’re interested, they’ll reply and you can send a more detailed email once you’ve gotten their attention. You have to present yourself the right way if you want to attract investors. So make sure you’re what they’re looking for! Investors invest when they’re convinced a start-up team can successfully execute its idea. There’s no hard-and-fast rule here, but investors usually look for people with passion, intelligence, empathy and natural leadership skills. When you meet with an investor, tell anecdotes that demonstrate these qualities in you and your team. An investor won’t base their decisions on the team alone: they’ll also want to see a compelling product. So figure out the most effective way to present yours. Would a video or a live demonstration suit your product best? Create a presentation that’s engaging and informative. It’s also important that you know a lot about the market you’re aiming for. Are there a lot of potential customers? What are they like? If you don’t have in-depth knowledge of your market, investors will lose interest in you. Investors aren’t the only way to raise funds, either. Let’s look at some of your other options. Angel investors are wealthy people who like your idea but aren’t looking to make a huge profit. They may help your company get off the ground just out of interest or kindness. Your customers might also help. It could be advantageous to sell your product to a small number of customers in the beginning, so you can raise some funds while remaining independent from investors for a while. Bigger companies might also provide you with funding if you’re partnered with them. If you have such a partnership, reach out to them about it directly because they might not come up with the idea themselves. Finally, keep an eye out for R&D grants for technology start-ups. Are you familiar with business law? If not, don’t worry. You only need to know a few things for now. In fact, there are only two really important legal issues you have to address in the beginning. First off, what’s your company’s type? In the United States, there are three general types of corporate forms: S-Corp (small business corporation), C-Corp (regular or “classic” corporations) and LLC (“limited liability corporation”). They’re all taxed differently. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, but for businesses trying to raise money from venture capitalists, it’s best to be a C-Corp. Next, you have to figure out how shares are divided in your company. It’s important to have clear rules in place so your shares are distributed evenly. Vesting is a good strategy. In the practice of vesting, people aren’t fully vested in their shares from the start. Instead, they earn them over time – usually over the course of around four years. Vesting helps you avoid the problems that arise if someone leaves the company early. Imagine a company with three founders who each own a third of the shares. If one of them leaves after the first year, they’ll still retain their shares, which can be disruptive to the company. Vesting incentivizes people to stay committed for longer, and protects the company if they don’t. It’s also important to find the right lawyer, so look for one with expertise in your field. It’s critical to stay on top of legal issues. If you’re a tech company looking to patent something, for instance, you have to make sure your patent is absolutely correct. A competitor might sue you if it’s not, which could cost you a lot of money or even force you to give up. Work can be a lot of fun if it revolves around your passion. But don’t forget that life isn’t just about work! Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is important for two main reasons. The first one is: if you work too much and don’t give yourself time to recharge, you’ll eventually burn out, which might put you back at square one. The second reason is: you run the risk of neglecting people in your personal life if you spend all your time on work. You’ll strain your relationships with friends and family if you don’t spend enough time with them. That just creates more stress for you, and it can follow you back to work. Sometimes you can balance work and life in creative ways, such as by combining work with your favorite leisure activities. Seth Levine, the managing director of Foundry Group, loves cycling, so he decided to try to incorporate it into his work. Foundry Group is a venture-capital firm that invests in start-ups. Levine started inviting start-up members to discuss their ideas on bike rides. He says that holding these cycling meetings helps him come up with more creative ideas and maintain his physical fitness at the same time. You still have to fully disconnect from work sometimes, however. Treat yourself to a week-long vacation once in a while. Vacations don’t just help you decompress; they regenerate your creativity so you’ll be even more productive and motivated when you get back. So even when your business is in its most hectic periods, don’t neglect the importance of your work-life balance. If you do, you could end up suffering both at work and at home. The key message in this book: Starting a business shouldn’t be about filling out forms and doing calculations. It should be about passion. So focus on a field or topic that’s meaningful to you and assemble a passionate team that can challenge you. Present yourself the right way to investors, stay on track legally and don’t neglect your personal life. Long-term success is about hard work, happiness and balancing the two.  Actionable advice: End your relationships with bigger companies if they aren’t productive.  Be careful when you collaborate with bigger organizations because some start-ups lose a lot of time here. Remember: big companies are slower than you, so don’t keep waiting for them if you can move forward more easily without them.

But Daniel Lubetzky, the creator of the popular KIND Healthy Snacks, encourages companies not only to focus on numbers, but also to do the kind thing. These blinks take a closer look at the ten central tenets of doing the kind thing, teaching you how to run a business that is both economically sustainable and socially impactful. Learn how practices such as insisting on the word “and,” being true to your brand and staying grounded in nature will help you sell great products, all while making the world a better place. In these blinks, you’ll discover what sun-dried tomato spread has to do with forging peace; why see-through wrapping can earn people’s trust; and how giving your seat to an elderly subway passenger might earn you some snack bars. Author Daniel Lubetzky built his company, KIND, around the idea of a business that was both economically sustainable and socially impactful. His motto, of course, was “Do the KIND thing.” Let’s take a closer look at what kindness means to the author. On one hand, kindness implies taking care of your own body by, for instance, eating healthy foods or using gentle cosmetics. KIND got started by releasing its line of KIND Healthy Snacks, which, instead of containing synthetic emulsions and pastes, are made from the finest whole nuts and fruits. Doing the KIND thing is also about being kind to the world, a principle that shaped the author’s 1994 cooperative venture that brought Arab and Israeli innovators together to create a line of KIND products. KIND proved that a company can come up with production processes that help forge social change by building bridges between people, even those on opposing sides of a political conflict. The philosophy behind KIND is to think in terms of “AND” instead of “OR,” so that opportunities arise that benefit not only oneself, but also the world. Many people seem to think that a business will be either economically sustainable or socially impactful, as if these two models were mutually exclusive. But this isn’t the case. People should shift their perspective and take the stance that a business must be economically sustainable and socially impactful. The philosophy of KIND can be applied by all sorts of entrepreneurs who want to challenge their assumptions about what is truly attainable, and build businesses that are both kind to themselves and to the world at large. Many entrepreneurs start their businesses with dreams of power and financial gain. But these goals rarely help them when they encounter bumps in the road. Since the journey toward your business goals will always be turbulent, you’ll need a purpose that will fuel you and keep you on track. Consider the author’s story. With a Jewish background and family members who had suffered in concentration camps during the Second World War, he is passionate about creating peace. This is exactly the passion that led him to use one of his early businesses to build a peaceful, cooperative relationship between team members from Palestine, Israel, Egypt and Turkey through the production of a sun-dried tomato spread. The author’s passion was aligned with his business purpose, giving this endeavor the staying power it needed, even when the business had trouble getting off the ground. Indeed, doing the right thing often takes a lot more effort than taking the easy way out, so determination is vital. The author encountered many challenges when starting up his own KIND business, selling healthy snack bars. Because of their high quality, his bars were more expensive to produce than his competitors’ products, which contained cheaper emulsions and pastes. Selling a healthy snack bar was another challenge altogether, as it was new to a market in which healthy products were practically unheard of and had yet to gain a foothold. Nevertheless, the author was determined to make his business grow, and even went door-to-door around the country to sell the bars. If you want a kind business like the author’s, you must be determined to stick to your values, no matter what obstacles you face. By sticking to your values, you’ll also let customers know that your brand is one they can trust. Find out why this is so important in the next blink! Any business seeking long-term success must be willing to create a brand that people trust – but this is only possible if you stay true to your word. Start by asking yourself what it is about your brand that consumers can rely on. The author failed to ask himself this question when launching a new sweet-and-spicy Asian Teriyaki pepper spread; the esoteric Asian flavor had nothing to do with the KIND brand, which was based on Mediterranean flavors. Consumers were disappointed, their trust in the brand was damaged and sales declined considerably. To avoid a mistake like this, always keep your brand in mind when innovating, so that new products are consistent with the brand identity that your customers know and love. Staying true to your brand also entails focusing on the stores where your product performs best. Remember: selling a new product isn’t about entering as many stores as possible – in fact, this is more likely to be a waste of resources than anything else! The author and his team began selling their snack bars with a focus on leading health food stores and specialty chains. They figured these stores might be the best fit for their product, and they were right. At Whole Foods locations across the US, hundreds of KIND bars were sometimes sold in a single day. In contrast, only one or two bars would be sold in generic convenience stores. By investing the most in those stores that really make your product sell, you’ll be ensuring that the customers who truly care about your product are reaping its benefits. You’ll also be more likely to earn their trust, developing a strong, steady stream of income and getting a return on your investment. Today’s marketplace is flooded with cheaply manufactured products that respond to fluctuating trends. These trends are short lived, and consumer demand shifts accordingly. But if your products are honest and down to earth, you’ll ensure your business has staying power. This idea makes up the fifth KIND tenet, and is what led the author’s snack bar to sustainable success. How? Well, if he had created a low-carb version of the snack bar in order to jump on the low-carb bandwagon, he might have experienced some temporary success. But it wouldn’t have lasted, since this trend came and went in the same way all consumer trends do. In the ‘70s, consumers were keen to buy processed foods – but by the ‘90s, they were on the lookout for foods that were grounded in nature. By keeping your product simple, you’ll make sure your business isn’t affected by consumer whims. Another way to make sure your business keeps prospering is by staying on brand. This will protect you from any competitors that enter the market. If you confuse consumers by changing your brand identity while innovating, you’ll again see a loss of trust among your customers. Though it’s tempting, there is no need for you to compromise your brand in order to keep up with competitors. As the KIND healthy snack bars gained traction, several companies launched competing products. A new entrant claimed that their snack bar contained less sugar than the KIND bars. Instead of compromising the KIND brand by using emulsions to lower the bars’ sugar content, KIND launched the KIND Nuts and Spices line. These bars had less sugar due to the removal of fruits, and they stayed consistent with the company’s nature-grounded brand, making them a hit with consumers. Everywhere we look, we’re bombarded with advertising for all manner of consumer products. Though these ads promise happier lives and fulfilled dreams, the products often only disappoint us. Why? Because they can’t live up to their own marketing. Extravagant promises are just another way of damaging your customers’ trust. If your product is authentic and your campaigns are transparent, you’ll make your brand more trustworthy than others on the market. Use your products’ names, designs and marketing to ensure that what customers see is exactly what they get. For instance, one KIND product is called Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew, and not, for instance, Black Forest Cake Supreme. Consumers know precisely what to expect when they purchase the product because of the no-frills name. KIND also uses transparent wrappers, so consumers can literally see through the packaging, making it nearly impossible for them to expect more than what they’re getting. Moreover, KIND markets their products with pictures that aren’t stylized or romanticized, but that simply tell the truth. If your brand is authentic, consumers will choose your products, even if the products themselves aren’t perfect. After all, authenticity has nothing to do with being perfect – it’s about sticking to who you are and what you believe in. Remember the Greek yogurt craze? Several companies attempted to profit from this trend by introducing sweets and snack bars with a coating reminiscent of Greek yogurt. But this coating was far removed from the authentic Greek recipe. Though many were fooled, most people were able to distinguish between authentic Greek yogurt and those making use of artificial flavors. Consumers lost their trust in the artificial products, and stuck with the authentic ones. There’s no denying that it feels great when someone does you a favor or gives you a compliment. In fact, you’ll probably want to spend more time with that person because of it. Why not make your brand do the same thing by celebrating empathy? As part of a promotional campaign, KIND developed the #kindawesome cards, which were to be handed out to people in public performing kind acts. If, for instance, someone on the subway offered their seat to an elderly or pregnant woman, and a person from KIND spotted them, the thoughtful passenger would be handed a #kindawesome card with a code that could be entered on the KIND website. This code would then unlock a packet of snacks that would be sent to the person’s address. By linking the concept of empathy to your business, people will develop powerful positive associations with your brand. And, of course, if people have positive associations with your brand, they’re more likely to purchase your products. The ninth tenet of running a kind business is learning to take a step back and let your team lead. Having insightful and dedicated team members is an asset to your business, and if you let them take the spotlight, you’ll be pleasantly surprised at their skillful contributions. At the 2013 National Product Expo West trade show, one of the world’s largest, the author and his KIND team were presenting new products to their largest and most loyal retail accounts. The author thought that he could speak best about the products’ features, so he started off the presentation on his own. However, as the presentation wore on, he observed how well his team presented the products and realized that they were performing just as well as he was, and sometimes even better! By letting his team lead, KIND made a memorable presentation and every retailer bought its entire line of new products. Running a kind business is demanding, and it’s vital that you keep your team going, even in the face of setbacks. But how? Enter the tenth and final tenet of the kind philosophy: a focus on resourcefulness and empowering your team. So what does it mean to be resourceful? Well, for one thing, it’s not the same as being frugal. If the main priority in your business is frugality, your team members’ concern with budgets will come at the expense of other important aspects. In KIND’s early years, the author chased down every single overdue payment from his distributors and retailers. But he soon realized that the hours spent chasing a retailer who owed him $80 could have been better spent closing new deals. Resourcefulness became his new focus, and it served him well later on. When KIND lost Starbucks as a retailer of the KIND bars, the team focused on their resourcefulness again. Instead of being blinded by budget concerns, they focused on how to get into new stores and coffee chains. As a result, they successfully entered several well-regarded chains like The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and Peet’s Coffee & Tea. Finally, if you empower your team members to think and act like owners, you’ll foster a sense of responsibility and commitment. KIND gives all its team members stock options, treats every employee equally and encourages them to speak up and share their ideas, leaving team members feeling appreciated and committed to the business. So, whenever the business is doing well, everyone can take credit for the success. Likewise, if things are not going well, everyone will feel responsible for getting the business back on track; in this way, the responsibility for your business is shared. This is incredibly valuable for both your business and your employees, creating a KIND experience for everyone involved! The key message in this book: Doing the KIND thing is about being kind to both yourself and to the world. By creating an authentic brand that is driven by your passions and trusted by consumers, you can ensure that your business makes a positive social impact while achieving long-term success.  Actionable advice: The “Push” is not all you have to consider. Next time you push a store to stock your product, stop for one moment and consider this: Did you think about the pull factor? Will the store’s customers pull the product off the shelves? It doesn’t do your business much good if you succeed in getting your product on the shelves, but customers don’t buy it. This might also result in a poor relationship with the buyer. So the push factor is not the whole story – you have to consider the pull factor as well.

In the other corner stands Google, search engine giant and software visionary, armed with the strength of an open-source operating system called Android and leagues of phone manufacturing partners. Once friends, these two tech behemoths turned enemies, fighting for an ever-larger piece of the lucrative smartphone market. These blinks document how an early partnership turned into a legal dogfight, complete with backstabbing, closely-guarded technological secrets and piles of nondisclosure agreements tossed in the trash. In these blinks, you’ll discover how Steve Jobs was misled by his “friends” at Google; what gorillas, glass and iPhones have in common; and how many lawyers it takes to cripple a smartphone manufacturer. In 2001, the technology market was wowed with the introduction of Apple’s iPod. Yet the device had only one function: playing music. Meanwhile, Apple executives had been dreaming for some time of creating an Apple phone, but Steve Jobs didn’t share their dreams. He didn’t want to waste money and effort developing a phone that would only end up being meddled with by the large phone carriers, such as T-Mobile or AT&T. At the time, companies that manufactured phones depended on carriers not just for marketing but also for subsidizing a phone’s purchase price; thus carriers had a big say in the development of any phone technology. True to character, Jobs didn’t accept this situation, as he wanted Apple to have full control over any phone it developed. Apple instead focused its efforts on the iTunes Store, a service that offered music and videos for download. It launched in April 2003 for Mac and iPod users, as only Apple hardware had the software required to run iTunes. Yet competition in the market was growing. Other phone manufacturers were equipping phones with music apps that allowed users to download music from Amazon or Yahoo, for example. People no longer needed a phone and a separate MP3 player – they could have both on a single device. Instead of developing a phone that was compatible with iTunes, however, Apple partnered with technology company Motorola to launch a music phone called Rokr. It seemed the perfect fit: Motorola would develop the hardware, negotiate with phone carrier AT&T and then pay Apple a licensing fee to run iTunes on the device. Rokr was a flop, however. The device was chunky and could only store 100 songs. It could run iTunes but didn’t allow a user to download music from the internet directly. Yet this setback wasn’t of huge concern to Apple. In 2004, iPod sales began to soar, and at the same time, Jobs started to think again about an Apple phone. By the end of 2004, Steve Jobs was warming to the idea of an Apple phone. He knew that mobile connections were now fast enough to run a web browser, for example, or even stream video. Cingular, a phone carrier that was soon to be absorbed by AT&T, promised it would cede full control of product development if Apple were to ever develop a mobile phone. So Apple started development, with the lofty goal of creating smartphone features that had never been seen before. For instance, the company wanted to pioneer a multi-touch screen, which would allow a person to use two fingers to navigate. Today, using pinching or stretching gestures on a smartphone screen is commonplace, yet in 2005 phone chips weren’t powerful enough to run the graphics software required to interpret two-fingered motions. Due to these ambitious goals, Apple’s first prototypes were very large. Over the next two and a half years, the development team worked to shrink the technology sufficiently to make it fit inside a regular-sized smartphone. The company also found a way to manufacture a scratch-resistant screen. Early on engineers were frustrated with their two options: plexiglass screens that could survive a fall but scratched easily, and ordinary glass screens that didn’t scratch but shattered in a one-meter drop test. Jobs had an epiphany when he met with glassmaker Corning and learned about gorilla glass, which is the hardest glass in the world. Originally developed for fighter-jet cockpits, gorilla glass was the solution Jobs was looking for, and he convinced Corning to start producing it for Apple. With a screen made of gorilla glass, the iPhone passed all its durability tests. The phone screen didn’t scratch when shaken in a bag filled with coins; it even survived a fall onto a concrete sidewalk. While we take innovations such as gorilla-glass screens and multi-touch navigation for granted today, at the time such ideas were groundbreaking. Imagine you arrive at work one day to find that half the rooms and even hallways in your office have been sealed off and you can no longer access them. Although this seems ridiculous, it’s exactly what happened at Apple during the development of the iPhone. Jobs didn’t want any information about the iPhone to be leaked. So as development proceeded, he began to cordon off areas, limiting employee access. Over one weekend, certain common areas became off-limits to any employees not on an iPhone team. Some buildings were virtually divided in half. Importantly, employees on the iPhone team had to stay silent about their work. Jobs had team members sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), but even this step wasn’t enough. He also had employees sign another contract, confirming they had indeed signed the NDA! The bottom line was that if anyone was caught discussing the project with outsiders, they would be fired. Even the teams working on the iPhone couldn’t share information about their work with other iPhone teams. Engineers working on the phone’s electronics worked apart from people who worked on software, for instance. In fact, when the software team needed to test-run programs, they weren’t even given the real phone that the engineers were working on but had to make do with a simulator! Other companies that provided iPhone components were kept in the dark, too. Marvell Electronics provided the phone’s Wi-Fi chip, but the company didn’t even know the chip would become part of a smartphone, thinking it was for a new model of the iPod. To keep Marvell in the dark, Jobs even showed their executives fake schematic graphs of a fictional iPod project! Scott Forstall was a brilliant software engineer and had worked for Apple since 1992. Yet despite his successes, he still remained outside of Steve Jobs’s “inner” circle of favored developers. So imagine how Forstall felt when Tony Fadell, a relatively new engineer, quickly became one of Jobs’s favorites and was appointed head engineer for the iPhone project. Fadell had led the team that developed the iPod, and by late 2006, the iPod was generating 40 percent of Apple’s revenue. Apple’s initial plan for the iPhone was to first create a new, better iPod, then add a phone function. The device was to run the iPod operating system. Forstall had a different vision for the iPhone, however. He approached Jobs and suggested that the team instead develop a compressed version of OS X, the operating system for Apple’s Mac computers. Jobs liked the idea and allowed Forstall to take on the project, even though he wasn’t sure it could be done. At the time, mobile chips weren’t nearly powerful enough to run OS X. The operating system would have to be scaled down to a few hundred megabytes, a tenth of its size. Yet Forstall managed to do it. As a result, the rivalry between Forstall and Fadell heated up, and they fought about nearly everything over the next two years. When Forstall’s team was doing well, for example, Jobs allowed him to poach the best engineers from Fadell’s team. Forstall also kept his project a secret, and Fadell’s iPhone team didn’t even know about it! Insiders say their rivalry was partly fueled by Jobs’s behavior. He would seem to favor one executive’s team for a while, then switch to favoring the other, stoking their competitive animosity. In 2007, few people would have considered technology giants Apple and Google direct competitors. Google made its money from search ads, while Apple sold electronic devices. Rather, the two companies were on friendly terms. Jobs was friends with executives at Google, and several of Apple’s board members also served as Google’s advisors. What’s more, Google CEO Eric Schmidt was a member of Apple’s board of directors. Google was even a partner in the development of the iPhone. Jobs was keen to include Google software such as YouTube and Google Maps in the device, and so Google organized a special iPhone team to work on these projects. Yet at the same time Google was developing its own smartphone project. In July 2005, the company bought Android Inc. for $50 million and put Android cofounder Andrew Rubin in charge of its project. Rubin worked on the Android smartphone operating system in secret, and only a few top Google executives knew that the company had partnered with phone manufacturer HTC to develop a new kind of smartphone. The first phone Google developed was similar to the BlackBerry device and was called the Sooner. Yet the device was not successful, primarily because it was released on the heels of the far more impressive iPhone in 2007. Jobs had succeeded in creating a smartphone with a multi-touch screen and a cutting-edge design – and it overshadowed the Sooner completely. The Android team dropped the Sooner shortly afterward and set to work on the Dream. This new project was to offer features that even the iPhone didn’t have, such as a 3G connection, a copy-and-paste function and Google Street View. Jobs presented the Apple iPhone at MacWorld on January 9, 2007. True to form, his presentation was flawless. The engineers sweated out the whole event, however. They knew the device was far from being ready for the market. For instance, when the phone processed too many tasks at once, it ran out of memory and crashed. Jobs secretly used several iPhones during his presentation, switching to a new phone whenever one device froze. While Jobs could hide this glitch during his presentation, the next step could have been the company’s undoing, as the iPhone was scheduled to launch on June 29. Jobs’s team had a number of problems to overcome. The phone’s virtual keyboard still didn’t work. Multiple letters would pop up when a user touched one key, and only after an irritating lag time. What’s more, engineers still hadn’t figured out how to properly embed multi-touch sensors into the gorilla-glass screen. The phone’s tiny antenna was presenting problems, too. The manufacturing company couldn’t mass produce them properly, and transmission performance was unreliable. Despite these challenges, Apple managed to meet its deadline. The international media covered the June 29 launch as if it was a historic event, and the iPhone remained in newspaper headlines for weeks. Stories captured young Apple enthusiasts rushing to touch and purchase the iPhone as if it were a sacred relic! In the first two days, Apple sold 270,000 iPhones, and went on to sell another 3.4 million over the next six months. Friends had warned Jobs about Google’s secret Android project, but he didn’t take their warnings seriously. On November 5, 2007, Andrew Rubin held a press conference to announce the development of the Android operating system and a newly founded Open Handset Alliance, or OHA. This was a consortium of 34 phone producers, software developers and carriers, including T-Mobile, Ebay, Intel and Sony. Jobs didn’t like this at all. The Android mobile operating system would be open source, so that any phone manufacturer could use it. Once this platform launched, it would be in direct competition with Apple’s iOS. The goal of the Open Handset Alliance was to develop open, shared standards for mobile devices instead of having companies develop proprietary software, like Apple had done with its iOS. Google aimed to promote Android devices on the basis of their open-source operating system, which the company itself would benefit from in turn. The following week, Google released a video in which cofounder Sergey Brin and Android engineering director Steve Horowitz were shown playing with different phones. One Android phone offered features that the iPhone didn’t have, such as Google Street View. Jobs felt that the Android phone was basically a knock-off of the iPhone and confronted Google executives about it. They initially reassured Jobs that the phones that were featured in the video were just prototypes for testing the Android OS, and not actually new smartphone models. Jobs mistakenly believed them, as he considered these executives his friends. However, in mid-2008 he learned that Google was planning to release a new phone with iPhone-like features, such as swipe navigation. He threatened to sue Google if the company released a multi-touch smartphone, a feature that Apple had patented. The two sides met for a long meeting. Jobs demanded that certain features be withheld from the new Google phone. Google executives complied, but not for long. While the first smartphone running the Android operating system, the HTC Dream, turned out to be a flop, better ones were on the way. Google was in the process of developing other Android phones with multi-touch features, despite Jobs’s legal threats. In late 2008, Google partnered with Motorola and Verizon to develop a second Android phone, the Droid. It was released in October 2009, and Google marketed it by highlighting features that the iPhone didn’t have, such as the ability to run several tasks at once. In its first three months on the market, the Droid sold better than the iPhone! Then in January 2010, Google released a software update that enabled multi-touch navigation on the Droid. That same month, the company partnered with HTC again to release a third Android phone, the Nexus One, which also offered multi-touch features. As a result, Jobs quickly began legal proceedings over patent infringement, and this opening salvo kicked off a long battle between Apple and Google. While Jobs would have preferred to sue Google directly, he knew he was better off taking the phone manufacturers to court for copying patented iPhone features. After all, Google didn’t actually manufacture its phones, and it gave away its Android software for free. First Jobs sued HTC, the Taiwanese maker of the Nexus. And as Android began to be used in other smartphones, Apple filed patent lawsuits in nearly every industrialized country. By 2012, Apple had about 50 pending lawsuits in at least ten countries just against Samsung, the top distributor of Android-based smartphones. Apple hired 300 lawyers from 50 law firms to process the Samsung suits alone! In the summer of that same year, Apple won a $1 billion judgment in its high-stakes fight against Samsung. Sure, Apple wanted to protect the iPhone’s special features, but it also wanted to weaken its now biggest competitor in the smartphone market. Steve Jobs criticized Google publically at every turn, from 2008 until his death on October 5, 2011. And all the while, Google fought back in the market, releasing new products to chip away at the iPhone. In 2008, Google launched a new application called Google Voice that extended its mobile reach even further. This app allowed a person to make free voice calls online, combining phone numbers and email addresses into a single identification number. If someone calls you over Google Voice, your phone rings and a transcript of the caller’s voicemail is sent to your email. Considering how Google Voice functions, using the application meant that a user’s full contact database would end up on Google’s servers, even if that user was calling over an iPhone. This app could crush Apple, and the company knew it. As a result, when Google offered Google Voice to Apple for inclusion on the iPhone, Jobs rejected the offer. But this move made Apple look bad, as the company was withholding a popular and useful app from its user base. Amid the back and forth, media outlets began to portray Jobs as a control freak, and Apple users were turned off by the endless drama. The Federal Communications Commission even looked into the matter, suspecting that Apple was potentially violating FCC regulations by refusing to allow Google’s app on the iPhone. Jobs eventually caved in and included Google Voice in the Apple iTunes app store. Apple responded, however, by attacking Google’s dominance in mobile advertising and creating a service to replace Google Maps. In 2010, Apple launched its advertising platform, iAd. Just three years later, the company had already earned $200 million from this service. And in 2012, Apple revealed its alternative to Google Maps and incorporated the software in the iPhone 5. Yet Apple Maps failed terribly on release, as its maps misled drivers and even showed an incorrect location for the famous Washington monument in Washington, D.C. These developments were far from the end of the battle between Apple and Google, which seems set to continue for years to come. The key message in this book: Google and Apple started out as friendly companies with shared goals. As the market for mobile internet gained traction, however, the two firms began competing directly with each other in an effort to dominate the young industry, eventually ending up in the courts. Along the way, users have enjoyed an ever-improving stream of iPhones and Android-based smartphones.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

To figure out where to go, many of us would look at a map of the floors. Yet imagine if there was no map, and you had to wander aimlessly, wasting time and energy until you found the sporting goods section. Or perhaps you might find the store exit first, and choose to leave! The online world is the same. Visit a well-designed website and you can find what you need in seconds; surf a cluttered, poorly organized site and you’ll leave before long. These blinks explain exactly what you need to consider when building a website, sharing the hints and hacks that will make your website not only useable but also popular! In these blinks, you’ll discover why the world’s landfills are chock-full of unread user’s manuals; why doing what other web designers have done isn’t exactly a bad thing; and how pizza (and some cash) will help you build a great website. Did you read the user manual to a technology gadget you purchased recently? Probably not. Unless you happen to be an engineer, most people simply don’t care about how stuff works. Imagine asking a random person on the street to explain how a browser or search engine operates. Although most people lack even the most basic knowledge about the mechanics of the internet, they can still navigate websites without much problem. So when you buy a new device, often you just play around with it instead of reading the directions that explain how to use it. And then, when you find a method of operation that works for you, you stick to it. You may have seen this behavior firsthand, for instance when someone searches for a complete website URL instead of using the browser’s URL bar to go directly to the desired website. This is an example of a common decision-making strategy called satisficing. Given a problem, you’d think that a human would rationally search for information, identify solutions, compare them and then choose the best one. But in fact, satisficing is a more typical approach. A study showed, for instance, that firefighters simply do a quick check for errors and then proceed with the first available solution. And these are people operating in high-pressure, high-risk situations! In contrast, your average web surfer just needs to click the “back” button on a browser if she makes a mistake and clicks on an incorrect link. In general, we make decisions quickly as we surf online. Not only because it’s easier, but also because figuring things out independently feels like a game – it’s more fun! In other words, our default internet behavior is to click on the first thing that catches our attention. And when this gets us what we want, we feel smart, comfortable and more confident. Imagine visiting a website with the following text on the home page: “Welcome to XYZ Corporation! We provide world-class clients with innovative products and customizable solutions...” We’re all familiar with this sort of promotional corporate jargon and yet, we never read it. Because usually, when we’re online, we’re on a mission – and we want to get this mission over and done with quickly. That’s why instead of plowing through long texts and reading carefully, we scan. If you run a website and want to communicate a specific message, make sure you use the following elements: short paragraphs, headlines and highlighted keywords. Additionally, organize these components using visual hierarchies, so users can decide which areas to focus on. This is important, because eye-tracking studies show that we make rapid decisions about where to look and completely ignore irrelevant areas, like advertising blocks. Think about a print newspaper. On the front page, headlines, text and images are thoughtfully formatted, so that the reader can immediately glean what’s most important. You should think of your website in the same fashion. Make it obvious what’s important, so that a reader can find that important information quickly and click on it. This gets to another crucial point. Contrary to popular belief, most website visitors don’t mind clicking as long as the choice is mindless and the result is clear. So make sure your website pathways are easy to navigate and understand. But don’t hide important information (like shipping costs) behind a lot of clicks, because that will only annoy your visitor. Too often we imagine that building a website is like creating a product brochure for an interested buyer. But in reality, it’s more like building a billboard to attract cars rushing by at 60 miles per hour! Visiting a new website is somewhat like walking into an unfamiliar supermarket, with one major difference: online, you can’t walk around and look down every aisle. This presents a challenge. Because if you don’t find what you’re looking for or don’t understand how a website is organized, your option to leave (and never come back) is just a click away. Another challenge is that it’s difficult to judge the scale of a website, whether it has 100, 500 or 12,000 pages. And that’s exactly why it’s so crucial to design a site that a visitor knows how to navigate. To do so, it helps to include a “sections” bar at the top of a page to communicate exactly what the site contains. Moreover, every page should include the following four additional navigation items to help a visitor move around. First, don’t forget a search bar. With a search bar, a visitor can immediately find what she’s looking for, without having to learn the organizational concept of the site. Second, consider a “You are here” indicator. Similar to a red dot on a map in a shopping mall, this small indicator lets your visitor easily navigate each page. Third, link your company logo to your home page. This element should be present on every page, to give users a simple way to jump “home” if needed.   And fourth, include a utilities component. This space includes all the nitty-gritty information about how to use your site, like a log in space, a FAQ section, a site map and so on. If these four elements are implemented correctly, a visitor is far more likely to feel comfortable and trust the people and company behind the website. To make sure this happens, we’ll explore how to make these navigation items as self-evident as possible in the next blink. If you live in the United States but have driven a car in London (where they drive on the left), then you know exactly how confusing it can be when conventions are broken. And that’s exactly why you should embrace conventions when you’re designing a website. Users have certain expectations about where stuff is and how things work, which means they’re likely to get annoyed if something is presented differently. Imagine how baffled you’d be if your favorite magazine decided not to print page numbers! Page numbers are a print media convention, but we’re also used to conventions on the web. For example, when words are placed horizontally along the top of a page, we assume this list represents the main sections of the website. Web designers often try to abandon conventions, seduced by the promise of doing something new and innovative. But conventions are established typically after years of fine-tuning and often represent the best and most effective practices developed to date. Tab dividers are a good example. Tabs are a great navigation choice as people are already familiar with the concept of tabs, both from other websites and traditional filing systems. And so when we see them, we instantly know how to use them. Of course, there is always room for innovation, especially as there won’t always be an appropriate convention to suit your needs. Just make sure that whatever you create is usable. In other words: It’s not about suppressing your creativity. It’s about prioritizing the user experience. Consistency and convention are your friends. It’s okay to stray a little as long as you maintain clarity and ease of use – with one important exception, which we’ll discuss in the following blink. When you follow a link from Twitter or Facebook, you often end up landing deep inside a website. But when you want to figure out where you’ve ended up and decide whether you should trust the site’s content, you often head to the site’s home page. Since the home page plays such a crucial role, designing a perfect example is almost impossible. Everyone on your team will have an opinion! Especially as items linked from the home page typically get more clicks, every stakeholder will vie for a spot. If you give in to everyone, your home page will be cluttered and too difficult to understand. Don’t give in to the pressure! When designing a home page, your first priority should be to create an accurate first impression. This is critical! A study on web design showed that the first impression of a website sticks, even after a visitor spends more time on the site later on. This is because our imagination goes into overdrive whenever we encounter something new. We create a big picture of how this new thing works, and then try to force the new information we gather to fit our preconceived notions. So if a visitor is confused from the start, she’ll start misinterpreting your site. And that will only make her more confused the more time she spends on your site. What can you do to avoid this? The most effective way to communicate with readers on your home page is to include a tagline, or a short sentence placed next to your logo that encapsulates the goal of your whole site. A good tagline is lively and personable, and conveys the value of your site. For instance, news site The Daily Beast uses the tagline, “Read this, skip that.” The tagline for car-sharing service Zipcar is, “Wheels where you want them.” At a glance, both taglines communicate clearly what the companies’ websites are all about. So your website should be easy to understand and navigate. But how do you ensure that your final product actually fulfills these goals? You might think to ask your friends, or simply trust your own judgment. Unfortunately, you can’t rely solely on your own judgment. After all, you’ve built the website, so its awesome features and usability flows are obvious to you. It’s impossible to be objective! Having discussions with friends about the site will be similarly fruitless. Because ultimately, people have wildly subjective opinions about what a website should be. If you ask a designer, they’ll tell you they like beautiful pages with lots of white space and subtle touches that offer a pleasant visual experience. Meanwhile, a developer would prefer to see a site with lots of innovative features that a visitor can fiddle around with. And both the developer and designer will assume everyone shares their views. We’re all like this! Whatever we like in a website, whether it be lots of colorful images or stark minimalism, is by default anathema to someone else. And few people try to see things from another point of view; we just assume that we’re “right.” But in fact, there are no “right” or “wrong” answers in web design. And that’s why asking a couple of people for their opinions simply doesn’t work. So instead, conduct tests. Watching people trying to navigate your website is the most objective way to evaluate what you’ve built and to figure out whether your website is working the way you intended. Testing is also valuable because it removes the categories of “right” and “wrong” and shifts your attention to what is and isn’t working. What’s more, it shows you just how different web users are! Although testing is necessary, it doesn’t sound like a lot of fun to most people. That’s why you should be sure to offer compensation or special treats to test subjects (developers are particularly fond of pizza, for example) to ensure as many people as possible will test your site. Your website should be understandable to anyone regardless of background, so don’t worry about selecting subjects only from your target audience. Any sort of person will do; just remember to reward your testers for their help – by paying them for their time. Once you’ve selected a group, ask them to navigate your site while either you or a facilitator (someone patient and empathetic) watches and takes notes. One of the facilitator's goals should be to keep the user focused and comfortable. Start with the home page. Have the tester click around and talk about what she’s seeing. That will give you a sense of whether she’s getting the main idea of the site. Ask questions such as, “What are you thinking?” and “What are you looking at?” But make sure you’re not influencing the tester’s behavior. If she asks for help, say something like, “What would you do if I weren’t here?” Get your test group to try out every feature on your site, including logging in, creating a profile or returning an item. If a tester fails at a task, watch her try to resolve it and then let her keep clicking until she either becomes too frustrated or you realize you can’t learn anything else from the session. An important tip is to get managers, team members and other stakeholders to watch the testing process with you. Often people don’t see the point of testing, assuming the website is good enough. But watching someone fail to use a website can be a transformative experience, making executives for example start taking usability seriously. In all probability, the next words out of a manager’s mouth will be, “Why didn’t we do this earlier?!” Many web development teams avoid testing because they assume that testing involves a lot of time, money and expertise. But that’s not the case. After all, you don’t need to test hundreds of people. You’re not conducting a scientific study, or trying to produce statistically significant results; you’re simply trying to inform your decision making and understand where people might struggle on your site. To that end, you only need to test three normal, everyday web users and have everyone observing the testing process take notes on the top three problems that frustrate or confuse participants. In the author’s experience, you’ll always encounter more problems than you can reasonably fix. Thus, you’ll have to prioritize and focus only on things that need fixing. In other words, don’t worry about fixing problems a tester quickly recovered from on her own. These minor obstacles are part of the fun of exploring a new website. Another benefit of keeping your testing group small is that you can start the process earlier, which makes testing that much more effective. The earlier you find problems, the easier it is to implement changes. Just consider how much easier it is to adjust a beta site than one that’s already established, intricate and live! (Additionally, you won’t have to explain or justify changes to users familiar with a long-running website.) You can also start testing before you’ve even built a website, by watching people navigate competitors’ sites. That way, you can generate useful knowledge that will inform your own development process. Ultimately, by conducting testing early on, you can make better decisions throughout the development process. And this saves time, as you won’t have to redo everything at the end. All it takes is a few hours of time and a little bit of cash upfront. Do you remember the pre-smartphone era? Even then, some cell phones had web browsers, but they were underused. It wasn’t until Apple introduced a touchscreen with swiping and pinching features that mobile browsing became so widespread. Today, people move faster and read less online; what’s more, they’re more likely to leave a site as soon as they run into a hiccup. Don’t forget that mobile download speeds are unreliable and performance varies widely – so make sure your site loads quickly. Your design also has to accommodate a smartphone’s small screen. Since you have less space to convey the same amount of information, you’ll have to make compromises. Prioritize to ensure that in-demand features are quickly found. The rest of the information can be a few taps away, just as long as it’s obvious to a user how to get there. Another important thing to note is that people use the internet everywhere and want to do everything on it. It’s a common misconception that people only use a smartphone on the go, and thus only need basic functions. The reality is that a user is just as likely to be sitting on the sofa at home while surfing on a smartphone, and will thus expect to access a site’s full menu of features. That’s why you should always provide a link to the complete website and implement zoomability features. Returning visitors may be accustomed to your website, so they may not need to see an entire page to figure out how to navigate. All in all, mobile computing is the future, and new possibilities for online interaction will provide amazing opportunities to create a great user experience. Just remember that the only way to make sure you’ve built something usable is to test it! The key message in this book: Usability puts a visitor front and center, ensuring that it is as easy as possible to find information on a website. You can ensure that your website is delivering a great user experience by conducting simple tests at every stage of the development process. Actionable advice: If usability testing bores your boss, do it on your own time. You don’t have to invite the whole executive suite to your first usability tests; the first steps can and should be simple and informal. What you need to do is to show exactly how testing can yield fruitful insights. You could, for example, measure the number of incoming support emails after you’ve corrected a mislabeled button; then send the data to your boss, along with a video of the test that initially drew your attention to the issue. Suggested further reading: The Laws of Simplicity by John Maeda The Laws of Simplicity consists of a set of “laws” formulated by the author to try to grasp the meaning and essence of simplicity. Along the way, it provides useful advice on how to introduce simplicity to our daily lives, business and product design. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It’s something every company, athletics club or theater group longs for. But far too often it seems an impossibility. And let’s not kid ourselves, working together with others can sometimes be pretty terrible. There is surely no more fear-inducing phrase in the English language than “team building exercises”. But there’s a reason why they exist. We all know that there’s much to be appreciated in a strong team. When something’s done well, we all benefit. But there’s no need to see the dream team as an elusive thing. There are some simple rules that can be applied to ensure that your team will be at its best. Shane Snow’s a great guide for this. His examples aren’t just dry recollections of company politics. Instead, he draws lessons from across the gamut of human history. It’s a lot of fun and it’s a great way to help those key rules stick in your head. In these blinks, then, we’ll take a closer look at the elements that make up a dream team and give you the ideas, concepts, and encouragement so you can go out and create one of your own. In this pack you’ll learn: which hip hop group you should aspire to be; how the Wright Brothers liked to settle arguments; and some basics of modern art appreciation. In 1974, the FBI was trying its hardest to serve a subpoena to a Mafia boss based out of Newark, New Jersey. In those days, the law was pretty clear: only if the subpoena was given directly and personally to somebody was it necessary for them to obey it and appear in court. So the Mafia boss came up with what he thought was a winning strategy: he surrounded himself with bodyguards. No subpoena-wielding FBI agent was going to get close to him! In the end, it was a young female agent, Chris Jung, who came up with a plan. She’d go undercover to the wedding of the Mafia boss’s daughter. She’d make out that she was one of the wedding guests and deliver the subpoena to the boss herself as he welcomed the guests. She was able to succeed because she was a woman in a male-dominated profession and so managed to achieve her goal without causing undue suspicion at the Mafia wedding. There are two lessons here. Firstly, generally speaking, diversity among team members will increase the chances of finding the right solution. Secondly, as Jung showed in this case, diversity can bring new ways of thinking to teams. Jung demonstrated that agency work didn’t have to be a show of strength and brawn. Disguise, intrigue and clever maneuvering could also reap rewards. These lessons don’t just apply to women in male-dominated teams. Gender and racial diversity within your team will add the kinds of perspectives that foster problem solving. That’s because your lived experiences shape the way you see the world, the way you think and, ultimately, the way you solve problems. A greater range of diverse opinions from different backgrounds will challenge people to re-evaluate entrenched perspectives and prejudices. In 2013, four different US universities invited around 200 people who self-identified as either Democrats or Republicans. They were to participate in a murder mystery scenario. Interestingly, even though the scenario didn’t involve politics at all, when the participants were told they'd be explaining their solution to the murder mystery game to people of opposing party allegiances, they prepared themselves better and worked on stronger arguments. The study showed another benefit of diversity: if a team is more diverse, the decisions that are presented will have been strength-tested for success. Have you ever wondered how it is that couples who argue all the time somehow stay together for years? Well, according to experts at the Gottman Institute, a research center that examines couples' relationships, frequent arguments aren't actually an indicator of long-term problems. What’s much worse is when partners stop talking to one another. Conflict is a sign that people are prepared to find a solution. On the other hand, silence can lead to serious issues if problems are left unresolved. The same is true of companies. Organizational silence can result in problems down the line. Let’s look at an example in the auto industry. In 1998, the Detroit-based Chrysler and the German car manufacturer Daimler, who owned Mercedes-Benz and Maybach, set up a merger of their companies. Three years in, DaimlerChrysler was worth only half of what it had been at the time of the merger. The venture had been a massive failure. Interestingly, the cultural differences between the two businesses didn’t result in DaimlerChrysler becoming an amalgam of the two companies’ best practices. Instead, conflict arose between the quality-oriented former Daimler employees and the utility-oriented Chrysler workers. This phenomenon is known as cognitive friction. Discussion was not encouraged between the two sets of employees, creating an environment in which each kept to their own and the groups rarely interacted. The result was organizational silence. This isn’t to say conflict in and of itself is necessarily a bad thing. Just look at the Wu-Tang Clan, arguably one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. They put their differences to good use. The posse formed in the 1990s and was comprised of musicians of different characters, ages and musical influences. The Wu-Tang Clan capitalized on its internal differences, moving the whole genre forward with groundbreaking lyrics and beats. However, a point will always come when tension and conflict no longer help to stimulate discussion and ideas. The whole thing can dissolve into toxic animosity. The famous aviation pioneers, the Wright brothers, knew the risks of this too well. They had an interesting strategy to avoid full-blown hostilities. They’d actually swap sides during arguments and try to argue each other’s points. That way they could detach, resasses their own natural stubbornness, and argue against the points rather than the person. The Wright brothers’ strategy for achieving harmony worked well for them, but it’s not easily scaled up to groups with more deep-seated animosities. For instance, at the turn of the twentieth century, many of the different communities in Buenos Aires were at loggerheads. Neighborhoods were never going to switch perspectives en masse like the Wright brothers did. But here’s something that did work: soccer! Argentinian national identity was evolving. The country used to see itself as one made up of rugged cowboy-like gauchos. Now it was dominated by pibes, kids who loved playing soccer on the streets. And kicking a ball around was something all kids could do too, regardless of race, religion or social class. This was particularly important to the Jewish community, who were facing particular difficulties in the city at the time. The soccer scene exploded. There were games on the streets and in the stadiums. Buenos Aires itself boasted a huge number of soccer teams. And, critically, when people played together, the animosities between different groups of Argentine society diminished. That might seem odd, but there are good reasons for it. Research shows that playing together makes the individuals see the other participants – irrespective of what side they are on – as part of the ‘in-group’. You feel less threatened by your opponents and actually more empathetic toward them. The brain tends to divide people either into ‘in-groups’ or 'out-groups’. That is, there are people who are similar to you whom you can trust, and there are people toward whom you’re more likely to harbor suspicious feelings. The part of the brain responsible for this division is the amygdala. When it identifies suspicious people, it triggers increased levels of adrenaline, sending alarm signals to other parts of the brain and body. The body’s heart rate and blood pressure will increase when this happens. It only takes something a little out of the ordinary to set off this response, even if it’s just hearing a foreign language or seeing someone acting a little strangely. In fact, it’s this chemical reaction that is the scientific basis for xenophobia. But we don’t have to let our bodies’ chemistry guide us. If people play together – as they did in Argentina – they’ll trust one another more. The result will be that in-groups expand and people will simply get along better. It has become fairly common in business circles to quote the adage, \"Don’t change a winning team.” On the surface it may make a lot of sense, but teams that have achieved success in the past often get stuck in their ways. That’s because whenever a team has been successful before, the tendency is to keep soldiering on in the exact same way. Innovation quickly becomes stagnation. Take the example of a company we’ll call G-Corp. In the 1980s it struck gold. It invented the successful blister cushion. Essentially, it was a bandage that released medication into a blister over a given time period. But, after this initial success, the company’s sales started to decline. Its fresh ideas weren’t nearly as good as the blister cushion. It failed to attract new customers. They were therefore forced to change what had once been a winning team. G-Corp’s executives hired the consultants Sense Worldwide who helped them expand the market for their products. It was a shock to the system, but it was needed. The team was able to move forward. Sense Worldwide began by setting up focus groups to help the executives understand the needs of their customer base. The focus groups were made up of people working in professions that were particularly susceptible to blisters. The executives were then made to draw a circle around the blisters on the feet of the focus group members with a permanent marker and then discuss the members’ needs with them. As a result, G-Corp came up with a new line of plaster-type products. There would be different shapes and thicknesses of plaster for different blisters, according to their severity. One final way to change up a team to enhance success, is to introduce someone into it who challenges the views of the others. In an experiment in 2009, American students were instructed to solve a murder mystery in teams of three. Yes, another murderous study – different to the one we mentioned in blink one! After 20 minutes, they were joined by a fourth member, the devil’s advocate. It was shown that the introduction of this new member doubled a group’s chances of solving the mystery. It wasn’t that the new person brought them the right answer. Rather the group was forced to consider its choice and test its argument against cross-examination. One particularly dismal March, the author headed to the Tretyakov Gallery to look at a groundbreaking painting. But he was left cold when he stood before it. The picture in question was Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square. It was painted at the start of the twentieth century, and it’s quite literally a small square canvas painted black. But the true significance of this painting lies in the story behind it. Prior to Malevich’s Black Square, art tended to portray reality and beauty. Even artists such as Picasso tried to capture a sort of reality, however distorted it can appear at first. Black Square freed art of the need to portray reality and reality alone. Art could become a vehicle for enriched visual communication and cognitive expansion. Art could be free. One of Malevich’s students, El Lissitzky, put these ideas into action. He designed propaganda posters for the Communists in Russia. Interestingly, when he realized the sort of power artists have to influence the masses, it proved too much. Consequently, Lissitzky, along with many other artists, fled for Germany in the 1920s. It was these artists who founded the now famous Bauhaus, an art movement that redefined the role of artistic function within global industry and advertising. This goes to show that it doesn’t really matter whether or not you like an original idea like the Black Square on initial viewing. Good ideas will still go on to have a long-lasting impact and influence. Don’t dismiss a possible solution before it’s fully formed. But there’s the other side of the coin: remember that good can come from bad ideas, even if they’re very unpopular. Take the idea that city planners in freezing Winooski, Vermont came up with in 1979. They wanted to reduce the town’s ever-increasing heating bill by covering the town with a dome through federal funds. Unsurprisingly, this wacky idea started gaining nationwide coverage, and was ridiculed from all sides of the political spectrum. It even earned an intervention from President Jimmy Carter, who gave orders to stop the dome’s construction. But the bad idea actually helped the town in the long run. Thanks to Winooski’s increased media profile, it managed to secure funding for a new hydroelectric plant nearby. Incredibly, it was the second largest funding amount per capita in the history of the US. The town was able to heat itself more economically and it all happened because one bad idea got tongues wagging. When you think about it, the Communist authoritarian Soviet Union was an unusual ally for the capitalist democracies of the West during the Second World War. But when faced with the existential threat of Hitler’s forces, they put aside their differences and put their minds to the task at hand. There’s a broader lesson in this. Superordinate goals unite people from different backgrounds who have quite different ideas. An even more extreme version of this occured in the War of 1812. The British were planning to take back the newly independent USA. They planned to send military vessels up the Mississippi river, but the port city of New Orleans stood in their way. The American general, Andrew Jackson, was struggling to match British troop numbers and so was forced to muster up not only his own trained cavalry, but also African American militia, pirates, volunteers with hatchets and hunting rifles and even prostitutes. Jackson was not a tolerant man and despised his new troops. The feeling was mutual. Nonetheless, they set aside their differences and concentrated on their superordinate goal: to defend the country against the British troops. Incredibly, in 1815, this mob of unlikely comrades beat the British back and saved the country from a full invasion. However, the truce between these groups was not to last. Soon after the battle old animosities resurfaced, as signalled by the State of Louisiana attempting to reclaim pirates’ property. The truth was, though their success had been a great one, the differences between the groups were simply too absolute to be overcome completely. But it’s not impossible to avoid dissolution. Unity can be preserved if a culture of teamwork and mutual respect is nurtured. In 1954, an experiment was conducted at a boys' summer camp. The children were divided into two groups, the Rattlers and the Eagles, and they quickly came to loathe each other. However, they were given a series of challenges that forced them to compromise. They had to deal with a compromised water supply and the breakdown of the camp truck during a lake expedition. After the first challenge, the groups quickly reverted to the norm of hating each other. But as they were given more challenges and collaborated more frequently, they began trusting each other’s intentions. They started to empathize. And so a deeper sense of respect for the other group was cultivated. By the last day of camp, the old animosities had vanished. They sat together in the cafeteria irrespective of what group they were part of and sang merrily together on the bus ride back home. It sounds like a swell summer! In the 1950s and early 1960s, the famed civil rights activist Malcolm X was a controversial figure, to put it bluntly. Not only was he a member of the radical Nation of Islam, but his bad experiences with white people in America in his younger years also led him to a radical conclusion. For him, integration was an impossible goal, and so he advocated that black and white communities should be kept separate. This story encapsulates what years of research have shown. Namely, many of our opinions are the result of our brains interpolating belief based on our previous experiences. But there is a way out, as Malcolm X later discovered. If you're put in a strange environment, you’ll tend to reassess your intellectual standpoint with humility. Research shows that if you immerse yourself in a different culture you will become more receptive to new ideas. As you move out of your comfort zone you'll see the world from a new perspective, one that is dissociated from your individual identity. Thus profound changes of heart become more likely. What made Malcolm X finally change his ideas about separatism was his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1964 and the subsequent time he spent in Africa. All that assisted him in developing a new multicultural perspective. He saw different cultures, where people of different ethnicities lived together in harmony. It convinced him that this was also possible in the US. But ressassment doesn't come from nowhere. You have to be prepared to approach intellectual arguments with humility and recognize any predetermined allegiances or prejudices you might hold. Only then will you be able to value discussion and arguments based on their rational merits alone. Malcolm X therefore exemplifies this intellectual humility in action. He was able to reconsider his entrenched opinions and reassess them. The lesson of intellectual humility holds true for teams as well as for individuals. While it’s self evident that a diversity of opinions in a group will increase the chances that the right solution will be somewhere in the mix, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the right solution will be the one that is settled on. This is where intellectual humility comes in. If people are willing and able to reconsider their opinions, then it’s more likely that a difference of opinions will result in rational debate. And if people are able to debate rationally, then it’s more likely that the right answer will be chosen. So far we’ve seen how intellectual humility, lively discussions, regulated dissent and common goals all help in creating a dream team. But there’s more that can be done. When team members hear colleagues’ life stories, it elicits empathy. Teams therefore improve as members better understand one another. A series of experiments conducted by Paul Zak of Claremont University looked into oxytocin production in participants under certain conditions. Oxytocin is important as it’s the hormone that’s produced when we experience trust or kindness, making us more empathetic toward one another. Zak demonstrated that when people were shown charity advertisements that relayed cancer patients’ stories or abuse suffered by pets at animal shelters, the participants’ bodies produced much more oxytocin than when shown ads that conveyed statistics about cancer patients or animal abuse. They were also more likely to donate money after seeing the story-based ads than the stat-based ads. There's a reason for this. Stories make us relate to one another much better than dry numbers. It's simply much easier to put ourselves empathetically in their shoes. The effect can be scaled up too: people’s stories have been front and center of some of the most important social justice milestones to date. Take the examples of Asian Americans and gay people in America. Attitudes toward these two groups changed significantly over the course of the last century. During the Second World War, Asian Americans were some of the most negatively stereotyped minorities in the country. And after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, over 120,000 Asian Americans were put into prison camps, supposedly because they were all potentially capable of conspiring with a foreign power. Eventually, positive characters in film and on TV helped people relate more to Asian Americans. One such character was Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek. He was eloquent, and so challenged racial stereotypes. It was a similar story with homosexuality. Over 50 percent of Americans in the 1950s believed that homosexual activity was criminal and warranted jail time. But when gay people started bravely coming out, and sharing their stories en masse, attitudes began to change. All it can take is a bit of sharing and empathy for things to work out for the better. Dream teams can be difficult to assemble and to maintain. But a good mix of diversity, provocation, intellectual humility and compassion will see you through in the end. It's definitely worth the effort. The key message in these blinks: Many of us have witnessed those moments when, as working as part of a team, everything comes together and something lasting is produced. What’s more, the result can be greater than the work of any one individual. However, most of the time, teamwork is frustrating. We can be left thinking that going it alone was best. But that’s not true! If we’re respectful, empathetic, open-minded, ready to be challenged and willing to listen to dissent, then a true dream team can emerge and achieve the very best results. Actionable advice: Reverse roles. Next time your team is stuck in an argument where neither of the sides is willing to compromise, suggest switching sides. If you’re forced to argue for the idea you were arguing against, you’ll find this will not only ease the tension, but also make everyone see the benefits of both ideas more clearly.

Just a decade ago, a person might say he couldn’t live without his Blackberry. But today? There’s no question that smartphones are a must-have device. With each jump in technological discovery and development, the role that tech devices play in our lives expands. So the question is, where do we go from here? These blinks show you where technology will take society tomorrow, exploring the deep questions of what we want or even need technology for in our modern lives. The technology of the future should be more than about tracking our steps and apps to count calories; indeed, tomorrow’s technology should be enchanted. In these blinks, you’ll also learn how a crystal ball could tell you when to shut off the air conditioning; why a talking bathroom scale is better than a life coach; and how a glowing table might finally silence your overly chatty colleague. What will technology look like in the future? Perhaps we’ll be served by personal robots, or maybe we’ll all become touch screens! There’s one idea that could change life as we know it. And it’s already in motion: enchanted objects are the technology that will shape our future. What is an enchanted object? It’s technology that makes our lives more convenient without distracting us. That’s right, not like a smartphone! Enchanted objects offer information at a glance, unlike screen-based devices that require your full attention as you read and respond to messages. Why is the difference between screen-based technology and enchanted objects so crucial? It comes down to neurology. In the human brain, two systems exist in fierce competition with each other. The first system allows us to make quick decisions, based on impulse and experience. The second system encourages us to make rational, calculated plans. The first system is the “faster” of the two, which explains why people can recognize and process colors, faces and shapes much faster than they can read text. Much of today’s technology relies heavily on the brain’s second system; we read or navigate blocks of text on phones and computers. As a result, such technology is inherently slower and less intuitive. Enchanted objects, in contrast, offer the benefits of technology without forcing a user even to think about it. Imagine that you’re waiting at a bus stop. An enchanted object – in the form of a pole at the bus stop – features a glowing countdown clock to tell you how soon your bus will arrive. Enchanted objects are simple and intuitive, and the way we interact with them is too. Many enchanted objects make use of natural human gestures. Rather than tapping or swiping a screen, you could give an enchanted object a kick to tell it what to do. Seriously! The Amazon Trashcan, for instance, uses cameras and sensors to track waste and reorder stock. Want to cancel an order? Just gently kick the can, and you’re done. Enchanted objects offer society a more natural and effective way to engage with technology. But that’s not all. We’ll learn about the significance of enchanted objects in the next blink. From crystal balls that can divine the future to mystical swords that warn of danger, people have shared stories and ideas of magical “devices” for ages. Yet today the dream of objects with supernatural powers isn’t just make-believe. New developments in technology are making this dream a reality. Let’s look at a few cases. Humans, by nature, are curious animals. We want to know how the world works! Which is a good thing, as the more informed a person is, the better the chances of survival in the world. It’s no wonder that we find the mythical idea of a crystal ball, a device that can see into the future or answer any question, so attractive. The author used the idea of a crystal ball as his inspiration when developing a device called the Ambient Orb. This device glows different colors to indicate a change in information or state, for things such as stock prices to wave height at the beach! One California power company uses the Ambient Orb in its business decisions. The orb tells a customer when using energy is the least expensive, so customers can avoid using energy-hungry devices at peak times, potentially avoiding a costly disruption such as a brownout. Another new idea was inspired by the fictitious world of Harry Potter. Remember the Weasley Clock? The hands of this “clock” showed the state of the Weasley family, whether they were home, on the way or potentially in danger. Google engineers inspired by this idea have created the Latitude Doorbell. This device chimes once a GPS tracking system registers that a family member is heading home. Finally, we have always been attracted to the idea of enchanted objects as guardians or protectors. Frodo’s sword, Sting, glows blue when orcs are near in the magical world of The Lord of the Rings, for example. The author’s idea for an Ambient Umbrella applies a similar idea: it glows if rain is expected, so you won’t leave it behind on your way out the door! Did you know that half the entire US population takes prescription medications? And that some 50 percent of those individuals fail to take their medication on any given day? Given such statistics, the US healthcare system has a real challenge on its hands. We all need to remember to take the pills that we’re prescribed, yet that’s often easier said than done. Some people simply forget, just like the character Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter series of books. Luckily, Neville had a Remembrall, a ball-shaped device that reminded him when he’d forgotten something crucial. The author thought that a Remembrall would be a wonderful thing for the medical industry. So he created an enchanted device that would remind a patient, using light and sound, to take a pill. Called the GlowCap, this device attaches to a standard medical pill container and can even order refills for a patient automatically. Enchanted objects could do more than just help people stay on track with medication, however. They can even revolutionize the way we travel. Take self-driving cars, for instance. Self-driving cars are safer as they reduce the chance of accidents caused by human error. Self-driving cars can also relieve the pain of looking for parking! Imagine this: a car drops off its passenger at work, drives itself out of town, parks, then returns to pick up the passenger on time. No need to walk for ages to a parking spot, no need for unsightly parking garages in the middle of a city! Finally, enchanted objects can help humans do what we do best: express ourselves! By giving people the tools to learn and develop new skills, enchanted objects can take a person’s creative potential to the next level. A great example of this is Guitar Hero, an enchanted object that inverts the learning curve, making learning to play the guitar initially easy and gradually ramping up the difficulty level as a person progresses. Enchanted objects can even help children learn through play. LEGO Mindstorms feature LEGO bricks with built-in sensors that react to touch, sound and light. Children manipulate the behavior of their toy designs while also learning a mode of thinking essential to computer programming languages! We’ve all been there: you look at your smartphone to notice that the battery is at three percent. At any moment, you’ll lose access to your camera, your maps and the tools you use to communicate. Let’s face it: we’re dependent on our smartphones. But this may change in the future. Enchanted objects will allow us to distribute essential tools across many devices, rather than collect them all in just one. Some companies are taking advantage of fast yet miniature technology and creating sensors that can be worn on the body. The Sunsprite is one example of this tiny tech. Developed for people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), the Sunsprite is a small, wearable sensor charged by the sun that measures whether the wearer is receiving sufficient sunlight. Enchanted objects are designed based on technological advancements that put durability and longevity first. Many popular tech devices today sacrifice these traits for portability and aesthetics. An enchanted object is designed for a single purpose – and its goal is to fulfill this purpose as effectively as possible, for as long as possible. The Facebook Coffee Table is a good example of this: a sturdy table with one function, to display photos of friends mentioned in passing conversation on a built-in screen. Finally, enchanted objects can reach their full potential when designed to connect emotionally with a user. After all, we’re far more likely to use an object that’s “cute” or which we find somehow loveable. When creating interactive medication packaging, the author teamed up with artists to design a product for which a user might feel affection. The team decided to use cute animals to give the packaging a sense of emotional appeal and thus encourage their use. So now you’re familiar with a few examples of what enchanted objects can do. Let’s look at how we can create such technological wonders today. What if your bathroom scale could do more than display a few numbers on a monochrome screen? By linking enchanted objects to the internet, we could create a household full of interconnected devices to help us organize and improve our lives. To “enchant” an object, you need to help the device get to know you. Using smartphones and tablets has already given us a head start, as we already use cloud-based systems to connect screen-based devices to the internet. This connection then enables a device to combine the information it’s collected about you with internet resources, and even artificial intelligence. By connecting household items in the same fashion, we could create a truly “smart” home. Your bathroom scale could show you your progress toward losing weight, perhaps even offer you much needed encouragement, for instance! Devices collect a wealth of data about us, so why not use this data to create personalized experiences? Rather than offering conventional health tips, an enchanted bathroom scale would know our medical history, age and even attitude toward losing weight. This would allow it to offer advice that would genuinely help you, and deliver it in a way that would encourage you to listen. If technology such as this were implemented in homes across the world, the health care sector of many countries would save billions in needless costs every year! What’s more satisfying than reaching a personal goal? Telling friends how you got there, of course! When we connect enchanted objects to social networks, we can use the power of communities and sharing to stay motivated. Enchanted objects that encourage social interaction will be the ones people use most. Research has shown that a person is far more likely to achieve a goal when the person feels he belongs to a group that cares about him, whether it’s a community recycling meet-up or a men’s walking group. We can also use enchanted objects to stay motivated by giving devices the latitude to turn progress into a game. The basis of the video game industry, after all, is the human drive to compete and improve. Points systems and leaderboards work well to push players to do better. An online community recycling leaderboard, for example, could encourage an entire neighborhood to be more conscious about the environment. Rewarding players with medals or acknowledging winning streaks are other techniques used by game developers to give users the feeling that they’re gaining experience and making progress. Posting data that points to a winning streak in losing weight, for example, could be integrated into an enchanted bathroom scale to stop you from abandoning your exercise routine after just two weeks! Most urban homes may seem modern, but really, they aren’t. Cramped, inefficient, often expensive and constantly in need of repair, our “modern” homes rarely make the most of what technology has to offer. Building more flexible transformer homes is one place to start. The modern home should be intuitive, adjustable and efficient. Limited space can be made more useful by using the same space for different purposes. City homes can convert a living space into a dining room, a study, a workout space or even a bedroom, depending on the need at a given time of day. Yet having to unfold a couch bed when you’re exhausted can be a drag, so why not automate it? A wall clock or remote control could be programmed to time such space transformations in a home. Enchanted objects could also help us get the most out of workspaces by improving communication. Think of the last business meeting you attended: the extrovert in the room dominated the discussion, right? To ensure that other team members share thoughts too, the author developed the Balance Table. This sleekly designed table has a built-in constellation of LED lights to show attendees sitting at it who’s been chatting on the longest. With the obvious cue of the table’s lights, team members are encouraged to keep their input balanced. We could enchant whole cities, too! Future urban areas can work to improve living standards by connecting city infrastructure with the cloud. Linking important city services to a wealth of online data could allow for a more informed, efficient use of resources. We’ve already seen this in effect, as BigBelly trash cans are used today in some US cities. BigBelly trash cans have built-in, solar-powered trash compactors. The trash in a BigBelly takes up less space, so it doesn’t need to be collected so frequently. These trash cans are also connected to the cloud to alert garbage collectors when they should be emptied, saving time and money. In the future, we’ll all be hackers. Not necessarily with the goal of revealing classified government documents but with the drive to make enchanted household objects fit our needs perfectly. Enchanted objects will be programmable, giving users true control over functionality. Most products today can only do what a designer created them to do. A watch tells the time; a thermometer measures temperature. But enchanted objects will allow users to choose from a range of functions. A recent example of a flexible enchanted object is Twine, a small plastic box containing a microprocessor. Created by two MIT graduates, Twine can be programmed to measure speed, moisture, temperature and vibration, as well as many other variables. Twine is also connected wirelessly to the internet. Put a Twine device in the basement to inform you via email when humidity levels rise, potentially signaling a water leak; attach a Twine device to a bird feeder to receive an alert every time a bird comes to snack. The possibilities are endless! By creating a web of connection between devices in the cloud, we’ll be able to streamline and automate many time-consuming tasks. Doing so will leave us more time for what’s important, whether being creative, learning new skills, excelling at our job or simply spending more quality time with those we love. The key message in this book: Today’s screen-based devices slow society down. The arrival of enchanted objects, devices with a single design purpose and connection to the cloud, brings what was once seen as science fiction closer to reality. From enchanted bathroom scales to crystal balls, we’ll soon be able to upgrade the objects in our lives, making them automated, more efficient and intuitive. Got feedback?

It’s not easy, is it? Trying to do very opposite things at the same time is a challenge not only for our bodies but also for our minds. In today’s competitive business world, leaders are often expected to do just that, perform tasks simultaneously that seem contradictory. On the one hand, a business leader needs to be a risk taker and passionate about her business, while on the other, she needs to be a calculating, rational manager. How can any one person master both personalities? These blinks will show you the way to best combine the energy of a daring entrepreneur with the cool judgment of a savvy leader so you can take your venture to the next level and beyond. In these blinks, you’ll discover how a simple to-do list can help you realize your dreams; why taking on debt is only for dummies; and why locking your staff out of the office isn’t an effective motivation technique. What sort of qualities do you expect from a start-up founder? A start-up founder certainly needs to be comfortable taking risks, and should have the go-getter attitude of an entrepreneur. What’s more, she needs to be comfortable thinking outside the box, as that's how she’ll create new products and find the right market niche. It's also necessary for a start-up founder to be a great leader. She should be disciplined, yet humble. She also needs to keep her cool under pressure, especially during the hectic early days. Ultimately, an effective start-up founder should embody just the right combination of qualities from great leaders and great entrepreneurs. In other words, you need to be an EntreLeader. An EntreLeader is a risk-taker who can spot gaps in a market. She is a passionate individual with a strong desire to succeed, but she’s also a capable leader who can motivate a team and can make tough decisions with integrity. A company’s leader determines a company's culture. Thus a leader needs to have strong EntreLeadership skills if she wants to succeed. Many CEOs today struggle with this. They don't always realize that strong leadership skills are just as important as strong entrepreneurial skills. The author too struggled with being an effective leader. In one of his earlier ventures, he managed 14 employees. Although he was passionate about his work, he was often frustrated that his staff didn't share his passion equally. He often overreacted to small issues, such as employees showing up late. Letting his anger overwhelm his reason, the author once forced his whole staff to sit outside on a chilly day, telling them that being late would “leave them out in the cold.” Unsurprisingly, this demonstration didn't go over well with his staff. And his failure to be a balanced leader didn’t only bring down the spirit of his employees, but it also hurt his business. The good news is that leaders can always learn and change. When you adopt the necessary skills to become an EntreLeader, you can bring your organization great success. When you imagine your dream business, of course you can’t help but dream big. You know that through your ingenuity, innovative thinking and hard work, you’ll achieve success. Unfortunately, many of our dreams never become reality. So what can you do to realize your dream? An EntreLeader breaks her dream into specific goals that each have a clear set of steps to achieving them. In doing so, an EntreLeader and her team always know what they’re working on and where they’re headed. To keep your team on track, try using a well-known management practice called management by objectives, or MBO. First, you agree to a set of goals with each member of your team. Next, you set a clear deadline for when those goals should be met. Accountability is important. If team members are involved in the goal-setting process, they’re also on the hook if things go awry; this fact helps to keep everyone motivated and on track. And setting goals isn’t a process just for your employees – you can and should adopt this process, too. Have you ever avoided a task because you were afraid that you'd fail? This kind of hesitation can prevent your dreams from becoming a reality. Avoid unnecessary delays by setting goals for yourself. When you set a well-defined goal with a clear deadline, it’s hard to wander off course. You know the path; so you have to keep going. The author’s friend, a web designer, decided to start his own business. He struggled in the beginning, so he set a goal of earning $5,000 per month after 120 days – or close the business. This self-imposed pressure energized him and forced him to take action. And as a result, he ended up earning $7,000 per month, much more than he had planned! Your dream is the starting point of your business's success, but be sure you’ve set a clear plan for realizing it. Have you ever spent a whole day working on a task, only to reflect and feel you hadn’t actually accomplished much? It’s not a rewarding feeling. You'll fall victim to this if you don't set a clear plan for what you want to achieve. A simple tool like a to-do list can keep you on track. A to-do list gives you control of what occupies your time during your busy day. Don’t fall into a situation where you only work when you’re asked to do so – work when things need to be done. Think of it this way: you probably would rush out to help a friend if asked, right? While it may be a kind gesture, this sort of behavior just creates more work for yourself, as in doing so you’re probably neglecting other important tasks. A prioritized to-do list helps you avoid reactive behavior. When you have an orderly list of tasks to complete, you'll concentrate better. You can still help out friends and colleagues, but you'll remember what you really need to do – and know when your list tasks are more important. A to-do list also gives you satisfaction when you look back at it at the end of the day, as it shows you all the goals that you’ve achieved and all the tasks now completed. When you review your list and see a bunch of “finished” check marks, you'll know you've spent your time wisely. You'll also know that the tasks you've checked off are the most important things you had to do – otherwise they wouldn't be on the list. A day spent on a well-planned family holiday feels much better than a day on the couch, right? That's because you've accomplished a list of meaningful tasks. Strive to make this a habit. What's the most important aspect of your business? You might assume it's your product. After all, you can't earn money without it! A product is important, but it's meaningless if you can't convince other people that it's important too. This is where a marketing department comes in handy. Behind every successful business, there's a great marketing strategy. A great marketing strategy connects your customers’ needs with your product. In 1994, the author started a class about how to avoid bankruptcy. He called it “Life After Debt,” marketed the class on the radio and offered a first session for free. Only six people attended the class, however. The author realized that his course wasn’t meeting his audience’s expectations, as most weren’t bankrupt but were interested instead in achieving financial stability. So the author revised his class, renaming it “Financial Peace University” and focusing on how students could achieve their financial goals. It was a huge success, and to date, millions of people have taken the class! This story also illustrates that building a strong marketing strategy is a learning process. While your first attempt probably won't be successful, you’ll learn from your failures and tweak your strategy accordingly. And in doing so, your strategy will just get stronger and stronger. And even if you have crafted the perfect strategy, you still need to make sure you’ve hired the right sales team. After all, they're the ones who persuade your customers to buy. Sales isn't about manipulating people into buying a product, but about giving people a positive experience by showing you care about their needs and offering useful information about how your product can meet those needs. You can't force someone into buying anything, but if you earn their trust, it's likely they’ll become a customer. So build trust by showing pride in your product and treating your customer with respect. And remember: a happy customer doesn't just buy a product, they tell their friends about it, too! Your company needs some capital to expand. But how do you find the money you need? A small loan wouldn't be risky as long as you're careful to pay it back, right? Wrong. Debt destabilizes your company, putting you at greater risk of failure or even bankruptcy. When you take on debt, you'll have to spend a period paying it off, which will reduce your cash flow. You'll have less money to pay your bills, your staff or buy stock. In fact, most small companies go under because of cash flow problems. Reducing your cash flow simply isn't a wise thing to do. Here’s a straightforward example of the perils of cash flow problems. The owner of a small but growing plumbing company obtained a commission from an important client to dig a ditch. To do the job, he needed a backhoe, but the rental costs were $450 per month. So the owner decided to take out a loan to cover the rent for the backhoe. After a few months, the owner realized that the fees associated with the loan were crippling his profits. The lingering debt essentially plunged a once-profitable business into crisis. Avoid the temptation of falling into debt by creating an emergency fund. An emergency fund is true to its name, in that it’s where you store extra cash to cover yourself or your business in times of crisis. The author benefited greatly from having an emergency fund. A bankrupt company was getting rid of its high-quality office furniture worth some $300,000. While the author didn’t really need furniture at the time, the fire sale price of $21,000 was too good to pass up. So he used his emergency fund to buy the furniture and stored it. Later on, he used the furniture for a new company, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process, and importantly, avoiding going into debt. Financial stability helps you survive in the long run, as you’ll be more able to recognize problems and handle unexpected events. Every EntreLeader understands the importance of earning the respect of her employees. But what is the most effective way to earn respect? Here are a few pointers. First, make sure you always reward your staff appropriately for their hard work. A company's compensation system reflects a leader’s values. If you compensate your team fairly, they'll feel not only appreciated but also will work harder for you and the company. And if you offer your staff incentives, such as commissions or profit sharing, they'll be even more motivated to help your business grow. One company with a whopping $50 million in revenue employed some 120 workers. Yet despite the company’s successes, the CEO didn’t deem it necessary to pay even his top employees a salary of over $100,000. Unsurprisingly, these employees felt their work wasn’t being rewarded fairly, and started to leave for better offers. Eventually so many top employees left that the company had to shut its doors! If you treat your employees with dignity, they'll repay you with loyalty and motivation. So respect them and go out your way to please them – it's always worth it in the end. People just work harder for someone who treats them well! One of the author's employees, for example, sealed a million-dollar deal. The company's salary structure didn't stipulate that he should be rewarded, but the author rewarded him anyway. The author knew his employee would keep working hard if he showed how much he respected his work with a reward. The employee was so overjoyed that he wept! So when you hire the right people, you also need to build a culture of unity and loyalty. Your staff will perform better, and you'll enjoy much greater success. The key message in this book: If you want a successful company, be both an entrepreneur and a leader – an EntreLeader. Managing your team fairly and effectively is just as important as risk-taking and passionate deal-making! Define your company’s strategic plan, manage your time well, avoid debt and craft a thoughtful marketing strategy. Running a company is a challenging task, and only an EntreLeader is capable of success.

Yet for a majority of people, this is where daily, 9-to-5 work happens.  But the cubicle is more than a physical space. Monotonous, repetitive work done in a less-than-inspiring environment under the watchful eye of an insensitive manager – cubicle work life is something to escape from, not get trapped in. But what can you do? The answer is to get out! There is another way to work, and it’s to work for yourself. Self-employment is challenging, but if you connect with your passion and reawaken your creativity, chances are you’ve got a great business idea brewing inside of you. So enjoy these blinks and get ready to tear down those cubicle walls! In these blinks, you’ll discover how your body communicates that you need to change your job; why other people’s opinions keep us stuck in jobs we hate; and  how one woman’s experience can help you unleash your creativity. Are you working at the job of your dreams? Unfortunately, not many of us can say that we are.  You may have strong ideals about the kind of work you believe is valuable, but chances are that you’ve sacrificed these values more than once in the face of a regular paycheck.  We all have differing preferences for what we’d like to have at work. You might prefer to work in a sunny loft for a non-profit that has a welcoming culture, a lot of business integrity and scheduling flexibility.  Yet instead, you’re working at a desk in a cramped cubicle with coworkers who are just as grumpy as you are. What’s happening here? Having a job that doesn’t fit your values is like wearing a shoe that doesn’t fit. Say you’re looking for new running shoes to train for a marathon. If you wear a size eight, would you purchase a size six because you couldn’t find an eight and anyway, you liked the color? Of course not.  The reality is that some of us simply aren’t cut out to work in impersonal corporations under an autocratic manager. Software engineer and venture capitalist Paul Graham likens those employed in big companies to animals trapped in a zoo.  So what does that make the self-employed? Animals in the wild. Though life in the zoo might be more routine and safer than life in the wild, it’s simply not what animals do. The same applies to humans.  So no, you aren’t crazy for complaining about a secure job with great pay, benefits, clever coworkers and social status. It could be that your values and corporate values simply don’t fit. Many of us daydream about leaving our jobs, yet very few of us take the plunge.  If we’re so unhappy, what makes us stay put? There are three main factors to blame. The first of these is that we care more about what people think about us than about our own happiness.  Our social self almost always overpowers our essential self, and this is what keeps us in our tedious, terrible jobs. The social self is concerned with how our peers judge us, and our performance in roles and duties.  The essential self, on the other hand, listens to our emotions and feelings. This means that even if we’re incredibly enthusiastic about a new, solo business venture, our social self will hold us back and ensure we stay stuck in the daily grind.  We also fear leaving an unfulfilling job because of lessons we learned while growing up. Whether your parents said that “nice girls don’t play in rock bands” or “farm boys do not join the New York City Ballet,” such conditioning led you to fear a life outside of what is expected.  As friends and family attend the “right” schools and start working at the “right” companies, we often feel pressured to do the same.  On top of this, the fear of losing what we have is another powerful influencer over career decisions. The entrepreneurial path is notoriously risky. By following your passions, you could lose everything. It’s this sort of logic that keeps us in our hated day jobs.  The late comedian Chris Farley summed it up best while playing a skit character on Saturday Night Live: “My name is Matt Foley and I am a motivational speaker. I am 35, divorced and live in a van down by the river.”  This is the reality we think awaits us if we leave a stable job. We may desperately want to strike out on our own, but we barely have the confidence to do so.  Could you ever imagine working on something for 24-hours straight? Seems crazy, right? But if there’s one thing that can push you to the limits in your work, it’s passion.  Passion is, unsurprisingly, the key to success.  Keeping your passion stashed away inside of you while feigning enthusiasm about a current job is tiring. Rather than trying to close yourself off, it’s time to open up to new ideas and creative channels.  But how do you do this? There are three steps you should take.  Start by listening to your body. If you have a headache that won’t go away, trouble sleeping and perhaps digestive problems, don’t brush it off and think you’re fine. You aren’t!  Your body is telling you that your job and lifestyle simply aren’t the right fit for you. Listen to your body! Reconnect with your body through light exercise, meditation and deep breathing – and see what it has to say.  You can also open your mind by keeping it switched on and active, rather than using addictive substances such as cigarettes, alcohol and chocolate to numb yourself at the end of each day. If you need two or three glasses of wine every evening to unwind, something simply isn’t right.  Finally, start taking action. Spark your creative spirit and stimulate your mind with art classes, travel, a new language or even just by spending time in nature. Basically, doing anything that makes you feel like a child again is a surefire way to help you reconnect with your passions and find your energy.  This in turn will prepare you to seek out new opportunities in your professional life. Once you’ve got your creative juices flowing again, be sure no idea goes to waste! There’s nothing worse than having a flash of brilliance while in the shower then forgetting it a few hours later.  The solution? Write all of your ideas down! Consider spending the very first moments of each day writing, unlocking your creativity with what the author calls the morning pages. These are three pages of unedited, free-flow writing.  In other words, you should write whatever comes to you as you wake up. This helps unclutter your mind ahead of a busy day.  Lists are another great way to get creativity down on paper. It’s as simple as writing down all the things that you like. You can then divide these into different categories.  Topics you might find interesting could include cars, quantum physics and martial arts. Activities you enjoy doing might include writing, coaching and giving advice. Industries that you find exciting might be alternative energy, automobiles and product design. And products you like could include the iPhone, the Sony Playstation and Moleskine notebooks.  The items on your list might seem a little disjointed at first, but if you keep up with your lists, you may find a new business idea as you connect activities you like with exciting industries, or products you enjoy with topics you find stimulating.  For instance, you’re interested in cars and want to make the world a greener place – maybe combine these passions with writing, and pursue a freelance career in journalism or blogging to get your green environmental ideas about transportation out there! Out of all your potential ideas, how do you know which is the right one to pursue? It’s actually easier than you’d expect, if you follow American business consultant Jim Collins’s sweet spot rule.  The sweet spot should allow three different areas of interest to align, creating a great foundation for a successful business.  The first area is what people will pay you to do. In other words, an idea that is marketable. The second area is what you love doing, or an idea that allows you to pursue your passion. The third area is what you were born to do, or an idea that taps into your natural talents.   Let’s look a little closer at the first area. What makes an idea marketable? Well, it should solve a problem for your customers. By seeking out problems and inventing solutions for them, you may well uncover an innovative idea for a new initiative.  Say you’ve been waiting in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles for close to two hours. You’ll probably start asking yourself questions: Why do I have to stand in line for so long? Does my transaction really require another person to approve it? Is there any better way of doing this? Questions such as these may lead you to a business idea. How about an online platform for common motor vehicle transactions, such as registrations, transfer of ownership or declaring vehicle modifications? In fact, most DMVs in the United States have built independent businesses based on exactly this idea, creating websites to handle simple transactions quickly and conveniently, without long waiting times at the office! So you’ve got an idea that hits your sweet spot and even solves a problem or two. Now it’s time to refine, plan and prepare to put your business idea into action.  Or is it? Of course, you should do research before jumping off the entrepreneurial cliff. But the truth is that polishing a business idea to perfection isn’t always the best way to go. As they say, we learn from mistakes. So put your idea out there so you can learn! Some of the world’s most successful people got where they are today by jumping into the deep end of the business pool. You need to test your idea to figure out whether you’re really cut out for a particular line of business. So start small, and see how things go. For example, if you want to start blogging, don’t hesitate to publish your first work. Though it probably won’t be refined, you’ll at least have something to build on, and may even receive some feedback from your audience to help you improve.  The quicker you put new ideas out there, the quicker you’ll be able to improve on them. The quicker you’re able to improve, the more likely you are of becoming successful in a shorter period of time.  Here’s a great example of early testing, with the company PBworks, which was building a commercial real-time collaborative editing system. Creator Ramit Sethi wanted to get the platform out as fast as possible, so invited a group of programmers to a “Super Happy Dev House,” an event where hackers collaborated on the project from dusk until dawn.  The service was launched incredibly fast, building positive hype and increasing the number of users early on. Feedback also came quickly, so PBworks was able to work on its weak points and become even better within a shorter time span. The key message in this book: Don’t be afraid to leave your stable, well-paid cubicle job. In the office your life is in the hands of others, no matter how well you perform your role. Take your destiny into your own hands and follow your passions! Build a business that aligns with your personal values.  Actionable advice: Make sure your salary is in line with the market. When you are negotiating a salary, it’s necessary to look at market norms and make sure that what you are charging is in line. This applies particularly to women who are self-employed, as they are traditionally underpaid in comparison to men. Make sure that your talents are valued!

And then there’s the fear – the fear of being criticized, of coming up short and not being the success you dreamed of. But author and entrepreneur Paul Jarvis is here to tell you that you can push through these fears, and that there’s no time like the present to put those plans into action. With over 20 years experience as his own boss, and with numerous start-ups to his credit, Jarvis has learned a lot about entrepreneurship and the excuses people make to continue working for someone else. But if you want your hard work to benefit your dreams, rather than the dreams of someone else, then it’s time to push the excuses aside and get down to some real, meaningful work that reflects who you are as an individual. Jarvis doesn’t believe in advice, so these aren’t “rules.” Rather, they’re lessons that he’s learned over the course of his career. But if you’re thinking of starting your own business, there’s a good chance they’ll help your career as well. In these blinks, you’ll find out why it doesn’t hurt to be an imperfect yoga instructor; why a bold manifesto is good for business; and why theft is better than mimicry. If you were a schoolkid in the 1980s or 1990s, you may remember the Choose Your Own Adventure books, a series of adventure stories that allowed you to decide what the main character did or didn’t do. For instance, if you chose to go through the scary forest, you’d turn to a certain page; if you chose to go around the forest, however, you’d turn to another. When the author, Paul Jarvis, was a young boy, he loved these books, and as an adult he continued to choose his own adventure by deciding to be his own boss rather than working for someone else. After quitting college, Jarvis did work for someone else, as an employee at a web design company in Toronto, and he didn’t like it one bit. However, this experience taught him the ins and outs of running a web-based business – things he knew he wouldn’t learn in school. Sure, when you work for someone else, you’re not risking much and you may feel a sense of security, but it’s not very rewarding in the long run. In order to get the big reward you have to take the big risk and embark on your own adventure, which means doing something no one else is doing – something that speaks to who you are as an individual. As a web designer, Jarvis has met clients who point to someone else’s website and say, “I want the same site they have.” But what they don’t understand is that following someone else’s lead is just going to make them boring and forgettable. Following someone else’s path may seem like an appealingly safe way to go, but imagine following someone else’s treasure map. It may lead you to where the gold was, but that gold will be gone by the time you get there. So why settle for the leftover scraps that come with copying someone else when you can do your own thing and uncover your very own treasure? The universe rewards those who do their own thing in an authentic way while managing to help others. It’s true that corporations and schools often tell people to fall in line and be like everyone else, rather than promoting individualism and uniqueness. But the fact is that we’re all unique and, as we’ll see in the next blink, it pays to embrace our weirdness. There’s plenty of so-called “expert advice” out there that says it’s smart to try and fit yourself into some cookie-cutter business model. But Jarvis is here to tell you that such advice is bullshit. In fact, he hates advice altogether. That said, he does believe that the best way to be inspiring and attract people to your business is to be true to your unique self, and to be different than what’s already out there. In other words: be weird. Plenty of people have advised Jarvis to refrain from swearing around clients – telling him that it’s unprofessional. Yet he swears from time to time, and he’d rather be honest about who he is than be phony in order to please a client who would likely be a bad fit anyway. The truth is, clients will respond positively when they see that you’re authentic and honest in your desire to help them. If given the choice, people will always choose an authentic and weird human over a flawless and boring bot. Take yoga instructors, for example. There are a lot of yoga instructors out there who are indistinguishable from one another – each one seemingly enlightened and perfect. And then there’s Caren, a yoga teacher who talks openly about her experience with depression. An expert would probably say it’s bad business to tell potential clients that you’re not perfect, but Caren’s openness doesn’t turn people off. In fact, it attracts clients, who are drawn to her story and inspired by her authenticity. What really matters is that you identify your values and stay aligned with them. When you do this, you can rest assured that you’re doing meaningful, worthwhile work, no matter what anyone else says. For Jarvis, his values are doing good work that helps people while always pushing his creative limits. Some people align their values with making money and getting famous, but Jarvis is against this practice since fame and riches are external factors that are ultimately out of your control. While you can’t determine how many people are going to buy your next product, you can determine the amount of work and care you put into it. So even if you don’t immediately reach through-the-roof sales, you can rest easy that you succeeded on your terms if your product is well made and truly does a good job of helping people as intended. When you establish good internal values, meaning ones you can control, your sense of self-worth will also be in your control, as it should be. There are all kinds of learning preferences, and some people are perfectly suited to the structure that schools and universities provide. But sometimes there can be a limit to how much you can learn from reading or listening to a lecturer – you need to go out and learn by doing. Whatever your craft may be, learning by doing is the best way to develop and improve that craft. Jarvis doesn’t regret dropping out of college to work at a web design company because he knows that he learned a lot of valuable lessons on the job that he wouldn’t have learned at school. Only after spending a few years as the company’s creative director did he feel confident enough to venture forth and start his own business. Still, when he started out, Jarvis made a lot of mistakes. But these became valuable lessons that allowed him to improve –  and he wouldn’t learned them unless he was doing. Also, since putting out quality work is one of Jarvis’s core values, these mistakes became opportunities to improve the overall quality of his work. However, this doesn’t mean that you should keep pushing things forward if your business has flatlined or isn’t getting off the ground. If you find yourself stuck in a bad situation, don’t be stubborn and try to press on with business as usual. Instead, recognize it as a good time to stop what you’re doing, take a step back and reevaluate things. Jarvis found himself in this exact situation with his freelance web design business so he hit the pause button and asked himself how he could do a better job helping his clients. Sure enough, stepping back gave him enough distance from the problem to clearly see the path forward, which involved completely restructuring his practices and procedures. There are also steps you can take to reduce your chances of getting to such a point of stagnation that you need to hit that pause button. One of the better things to do is to keep experimenting, trying new things and staying up-to-date with what’s going on in your field. Once you’ve made the first step of having a great idea that speaks to who you are and what you value, it’s time to move on to the second step: overcoming the obstacles that are keeping you from realizing that idea. You may think that the obstacles are big and plentiful, but the good news is that many of them can be overcome by thinking differently and adjusting your outlook on the challenges ahead. For example, you or someone you know may be a perfectionist – someone who doesn’t like to take on a project unless they know it’s going to come out flawlessly. No one wants to put out bad work, but if everyone only put out work they believed was absolutely perfect, the marketplace would be pretty empty. In fact, it’s safe to say that absolute perfection doesn’t exist at all in the real world. It’s just a concept that keeps us from moving forward with a perfectly good idea. If perfection is a requirement for you, then you’ll most likely end up never having done anything, which is a far greater tragedy than producing something with a few flaws. There’s another concern, often associated with being a perfectionist. Something that can also act as an obstacle to getting your work done, and it has to do with being judged. These days, it’s hard to avoid criticism from anyone with a computer or smartphone. Every day, Jarvis gets a message, be it a tweet, an email or a one-star review, from someone who thinks his work stinks. He thinks of it as a virtual slap to the face, but it’s not something he’ll dwell on for too long. It’s just an unavoidable fact of life and you simply have to move on. It also stings to lose a follower or a subscriber, but there are also the days when you’ll gain new fans and five-star reviews from people who really appreciate your work. You need to focus on the good rather than get stuck obsessing about the bad. And here again is where it helps to have work that is aligned with your values. Since Jarvis’s work is all about sharing what he’s learned and trying to help others, he can rest easy knowing that his finished product met these values – despite what the haters might say. Success doesn’t eliminate a person’s fears. It just creates new worries, such as the fear of not living up to the previous success! So it’s safe to say that everyone has fears about putting their own work out into the world, no matter who they are. This is why it’s important to really care about what you do and to have those strong values in place. It may not make the fears go away, but it should reduce them, since you’ll be less invested in how others respond. Jarvis has plenty of fears. In fact, in one long blog post, he listed each of them. In response to this extensive list, one reader pointed out that fears are often a sign that you have things you cherish and don’t want to lose. So, in a way, fears are something to be grateful for! To push past your fears, you need courage. Now, some people confuse courage with fearlessness, but real courage is about acknowledging fear and pushing past it in order to do what needs to be done. To make this a bit easier for yourself, you can give yourself a series of small steps, since it’s always easier to make small steps than it is to make one big, scary leap. Among Jarvis’s many fears is a fear of crowds, especially performing in front of people and receiving criticism. So it may surprise you to learn that he’s also a touring musician in a band. Jarvis didn’t suddenly lose these fears in order to be a touring musician; he pushed through the fear in a series of small steps. First, he played music outside, performing in parks to passersby. Then he moved to open mic nights at local music venues. After that, he started booking gigs in clubs. After each step he had a realization that there really isn’t so much to worry about. Even after performances that Jarvis thought went terribly, he’s had fans come up and say it was his best show yet. What’s more, failure isn’t worth fearing anyway, since it’s part of the creative process for any entrepreneur and artist.    Think about it: no one has emerged with a great product or work of art without leaving behind a series of failures, accidents and mishaps. The important thing is to embrace these failures as important opportunities to learn, grow and get better. Fear of failure is just one poor excuse for not doing something you really want to do. The other big reasons are not having enough time and not having enough money, but these barriers are far from insurmountable. As far as time goes, you always have choices to make and you can always choose to prioritize one thing over another. So instead of spending time on social media, you can start writing your own book and, if you don’t have much money, you can self-publish it as an e-book, which is what Paul Jarvis did. Along with establishing your values, it’s also important to define your intentions, or why you want to do something in the first place. When you have a strong desire and pure intentions, it becomes easier to push through the fear and make the necessary sacrifices with your time and money. Ask yourself: Why do I want to do this in the first place? What do I want to accomplish? How does my product or service add value to the world? When you have good intentions, people will recognize it. And conversely, when you lie about your intentions, people will be able to tell. Just contrast the intentions of Blue Bottle Coffee with those of Starbucks. Blue Bottle’s mission statement clearly sounds like human beings who want to help, while Starbucks’s sounds like it was written by a faceless corporate committee. So fill your intentions with humor, passion and love – all the stuff that humans are made of and respond to. When you really believe and care about the unique work you’re sharing with the world, your personal story will likely show up in the end product. That is, your product will reflect who you are. And people are far more likely to be attracted to this kind of work than some generic copy of something else. But it also helps to use a rallying flag to get your audience’s attention. A rallying flag can be a number of things, but what it should never be is confusing or boring. It can be a bold mission statement, a manifesto, a video – anything that takes a stand, draws a firm line in the sand and says this is what you and your work represent, so come be part of the adventure! You’ve probably heard someone say it as a form of career advice: “Follow your passion.” It sounds nice, but, in reality, following your passion isn’t enough. You also need to put time and effort into developing your craft, generating as many ideas as you can and questioning whether your passion is aligned with your values. The better advice is to find your intersection, and this happens by knowing your passion and where it intersects with your skills and how those skills help others. For example, if you’re passionate about protecting the environment, and skilled at web design, your intersection with helping people, and thereby getting paid for your work, might be in designing websites for eco-friendly businesses. But knowing this is still only half the battle since you then need to come up with your rallying flag and get your audience as excited and passionate as you are. And then there’s the matter of following through, finishing your work and making it as good as it can be. This means staying focused on the real work and avoiding the many distractions that people commonly mistake as being part of the real work. A lot of people seem to think of self-promotion and maintaining an active social media presence as being a substantial part of their work, but this is a mistake. Promotion is secondary to the craft of doing the work. Ironically, if self-promoting individuals spent as much time developing their craft and doing the actual work as they do composing the perfect tweet, then they probably wouldn’t need to promote themselves so much! Doing fantastic work for a client is promotion in itself, since this client will most likely recommend you to everyone in their circle. Since Jarvis ranks the quality of his work very high in his values, he’s never had to spend one penny on advertising. Twitter and Facebook could vanish and his business would be unaffected. Finally, there’s one more piece of common advice that Jarvis questions: the use of goals. Jarvis is against goals, since they tend to lock you into a certain track that can keep you from experimenting and seeking out alternatives. Instead, Jarvis uses his values to guide him. Since his primary values are to “do great work” and “help people,” he’s free to explore every possible way of making this happen. Now that we’ve gotten the excuses out of the way, it’s time to stop procrastinating and start your own adventure. So let’s get moving on your great idea for a product or service that can truly help people and make the world a little bit better. If you need some inspiration to get started, it’s not a bad idea to look carefully at the work of people you admire. But keep in mind that there’s a big difference between copying, theft and mimicry. Copying can be very helpful in developing your craft. When Jarvis was starting out, he would recreate websites he liked as a way of learning techniques and how certain things were done. Then, he would see how he could make the re-created sites better, faster-running and more stylish. Copying was also a good way for him to learn how to mix multiple web design styles together. Theft can also be used as inspiration for your own work. Jarvis has stolen lots of designs and details found in art, nature, architecture and other places. These details are then incorporated and blended into his own work and made part of his own individual style. Chances are, if he told you about the idea he stole, you wouldn’t even recognize it in his own work, but it was an important part of the process nonetheless. Mimicry, on the other hand, is taking someone else’s idea and passing it off as your own, which is simply bad form. Everyone takes bits and pieces from other creators past and present – and sometimes we’re not even conscious of outside influence. But these inspirational ideas should be jumping-off points for making something unique and wholly your own. While it’s okay to look to the work of others for inspiration and ways to improve your own craft, it can also generate some bad feelings if you were to start comparing your work or your popularity against theirs. Ultimately, this kind of measuring-up isn’t going to do you much good. What really matters is how you feel about your work as it stands and not against someone else’s effort. So try to stay focused on the process since this is where the real, lasting reward is. If you pin all of your hopes on the final result, you’ll find that satisfaction is fleeting. You might feel good for a day, but then it’ll be time to move on to the next thing. When you’re focused on the process of making and doing good work, rewards will be there each and every day. No matter what kind of adventure you’re planning to start, it all begins by taking a moment to ask yourself some important questions: What are my intentions and motivations? What are my core values? With the answers to these questions you can create your rallying flag and a mission statement that will help guide your decisions. Getting a big project started can be overwhelming. So much so that it’s often filled with moments where you’ll be tempted to give up. So, to keep your momentum going, it’s good to figure out how you can break down the launch of the project into small, doable steps. Once you’re up and running, it’s important to avoid burnout by knowing when to say no. Time and energy are precious resources and they aren’t to be wasted on clients who don’t see eye-to-eye with your values. When you stretch yourself too thin, every project can suffer. Of course, we don’t always have the luxury of being able to turn clients away, but if you find yourself struggling to get clients, you can take advantage of anonymity with some bold experimentation. Keep in mind that both fame and obscurity come with pros and cons. With fame and success, there comes a lot of pressure to keep delivering and maintaining your reputation, while anonymity provides an exciting opportunity to experiment, fail, learn and develop your expertise in relative peace. When you gain some followers, it’s important to keep learning and stay flexible. Being an expert only means that others respect and value your opinion. To retain that status you need to stay on top of the developments in your field and accept the fact that it’s an ongoing process. Opinions can change as a person continues to develop and gain new insights. Finally, don’t give up. Even if you feel like you’ve failed so many times that you feel cursed, all it takes is one success to turn things around. On the bright side, you should know that it often feels darkest right before the dawn. So keep learning from your failures, making those adjustments and trying again. What do you have to lose? The key message in these blinks: There’s nothing like doing your own unique work that reflects your values. Exciting, innovative work comes from people who break free from bland corporate thinking and do their own thing. Everyone, even successful people, has fears about exposing themselves to criticism and failure, but these fears can be overcome. Failure and criticism are not the end – in fact, they can be helpful in providing ways to learn, pivot and continue creating even better work.  Actionable advice: Rather than wanting more money, want enough money. Once Jarvis makes enough money to cover his expenses for the year and put some money into savings, he stops taking on clients for the remainder of the year. This way, he might work for six months and then spend the next six months traveling, writing, making music, working on side projects and exploring his hobbies – some of which do end up earning him some extra cash.

You have to juggle many issues, such as budget, time frame, supplier contracts and team concerns. Luckily for you, you can refer to earlier projects to get an idea of best practices or trouble spots.  Or can you? If you’re working on a truly innovative project, this might be difficult – you and your team may be going where no one else has gone before. Other projects might be interesting but not helpful; where, then, can you turn for guidance to keep budgets trim and deadlines met? These blinks are your guide to managing innovative projects on deadline and under budget. They’ll show you how to carry your project to success, by following just a few rational and logical guidelines.  In these blinks, you’ll discover when “stormdraining” can be more useful than brainstorming;  how borrowing technology keeps NASA projects on time and under budget; and  why a US fighter jet project missed engaging the Soviet “threat” by a good decade.  When you head a creative project, plenty of challenges will come your way. Luckily, there’s a fail-safe method that innovative project managers can use to stay on track, and it’s called F.I.R.E. F.I.R.E. stands for Fast, Inexpensive, Restrained and Elegant. Everyone can use the F.I.R.E. method to improve their processes and achieve their goals. Make your project fast by dividing it into smaller tasks that can be completed quickly. Big projects often drag, and sometimes it’s hard to feel you’re making progress. When you design for yourself a smaller group of shorter tasks, you can focus on each task one at a time, and set clear, achievable deadlines.  This means you have to stick firmly to a schedule, however. And being fast isn’t just about working quickly – you have to focus as well on quality. If you work quickly but sloppily, you’ll only create more work for yourself further down the line. In the end, you won’t really have saved much time. Keep your project inexpensive by maintaining a small budget, and aim to solve problems with your smarts before throwing money at them. Inexpensive doesn’t mean cheap, however – it’s about efficiency. Learn to make the most out of what you have.  Being restrained is about staying in control. When you’re restrained, you don’t allow unexpected circumstances to determine the direction in which your project heads. Instead, you control the situation by holding regular meetings, maintaining short schedules, organizing small teams and keeping a tight budget.  Finally, being elegant is about focusing on simplicity. Remember: less is more. Simple projects, if done correctly, are better than complicated ones, as they’re easier to work on and ensure high-quality results.  Often when you have a question, you “ask” Google. And in turn, the Google search engine provides you with a host of answers, whether you’re looking to lose weight, fix a stove or consider space flight.  How does Google do this? The company’s engine simply searches through the tons of research stored online, considering the millions of questions that have already been answered. Innovation works the same way; you just need to know what to search for.  To find a solution to a specific problem, however, the first thing you need to do is generalize it. Here’s another handy method to help you do this.  TRIZ is an acronym that describes a Russian method of inventive problem-solving. This method explains how any technical problem can be solved in four steps.  First, you identify your specific problem. Second, you generalize it. Third, you find a general solution to the general problem. Fourth, you use the general solution to develop a specific solution to your specific problem. That’s TRIZ! Let’s say you’re trying to design a larger engine for a more powerful airplane. You want the plane to fly further and higher, but it can’t lift off properly because it’s now heavier. That’s your specific problem.  Next, you focus on generalizing your problem, which in this case, would be a problem of the plane’s power-to-weight ratio. Once you find a general solution that addresses this, you can figure out how to apply this general solution to the design of your specific plane.  When solving problems, you should also identify your needs. It’s not always obvious what resources you have and which new resources you might need to complete your task.  If you’re trying to design a plane engine, you probably have tons of different materials available to you – but which ones would work the best? Once you identify that you need a lighter material, you can focus your efforts on finding it.  Have you ever tried to experiment with a favorite recipe, changing details here or there, and ended up with something you had to throw out? Sometimes it’s best to stick to the original recipe. Innovative projects can work the same way. When you have a time frame and a budget, try not to deviate from your plan, as you’ll just trip yourself up if you decide along the line to complicate things.  In 1981, US engineers began work on the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jet, an advanced piece of machinery conceived to fight Soviet technology. The project however was completed in December 2005 – years after the Soviet Union had collapsed.  So what happened with the project? The F-22 project ran into trouble in 1989 when designers extended the deadline for its completion by six months. They wanted the fighter jet to be “perfect,” so they kept tweaking features, and in the process, adding more costs and further delays.  As a result, the project kept changing to accommodate the added functions, and delays eventually snowballed until the project was a good ten years late.  You can avoid this! Stick firmly to a schedule and budget once they are set. Don’t aim to include every possible feature in a product or project. Try to make something that solves your particular problem, or your project will become irrelevant, just like the F-22.  While designers toiled on the soon-to-be-useless F-22, another invention surpassed it: the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or as we know it today, the drone.  A drone embodies the F.I.R.E. method: it is fast, inexpensive, restrained and elegant.  The drone project succeeded where the F-22 failed because the project as a whole was focused on answering a specific question in a short time period and on a limited budget. The Dragon Eye drone, for instance, only has one function: surveillance. It is also inexpensive; a Dragon Eye can be produced for roughly $60,000. When you hear the word “innovation,” you might assume it describes something complicated and expensive. That’s not necessarily the case, however. The US space agency NASA shows why.  The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has launched many innovative missions, given its dedication to simplifying and accelerating projects.  In 1999, for instance, NASA began a spacecraft project called Stardust, aiming to collect particles from the tails of comets in the galaxy and to bring them back for study.  NASA set a tight schedule and budget for Stardust, and completed it on time and under budget, for some million dollars less than what the team had been allocated.  How did they achieve such success? The Stardust team had a clear set of mission requirements, and members focused on the three most important tasks: encounter the comet; collect 1,000 particles; and bring the particles back home.  There were other goals (such as photographing the comet) but these goals were merely desirable – meaning they were secondary to the project’s three main goals.  The success of Stardust also illustrates the importance of focusing innovation to specific needs.  NASA could have built all the elements of the Stardust project from scratch, but the team decided to keep things simple. Project manager Ken Atkins cut costs by using tools developed for previous missions. Stardust’s Motorola Radio, for instance, was originally designed for the 1998 Mars Surveyor mission.  Using established solutions allowed the team to focus efforts on developing tools they didn’t have. In fact, the only real innovation that came from the project was a material for collecting particles, called aerogel. The rest of the project creatively used innovations from the past!  Imagine how awkward it would be to wear every piece of clothing you own. It’s nearly impossible, and even if you did succeed, you’d just look ridiculous.  One shirt, one pair of pants: it’s better to keep things simple.  Innovation is the same. You are guaranteed to stumble if you insist on too much of it for yourself or your project. Keeping it simple doesn’t just look better, however; it’s cheaper and faster, too.  Google’s Chromebook is a good example of this. The laptop comes with only the most commonly used Google features, like searching the internet or using Google Drive.  While Google could have outfitted its laptop with every feature it offers, it would have just cost the company more money and taken more time to develop. A few extra features weren’t enough to justify costs and delays.  Finding the right balance of complexity is called stormdraining. Stormdraining is the opposite of brainstorming: it’s about letting go of concepts or features that don’t provide significant benefit to your project.  To stormdrain, you locate the midpoint between simplicity and complexity; and this point will vary depending on the project. Start by removing one feature from your product at a time. If the system still works, take out another piece. Keep going until you can’t strip any more features and still have a functioning product.  This process takes time and creativity, but it’s much more efficient than building a product that is unnecessarily complex and expensive!  So remember to be critical of your project – get rid of anything that eats up resources and doesn’t provide significant reward. Focus your efforts on developing the tools and products you really need.  The key message in this book: Effective innovation is about focusing energy and resources on your most important tasks. You need to work fast, keep your project inexpensive and stay on track by restraining your budget and time frame. Aim to produce something elegant, not something overly complex. When you streamline your efforts with the F.I.R.E. method, you won’t just finish your project on time, you’ll produce something of higher quality, too.  Got feedback?

Ferracone","summary":"Are you familiar with the notion of aligned pay? If not, here’s a chance to get acquainted with an important element in business compensation. Aligned pay has to do with the amount of compensation a company pays its executives. And crucially, that amount, whether stocks, bonuses or otherwise, needs to be fair. But what is fair? These blinks will help you better understand what you should do when setting executive compensation and show you how you can bring your company’s pay scales back to earth. In these blinks, you’ll learn when a generous compensation package does more harm than good; which factors you should consider when setting executive compensation; and why, for successful executives, cash is just one element of a great position. Imagine you’re an account manager on a team of three employees. Even though you all work equally diligently, you find out that your two colleagues are paid a higher salary than you. Such a situation would be unfair, right? Unfair pretty much explains the state of executive compensation today. Executives are routinely overcompensated, and compensation plans seldom take into account CEO performance. Consider that John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco Systems – one of the world’s biggest telecom companies – each year “earned,” in addition to his $300,000 salary, from $5 million to $6 million worth of stock options and a $400,000 bonus. That’s way too much money – no executive can perform that well! But performance isn’t all a compensation plan should consider to be fair. It also should reflect what other CEOs earn in the same market. Industry standards vary, and each industry is subject to different external forces. For instance, the energy sector is sensitive to oil prices, while the tech industry reacts to inventory levels in the IT supply chain. Such external factors are important, as they can affect the overall performance of any executive. That’s why it’s important for CEO pay to reflect the compensation of peers in the same industry. This way, if an oil crisis drives prices through the roof, the CEO of an energy firm won’t be blamed for the company’s poor returns. Even if the CEO’s performance was above reproach, it wouldn’t make sense to base the executive’s compensation on that of technology CEOs working in a booming market. We all make decisions on a whim. As a result, we set goals that we can’t keep, and thus abandon those goals without thought. This sort of behavior works to distort executive compensation schemes. Decisions made randomly and outside original plans undermine fair pay strategies. Here’s why. Executive compensation should be based on a plan that dictates how much a person’s pay will change based on certain future events, such as a company merger. Such plans are obviously set well in advance; yet even so, events or arbitrary decisions can easily unhinge a well-made plan. For instance, let’s say a sitting CEO decides to retire after 20 years. While her contract already had a specific plan set out in case of retirement, the company board, on a whim, decides to grant the CEO extra stock options. The result? A far too generous compensation plan! In a similar way, adjusting compensation based on economic events without considering a company’s long-term business strategy will also lead to compensation that is unfair. This is why, instead of reacting to externalities and shifting plans, companies should always stick with the established plan and overall corporate strategy. Here’s a telling example. One company decided to change its executive pay scheme from a generous package including a base salary, bonuses and stock to just payment in stock – a choice that resulted in a dramatically lower total compensation. Why the change? The company made the decision in 2008, the year of the global financial crisis. Executives were responding to external events and ignoring overall business strategy. So now you know if you don’t stick to a plan, your compensation scheme will suffer. Have you ever heard the term illusory superiority? This is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual believes that his successes are a result of his hard work but his failures the fault of external forces. The same tendency can apply to companies. Corporations often believe that management is cleverer, more capable and generally “better” than employees at lower levels. This belief translates into executives earning far more than they really should. As a result, while a company with mediocre management may perform well just because the overall economy is robust, executives will still “earn” a bonus as a reward. Yet that same company will attribute any difficulties to other factors, such as an overall economic slowdown – not to company leadership! Another assumption that stilts executive pay is applying a one-size-fits-all mentality to compensation methods. This was the case in the 1990s and 2000s when many firms across the United States believed that executives of publicly traded companies should be paid similarly to managers at top private equity firms. This was a huge mistake; public and private firms are not the same beast. For instance, the evaluation of a public company is determined on a daily basis in the open market. Executives of public firms need to satisfy the demands of shareholders over an extended period, independently of when they purchased stock. Privately held companies, on the other hand, give executives a fraction of company equity when they come on board, which they can sell at a later date. Failing to account for this difference means that executives in publicly traded companies were overcompensated. They were compensated on a compensation model designed for short time periods (the private firms) when they should’ve been compensated based on a longer-term strategy that public firms require. We often think that there’s no problem money can’t solve, especially when it comes to compensation. If you pay someone a sufficient amount of cash, that person will strive to perform well, period. As a result, executive committees tend to overpay executives just to keep them in the top office, even if it means creating economic chaos within the company. During the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, some companies, fearing executive flight, refrained from cutting high executive salaries even as company revenue plummeted. Worse was that some companies promised executives generous stock option packages to stay the course, even though doing so would cause the company severe economic stress. Such decisions are unreasonable, as they inevitably lead to a misallocation of resources. Money used for executive pay could be channeled toward more productive projects, such as research and development. In fact, money is rarely as essential to retaining top talent as companies think. While many companies believe compensation is the greatest motivating factor, it’s just one of many elements that make an executive feel satisfied with her position. Other factors include how challenging the job is, how much the position allows her to grow professionally and whether and her reputation will improve with the new job. In fact, the majority of people hired for top positions aren’t interested in just money. Rather, such executives come on board because they believe in the work the company does, the vision it has and the people who work there. They want to help cement the company’s place in history. As a result, few executives change jobs for a bump in pay. When they do leave, it’s usually to take the next career step. We now know that executive pay is plagued by fairness problems. But what can be done? Just like a street map tells you whether to turn right or left, an alignment report can help guide your decisions regarding executive compensation. This report helps you determine whether a particular level of compensation is “aligned” with an executive’s overall value. An alignment report shows how much value an executive creates for a company and determines how much the executive should be paid relative to competitors in the market. A report might compare Company X to Company Y, for example, two companies involved in the auto industry. In 2015, Company X performed well under talented leadership, increasing revenue by 23 percent; its CEO was paid $180,000. That same year, Company Y, of comparable size and market share to Company X, didn’t do as well. Revenue grew by 8 percent; its CEO was paid $175,000. By comparing performance and industry, it’s plain to see that Company Y’s CEO was overcompensated. An alignment report can also show you if a given compensation design is fair. Compensation design is the way a company decides how its executives are paid, whether through a system of bonuses, stock grants or a combination thereof. To remain fair, such a design should compensate an executive according to performance relative to other executives in the same field. Thus if most CEOs at competing companies are paid a fixed monthly salary, your CEO is overpaid if he’s receiving a fixed monthly bonus on top of his salary – that is, as long as he’s generating the same amount of value as other CEOs in the same industry. Simply put, to determine whether executive compensation is fair, consider the value created by your executives and compare it to that created by those at competing firms. The key message in this book: Executive pay is out of hand, and something needs to be done. For the compensation of top management to be fair, it should be based on performance and be relative to that of executives in similar positions and at similar companies, catering to similar markets.

His long career at the head of the ever expanding Virgin business empire has made him a modern day business legend and a go-to person for anyone wishing to learn what makes a truly great entrepreneur and how to keep a business thriving in a constantly changing world. In this follow up to his classic 1998 biography, Losing My Virginity, we pick up the thread and get Branson’s own version of the events that have shaped Virgin, and himself, since then; from Virgin Atlantic’s epic battle with British Airways, disrupting the cellphone market with Virgin Mobile and Branson’s highly personal mission to take people into space with Virgin Galactic. In these blinks, you’ll learn: that the best kind of marketing is fun and cheeky; how we may someday thank a paper napkin for space travel; and why none of Branson’s successes would have been possible without Mom. In 1999, Richard Branson wasn’t sure what lay ahead. The trendsetting, billionaire entrepreneur had just wrapped up his latest hot air balloon adventure, attempting to travel all the way around the world only to end up in need of rescue near the Hawaiian Islands. At this time, Branson’s Virgin Group was on the verge of being the global brand he’d always dreamed of. And while there had been missteps along the way, such as the failed attempts during the 1990s to get into the cola, vodka and cosmetics markets, he was constantly learning and becoming more focused on what exactly made a perfect fit for the Virgin Group. One of the companies that Branson fought hardest for is Virgin Atlantic, the international airline whose history shows how determined Branson can be to compete. Virgin Atlantic was founded in the early 1980s, and as with most of Branson’s projects, it was born in an attempt to offer people a better experience. In this case, an alternative to British Airways (BA), which wielded an extremely powerful influence at London’s Heathrow Airport but offered bad food, bad entertainment and bad service. But BA would not go down without a fight. Ever since Virgin Atlantic started doing business, BA has tried to squeeze it out of the competition, even using “dirty tricks” that involved printing libelous remarks about the company. Though the libel suit against BA was settled with Branson being awarded damages, he prefers to win simply by being the best airline in the business, not by being in the courtroom. Branson is also always keen to improve and take a shot at his competition. At one point Virgin Atlantic began offering in-flight massages. Branson advertised this by putting up a sign at Heathrow that read, “BA Don’t Give a Shiatsu.” And when BA was spending huge amounts sponsoring the London Eye in the 1990s, and running into all kinds of technical problems that left the giant ferris wheel stranded on its side, Branson jumped at the chance to hire a blimp displaying the message, “BA CAN’T GET IT UP.” Cheekiness and great service; that’s the Virgin way. Richard Branson was one of the first Britons to use a cellular phone back when they were the size of your head. And though few then would have guessed they’d eventually be the preferred method of communication, by the turn of the century it was clear they were here to stay. But how did Branson get involved in the mobile phone market? It all came down to one expensive telephone bill. Branson’s business partner Will Whitehorn showed up one day with a prize: British Telecom had awarded him the honor of having the most expensive phone bill in Britain. This got Branson thinking: in 1998, mobile phone carriers were making a killing with expensive and lengthy contracts that customers had no choice but to accept. That year, phone sales reached $162.9 million, which was more than double the year before. This is the kind of scenario that Branson loves to work with as it presents an opportunity for him to come up with a better service. So he founded Virgin Mobile, partnered with Deutsche Telekom, the parent company of T-Mobile, and reduced costs by using their pre-existing network. Virgin Mobile then offered pay-as-you-go plans, letting customers pay just for the time they used rather than get locked into expensive contracts. At the time, Branson had 381 Virgin Megastores, which were perfect locations to sell Virgin Mobile phones to the target audience, young people who wanted their own phone but didn’t need big bills or confusing contracts. The strategy worked. By November 2000, Virgin Mobile UK had 500,000 subscribers, won a Network of the Year award and had already been estimated as having a value of £1.36 billion. Soon, the service was reaching Australia, the United States and Asia, while Virgin Mobile UK became the fastest growing mobile startup in UK history. As for Virgin Mobile USA, it reached a billion in revenue in only three and a half years and continues to grow. Richard Branson gets ideas pitched to him all the time. Many don’t fit the Virgin brand, but sometimes they’re just perfect, like the time he was pitched the idea for Virgin Active. Gym membership is another service that people often complain about but essentially accept: the equipment is old, the locker rooms are tiny, and the sign-up fees and membership prices are ridiculous. In other words, it’s the perfect market for Virgin to enter and improve, but it almost didn’t happen thanks to a disastrous beginning. After two years of preparation, the flagship gym was nearly ready to open in August 1999 when it caught fire, causing a significant delay. The location was Preston, Lancashire, especially sought out for its demographics. Nowadays it’s common to use technology to pinpoint desirable locations for a business, but in 1999 this was cutting-edge work by Frank Reed and Matthew Bucknall, the two brains behind the Virgin Active concept. They also designed a fantastic facility: a big spacious gym with great atmosphere; showers that were better than anything people had at home; attention to the smallest details, like towels being ready and available for people and the pool being the right temperature. But it all literally went up in smoke, and they had to pay staff while no money was being made. Luckily, though, while the gym was being repaired the staff remained genuinely enthusiastic and did a great job of promoting and keeping the business in the minds of the community. The main attraction was that it would be affordable. The local competing gym, LivingWell, was charging £300 just to sign up! At Virgin Active, there were no outrageous membership fees or long-term contracts. So when the doors finally did open, the customers were still there and they now had a gym with which they could fall in love. Just like British Airways, many services in England were traditionally run by the government. For phones, you had British Telecom, and for trains you had British Rail. This is on top of British Gas, British Steel and British Coal. But Richard Branson was set to change this for rail, ever since he’d experienced the famous bullet train ride from Tokyo to Kyoto in 1991. When the Department of Transportation privatized British Rail and invited businesses to bid to run parts of the system, Virgin Trains was ready. It wasn’t easy. Introducing new and better trains meant upgrading and installing new infrastructure that ended up costing four times as much as predicted. But eventually the two parties reached a deal, and by the early 2000s, Virgin Trains was operating its new West Coast Main Line service. Improvements were apparent right away. On a test run of the new Pendolino train that Branson introduced to the United Kingdom, the London to Manchester route was 15 minutes faster. And in the first week, 82 percent of trains were on time, with only four cancellations – and it just got better from there. Virgin Trains improved their part of the messy, poorly scheduled nationalized rail service. And as a result, the number of passengers has nearly tripled, and the network is booming. Some people, such as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, see these bigger crowds as a reason for Britain to return to nationalization. Corbyn even released a video in 2016 of himself sitting on the floor in an overcrowded Virgin Train to prove his point. But the video, Branson claimed, was misleading: there were 140 seats available on the train, and Corbyn ended up sitting in one of them after his video shoot. But he also simply missed the point. More people are using trains because of the improvements made over the past 15 years. Meanwhile, 65 brand new and improved Azuma trains are being introduced soon. And as always, Virgin Trains will be making every effort to improve in every possible way. One of Richard Branson’s dearest friends was Nelson Mandela, a rare sort of person who could walk into a room, transform its energy and bring a smile to everyone’s face. After Mandela died in 2013, it was difficult for Branson to adjust to a life without this tremendous force for good, but he’s forever grateful that he got to work alongside him as part of Virgin Unite. Virgin Unite is a charity that Branson developed with the intent of bringing together different leaders in philanthropy. The basic idea is that those who want to make a difference can make an even greater impact by joining forces. And at the heart of Virgin Unite is a group of knowledgeable advisors and leaders Branson calls “the Elders,” inspired by the concept of village elders. Nelson Mandela was Branson’s first choice for an Elder, and his second was UN Secretary Kofi Annan. Once on board, Branson let Mandela create a list of 12 other peers he believed would be great assets to their cause. Virgin Unite and the Elders had no specific goal other than making the world a better place. Branson wanted a group of powerful independent minds who would be able to respond to a crisis faster than the bureaucracy of the UN would allow. Mandela’s list included former US president Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu, as well as Ireland’s former president, Mary Robinson, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh. Everyone was united in their desire to improve the state of human rights around the world, and it was inspiring to have these great minds sharing ideas and traveling to places like Darfur, Somalia, Palestine, North Korea and Russia. These are just some of the places where human rights violations are ongoing, and Virgin Unite needs the world’s brightest minds and most powerful humanitarians to work together on a mission to find solutions to these crises. Sometimes you have to sell one concern to keep another going. This was the case in 1992 when Richard Branson sold Virgin Records to support Virgin Atlantic, and in 1999 when he sold 49 percent of Virgin Atlantic to kickstart the Virgin Active gyms. But one sale really hurt: the Virgin America airline, which began in 2004. At the time, airlines around the world were still figuring out how to move forward after the events of 9/11, and most experts thought a new airline wouldn’t stand a chance, even if it were a recognizable brand like Virgin. However, Branson noticed that most American airlines were offering services and experiences that passengers endured rather than enjoyed. So he knew there was a perfect opening for the Virgin brand to enter and offer something better. It took three years before Branson collected enough petitions and convinced enough people at the US Department of Transportation to approve Virgin America for take off, and it wasn’t long before the new airline was winning over the public. Virgin America was the first to offer WiFi in every plane and on-demand dining accompanied by great entertainment choices. And as a result, publishing giant Condé Nast named Virgin America the best domestic airline for a remarkable ten years straight. But Branson by law could not keep full control of Virgin America. Since Virgin America was American and Branson was not, he was limited to no more than 25 percent of the company’s voting shares. So when the airline was made public in 2014, it wasn’t long before other airlines tried to buy it up. Just 18 months later Alaska Airlines made an offer of $2.6 billion that the board at Virgin America unanimously approved. The sale broke Branson’s heart since it turned out that Alaska had no interest in keeping the Virgin spirit alive. In fact, they’re planning on completely retiring the brand by 2019. As some angry customers have rightly pointed out, now it’s just “another bullshit airline.” What do you do when one of the worst businesses in town asks you to partner up? This was the predicament Richard Branson faced when Simon Duffy, the CEO of NTL, the international cable communications giant, approached him about joining Virgin Media. NTL was commonly referred to by customers as “NT Hell” and ranked at the bottom of every customer service survey. Since the Virgin brand was built on great customer service, this wasn’t the kind of partnership Branson would normally get involved with, but Duffy’s idea was too good to pass up. It was a chance to get Virgin Media into people’s homes for cable service, internet service and both cellular and landline phones. Duffy called it a “Quad Play” package, but this being Virgin, Branson preferred the more irreverent name, “Four Play.” A quick look at NTL’s customer service revealed the problem right away: all the service operators were using scripts. Branson tore the scripts up and got everyone on board with the Virgin way: loosen up, be yourself and never try to help a customer by using a script. Branson was excited to be taking care of so many customer needs with one service, and before long customers were pretty satisfied as well. Virgin Media became the number one broadband provider and the second biggest pay-TV and home-phone provider in the United Kingdom. The only person who wasn’t happy was Rupert Murdoch, who owns Sky TV, the United Kingdom’s largest pay-TV provider. Murdoch bought up a 17.9 percent stake worth £940 million in popular British commercial station ITV just to block Virgin Media from merging with it. Unfortunately for Murdoch, the Office of Fair Trading didn’t take too kindly to this violation and forced Sky to sell over 10 percent at a £348 million loss. Murdoch also owns media company News Corp, which has a subsidiary that was found to be responsible for hacking the phones of Branson, his family and neighbors in 2011. As a small consolation after the privacy violation was sorted out, Branson received a letter of apology. As time has passed, the Virgin brand has become clearer for customers and Branson himself. Nowadays, most of what Virgin offers falls into one of four categories: travel and leisure, telecom and media, music and entertainment, and health and wellness. But there’s a fifth category that ties all these together: money. And that’s where Virgin Money comes in. If you had told the 19-year-old, spliff-smoking Branson, who had just started Virgin Records as a mail order service in the back of a magazine, that one day he’d be a banker, he might have asked you what you were smoking. However, when the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 left the United Kingdom badly shaken, it was clear that financial services were another area where customers were being royally screwed over. Not only that, but one of the United Kingdom’s most iconic banks, Northern Rock, was in desperate need of saving. Branson took this as a cue to spend £1.25 billion to rescue Northern Rock and become a banker. But the origins of Virgin Money actually go back much further to 1997, when Branson was sold on a simple idea: no one trusts banks, but they trust Branson and the Virgin brand. So, for 20 years now Virgin Money has been offering credit cards, savings and investment services. Now, with Northern Rock, the service has grown into full banking services, including mortgages. But what Branson really delights in are the Virgin Money Lounges. These are lounges around Britain where Virgin Money members can relax for a moment during a busy day, enjoy some free refreshments or a little peace and maybe meet up with a friend. They’re community spots that offer a little breathing room in today’s hectic, fast-paced world. Plus, the Virgin Money branches with a lounge do 300 percent more business than those without. Clearly they’re working well! Many dream of being an astronaut when they are young, but few people are as dedicated to making that dream come true as Richard Branson. For a long time, Branson thought this dream might remain a fanciful wish until he accidentally ran into aerospace engineer Burt Rutan at a hangar in the Mojave desert and heard his plan for SpaceShipOne. In 2003, 12 years of searching later, Branson found a workable spaceship design drawn by Rutan on the back of a paper napkin. His amazing design led to the formation of Virgin Galactic, which became one of the main focuses of Branson’s life for the next 14 years. Branson immediately showed the design to his friend Paul Allen at Microsoft, who agreed to chip in $25 million to build the first spaceship, and its mothership, WhiteKnightOne. The basic idea is that the mothership takes the spaceship up to a certain height and releases it. The shuttle then launches up into space where it spends some time before gliding back down to earth. Things were going smoothly until the fourth powered test flight for SpaceShipTwo in 2014. After the mothership released it up in the skies, a lever was pulled too soon, opening the ship’s tail to a glide position just as it was about to launch. As a result, massive force broke the entire structure apart, killing one pilot, Mike Alsbury, and injuring the other, Peter Siebold. The press had a field day with the tragic incident, and it almost stalled the project completely. Completely inaccurate headlines like “Eyewitness Reports Explosion after Ignition” were run by supposedly reputable agencies like the Associated Press. In truth, there was no problem with the engine or any explosion at all. The engine and gas tanks were found in one piece, and the investigation eventually revealed the true cause, though the media were still eager to paint the project in a bad light. As a result, difficult questions had to be asked. Could Virgin Galactic survive this tragedy? Unlike the SpaceX program being developed by entrepreneur Elon Musk, Branson’s Virgin Galactic isn’t aimed at reaching Mars. Branson wants to take people to space so they can see earth from a new perspective, which is an experience they’ll carry with them for the rest of their lives. You can already make a reservation to be one of the first astronauts, and Branson is hopeful that commercial trips will soon take place. There’s even a new SpaceShipTwo, which resumed testing in February 2016. It took time to build it and to reassess the project in general after the accident, but things are now back on track, and commercial flights will be underway in the near future. In fact, on December 5, 2016, the fifth powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo went off perfectly. But though Virgin Galactic is pressing on, the 2014 crash did cause Branson to question his motives – something everyone should do from time to time. Some people were saying that the pilot’s death should be blamed on Branson’s ego. But Branson saw this for what it was – bad reporting – and he has only become more determined than ever to reach his goal. It took time to mourn the loss of Mike Alsbury, but there was never any doubt among the engineers and team behind Virgin Galactic that the best way to honor the loss was to learn from what happened and move forward. Space exploration is for the benefit of humankind, not personal glory. For Branson, as well as his peer Elon Musk, picking up where NASA left off on space travel is about reaching new frontiers and showing the world the endless possibilities that lie ahead. There is a quote from the brilliant physicist Stephen Hawking, the only person to be offered a free ticket, which sums up Virgin Galactic well. He said, “[Virgin Galactic] has my utmost respect for enabling more of humanity to experience the true wonder of space.” While helping the public see the wonders of space is certainly a big project, Branson still finds time to help out fellow entrepreneurs. One of the projects he’s most passionate about is Virgin Startup, which was created to help innovative people get the money they need to turn their ideas into reality. Branson knows he was fortunate to have parents who supported him unconditionally when he was starting out as a teenager with his Student magazine and then Virgin Records. In fact, his mother once gave him £100 when he was flat broke. Without this gift, he might never have built his global empire. Branson wants others to have the same opportunities he had, so he has been lobbying the British government to put aside some of the money it uses for student loans into a Youth Investment Fund to help young entrepreneurs. This is how Virgin Startup began, as a way to get business loans to young people who don’t yet have the kind of collateral that regular banks require. As of May 4, 2016, Virgin StartUp has provided over 1,000 loans in less than three years, which adds up to around £10 million in funding and tens of thousands of hours in mentoring. But that’s not all Branson’s been up to. Another project he’s excited about is OneWeb. This is the brainchild of Greg Wyler, a technological innovator who plans to launch an interconnected system of satellites that would provide broadband internet connection to the entire world, including the four billion people who currently have no connection. This isn’t just a matter of getting more people on social media sites; it’s about providing people with the means to help themselves out of poverty and access basic internet coverage. And it’s an idea that fits perfectly with Virgin Galactic since the mothership, WhiteKnightTwo, is equipped with LauncherOne, which can send a 500-pound satellite into orbit much more easily than any current land-based launching system. Currently, OneWeb is on target to become active in 2019, at which point we’ll have a communications network that is ten times bigger than anything we’ve seen before. Richard Branson is the first to admit that he sometimes has a hard time staying neutral, especially when people are spreading falsehoods and misinformation about topics that are close to his heart, like climate change, prison reform, HIV/AIDS prevention and human rights. It’s no secret that he can cause a stir. Branson has spent a lot of time in South Africa trying to provide access to HIV/AIDS medication and slow the spread of this preventable disease. So it angered Branson in 2014, when the South African health minister publicly stated that a mixture of beetroot, potatoes, garlic and lemon was a fine treatment. Branson made a public statement, calling it a genocidal crime for the health minister and South African President Thabo Mbeki to continue denying proper treatment and real medication to the country’s citizens. These remarks opened a fruitful dialog between Branson and Mbeki, though the president was forced to resign before he could make the improvements they’d been planning, which included the opening of a publicly funded Centre for Disease Control. Other subjects on Branson’s mind are climate change and prison and drug reform. It’s sad that the scientific facts of climate change have become politicized, but the Virgin Group is still dedicated to replacing fossil fuels. And it’s also a shame that $100 billion is spent each year enforcing drug laws, while the criminal drug industry remains a strong $320 billion-a-year enterprise with no signs of being slowed down by the war on drugs. Branson points to Portugal’s decriminalization of drugs as a model. The Portuguese now treat drug addiction as a public health issue and, as a result, heroin addicts are rejoining society rather than crowded prisons. There’s still a lot of work to do, and Branson is full of passion for these causes. The sky is no longer the limit for what can be accomplished. The key message in this book: Since the fledgling days of Virgin Records in the 1970s, Branson has continued to find ways of providing exceptional customer service and experiences. Wherever there’s room for improvement, Branson is eager to enter the market and get stuck in. But it’s not just airplanes and entertainment, with charitable organizations like Virgin Unite, Branson is dedicated to making the world a better place though prison and drug law reform, reducing carbon emissions and fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa. Actionable advice: Take notes. Branson often reminds his colleagues that no one is above taking notes, and he is always stupefied at CEOs and executives who refuse to take out the old pen and paper to jot down ideas. In his research, he’s found that the executives who take notes are more productive than the ones who don’t since they’re more apt to remember those fleeting moments when a brilliant plan reveals itself.

If you start a company, one day you’ll probably leave it. Yet leaving isn’t just as easy as walking out the door. What can you do to make your exit something that’s a positive for the company and not the start of a period of chaos? Will you sell your stake, or liquidate? Hand over the reins of the company to a child or your spouse? These blinks outline the steps that great entrepreneurs take when they decide to exit a company, all with the goal of not only helping your business but also improving your life. After reading these blinks, you’ll know why you should start thinking about leaving your company right now; why you’re never too busy to ponder an exit strategy; and whether selling out to your employees makes good sense. In business, if you ever start to think you're invincible, stop. All companies close and every company owner has to make an exit eventually. When it comes time to leave, you need to think about your own future just as much as the future of your organization. You have to ask yourself questions, like “Who do I want to be?” and “What do I want out of life?” The answers to these questions will help you figure out your next step. It's essential to plan for your own future. Don’t be like the business owner who didn’t anticipate a financial shortfall and was forced to sell his company quickly. The fallout from this mess resulted in the owner dealing with a failed marriage and the loss of close colleagues, too. If the owner instead had planned ahead early, he might have avoided such an unhappy ending. A good exit strategy isn't just important for you but it’s vital to your company as well. Try to imagine your business functioning after you leave. You'll probably discover some trouble spots where process or organization might suffer without your influence. Once you fix these problems, you'll actually raise your company's market value! So think carefully about your company's financial state and its long-term goals. You'll eventually start to view your company as a product itself. Ray Pagano, for example, was able to make a successful exit from his security camera business. He started preparing to leave some two full years before he wanted to retire. In that time, he reviewed company operations with his employees and formulated specific goals for each department, all the while planning for his own future, too. When it came time for Pagano to sell the company, he felt liberated. He devoted himself to his sailboat and was still welcomed back to his old offices whenever he wanted to visit. Many business owners think of their businesses as an extension of themselves. But sometimes the greatest thing you can do for your company is to free yourself from it! If you want your business to survive, make sure it can run without you. A company that's dependent on its owner won't last. Keep in mind that there has to be a transition phase between your exit and the start of your company's new life without you. The owner of a meat processing plant managed to make this transition successfully. He realized his problem early, that he ran too many things independently and didn’t rely on managers enough in making decisions. To improve the situation, he empowered his managers and gave everyone more responsibility. This successful transition period ensured that the company would thrive without him. Many business owners don't consider such issues, as they're too preoccupied with things that seem more urgent than their eventual exit years down the road. Some owners also mistakenly assume an exit will be simple. They don't realize that leaving is actually a phase unto itself that carries long-term consequences. Your exit affects you, your employees, your loved ones and the legacy of the company you've helped build. The owner of a staffing company learned this the hard way. Under his watch, the company achieved record revenues and staff grew. Yet while he was focusing on expansion, he ignored planning for his own exit strategy. So when the owner had to retire for health reasons, he didn't have time to organize an effective transition and lost the chance to shape his company's legacy. Such hasty exits can be stressful, and they often end badly for your organization, too. So you're ready to craft a strong exit from your company. How exactly do you start? There are four main phases to contemplate: exploratory, strategic, execution and transition. First is the exploratory phase. This is when you sort out your priorities and explore your options. It's also the time to decide if you want to liquidate or sell your company. If you're selling, determine the price and who you want to sell to, and outline a time frame for the sale. Next is the strategic phase. Here you’ll start to regard your company as a product. You'll strengthen it as you pinpoint weaknesses and work to maximize value. In the execution phase, you'll seal the deal and follow through on your plans. Will you liquidate your company? Sell it? Pass it on to your children? Whatever your decision, this is the time when the company changes hands. Finally in the transition phase, you'll move on to whatever comes next. This phase lasts until you’ve completely transitioned – both physically and psychologically – into your new career, retirement or whatever else awaits you. Let’s say you own a successful insurance company and are planning your exit. In the exploratory phase, you might decide to sell your business for $20 million sometime in the next ten years, then retire. In the strategic phase, you'll figure out ways to make your company more attractive for potential buyers, by working to increase sales during the period. In the execution phase, you'll work with potential buyers and eventually reach a deal. When you're satisfied with the results, you'll enter the transition phase where you'll move to Santa Barbara and start to enjoy your retirement! Unfortunately, when you make your exit, things might not go according to plan. Not every owner can sell her company and make millions. Selling isn't easy and it's not a sure thing, either. Selling is just one option of several, and for your company, it might not be the best option. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 65 to 75 percent of owners who hope to sell their businesses never even make it on to the market. An owner of a bakery discovered just how difficult selling can be. While he put his business on the market, he was having a hard time finding suitable buyers, and wasted a ton of time and money running ads and holding meetings. The owner eventually became so frustrated that he just wanted to be done with it all, and ended up selling his bakery for less than it was worth. Don’t lose your cool and back yourself into a corner; plan ahead to avoid mistakes like these! If your business is small, liquidation might be the best option. Many small businesses exist only so the owner can earn a modest living, keeping the company as long as its operations fit with their lifestyle, then deciding to liquidate when they’re ready to retire or follow other plans. In such cases, potential buyers are usually limited to family members, employees or friends. Let’s say you're the owner of a small manufacturing company. If you don't have any relatives interested in taking over the business, it might be a waste of time looking for other buyers. You'd probably be better off continuing to run the company and saving money in the process. When you've saved enough, you can then liquidate the company and move to the next phase of your life. On the surface, planning for an exit five years in advance might seem a bit excessive. When you realize how much preparation an exit strategy requires however, you'll be glad you started early. There are a number of things you can do to increase the sellability of your business. You'll need to work on your cash flow, overall customer satisfaction and recurring revenue streams, among other things. None of these variables can ensure a perfect sale alone, but these are the elements of your company that potential buyers will scrutinize. Let’s say you own a toothpaste company, and your potential suitor is a market-leading oral hygiene firm that's looking for expansion opportunities. Knowing this, you should work on your company’s growth prospects, general customer satisfaction and logistics. Your potential buyer will view these factors as a solid base for his company’s further expansion. Ultimately, you should adapt your business model to suit a specific potential buyer. The buyer will undoubtedly want to change some elements, but you can make your company more appealing if you can anticipate a buyer’s wishes. When you improve your business in this way, you'll also increase its value. The owners of a lighting company found a suitable potential buyer and knew they had to work to make their company even more attractive. So they worked to double sales receipts and even modified the company’s business model. The owners knew the buyer was looking for a financially sound business upon which the company could expand. In the end, the changes helped position the lighting company perfectly. The buyer agreed to a sale and the owners made a happy and strategically sound exit. So you're ready to sell and there's a great offer on the table. There's just one problem. The offer will certainly mean the buyer will lay off all your employees. What do you do? If you want your business to retain its culture and independence, you'll have to find a buyer that shares your values. Every business owner makes a special impact on his company's atmosphere and character. Do you want these characteristics to last after you are gone? Business owner Roxanne Byrd had a special management style. She prioritized friendliness and trust, and her employees deeply respected her. And while she found a promising buyer, she soon discovered that he had an unethical business strategy, and planned to mislead employees until he could liquidate the company’s assets. Byrd wanted her successor at the company to carry on her legacy, so she decided not to sell. You too will have to decide what is most important to you. Do you want your successor to maintain the values you instilled in your company? Or do you just want to cash out, and go? If you're planning to sell to a strategic buyer, you may not need to have a successor in place. A strategic buyer is someone who is already the owner of other businesses. Strategic buyers typically install their own managers into companies they acquire because they want to keep all their businesses aligned to the same goals, principles and strategies. In the end, the decision is yours alone. Every business owner has to find the exit that's right for him. The key message in this book: Don't make the mistake of thinking that leaving your company is a simple feat you can accomplish quickly. A good exit strategy requires a great deal of long-term planning. Think about the life you want for yourself after you leave and guide your organization through a predictable transition period. When you plan well, your exit will be a positive and healthy experience for everyone. Actionable advice: Tweak your business to specifically suit potential buyers. If you increase your company's market value, your company will be more attractive to potential buyers. But try to go one step further. Adapt your company to specifically suit the buyers you are targeting. In doing so you'll increase your chances of making a better sale and your potential buyer will have less work to do when they take over.

At the end of the day, the performance of employees is the primary factor impacting the success of a business, and it is the manager’s job to ensure that performance hits its peak. Much has been written about how managers can fulfill their role effectively, but what if all the conventional wisdom about management is in fact wrong? Instead of taking for granted the age-old adages of management, First, Break All the Rules examines the practices used by truly great managers. These blinks explain on a practical level how managers can find the right employees for the right roles and keep them satisfied with their jobs. You’ll also find out how to walk the tightrope of allowing employees independence while ensuring the quality of their work through guidance and control. Finally, you’ll also find out how to deal with situations where an employee is not performing in line with expectations.     There are many ways to increase revenues for a company, yet most of these techniques result in only short-lived growth. In fact, a successful business – one which can sustain growth – can be based only on consistently good performance, which has much more to do with how things are managed within the business. In other words, at the heart of a successful business is a strong and high-performing workplace. The success of any business can be based only on a revenue stream that’s robust and sustainable. Such a stream is not generated by techniques like slashing prices or opening a new location, but is the result of a growing base of loyal customers. Growing such a loyal customer base requires that those customers feel satisfied with a company’s excellent products and services. So, how can a company create such a strong, high-performing workplace? The key lies in satisfied employees: the more satisfied an employee is, the more she’ll contribute to building and maintaining a strong workplace. Why is that? For one thing, satisfied employees are more engaged in their work, and because of their stronger commitment they greatly contribute to higher productivity. Another reason is that employees’ commitment often has an indirect effect on company profits. A satisfied, engaged employee is more likely to save energy (by, for example, making sure to turn off the lights) and negotiate prices, and less likely to steal from the company. Finally, such engaged employees will probably also stay longer with the company, and are more likely to be friendlier towards customers because they care greatly about how the company is perceived. So, in order to be successful in the long term, companies must build strong workplaces where performance is consistently high. Ensuring that employees are satisfied in their roles is a sure-fire way of creating such a workplace. If the key to a successful business is the satisfaction of its employees, then what’s the key to that satisfaction? The manager. This is because the manager is responsible for defining the employees’ work environment, creating an atmosphere that will lead to employees’ contentment. Indeed, an employee’s satisfaction is influenced far more by the role of her immediate manager than by the policies and procedures of the company as a whole, and this is because managers transform the work ethos of the company into practices and guidelines. For instance, in terms of practices, this transformation often involves translating new company strategies into concrete goals employees can focus on. For example, large technology companies no longer focus on producing innovative products, but instead aim to make their product the standard. When turning this new strategy into a concrete guideline, the sales manager must, for instance, make sure his sales clerks tell customers about the product’s compatibility with other gadgets. And in terms of guidelines, the benefits of a manager who knows, trusts and invests in her employees outweighs, for those workers, any employee-unfriendly company regulations. For example, consider the manager of a large media company that didn’t give pay raises to designers unless they were promoted to management level. The main problem here was that the designers who performed excellently received no reward for doing so. To resolve the issue and reward these high-performing workers, the manager invented a new job position in which designers could continue designing but were also responsible for sharing their insights with new designers – thus making the job appear like a management role. As these examples show, managers are in charge of transforming the workplace into more than just a place to make a living. And although no one should be willing to work at company which pays poorly, what’s more valuable to employees is a workplace that offers a sense of purpose and the potential for self-expression. To become a great manager you must first let go of popular management principles and learn what the essence of your job really is. The first thing to understand is that a manager is not a leader. While great managers and great leaders have much in common, a crucial difference between them lies in their focus: Whereas leaders look outward, towards the future, great managers mostly look inward, at what already exists and can be turned into performance. Whereas leaders must be visionary, great managers must be empathetic. In short, managers deal with people, and they’re job is to find, focus and keep good employees. However, if managers aren’t leaders then what exactly are they? Managers are mediators. They attend to the needs of both the company and the employee, and address the interests of both. They ensure the workplace atmosphere is conducive not only to hitting the desired economic targets, but also to making each team member feel productive and essential. In negotiating both sides, managers try to find a point of convergence – the point at which business demands and employees are brought together productively. In this sense, managers can be seen as “catalysts.” Like a catalyst in chemistry, the manager facilitates a reaction between two discrete elements, which (although involving just the two parties) nevertheless requires an additional something to get the process started. As you can see, the key to a successful business lies in successful mediation, bringing the needs of the employee and the needs of the company into alignment. In this regard, managers play the central role, by finding, focusing and keeping good employees. In the next blinks, you’ll find out how great managers get the most out of their employees – by identifying and nurturing their unique talents. Although all great managers have their own individual styles of management, there is one central maxim they all share: Every person is unique. They have a unique way of thinking and relating to the world, and are motivated in ways specific to them. In fact, studies show that during the first 15 years of a person’s life, the brain’s synaptic connections are carved in a highly individual way, and that after that age people are not capable of changing much mentally. Furthermore, everyone’s unique nature includes talents and “non-talents.” Talents should not be considered special abilities possessed only by gifted people. For instance, the word “talent” should not be used to describe Mozart or Einstein. A talent, rather, means every recurring pattern of thought, feeling or behavior that can be productively applied. For example, some people are naturally outgoing, and would therefore make perfect sales reps. But people also have “non-talents” – the lack of such a recurring pattern. Some people are unbelievably messy, yet not being able to keep a clean desk doesn’t mean that such people won’t meet their deadlines. There are three types of talents: striving, thinking and relating. Striving talents define a person’s motivation – such as competitiveness. Such people are motivated by the goal of being better than others. Thinking talents define how someone approaches any mental work. Some have the talent of being focused, while others are able to leave options open. Finally, relating talents define communication habits: some people have the talent of confronting people, others of avoiding confrontation. In a work environment, the first kind of person might cause friction, whereas the latter will contribute to a pleasant working atmosphere. For instance, she might be the kind of person who brings homemade cake to the office. Contrary to popular belief, people cannot become everything they want to be. However, each person has a distinct set of talents – a fact all great managers know and make the most of. The fact that each person has his or her unique and unchangeable set of behaviors means that, for managers, this must be translated into management guidelines. This is because each employee’s unique nature plays a crucial role in their individual job performance. For example, although accumulated experience can contribute to a performance increase, it’s actually the employee’s unique talents that determine how well they perform. Performing at maximum level at a job is possible only in cases where talent and job demands are well-matched. Consider a common task of nurses: giving injections. The more injections a nurse performs, the better he gets at them. However, if a nurse lacks the required empathetic talent, he will never be able to relate to his patients the way that care workers are required to do. Thus his non-talent has become a weakness, and he will never succeed as a nurse. How, then, can managers best deal with the situation where every employee is naturally talented in unique and different ways? They should capitalize on them. Successful management is all about focusing on people’s natural set of talents, then making use of them. Managers must establish techniques which allow their employees to use and develop their innate and unique talents, rather than neglecting such uniqueness and trying to force-fit employees into a certain mold. But not only do great managers capitalize on their employees’ uniquely different talents, they also redress the fact that employees have non-talents by preventing them from developing into weaknesses. In order for managers to put employees’ natural talents to use, they can following these four general guidelines: Select for talent Define the right outcomes Focus on strength Find the right fit The insight that everyone has his or her unique, natural talents is shared by all great managers. In the next blinks, we’ll see how certain techniques for successful management can be deduced from this insight, including how to select the right person for the job. As we have seen, the snug fit of an employee’s talents with company demands contributes greatly to good performance. But how do great managers find such employees? And how do they decide which qualities they’re looking for? First, by being aware of the different kinds of talent a job position requires. For each position, they should consider at least one critical talent in each of the talent categories (striving, thinking and relating). In order to determine the appropriate talent for the job, great managers consider not only the job title and description, but also the culture and ethos of the company, and the team which the new employee will join. For example, in any given team, distinct roles are required. A team consisting of people who tend to avoid confrontation might benefit from an employee with the relating talent of bringing issues to the surface. Second, great managers conduct job interviews in a way that allows the candidate to reveal their personality. To this end, they don’t put candidates under stress, base their evaluations only on appearance, or judge candidates hastily. Great managers know that people need time to adjust to the often-awkward interview setting, and that if they put people under stress, they’ll end up evaluating whether the talent can perform under stress. Of course, such a talent might be crucial for some job positions, but certainly not for all of them. Furthermore, by focusing only on this quality, the manager can blind herself towards a candidate’s other, potentially well-fitting talents. Another interview technique great managers use is to ask open-ended questions – those which prompt the interviewee to answer in a personal way. And when considering the candidate’s answers, great managers look for specificity and “top-of-mind” responses, as these guarantee the answers are more personal. In sum, managers must find a way to ensure that, whatever work needs to be done, it should be done by employees with the talent most suited to succeeding in that task. Gathering a team of talented employees is not enough.Managers must also make sure that employees’ talents are actually put to use properly. What often gets in the way of achieving this is the conventional career path – a model of progress with many flaws. What are those flaws? First, just because an employee excels at a certain job doesn’t mean that they’ll excel in a higher position. One rung in the career ladder does not necessarily lead to another. Second, the conventional path limits prestige to those who manage to climb the ladder, thus generating conflict as co-workers compete for the limited, higher positions. Finally, this system overemphasizes the value of experience, leading to a “hunt for marketable skills and experiences”; if an employee has managed to climb a rung of the ladder, this is interpreted as a gain in marketable skills. Great managers have little use for the conventional career path. Instead, they use a range of techniques to establish alternative paths that better suit the employee. In doing this, great managers create an environment where money and prestige are spread equally throughout the company, and, because of that, the employee is much freer to base her career choices on her talents. One of these techniques is to define graded levels of achievement. This technique is practiced in many law firms, where promotion makes a significant difference to prestige and salary but not to the work itself. Another technique is broadbanding the pay structure: the pay for each position is structured so that the top-end of a lower-level position overlaps the bottom-end of the position above. In this way, excellent performance in a lower-level position becomes more lucrative than poor performance at a higher-level position. Great managers know that the conventional career path is full of wrongheaded assumptions, so they try to make it possible for their employees to climb up the career ladder while always doing the work that best suits their talents.  Ultimately, the results of management lie in the employees’ performance. For this reason, great managers shift their attention away from controlling employees and onto employees’ performance results and outcomes. Behind this is the manager’s awareness that they have only limited control over workers. For a start, managers are not the ones who actually do the work that may lead to the results they desire. All they can do is motivate their employees to do it. Thus the manager’s control should be reconceptualized as a mediated form of control – or, “remote control.” Yet despite their lack of direct control over the work determining performance results, managers nevertheless remain accountable for such results. Therefore, they must focus on the desired outcomes the work is intended to produce. Great managers define these desired outcomes for employees and allow them to find their own ways of reaching them. Often, there is no one right way to accomplish such goals. So rather than establish rules that require, for example, sales clerks to follow a certain selling style, the manager should only define the outcomes she wants to see. This allows her sales staff to choose the selling style they’re most comfortable with. There are many advantages to this approach. One is that it’s efficient, because the manager does not waste time by devising and trying to enforce a style of working. Another advantage is that it encourages employees to take responsibility, and thus attracts responsible employees. By defining the outcome, great managers create a work environment where employees feel motivated to achieve, to move towards a definite goal without being told how to get there. Finally, such a work environment actually helps employees to become aware of their talents, as they are put to the test. Great managers know that they don’t need to establish a strict, clear method for achieving a desired result. The most important thing is that, in the end, the desired outcome is reached. While great managers allow employees to be individuals, that doesn’t mean employees are free to do whatever they wish. Indeed, in terms of certain aspects, there are some rules employees must adhere to. First, any rules concerning accuracy and safety must be followed. For example, banks have defined regulatory steps and strict internal guidelines to ensure money is handled securely and precisely. Second, any rules essential to industry or company standard must be adhered to, as this ensures the legitimacy of the company and its comparability to other companies on the market. For example, accountants must know and apply the rules of double-entry bookkeeping, and engineers must ensure the product will operate on the standard electrical frequency. Such rules represent the minimum standard for meeting and satisfying customer expectations, which revolve around accuracy, availability, partnership and advice. The most basic factors here are accuracy and availability: they meet the minimum requirement for customer satisfaction. For example, it’s obvious that if a customer wants her car wheels changed, the workshop must have wheels in stock and a mechanic who’ll do the job correctly. The rules that great managers insist their employees obey all relate to those two basic factors. But to achieve maximum customer satisfaction, much still lies in the hands of the employee. For example, the customer wanting her wheels exchanged might become a maximally satisfied customer if the mechanic exceeds the customer’s expectations by offering advice on how to make wheels last longer, or simply involves the waiting customer in a nice conversation. Furthermore, if the motor mechanic has the additional talent of being outgoing, they might even transform the customer’s waiting time into a pleasant experience. Following these basic guidelines ensures the minimum performance results, and the baseline for customer satisfaction. As for the rest, employees must be allowed to follow their talents. Great managers establish successful, personal relationships with employees, and they do this in order to help those employees to develop. They also spend a lot of time with their best employees, trying to understand not only their talents, but all aspects of their lives. It’s only by knowing their employees this well that great managers are able to choose the right ways to develop them. For instance, it’s only by knowing what’s important to employees that the manager is able to motivate or reward them appropriately. What’s more awkward that rewarding a worker with a gift she doesn’t like? If an excellent though naturally shy employee is rewarded with a very public display of appreciation, this will at best make her uncomfortable, and at worst, misunderstood. When it comes to finding out how to improve employees’ performance, great managers refer to excellent employees, not past mistakes or average employees. Why? Firstly, learning from mistakes can lead to wrong assumptions. Say you’re observing nurses with emotional relationships to their patients, but you notice also that they become so overwhelmed they can’t do their job. You might conclude that forming emotional relationships is a bad thing. But you’d be wrong. The truth is that forming strong emotional relationships with patients is a key talent which excellent nurses possess. The problem is that you observed only bad nurses, and with those nurses this talent for emotional connection can develop in the wrong way. Secondly, establishing business goals based on average employee performance will lead you to underestimate what’s possible. It’s only by learning from excellent employees that the criteria for excellence can be discovered: Excellent nurses show that an appropriate relationship with patients is needed for care work, and excellent workers likewise show that performance can be improved continually. As we can see, high-performing employees are worth learning from and about. By doing so, these employees can be helped to perform better, and they can also help managers to understand how they achieve excellence. Because great managers focus on performance, they immediately address any performance that’s not meeting their expectations. Rather than drawing hasty conclusions about poor performance, great managers first analyze the situation. For instance, they will try to determine whether poor performance is caused by lack of teachable skills or knowledge. If so, the right training will likely improve performance. But they also question their own work, wondering whether it was an error in management that led to a poorly performing employee. Yet, what if instead of being caused by lack of skills, or by bad management, poor performance is caused by an employee’s non-talent? Since no one’s perfect, nor has all the requisite talents to excel in a certain position, this might not be a particularly unusual situation. So what do great managers do in those cases? They try to “manage around” the non-talent. They do this by, for example, building up a support system to alleviate the employee’s weakness or make it irrelevant (e.g. a spell check software for a bad speller). Or they find the employee a complementary partner, forming a team in which each member’s specific non-talent is supported by the talent of the other. However, in those cases where a non-talent proves to be a real weakness, great managers do not hesitate to let go of the employee. Where a particular talent is an essential requirement for a job position, an employee who does not naturally possess this talent is better off leaving the position. Of course, this doesn’t mean the employee is a generally useless person. It simply means that their talents can be applied more productively elsewhere. Great managers do not feel bad about being tough because they do not blame the employee. In fact, if they blame anyone, it’s themselves, because they made a casting mistake. The key message in this book: Each person has a unique set of talents which make him or her the right fit for a certain job. Successful management encourages and helps employees to develop these innate talents and to become even better at what – thanks to their natural inclinations – they’re already good at.  Actionable advice from the book: Select for talent When recruiting, one of the most important things to remember is to “select for talent.” The unique talents of candidates and the job they’re applying for must make a good fit. So, during the job interview, ask open-ended questions and listen to specifics to discover the candidate’s talents.  ","headers":["What’s in it for me?","Employee satisfaction is the key to a successful business.","The manager determines the degree of employee satisfaction.","The work of the manager is centered on mediating, not leading.","Each person has a unique and unchanging set of behaviors which can be considered talents.","To create a high-performing workplace, managers must consider each employee’s unique talents.","Great managers find people who have the right talent for the job.","Great managers establish alternative career paths for employees, thereby keeping them in the best-fitting job position.","Great managers focus on reaching desired outcomes, not on controlling their employees.","Great managers establish basic rules that ensure a baseline of customer satisfaction.","Great managers focus on excellent employees, who they try to develop and learn from.","Great managers carefully analyze poor performance and try to work around employees' non-talents.","Final Summary"],"category":"Entrepreneurship","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/530466a53439370008160000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"First, Break all the Rules (1999) shows how great management differs from conventional approaches.

A great many companies collapsed as funding dried up, but it wasn’t long before a new wave of startups emerged, many of which were part of the Web 2.0 movement that focused on user-generated content. Around 2006, author Jessica Livingston talked to the founders of many startups from the early days before the first Mac to early Web 2.0 companies like Flickr and Blogger. These casual conversations were transcribed for Livingston’s book and focus less on exact dates and numbers, and more on the ups and downs and lessons learned from launching your own startup. Although technology has changed in leaps and bounds since 2007, the stories of these pioneering entrepreneurs and the ideas that drove them are still highly relevant today. And while some of these businesses and technologies are the stuff of history, there’s truth to the saying that we can't understand our future without first understanding our past. In these blinks, you’ll find what completely different products Paypal and Flickr started out as; how many millions Yahoo paid for a collection of website bookmarks in 2005; and why investor money isn’t always the best option. In talking to the founders of numerous startups, the author found some interesting commonalities between some of the most successful of the past few decades. Among the most obvious is the fact that many big startups ended up with an idea or product very different than the one they started out with. Take Paypal, for example. You know Paypal as one of the more popular ways to transfer money and make payments online, but co-founder Max Levchin didn’t set out to help people do that. In the late 1990s, Levchin was working on software for early handheld computer devices like the Palm Pilot. It all started when he created an emulator that generated single-use security passwords, which at the time, people had to buy bulky, expensive devices to do – or even several devices for different passwords and systems. Levchin’s emulator software made all those devices obsolete, putting the technology right into your Palm Pilot. But the market for this service wasn’t that big around the turn of the millennium, so Levchin thought, what kind of information do people need to keep secure on their devices? The answer was credit card information, which then led to software that let you securely “beam” money from one Palm Pilot to another. Soon, Levchin and his co-founder Peter Thiel were gaining around 300 users a day, but they maxed out at around 12,000 users. Far more popular was the online money transfer demo on their website. This demo had attracted around 1.5 million users, so it was clear where PayPal’s attention needed to be: web-based money transfers. And once that shift was made, they were soon gaining 20,000 users a day, leading to Ebay eventually purchasing PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002. Blogger.com is another example of success coming in a different way than expected. Evan Williams and his co-founders started Pyra Labs in 1999 to make project management software. The blog was just one tool with which they were working. But in working on that tool, they made it super easy for any person, from any computer, to log in, write and instantly publish their work for all to see. It had nothing to do with project management, and Williams nearly went broke in the process, but thanks to his determination and the generous fans who loved the software, Blogger.com ended up a success story. It gained a million users, started generating revenue and was acquired by Google in 2003. Another commonality among many early startups was that their ideas weren’t always so well-received, at least not initially. Innovative ideas can seem confusing or too tricky to understand for people, which is problematic if your idea needs funding to develop. This was the problem for Steve Perlman and his WebTV idea. In 1995, Perlman was already a respected figure in Silicon Valley, having helped Apple develop the first Mac with a color display. Yet Perlman had difficulty selling his idea for interactive TVs that involved more than just changing channels. At the time, TVs didn’t even have program guides, and Perlman was finding there was something of a catch-22 problem: TVs didn’t have interactive content because there was no hardware for it, and there was no hardware for it because there was no interactive content to prove there was a market for it. Many people Perlman approached had no confidence that customers would want to do anything more interactive with their TV than changing the channel. He proved them wrong: after being bought by Microsoft, WebTV became MSNTV. In its first eight years in the market, the product generated $1.3 billion in revenue. While interactive TV that you can pause, rewind and record may seem pretty basic nowadays, web-based email that you can access from any browser, seems like a no-brainer. But in 1996, most everyone accessed their email from work, where internal networks and firewalls prevented you from accessing it anywhere else. In fact, before Hotmail was founded that year by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith, many people believed that email accounts were always going to be something you got from your employer. Bhatia knew, however, that there would be more people like him, who’d benefit from being able to check their email from any web browser. Nevertheless, many investors shot down Bhatia and Smith’s business plan until one was finally willing to give them just enough money to prove that they could indeed make a web-based email service. It wasn’t long before the idea was proven worthwhile. Thanks in part to word of mouth, and the clever idea of putting a link to the Hotmail site at the bottom of each email, they were gaining up to 5,000 new users every day. By the end of their first year, Hotmail boasted 7 million subscribers, and not long afterward, they were acquired by Microsoft for $400 million. Not all startups began with a great idea. Sometimes they didn’t have any idea at all! This was certainly the case for Joe Kraus, co-founder of Excite, an early web search tool. In 1993, Kraus teamed up with five friends from Stanford University, and they proved that sometimes having an idea isn’t as important as having a good team. In fact, Kraus and his classmates had no idea what their business would be, but Kraus wasn’t worried because he knew his friends were all passionate and intelligent. It felt like just a matter of time before they found their way forward. Sure enough, during a brainstorming session at their favorite taco shop, they realized that with so much information being published in digital formats, people were going to need a new way to search that digital info to find what they were looking for. At first, they focused on searching things like digital encyclopedias, but their attention soon turned to the web. After showing that their technology could scale to search massive databases, they got $3 million in financing, and their new company, Excite, became the primary search tool for the dominant browser at the time: Netscape. In 1996, another team was coming together without any idea. This one featured Arthur van Hoff and three others from the tech firm Sun Microsystems. They had all been involved in developing Sun’s Java programing language and decided that they should each put in $25,000 and try their own startup business, despite a lack of ideas. Van Hoff wasn’t worried because he’d seen plenty of lousy ideas get funding, and he also knew that the first idea usually got scrapped in favor of a better second idea. In fact, having a team allowed them to pivot quickly from testing one idea to another before ending up with Marimba, a subscription-based software distribution model. Nowadays, most software updates automatically, but at the time, it was pretty new to have a system that makes sure everyone receives their update at the same time. This is especially important for companies like the financial firm Morgan Stanley, with employees around the world. Imagine trying to contact 100,000 employees worldwide to make sure everyone installed their software update! So rather than starting out by fixating on one idea, instead, make sure you have a flexible team that can pivot and run with the perfect idea when it presents itself. The idea for Hotmail came when the founders were annoyed at not being able to access their email outside of the office firewall. Indeed, many startups began as solutions to personal problems, until the founders realized that millions of other people could also benefit from their idea. The most famous example may be Yahoo, which started out as a collection of online footnotes in the form of web links for all the references being made in the PhD thesis papers of two Stanford grad students, Jerry Yang and David Filo. Quickly, the site grew, with new categories and links being added based on suggestions by enthusiastic fans. It was growing so fast that Yang and Filo had to bring in their friend Tim Brady to help write a business plan so they could turn their hobby into the job it was clearly shaping up to be. Remarkably, as a business student, Brady was also able to submit this plan to some of his classes as a final project for graduation. Within a few months, Yahoo was indeed a real business, receiving an initial $1 million in funding. A year later, in 1996, they went public and were on their way to becoming one of the web’s pioneering empires. The story of deli.icio.us is similar in many ways. This site began in the late 1990s as a private collection of online bookmarks made by Joshua Schachter, who was working as an analyst at Morgan Stanley at the time. By 2001, with the help of some suggested links from others, he’d amassed around 20,000 bookmarks, which proved highly popular at a time when finding cool and interesting things on the web wasn’t easy. Naturally, a collection this size was a challenge to keep organized, so he started tagging the links with short categorical descriptions, like “math” or “food.” He then put the database on a server for the public to see. Within a year, the service had 30,000 users. It was growing to be so popular that he received $1 million in funding before the service was purchased by Yahoo in 2005 for $30 million. For Schachter, tagging was a simple solution to a personal organizational problem, yet it was one that became extremely popular in helping others find what they were looking for as well. Oftentimes, the best solution to a problem isn’t going to be some complex tool that comes with a 500-page user manual. Like Joshua Schachter using descriptive tags to help organize his bookmarks, the best solution is often simple and easy to use. Simplicity has always been at the heart of Apple, even in its earliest days when engineer Steve Wozniak was working in his apartment, putting together the first Apple computers. When Wozniak was a high schooler and teaching himself how gadgets worked, he wouldn’t just take things apart and put them back together again – he’d take them apart and then figure out how to make them work with fewer parts. This way, they could not only be made more cheaply, but they could also be made more elegantly and with fewer chances of things going wrong. For Wozniak, doing more with less is what being an entrepreneur is all about. A true entrepreneur finds a way to create something with whatever limited resources they have while still striving to make it better than whatever is currently being sold. A similar philosophy was in the mind of Philip Greenspun when he created the web design company ArsDigita in 1997. After creating a simple yet popular community site called Photo.net, he started getting requests from companies to help build their websites. After working on a few sites, he published a free design framework called the ArsDigita Community System, which anyone could use. But the requests for design work didn’t stop. After he published a book called Database Backed Websites (1998), they increased further. What Greenspun built was a business that offered simple, quick and clean design solutions, with websites that didn’t require the sort of fancy coding that took lots of time and created bugs. He was also trying to create a business that positioned programmers as problem solvers and not just human robots who kept quiet and wrote code all day. ArsDigita had an annual growth of around 500 percent and was working for clients like Levis and Hearst Publications. But unfortunately, there is such a thing as growing too fast. When Greenspun opened the door to venture capital, all but one of the founders got squeezed out, with new leadership wanting to turn the startup into a slow and expensive company like IBM. In the end, ArsDigita collapsed, becoming one of the more well-known examples of what can go wrong when venture capital enters the picture. As Philip Greenspun found out, venture capital often comes with strings attached, whether it’s the addition of investor-approved executives or handing over shares in the company or a percentage of the profits. So, if you’re launching a startup and want to stay in control of your business, many founders recommend that you reduce costs or find a way to avoid bringing in new investors. Joel Spolsky knew about Greenspun’s dilemma with investors, and he founded Fog Creek Software with the aim of following ArsDigita’s lead while avoiding their mistakes. Like Greenspun, Spolsky wanted to have a consulting company that attracted great programmers. To do that, he had to create an environment that treated programmers well. So he made sure every programmer would have their own office with comfortable chairs, be able to travel first class and get four weeks of vacation annually. These are all perks that investors don’t like to see since they consider it all to be an unnecessary extravagance – they’d prefer to see programmers lined up at desks like a sweatshop. So when they were just starting out, Spolsky had a plan to make sure he didn’t need venture capital: he had a useful piece of bug-tracking software called FogBugz. He even discovered an interesting thing about software sales: sometimes a high price would make the software appear to be more valuable and therefore more appealing. So when he raised the price from $199 to $999, he actually sold more units! The other way to avoid having to take on venture capital is to stay cheap, which a lot of startup founders advise, including Paul Graham, the co-founder of Viaweb and the man behind the influential startup incubator, Y Combinator. As Graham sees it, for every penny of investor money you take, the less autonomy you’ll have and the more you’ll be at the mercy of others. So spend as little as you can and embrace a minimalist, bohemian style rather than a lavish or luxurious one. Of all the advice given by the founders with whom the author spoke, one of the most repeated was how important it is for entrepreneurs to listen to their customers. With this in mind, the emphasis should be on creating something of real value to others. Certainly, this was what Paul Graham, of Viaweb and Y Combinator, advises. In fact, “Make something people want,” was the phrase printed on Y Combinator t-shirts. As Graham sees it, the very basis of a startup should be about creating a product or service that makes other people happy and then converting that happiness into money. This may sound simple enough, but Graham has seen his fair share of people come up with an idea that they think will make people happy. This is why it’s important to listen to your customer and know what they really want. Graham also puts a high value on honesty. With Viaweb, Graham and his co-founder Robert Morris created web-based software for setting up online stores. What’s more, they set out to create the best e-commerce software available. And since they kept close tabs on their customers’ satisfaction, as well as the quality of their competitors’ product, they could say with all honesty that Viaweb did indeed offer the best software. The added benefit of honesty is that when you, the entrepreneur, say your product is the best choice available, the client will be able to pick up on the fact that you’re telling the truth. It’s hard to put a value on truth and honesty, but if being a salesperson doesn’t come naturally to you, having the benefit of honesty can be a huge asset in winning over clients. Paul Graham was always a tech-oriented guy and never comfortable in the role of a salesperson. Nevertheless, he found that with Viaweb, he could be very persuasive thanks to the one simple trick of being honest. Other salespeople might suggest that you need to be eloquent and have tons of charm and finesse to sell your product, but Graham has found that honesty can indeed be a powerful tool for winning people over. Sometimes the stars align, and your product comes out at just the right time to compliment all the other things that are going on in the zeitgeist. Certainly, this was the fortunate case for photo sharing software Flickr. Caterina Fake and her husband Stuart Butterfield didn’t plan on this timing, as Flickr is another case of a successful product not being the startup’s original idea. In 2002, Fake and Butterfield began working on Game Neverending, a videogame partly inspired by the popular pet games like Tamagotchi, where a user takes care of a virtual pet and gives it toys while trading items with other users. One of the planned features of Game Neverending was to allow users to share photos with one another. As they were waiting for some work on the game to be finished, Fake worked on this photo sharing feature and eventually enabled users to post their photos on a web page – this is where Flickr really took off. Looking back, Fake can see where all the pieces fell into place for Flickr. After all, there had been other photo sharing programs before, but by 2004, personal blogs and the first wave of social media, such as Myspace and Friendster, were making it much more appealing to share photos. Plus, digital photography was also making it increasingly easy for anyone to get their photos on the web. Until then, most online photo services like Shutterfly made their revenue by getting people to pay for a printing service. And for this reason, Fake feels fortunate that Flickr didn’t start out as the main project, since the research would have suggested that there was no market for photo sharing that didn’t ultimately aim to get people to make prints. But in 2004, people were realizing that photo sharing was one of the primary activities that made social media platforms like MySpace and Friendster fun. Plus, the recent rise in personal blogs made people a lot more comfortable with the idea of sharing their personal photos with the public at large. Before blogs and social media, the standard practice was to keep any online photos private. The key message in these blinks: Between the time when Apple made its first computers in the late 1970s and the early 2000s when blogs and user-generated content were all the rage, startups revolutionized business in the United States. In talking to some of the founders of the most successful startups during this time, we can see some interesting commonalities among the many stories. These include the fact that many startups began without any initial idea; that often finding ways to do more with less can lead to success; that solving a personal problem can end up being a million dollar solution; and that often the initial business plan doesn’t resemble the final one.

But do you know what exactly this entails? More importantly, would a franchise be the right option for you if you were to expand your business? After all, franchising is only one of many options. These blinks will help you to figure out if franchising is the right step for your business pursuits. They’ll outline the key advantages of franchising, while also offering some insights as to why not all businesses will work as franchises. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why franchisees tend to be very committed managers; why barbecue businesses in the United States usually aren’t franchises; and three possible ways to structure your franchise business. When it comes to modern business, franchise structures are everywhere. Many businesses today increase their market share and expand across new areas by creating a franchise. So what is a franchise exactly? A franchise is a partnership between a franchisor and a franchisee. A franchisor is typically someone who already owns a thriving business. Franchisors create a contract that allows another party, the franchisee, to copy and use the existing business model. And with that, a franchise is born! Hold on, you might be thinking – why would any aspiring business owner want to join a franchise? After all, wouldn’t it be more exciting to create a unique business of one’s own? Sure! But starting your own business, as we all know, is tough. Becoming a franchisee, on the other hand, has a lot of perks that make those difficult first stages easier. Franchisees can take advantage of the franchisor’s brand, trademark and customer base, rather than having to build up their own from scratch. Franchisees also benefit from the training provided by the franchisor, helping them set up and run the business as smoothly as possible. Plus, franchisors provide ongoing support in challenging areas, including finance and operations. This way, franchisees can hit the ground running and get their branch off to a great start. Of course, franchisors don’t take care of everything for the franchisee. Franchisees invest their own money and are responsible for all loans taken to open up the new branch. They’re also expected to pay a certain percentage of their sales to the franchisor and buy supplies, from ingredients to branded equipment, from them as well. If you’ve got a great business on your hands and are ready to take the next step, what are your options? Business owners looking to expand might think about opening another business unit operating under their own management – but this can be expensive and time-consuming. Franchising offers a more cost-effective alternative to growing your business. Let’s take a closer look at three key advantages. First off, franchises require less money to get started. To set up another company-owned business unit, you’ll need capital. To get the funds you need, you’ll find yourself grappling with banks to set up increasingly expensive loans, or struggling to win the attention of investors in equity markets. To avoid all this hassle, business owners can create franchises. As we learned in the previous blink, franchisees invest their own money and carry the risk of the business themselves. This means that franchisors don’t have to raise anywhere near as much capital to open a new branch. Secondly, franchisees make great managers. No matter how you expand your business, you’ll have to delegate control to others. But managers hired to run new company-owned businesses are likely to act rather selfishly, since their livelihood doesn’t directly depend on the survival of your brand and business. Managers of franchise branches, on the other hand, carry the risk of the operation; they’re personally invested in the business and will want to see it succeed. As a result, franchisees tend to be responsible and reliable managers. Finally, creating a franchise will kickstart your expansion much faster than creating company-owned units ever could. Taking the latter path means a lot of managerial work ends up on your plate, from finding a new location to hiring staff, whereas franchisees will take on this managerial work themselves. All that’s left for you to do is find the individuals willing to become your franchisees. We now know that franchising has a whole host of benefits. But when deciding to start a franchise, there are a few more factors to consider. The truth is that not all businesses make good franchises – so how can you tell whether it’s worth becoming a franchisor or not? There are two essential conditions that any business hoping to jump into franchising needs to have covered. First, your business must look promising to franchisees. You want potential franchisees to jump at the chance to put your name on their shop front, so your business needs to have an edge over competitors. So how can you differentiate yourself? Start out by working out your unique selling points. Unique selling points can be anything from a viral marketing strategy to eco-friendly company values to a just plain brilliant product. Even the pizza franchise Domino’s has unique selling points that help it stand out from the competition, such as its strong focus on delivery service. If there are just too many competitors with similar products out there, your business can still win over franchisees with promises of great benefits. Many lawn-care companies in the United States are part of a franchise, having signed up because of the great marketing and support networks offered by the franchisors. The second essential condition for a franchise is that the business must be easy to reproduce.  Once you’ve sealed the deal with franchisees, they’ll have to build up a replica of your business, which means learning everything about its operation – and they’ve got about three months to do it. If your business model is too complicated to be taught and reproduced within three months, then franchising may not be your best option. Also bear in mind that not all products can be a hit in every region. A barbecue in South Carolina means a big plate of pulled pork, while in Texas, people expect slabs of beef. Different cities come with different customers, who in turn have different tastes. After investigating whether your business is suitable for franchising, it’s time to think about whether a franchise model suits you personally. Find out what a franchise means for your career and life in the next blink. Making your business into a franchise is no easy task. It takes a lot of effort to build up a winning franchise system, and this should fit into your plans for the future, both professionally and personally. Start by asking yourself where you want to be with your business five years down the line. Do you still plan on running it, or do you hope to have sold it by that time? If you’re planning to sell, you’ll want to maximize the value of your business so you can get a good price. In this case, franchising is a sensible option: you can expand quickly, which means you can attain a higher valuation for your business sooner. Next, ask where you are with your business now. Consult your finances, and consider some of the challenges your business faces. Is your business concept a valuable one? If it is, then there’s just one last question to ask: are you the right person to start a franchise? Franchisees are business owners themselves, often with experience and, sometimes, strong opinions. To build a successful relationship with them, you’ll need to have some leadership skills up your sleeve. In the best-case scenario, you and your franchisees should be able to work together on new ideas and strategies to keep your brand moving forward. As well as being a good leader, you need to be a great salesperson. As the franchisor, you call the shots when it comes to the direction of your business. You have to be able to sell your ideas to your franchisees, helping them see things from your perspective. Explain your choices, and make it clear how the whole franchise will benefit from them. If you’ve gotten this far and have decided to enter the franchise business, it’s time to start your preparations! This is what we’ll delve into in the next blink. There are over 3,000 franchise companies active in the US market today. So what does this mean for you? Well, put it this way: the days when a bright idea was enough to make a load of money through franchising are gone. Nowadays, a well-defined franchise plan is what will ensure your business’s survival. A franchise plan should outline how you envision working with your franchisees. It’s vital that you have a fixed set of rules to follow – this will help you stay on the right track and keep your franchise relationships strong. Like any good plan, your franchise plan must include goals, as well as the steps you need to take to achieve them. Start by deciding on the kind of franchise structure you’re aiming for. You could take the single-unit approach, which allows each franchisee to open one business unit each. This strategy was behind the successful expansion of McDonald's to just about every city in the world. Another option is area development franchising. This means creating a contract with an area developer, who then retains the exclusive right to open up a certain number of business units in an agreed-upon area. Pizza Hut and KFC are known for their use of this franchising strategy. A third alternative is sub-franchising, most often seen in international markets. This entails giving another individual the rights to act as a franchisor in a specific region. This company will take care of negotiations with new franchisees and provide support for them, in exchange for a fee paid to you, the franchisor. Each of these options has its benefits and disadvantages. The single-unit franchise requires that you give your franchisees a lot of support, which could lead to high costs in training and management. If this doesn’t sound feasible, then area development franchising could be a better bet. That way, you’re able to rely on experienced franchisees to take care of support and management. After setting up your franchise according to your plan, the job isn’t done! You need to maintain your franchise so that it continually generates profit and grows. Find out how in the next blink. Franchisees are a little different from your garden-variety managers. You can’t fire them easily and you can’t control how they run their business as much as you’d hope. Because of this, you need to ensure your brand gets the protection it needs. How? By creating a quality control system. An effective quality control system starts with hiring professional and reliable franchisees. The right candidates need not only business chops, but a strong work ethic too. This way, you can be sure that they’ll provide your customers with top-notch service. If a franchisee is a good businessperson but hurts your brand image by disrespecting customers, your brand will run into serious complications sooner than you think. It’s a good idea to create and maintain a franchise operations manual; this is a guidebook for your franchisees that details how each aspect of your business should be run. A franchise operations manual also serves as a legally binding document that you can write into your franchisee’s contract. This way, you can ensure that every franchisee is committed to maintaining the standards of your brand. In fact, one legal case illustrates just how powerful operations manuals are. In Ketterling vs. Burger King, a customer took the fast food chain to court because she slipped on snow in the parking area of one of its branches. But because Burger King had specified in their operations manual that day-to-day maintenance was the task of the franchisee and not the franchisor, they couldn’t be held responsible for not removing the snow. Finally, you can ensure that the quality standards of your brand are upheld by providing adequate training and support to your franchisees. The importance of these two aspects of franchising should not be underestimated! Training doesn’t mean just one preliminary crash course in your business with a new franchisee; instead, ongoing training is required to ensure branches are consistently performing well. You can make ongoing training cost effective by going digital. Online videos and training programs allow franchisees to brush up on their skills anywhere, anytime. Regional meetings and annual conventions are also great fixtures in a franchise’s calendar, allowing teams to come together and get to know each other. With all this talk of business standards and quality control behind us, it’s time we take a closer look at the human side of franchises. A great relationship with franchisees is essential to your business’s success and growth – and it all starts with healthy communication. When establishing relationships with franchisees, roles should be clearly defined. They should know where they stand and feel comfortable with the fact that you’re there to protect the brand and supervise your network of franchisees. While certain sanctions may be necessary to communicate to franchisees that they’ve overstepped their roles, be careful not to slip into the role of a dictator; franchisees have the right to receive explanations for your business decisions, so let their voices be heard too! By being open and honest with your franchisees, you can secure their trust and loyalty. Get in touch with them on a regular basis and be sure to respond to their e-mails and calls as quickly as possible. They’ll appreciate it and will know that they have your support. Finally, give your franchisees the opportunity to provide feedback. Unfortunately, many franchisors forget that their franchisees need a space where they can express their concerns. These constructive conversations are essential to successful long-term relationships, so be sure to make them part of your franchise operations. From open discussions with outspoken employees to anonymous surveys to help more reserved team members express their opinions, feedback is a cornerstone of thriving franchises. The key message in this book: From winning over franchisees to creating a franchise business plan to establishing routines of quality control, setting up a franchise requires preparation and dedication. But with a strong brand, clear communication channels and an appropriately tailored model, you can ensure your business enjoys the many perks of a franchise strategy.  Actionable advice: Never stop supporting your best-performing franchisees. Next time you think those franchisees whose numbers are always outstanding don’t need that monthly meeting with you, think again! Though it’s tempting to shift your time, money and support to branches that need the extra help, it’s essential that you never stop caring about any of your franchisees. Rather than creating an imbalance in your attention and resources across branches, tailor different kinds of support to each franchisee’s needs. Even successful branches have the potential to do better! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Individuals such as these are called mentors, and their advice and experience can be invaluable.  Yet while not everyone is lucky enough to find a mentor to personally guide them, we can seek out the stories of the lives of others to help us in our own quests.  In these blinks, you’ll meet six successful people and learn how they made their way in the world. Each has walked along a different path and conquered individual challenges.  Yet the thing that connects all these stories is the inspiration behind each experience – and it’s this inspiration that can be your “mentor” as you explore your own road to success.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how the values of a soldier can shape a successful artist; how being bad at communicating inspired the creation of Craigslist; and how Teach for America found its start with one determined undergraduate.  Did you look up to your parents as a child? Many of us did and still do. It’s not uncommon for people to even follow in the footsteps of their parents when it comes to a career.  That’s exactly what Harvard Business School dean Nitin Nohria set out to do.  Nohria had a great role model in his father. Born in a humble village in India where few had access to education, Nohria’s father was one of the first to graduate from high school. He then studied abroad, and once back in India, built upon his engineering degree to become the CEO of a major company.  Hoping to make his father proud, Nohria too pursued a degree in engineering, yet struggled with poor grades at school. The reason for this was a passion for literature that consumed most of his time.  Nohria’s grades in his university science classes continued to be average, but he excelled in elective courses – history, literature and economics.  This got him thinking that his path perhaps didn’t lie with engineering after all. So he decided to try his luck in a new direction. Excitingly, he received a fellowship to study finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Nohria then packed up and moved to the United States.  Once at MIT, Nohria unsurprisingly excelled in his humanities classes. Inspired by his successes, he switched to a degree in management, ultimately completing a doctorate in the subject.  The crowning moment of all his hard work came when he was offered the position of dean at the Harvard Business School.  Nohria believes he’s lived the American dream. Like his father before him, he never stopped working to create new opportunities. And though he might not have followed his father’s exact path, Nohria is glad to have had such a mentor in his life.  Unfortunately, not all parents inspire their children in the same way. However, this doesn’t mean that these children can’t achieve great things on their own. Unloving, controlling or absent parents don’t just lead to a troubled childhood, but are almost always at the root of psychological difficulties in adulthood.  Nevertheless, hardships people experience when children can motivate later on in life. Performance artist Marina Abramović is an incredible example of this. Abramović was born in Belgrade, Serbia, to parents active in paramilitary groups. They were frequently absent; yet when they were home, control and order were their preferred parenting methods.  Abramović’s mother was a germophobe, and was extremely strict with her daughter. She would shake her awake if Abramović was sleeping crookedly in bed, and she also forbade Abramović to play with other children.  Abramović spent most of her early years alone, but could entertain herself, learning how to draw and paint at age three. At just 12 years old, Abramović held her first art show.  She continued to pursue art, graduating from art academies in Belgrade and in Zagreb, Croatia. It was during this time when she made a huge discovery about her relationship with art.  Abramović one day saw high-speed planes fly above her, leaving contrail lines in the blue sky. These streaks fascinated Abramović, bold drawings that appeared only to quickly disappear. She realized that art could appear from anything in the world, even from her own body. These ideas formed the core of Abramović’s long, illustrious career as a performance artist. Yet when Abramović started out, performance art wasn’t considered a legitimate art form. She was subject to harsh criticism, even ridicule. But she continued to work, creating performances where she pushed her body and mind to the limit. Today she is a worldwide success.  Teenage nerds have it tough. Fascinated by electronics yet burdened with awkward social skills, many a clever yet geeky young adult often feels excluded and alone.  Yet plenty of nerds have made it big in the modern world. Some, like Craig Newmark, got their break by combining technology with something they were never very good at – communication.  Newmark was a self-described “computer nerd” growing up. Social events were to be feared. Although a nice guy underneath, he didn’t have many friends, and this baffled him. Yet one day during a class discussion, he realized what had been holding him back: poor communication skills. Newmark knew that while he’d missed out on years of socializing in high school, all was not lost. The internet – a fairly new technology in 1995 – could give him a second chance to connect with people.  He noticed that the internet was particularly useful for connecting people and letting people help each other. Newmark decided to take the opportunity to create something online that made others feel involved and included.  So he started by simply sending emails to friends with tips about upcoming art and technology events. People got word of Newmark’s list, and asked if they could sign up. Soon list members suggested he also include information about job openings, services and even sales ads.  Not six months later, Newmark had an email with 240 listings, way too many to include in a single email. So he decided to start his own list server, named Craig’s List. In 1997, Craig’s List was getting one million page views a month. Just two years later the list became a company, called Craigslist. Newmark still runs Craigslist according to his original motto, “Give people a break.” His goal is to develop a sense of trust and belonging in urban communities across the world, and help people connect with other people to solve everyday problems.  How can you judge if you’re just ambitious or downright crazy? Although people may tell you that your goals are unreasonable, only you and your gut can say if you’re on the right track. Wendy Kopp is one leader who believes that if you feel something is worth doing, you do it.  It all started during Kopp’s freshman year at Princeton University. Eager to make a difference, she joined a student organization, and together with other members approached the CEO of a major St. Louis-based company in an effort to raise funds.  After the group’s presentation, the CEO gestured to the local, poor neighborhood visible from his window. He asked the students why he should support their goals when others had far more urgent needs. These words resonated with Kopp. Kopp then decided she would dedicate herself to a greater cause: equal education. She devised a project to improve public education by recruiting and training America’s top graduates to become teachers in low-income school districts. She estimated the project’s budget at $2.5 million, a sum her professors balked at. They insisted that she was too idealistic and there was no way she could raise the needed funds. Kopp didn’t give up and put her plan into action.  To raise money Kopp sent hundreds of letters to CEOs and business leaders. The few that responded simply told her that she was aiming too high. But this didn’t deter her.  Kopp began to recruit graduates directly. After getting more than 2,500 interested students, the media picked up on her project. Once the story went public, donors got in touch. Kopp quickly raised the funds she needed – even a $500,000 grant from former presidential candidate Ross Perot. Kopp’s program, Teach For America, commenced its training phase with 489 teachers. By moving past rejection, Kopp was able to keep her project moving until it finally got off the ground.  Do you remember what you wanted to be when you grew up? Was it perhaps a doctor, a ballerina or a fireman? Many people are still holding on to childhood dreams – and that’s okay! Yet sometimes destiny has something even more special in store.  All her life, Sara Blakely wanted to become a lawyer. She’d seen her father work in court as a child, and was determined to be just like him. But when it came to law school admission tests, Blakely failed not once – but twice.  Devastated, Blakely gave up on her dream, instead taking a job selling fax machines door-to-door, often to rather unwilling customers.  While not necessarily a fulfilling profession, this job gave Blakely one thing – an immunity to the word “no.” Customers would tear up her business card in her face or even call the police to escort her from the building, and still Blakely wouldn’t take no for an answer.  Yet Blakely wished that she was selling a product she actually cared about. Perhaps she could come up with one herself. But what would that product be?  While getting dressed to go to a party, she cut off the feet from a pair of pantyhose so she could wear them with sandals. Seeing how flattering the hose made her under her outfit, Blakely realized that this was a product she could develop and sell: comfortable, invisible shapewear.  She researched, patented and networked in secret for a year. Many local producers refused to make a prototype for her, but Blakely was so used to rejection that nothing could stop her. One factory owner however thought how his three daughters might like this product, and decided to give Blakely a chance. This was her break! Blakely’s Spanx has become a cult item, referenced on popular shows like Sex and the City and The Oprah Winfrey Show. Just imagine if she’d been admitted to law school – she’d never have become an entrepreneur or one of America’s youngest female billionaires.  Can you imagine a business leader that takes showers at public tennis courts and only has $2.50 to spend each day? Sounds unbelievable, but that’s really how tough starting a new business can be. Luxury brand owner John Paul DeJoria can attest to this.  If there was anything that DeJoria’s mother taught him, it was that success has nothing to do with money. Rather, true success stems from working hard and being happy.  There was a time in DeJoria’s childhood when just a few dimes were all that he, his brother and his mother had to their name! Despite the adversity they faced, the family knew they were happy. They had food to eat and a small garden. His childhood was the foundation of DeJoria’s approach to business. He started from the bottom, working all manner of odd jobs. But whether he was making flower boxes, driving tow trucks or selling encyclopedias door-to-door, there was one thing DeJoria always strove to do: help his customers make the right decision. This principle helped DeJoria gain more responsibility in management roles.  After working his way through different jobs, DeJoria joined forces with his friend Paul Mitchell to create one of America’s biggest professional hair-care companies, John Paul Mitchell Systems.  Yet even in the early days, DeJoria had to live out of his car! But he and Mitchell never lost faith in their enterprise, and eventually it paid off. With the success of John Paul Mitchell Systems under his belt, DeJoria has gone on to found many other businesses.  His brand Patrón is a worldwide tequila brand, frequently name-dropped in pop music; DeJoria is also active in the diamond trade. Yet regardless of venture or field, DeJoria has always stood firmly by his principles of working hard and helping customers to make the best choice. The key message in this book: The path to a successful venture is a lifelong journey, as stories of influential mentors show. Whether their childhood is full of inspiration or adversity, mentors learn from their experiences, discovering their true values and skills that would serve them well down the line.  Actionable advice:  Speak up! The next time you’re in a meeting and find that people aren’t paying attention to you, consider how your voice sounds. Is your tone nervous, sarcastic or pessimistic? If so, it’s no surprise that people would rather tune you out. Try to convey optimism and enthusiasm, and watch as you shape the discussion.

Ultimately, both set out to achieve the same goals, and yet their outcomes are vastly different. As it turns out, part of this difference lies in what we actually consider to be a strategy; in other words, losing strategies may not even be strategies at all! These blinks offer you insights into strategic thinking by drawing from the experiences of successful – and sometimes disastrously unsuccessful – cases. By examining the wisdom gathered from these different examples, you’ll learn about the anatomy of a successful strategy, how to apply it to your life or business, and how to become an effective strategic thinker. You’ll also learn: why you should be wary of sexy-sounding fluff how one man’s epiphany in Italy lead to a chain of 4,500 coffee shops how to look beneath the obvious to find the hidden powers of a situation and maximize their impact how a little geometry led to the death of 50,000 Roman soldiers and finally, you’ll grasp what all good strategies have in common – and what the bad ones lack. So what is a strategy, exactly? Consider this: the “2005 key strategy” of a major graphic arts company was a 20 percent revenue increase and a 20 percent profit margin. Does this sound like a good strategy to you? The short answer: No. In fact, these are simply goals – far removed from a working strategy. A vision or a goal is simply a stand-alone idea. A strategy, however, is a set of different ideas that includes a plan to achieve these goals. Often a goal or a vision can be a perfectly fine starting point for a strategy. However, the strategy itself must include precise information on how these goals will actually be achieved. For example, if your football coach advises your team to win the next game, he isn’t providing you with any useful information unless he tells you how to win. In other words, he must provide a plan of action – a strategy. It’s not only our goals that are often mistaken for strategies; motivational slogans and buzzwords sometimes get passed off as strategies too. This is usually made obvious by an absence of clear, simple words. In these cases, “fluff” – superficially restating the obvious while applying a heaping portion of buzzwords – takes on the appearance of high-level thinking. The fundamental strategy of one major retail bank is a perfect example – in their own words, they offered “customer-centric intermediation.” Let’s unpack this, shall we? “Intermediation” means simply that they take deposits and lend them to others, and “customer-centric” means that they focus on the customer. By taking the fluff and unraveling it into simple, meaningful language for the layman, we quickly discover that their “fundamental strategy” for banking was simply “be a bank!” What’s missing in both these business examples is a plan of action. Essentially, if you have no plan of action, then you don’t have strategy. It’s natural for each strategy to look different, since each is tailored to meet one specific need. However, there is one essential component to every successful strategy: the kernel. The kernel is composed of three parts: the first two are the diagnosis and the guiding policy. The diagnosis is a simple analysis of an often complex set of circumstances, and the guiding policy lays out the approach that will be used to tackle this diagnosis. One example of these components at work can be found with IBM in 1993. During that year, IBM was on the decline – their previously successful strategy of offering complete computers no longer worked in a fractured industry where many computer companies had started offering individual parts. While many believed that they should adapt to this fragmentation, CEO Lou Gerstner developed a different diagnosis: instead of fragmenting IBM’s different departments, they would instead integrate and centralize them to become new market leaders in IT consulting. In order to enact this diagnosis, they then created a new guiding policy that focused company resources on customer solutions. The final component of the kernel is a set of coherent actions that ensures that the guiding policy is effective. In other words, the actions needed to achieve the goals of the guiding policy can’t contradict one another. One example of a failure to establish coherent actions can be found in the Ford Motor Company. When they acquired Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin, their new guiding policy was to exploit these brands and simultaneously take advantage of economies of scale. This led them to consolidate the design and manufacturing processes between the brands. However, this approach lacked coherence, since the value of these brands lay in their unique qualities. Volvo buyers don’t want a safer version of a Jaguar, just as a Jaguar buyer doesn’t want a sportier version of a Volvo, and Ford’s strategy suffered for it. Most people don’t like to choose between two things – they’d rather just have both. Unfortunately, this is rarely possible – when forming a strategy, the choice of one thing over another is simply unavoidable. A good strategy demands that you prioritize what’s most important and focus your resources there – trying to have it all will leave you struggling. For example, in 1988 computer manufacturer Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was struggling to compete with a new type of PC. Executives couldn’t decide how they should respond to this new situation: they were torn between focusing on building ready-to-use systems, customer solutions or new microchip technology. They were told to find a compromise, but they just couldn’t, and ended up failing to choose a single direction and act on it. Finally, in 1992, their new CEO decided that they would focus on chips, but it was too little too late. By then they had missed the boat and been overtaken by competitors, and were eventually bought out by a rival company. Unfortunately, tough choices will often damage other areas of the business, and thus encounter strong opposition. However, you must have the constitution to overcome this and drive through the decision anyway. For example, Intel found itself having to make hard choices after many Japanese companies in the manufacturing market made it tough for them to compete. Their CEO, Andy Grove, was forced to make a decision and shift the company’s focus to manufacturing microprocessors. This move met opposition from many areas of the business, including the salespeople and researchers, who were attached to the old habits and processes. While it might have been less stressful to back down in the face of opposition, Grove instead persevered with this new direction. And a good thing, too: by 1992, Intel was the world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. Now that you’ve learned about the anatomy of a good strategy, the following blinks will explore how these strategies can be applied for maximum effect. Once you have a strategy,how do you use it to gain an advantage over your competitors? In short, you need to ensure that your strategy offers you leverage over your competitors, i.e., that you anticipate opportunities before your competitors have a chance to act. Anticipation, however, doesn’t mean foreseeing the future; it means having an insight into the present that enables you to spot emerging possibilities and act on them. We can gain some insight into leverage by looking at Toyota. Even while they were profiting from booming SUV sales, Toyota invested more than $1 billion into engineering hybrid electric-gasoline technologies. Why? Their insights had shown them that the dwindling supply of fossil fuels would eventually drive demand for hybrid cars, and that if they could pioneer the first acceptable hybrid technology, other manufacturers would then license their system rather than develop their own. In other words: they would gain leverage. In order to anticipate an opportunity (and thus gain leverage), you must identify your market’s central pivot point – meaning the best way to succeed in that field. The convenience store chain 7-Eleven did precisely that in Japan when they discovered that their Japanese customers easily became bored with the same selection of soft drinks. To exploit this, they identified the central pivot point: variety. To accomplish this, they created a strategy around this point. The average 7-Eleven store can stock only 50 varieties of soft drinks – only a fraction of over 200 brands available in Japan – so the firm created a system to maximize soda variety on their shelves by researching and recording local tastes. Each store would then sell a range of brands that appealed to those local tastes, thereby allowing 7-Eleven to shift an enormous variety of drinks. By identifying and focusing on the pivot point, 7-Eleven gained leverage over rivals whose stores lacked what the Japanese market wanted. By now you might be thinking that you’ve fleshed out a good strategy for your business. There is still some important work to be done! You should ask yourself: do I have the resources for this, and does it reflect my current situation? A good strategy is composed of actions that are based on your current situation and all fit together to maximize your advantage. One classic example of a pristine strategy can be found in ancient history with the military maneuvers of the Carthaginian general Hannibal. When Hannibal invaded the Roman Empire in 216 BC, he soon ran into trouble: at the battle of Cannae, he was met by a Roman army that outnumbered his troops by 85,000 to 55,000. So what did he do? He created a strategy based on his limited resources and current situation. First, he had his men form an arc, the middle of which then pulled backwards to feign a retreat as the Romans approached. The Romans then charged after the retreating soldiers and thus into the gap Hannibal’s army had left. As more Romans poured forward, they became crammed into a smaller and smaller space until they couldn’t properly swing their weapons. The sides of the arc then circled behind the Romans, and the slaughter began. Over 50,000 Romans died that day, compared to Hannibal’s 5,000 or so losses. So what can we take away from this gruesome story? Hannibal carefully considered every single action in his strategy so that each one naturally followed the last. Thus his strategy won him a decisive victory in spite of the odds against him. The best strategies, such as Hannibal’s, recognize the trade-off between resources, possible actions, and the optimization of both. Like Hannibal, you should strive to ensure that your strategy utilizes your limited resources in the most efficient way possible. The world of business is one that is constantly changing; it’s lucrative to develop strategies that take advantage of these shifts, but how do you make it happen? In many cases, the biggest effects of changes will be so obvious that they can’t offer you any clear advantages. However, with these effects come many other opportunities if you look for the less obvious second-order effects. For example, when television first emerged, it was easy to anticipate that free TV would produce huge competition for movie theaters. Yet there were many second-order effects, which were much harder to predict. One involved the organization of Hollywood studios. In the past, these studios had a captive audience. But that audience disappeared with the advent of the television, so they had to make up for this lost revenue by taking up roles financing independent films that could draw specialist audiences to the cinema. Indie directors and writers therefore benefited from major studio funding to produce their specialist films, thus enjoying the hidden second-order effect of television’s introduction to the market. However, in some markets changes are relatively rare due to the prohibitive cost of improving the existing technologies. In these cases, you can create changes through innovation. For example, in the 1960s black and white photographic film had been improved upon to the point where investments in fresh research no longer provided a worthwhile return. This made it difficult for newer companies to challenge the Goliaths of the industry, such as Ilford in the UK and Ansco in the United States. However, a few smaller companies, such as Kodak and Fuji, did challenge these giants’ market share by developing color film, where the opportunities were far more plentiful. By further developing this new technology and making it more effective, these companies instigated a change in the market and managed to rise to the top. Now that you understand the nuts and bolts of a strategy, it's time to ask yourself how a strategy turns visions into realities. In most cases they do this by maximizing competitive advantage – namely the ability to produce more value at lower costs than competitors. So how can you engineer a strategy that accomplishes this? One way is to use isolation mechanisms, which give you a competitive advantage in an area by limiting your competitors’ opportunities. For example, Apple’s iPhone is protected by many isolation mechanisms working in concert: the brand name, the company’s reputation, and then the complementary iTunes service with its huge media database. These factors make it difficult for competitors to create rival products; not only are they competing with that product, but also with its marketing, its comprehensive operating system and its image. Apple has so effectively cornered its market that the only opportunity for a competitor to enter would be to sell a comparable product at a lower price, which is certainly no small feat. Another way to achieve competitive advantage is by creating a higher demand for any of the resources you have at your disposal. One example of this is the marketing methods of the POM Wonderful pomegranate juice company. While pomegranates were originally only a minor crop in their orchards, the owners realized that they made more money per acre from pomegranates than from other crops. They then invested in research, discovering previously unknown health benefits from pomegranates, and bought 6,000 acres for cultivating pomegranates, thus increasing US pomegranate production capacity six fold. They then starting selling their pomegranate juice as a fresh fruit drink, emphasizing its many health benefits. And because they were now the largest producer of pomegranates, they were able to reap all the rewards of the high demand that they had created, without having to share with other manufacturers or competitors! Now that you’ve learned how to successfully implement your strategies, the following blinks will reveal how to become a great strategist. So you now know about the components of a good strategy and how they can and have been used in real-life scenarios, but how can you become an effective strategist? You must first start making strategic hypotheses – educated estimations of how a given situation works or could work, which help when you contemplate your strategy. As an example, consider this hypothesis, developed by Howard Schultz after a visit to Italy in 1983: “The Italian espresso experience could be re-created in America and the public would embrace it.” Schultz was awed by the grace and flair of Italian coffee bars, where expensive coffee was served in a relaxed social setting, and struck by the contrast to the coffee culture in America, where the mass market was comprised of cheap, bland coffee. Having developed his hypothesis he decided to test it by convincing his employers at a roasting company in Seattle to give him space to set up a small espresso bar. That company was Starbucks. Like Schultz, you too should test your hypothesis to gather new information, and form new hypotheses based on those results. Schultz started by copying the Italian original, but he soon noticed that Americans preferred lounging in chairs to standing at the bar, so he introduced chairs and tables. He then discovered that many American customers wanted their coffee to go, so he introduced paper cups. What can we learn from his success? He tested his hypothesis, which was recreating the Italian espresso experience – but needed to modify it for American preferences in order for them to truly embrace it. His company then purchased Starbucks’ retail and trademark in 1987, and by 2001 brought in $2.6 billion in revenue. Indeed, strategy is much like a science: we must come up with a possible explanation, or working hypothesis, and constantly refine it. Statistically, you’re five times more likely to have a car accident if you’re talking on a cell phone while driving – roughly the same as if you’re drunk. However, though many people are aware of this fact, when faced with a decision they tend to think: “It won’t happen to me, I am a good driver.” This phenomenon is called the inside view – the tendency to ignore lessons others have learned in a similar situation and to believe that our specific situation is somehow different. Many of us follow the inside view, and so often the results are fatal. The 2008 financial crisis is a perfect example. In the years preceding the crisis, it was widely believed that the economic histories of other nations were no longer relevant to modern America, and many thought that the Federal Reserve’s expertise had finally eliminated economic booms and busts entirely. This inside-view thinking caused people to ignore problems within the system, which then led to the greatest financial crisis in half a century. In order to avoid this disastrous way of thinking, we should seek to gain perspective by closely scrutinizing a situation from the outside view. A good strategy does this by asking: Why have other people in a similar situation to mine succeeded or failed? In addition, a good strategy recognizes that in the vast majority of cases, our situation is far less unique than we might imagine. The 2008 financial crisis could have been avoided if analysts had looked at financial history with an outside view, and realized that crises always happen. Similarly, how many accidents do you think could have been avoided if people looked at the statistics with an outside view? Good strategies benefit from paying close attention to other people’s experiences and the lessons they’ve gained from those experiences. The key message in this book: Luckily we can all learn how to become good strategists. By understanding what makes a solid strategy and by finding the hidden power of a given situation, be it leveraging, maximizing your resources or anticipating change, you too can become an effective strategist. Actionable advice: Get your priorities straight. Trying to accomplish all your goals at once makes for an ineffective strategy. Instead, make a list with the most important things that you can work on and start with them first. By producing this list, you ensure that your various objectives have unity in direction, and can then clear up conflicting issues. Take lessons from the past. If you find yourself in a situation that other people have experienced previously, pay close attention to how it turned out for them. Try to look at your own situation objectively rather than assuming that it’s somehow different to what happened in the past. Think like a scientist. If you feel uncertain about what the deciding factors in a situation are, form a hypothesis and test it out. This test will offer you insight into which areas need to be readjusted, thus helping you move closer to a solid understanding of your situation that you can use to build an effective strategy.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

He captures examples of entrepreneurs and organizations helping themselves and their employees by encouraging passion and productivity at work. These high performers share five skills: asking the right question; seeing for themselves; talking to their outer circle; improving the mix; and delivering the difference. You’ll find out that making a difference and doing great work just means finding out what people truly love. You will learn how to make a difference that people take to heart, and to go on making a difference throughout your career. In these blink you will learn the story behind The Cat in the Hat; how Instagram was created from a single feature of a completely different app; and how the inventor of instant photography came up with the Polaroid. Imagine that you’re recovering from surgery in a hospital. Which would you prefer: a janitor who noisily rushes through his cleaning routine in the ward, or one who recognizes your suffering, and works carefully and quietly? Clearly, the way this janitor does his job affects your well-being. In the same way, the way you do your job will always have a huge impact on others. Yet most of us work with our heads down, so immersed in checking off our daily to-do list that we miss all of the other factors in work life. The noisy janitor, for example, isn’t trying to be insensitive. He’s just preoccupied with getting all the rooms cleaned as quickly as possible. However, we can broaden our perspective by working with our head up. Job crafting can help us change our perception of work – from being something we just need to do, to a vehicle through which we can make a positive difference in people’s lives. In this example, it means the janitor changing his routine so he causes the least disturbance and noise. But crafting your job isn’t enough. You can also reframe in order to discover what benefits you can provide for others. Reframing is when you make a mental link between your job and a greater purpose: its value to society and its potential to make a difference. Reframing is about considering how your work affects others, and trying to see a larger purpose beyond the immediate goals of your job. A hospital janitor might see the potential to improve patients’ mood simply by talking to them and making subtle rearrangements in their rooms. You too can take your work beyond the to-do list by reframing your role. Would you consider the person who invented the wheel to be a great inventor? Yes? Then what about the one who invented the axle? The wheel was a smart piece of work, but good work is just the starting point – the foundation upon which great work is made. Civilization’s game-changing innovations are the result of adding and tweaking good ideas and inventions in order to create something even better. As Carl Sagan said: “If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.” You need the ingredients – such as apple, wheat and cinnamon – to exist before you can turn them into delicious apple pie. However, if you only build upon what you already have, you’re placing considerable constraints on what you can do. But don’t see this as a problem; these constraints are actually the ideal starting point. They can lead to amazing creativity. For example, when illustrator Ted Geisel was trying to make a positive change in the way children learn to read, his boss narrowed down his options: he could use only the 225 words that every six-year-old knows – most of which are two syllables long and few of which are verbs – and then write a story they could read. Rather than becoming frustrated by the limitations of this project, he embraced them as a challenge. His breakthrough came when he found two words on this restrictive list that rhymed: “cat” and “hat.” In 1957 he published the first version of The Cat in the Hat and forever changed children’s literature. Geisel is the author you know as Dr Seuss, and his works remain popular to this day. In 1944 a three-year-old girl asked her father the right question as he was taking a picture of her: Why couldn’t she see the photo right there and then? Her father explained that the films needed to be developed in various chemical baths in a darkroom. For the kid, this answer meant nothing. Fortunately, her dad decided he didn’t like that answer either, and set out to do something about it. Great work comes from taking the time to question what’s missing in our lives that the rest of the world would love, too. Everything we use in our day-to-day existence was formed by the question of whether there are improvements that could be made to the status quo. Back to the three-year-old girl: three years after she asked about the picture, her father, Edwin Land, gave the world something that people would love when he co-founded the Polaroid Corporation, forever revolutionizing photo development with the creation of instant photography. When asking yourself these crucial questions, make sure you keep three things in mind: Tackle the problem. Problems are opportunities, so don’t run away from them! Edwin Land wasn’t satisfied with the initial answer he gave his daughter, and decided instead to look more closely at the question she asked. Consider what you’re good at and try to use it in your solution. Land had worked with a group of scientists to create a polarizing filter for sunglasses. He put this knowledge to use when answering his daughter’s question. Think outside the box. Think big! Try to imagine what kinds of things people would love if anything were possible. By asking the right questions and applying the right attitude, you’ll be able to change the world for the better. Today, Netflix is a household name with global success, which makes it easy to forget that, earlier on in their existence, the company was in serious trouble. At that time a large part of their business involved mailing DVDs to customers, who then returned them. But mail sorting machines destroyed DVDs packaged in normal envelopes. This was costing the company loads of money, but it only took a trip to the sorting office for Netflix co-founder Jim Cook to find a solution: a low-cost “Netflix Envelope” sturdy enough to protect DVDs. So what can we learn from this? Essentially, the best work often comes when you take a look for yourself. We all see things differently, and our own perspective draws on our own ideas and our personal knowledge. Seeing things for yourself isn’t just about being observant of the things around you – you can also gain perspective from looking into the past. Take a page out of Amazon’s or iTunes’ books: they’re constantly looking into your search and purchase history in order to see what you might be interested in now. You too can find patterns in the past, and use them to form insights about how to give people what they love. One of Whirlpool’s most famous products resulted from an examination of the past. After considering trends in washing machines over the years, they reintroduced the top loader, which would become one of Whirlpool’s most successful projects ever. Did you know that 80 percent of the 16,000 words that we utter each day are spoken to the same five-to-eight person group of friends and trusted confidants? That leaves you with only 3,000 words for the people you don’t usually talk to – and it’s these people who have the greatest impact on your creativity. Talking to people you don’t usually talk to can lead to ideas that you couldn’t put together on your own. Your inner circle is a comfortable place to start conversations about your ideas and aspirations. However, because they think like you, support you and don’t want to hurt your feelings, you can’t count on their objectivity, and this can put you at a disadvantage. But we do find divergent thinking, unexpected questions, difference of opinion and added expertise from our outside circle – people who operate beyond our more intimate peer group. These people will give you feedback that contradicts your ideas, and that’s an asset, because it shows you how your ideas or approach might be going wrong. But it’s crucial that this challenging feedback is high quality. You can obtain this by presenting your ideas to others in a way that taps into their desire to share their opinion. You aren’t merely asking them to solve your problem for you, you’re inviting them to participate in making a difference. This shared responsibility gives them an opportunity to focus their insights and talent in a way that is meaningful to them. Simple phrases like “Can I get your thoughts on something?” “I have this idea but don’t know where to start, so can you help me?” or “Have you had any experience with something like this before?” can be great starting places for productive conversations. Whatever you do, make sure that you don’t limit your conversations with outsiders to just 3,000 words! So far, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about how to approach work in a way that will give you positive, creative ideas. But this isn’t all. You must also edit and improve your ideas before implementing them in order to make a difference people love. Great workers create changes in their mind before making them a reality. Your goal should be to model, adjust and play with your awesome ideas before executing them, if you want to give them the greatest chance for success. There are three tricks which can help you along the way. First, add something new. Simple additions that lead to massive improvements are all around us: just think of the rolling suitcase (suitcase plus wheels) or heated car seat (car seat plus heater). Start by brainstorming with a ton of ideas, always asking yourself whether these additions improve the product or concept and whether people will love it. Also keep in mind that these additions must be useful. Sometimes we’re so eager to innovate that we end up with additions no one cares about. How many of your remote control’s features do you actually use, for example? And how many are just annoying or confusing? Second, you can improve by simplifying. When we want to improve something, our first impulse is to add to it. But additions don’t always lead to improvement. In fact, removing things can be a great way to make a difference that people love. Think of the iPod: by removing a set of buttons and replacing them with a scrolling wheel, Apple removed complexity from their MP3 player while also making it a design icon. In essence, look at the features that people don’t love. Those are the ones you can probably remove. Finally, harmonize all your ideas. Your ideas for improvement should be clearly related to one another. Make sure that everything works together. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger once created an app which they named Burbn. The app was designed to allow users to share their location with friends, as well as share photos. Never heard of it? That’s because it was a complete failure. People didn’t care about “checking in,” and the app was too slow and had too many features. This kind of failure is common with new ideas; it’s how you handle these failures that will separate you from everyone else. Great work does not end once the product is complete. It ends when you make a difference. However, to change this definition of “complete,” you need a growth mind-set rather than a fixed mind-set. People with fixed mind-sets believe that their successes are the result of their natural ability and intelligence, and don’t pay attention to negative feedback or learn from failure. On the other hand, people with a growth mind-set know that success isn’t innate – it’s the result of learning and failing. They’re always open to improvements led by feedback, good or bad. Systrom and Krieger could have easily given up on Burbn, or fixed its obvious errors. Instead, they embraced a growth mind-set, opting to find out whether their app had a redeeming quality that people loved. The answer was “photo sharing.” They took this information and ran with it. They added cool filters and borders and made the photos shareable across multiple social network platforms, and finally relaunched their app in 2010 under a new name: Instagram. The key message in this book: Everyone can make a difference in their work, as long as they have the right mind-set and a willingness to explore. By mastering the five skills of asking, seeing, talking, improving the mix and delivering the difference, you too can make a difference that people love. Actionable advice: Don't lock yourself inside your inner circle.  Close colleagues and old friends offer a kind of ease and comfort that allows us to freely share ideas, but this familiarity can actually stifle your creativity. The next time you have an idea, invite outsiders into the conversation in order to learn from their unique perspective.

When starting from scratch, you’ve got to grab that big idea, set priorities, stay lean but choose the right staff, and so on. In these blinks, successful entrepreneur and author Jason Fried shares with you his insights on the challenges of creating, launching and managing a new product, based on his personal experience with his own web-application development start-up. Yet the wisdom here isn’t just for app jockeys. What you’ll learn is essential information for anyone looking to succeed in today’s business world, whether corporate executives, marketers or designers. The bottom line? Cut out the fluff and get to the core of your idea – if you want to win, it’s time to get real. In these blinks, you’ll discover why trying to do what the competition is doing is a sure way to fail; why you should chose a generalist over a specialist every time; and how you can find your own personal work zone. Has anyone ever told you that when starting a business, a surefire strategy is to identify the most competitive company in your industry and copy it? Well, this strategy is dead wrong. Instead of trying to mimic successful companies, do the opposite: underdo your competitors. Committing yourself to perpetually trying to one-up the competition is a dead end. What’s more, such strategies often result in the creation of overly complicated, poorly working products.  That’s why the better idea is to do less. For instance, if your competitor makes a product that offers ten features, you should create one with just five features. By selling a product with fewer options, you’ll position yourself as the company with the simple, quality choice – and leave the complicated projects to the people with the established resources to take them on. But how can you tell which features of your new product are the essential ones? Simply build a product you personally would want, as you can be sure that others will want it, too. That’s because people who are like you probably share problems similar to your own. So, by making something that solves your own issues, you become your own target audience – which means saving time and money on surveys and customer feedback. Take Basecamp, the author’s first web application. His web design company was in need of a communication tool for keeping in touch with clients and following up on projects. Since he couldn’t find a good option in the market, he just made his own!  And guess what? Basecamp was an instant hit. But remember, when building your own product to your own specifications, it’s essential to avoid seeking external funding to do so. If you line up a bunch of investors, you’ll soon be answering to their specific demands for involved market research and a competitive product. At least at first, it’s smarter to begin with whatever cash you have in hand and remain your own boss. Every entrepreneur wants to strike it big, but it’s important not to take things too fast. After all, physics tells us that the heavier the mass, the harder it is to change its direction.  This means that being small keeps your business agile and adaptable, able to hold on to good ideas while quickly dropping bad ones. For instance, say virtual reality becomes a must-have for consumers overnight. Which company would be able to quickly add virtual reality software to its apps? One with hundreds of employees, a product with loads of features and a 24-month strategic plan – or a small, flexible start-up? It’s cases like these in which big-timers are jealous of smaller, nimbler competitors and the razor-sharp reaction time many start-ups can boast. So if staying small and flexible is key, how can you keep a growing company lean? Well, this depends on your strategic decisions. If you hire excess staff, make long-term, inflexible strategic plans or fill your days with endless, unproductive meetings, your company will get bulky, and fast. On the other hand, if you seek simplicity, maintain small teams and create pared-down yet effective products, your company will remain lean.  The strategy here is the rule of three. Three people is enough manpower to begin work while remaining agile. For instance, if you are building a web application, you should start with a developer, a designer and a sweeper; that is, a person who mediates between design and development. For anything other than web applications, you should have one person who handles the core technology related to your product, one who deals with business development and one in charge of financial issues. And if you find that three people isn’t enough to develop your first product version, you’re probably being too ambitious and should scale down your idea. Just like being in a hurry to grow your company can get you into trouble, rushing a product to market is a sure route to failure. Before you throw that app out there, you need to establish priorities first. For starters, you’ll need to articulate your big idea concisely by answering a few questions. This will help you outline your vision for your product. Ask yourself, “Why does my product exist?” and “What makes it different from the competition’s product?” Take the author’s Ta-Da List application, an electronic to-do list. His vision was simply to “compete with a Post-it.” Importantly, you should be targeting a niche group of customers who are really excited about your product, instead of trying to please a general audience. During this early stage of development, it’s also important not to pay too much attention to details. Focusing on details can produce petty arguments about unimportant things, and that means needless delays and potentially compromised products. So try to avoid nitpicking. You’ll have plenty of time to be a perfectionist later! Consider the process of drawing. When you draw a picture, you don’t start with minute details; you begin by getting the general proportions correct, sketching out the broad outlines of a scene. Only once you have a framework do you start refining the picture and adding detail. Another important reminder is to avoid wasting time concerning yourself with future problems that could potentially arise. While it’s essential for companies to find ways to scale, or expand, there’s no need to worry about such issues at this early stage. After all, once you launch your product, you’ll then have time to gather the market data you’ll need to progressively grow and improve. When your product logs its millionth user, for example, you’ll have to ensure your servers can handle the traffic – but until then, you’ve more urgent matters! When setting up a new business, time is of the essence. Unfortunately, there are plenty of ways to waste it. You need to optimize your schedule – here’s a few tips to help you do so. First, you’re at your most productive when your surroundings melt away and don’t distract you. This is why so many people enjoy working either early in the morning or late at night. During these quiet times you can easily get into the zone – a state of mind when you are totally focused on work. Getting in the zone isn’t difficult; you just need to avoid being interrupted. Try to devote half of the work day to maintaining a distraction-free space – a time when no one talks to each other, answers the phone or responds to email. For this same reason, it’s helpful to avoid meetings, at least long ones. Every minute spent in a meeting is a minute that’s not spent getting real work done. In fact, meetings tend to focus on abstract ideas and rarely handle concrete problems. In short, they’re not about real things. So to avoid wasting precious time, limit meetings to a strict 30 minutes. You should also invite as few people as possible to a meeting, and refuse to attend if a meeting has no clear agenda. Another way to save time is by avoiding too much back-and-forth communication. It’s important not to “silo” your company’s activities. Unfortunately, plenty of businesses create specialized departments for development, design and other areas, yet in the process build impenetrable walls between each group. The problem with this silo strategy is that employees can’t see beyond their area of expertise, which means they miss the greater context of a company project. To avoid this, create integrated teams to foster healthy dialogue across specialties. Copywriters should work with designers, for instance, and developers should work with customer support. In doing so, customer problems will be solved faster, as information will come from the source. If you’re not already aware, you’ll learn soon enough that you can’t do everything yourself. But how do you pick the right people to help you realize your big idea? When starting off with a small crew – like you should – you don’t want to put together an “A-Team” but instead choose a well-rounded group of broadly talented individuals. The success of a small team doesn’t depend on the perfect mastery of a particular skill set. In fact, such specialization renders many experts incapable of performing tasks outside their focus area.  A valuable team member is a person with a specialty, but also someone who can help out with other issues. For instance, it’s essential for software companies to find developers who can both code and understand design. Being familiar with both disciplines can help developers preemptively adapt programming work to design demands, for example. It’s also always a better call to bring on a worker of average skill and genuine enthusiasm over a grumpy expert. During your first development stages, enthusiasm is crucial to boosting growth and supporting your team’s morale. Often the best option is to select someone who used to work in a large, impersonal corporate environment. After such a sterile experience, he’ll be overjoyed to join your agile start-up and will bring this energy and enthusiasm to the group. That being said, it’s smart to delay hiring as long as possible prior to your product launch. After all, assimilating too many new people into your company can mean major headaches if they don’t fit into the company culture. This can lead to miscommunication and potentially personality clashes. If you can, find another way to get the job done without hiring new team members, even if it means scaling back your project’s ambitions. Remember, staying lean is essential to your success! As a new entrepreneur, it can be difficult to manage your product’s features, but it’s essential to exercise discipline when choosing the elements your application will offer. You should be fine as long as you stick to the author’s motto: it’s better to launch half a product than a half-assed product.  To avoid building a half-assed product, you should be comfortable with launching your idea before it’s completely realized. The result will be a lean, simple and smart product that forms a good foundation on which your company can then build and improve. The original version of Facebook, for example, was relatively rough and much less developed than the version you use today. But Mark Zuckerberg launched his product as soon as it was good enough to capture his desired market. He then worked slowly to refine the site, adding features one by one. Don’t worry – it’s okay to limit the options your product offers. Just think about all of your product’s features, and divide that number by two. Now you’ll have pared your product down to its basic features; if you divide that number by two again, you’ll be left with its most essential features!  Say you’re about to launch a chat application. Your users will probably want many different formatting features, like the ability to bold, italicize and colorize fonts. But do such features really matter? Often, the answer is no – and that’s how you should answer requests for more features. That’s exactly what Steve Jobs said when he was asked about “missing” features during a private presentation for Apple’s iTunes store. He didn’t want the app to offer a thousand features that would make it ugly. His reasoning was that innovation lies in “saying no to all but the most crucial features.” First impressions are crucial, and the same holds for software applications. Since your product’s interface is the first thing a user interacts with, your interface essentially is your product. This means it’s important to take care of the interface early on in your development process. In fact, when it comes to web applications, dialing in the interface should even come before the bulk of programming. If you go the other way around, you’ll quickly find that programming becomes the hardest part of the job. If your interface is weak, you’ll face an extremely complicated and expensive challenge in cleaning it up or improving it. To build a killer interface, you need to focus on the core element of each page, and leave the rest for later. To determine what a page’s core is, ask yourself: “What’s the essence of this page?” and “Which element is vital to its comprehension?” If you’re building a blog, for example, the core of the page will naturally not be the page header or menu sidebar, but the blog post! So you should start with the blog post unit before moving on to other aspects of the page. A strong interface also depends in large part on the quality of the preferences you offer. To keep things simple, skip preferences altogether. Here’s why this is good advice: Preferences are aspects of your application that your users can customize. For instance, an app that lets a user read an ebook on a smartphone may offer options to change the size and style of the font, among other things. So as you build your web application, it can be tempting to avoid making design decisions by letting the user instead make them through preferences. But really, you should avoid this solution. That’s because each customization you offer means more code, extra developing, further testing and loads of other complications. Endless lists of options might be a pain for the user as well! So your product is ready and you’re set to release it to the market. But first you’ll need to strategize, as it’s essential to ensure that access to your product is painless and straightforward for the user. It’s especially important to make the process of signing up as trouble-free as possible for your target audience. Your website could show a message like, “Sign up and login in under a minute!” The goal here is to seamlessly convert visitors into actual customers without requiring them to give any thought to the process. But it’s also a good idea to give potential customers the chance to test your product without handing over payment information. Beyond this, there are a few more points to keep in mind at launch. First, long-term contracts are a pain; avoid them. Customers will hesitate to sign up for anything that binds them to a long-term agreement with early-termination fees, or charges incurred for breaking a contract early.  Instead, offer monthly billing without contracts or penalties. If you try to employ sneaky tactics for raking in more money, it will only backfire! Second, offering free samples is an excellent way to bring in new customers. With the constant flow of information and advertising in the market, it’s difficult for a new company to grab a potential user’s attention. So to get the exposure you need, consider offering freebies. That’s exactly how Apple built up its line of music products. The company offered the iTunes software for free, building interest in its iPod and iTunes store. Essentially, the software acted as bait to attract new customers. And lastly, when it comes to promoting your product, it’s important to blog about it. Traditional advertising is both expensive and questionably effective. In contrast, blogging is a casual and inexpensive way to reach your audience quickly and present your offer in detail. The key message in this book:  Web application development might seem like a niche field, but many techniques that make app developers successful apply to all forms of entrepreneurship. Regardless of your project goals, it’s essential to stay organized, hire intelligently and strategically promote your product.  Actionable advice: Embrace your size. Small companies should use their size to their advantage, and communication is one arena in which they can excel. Bigger companies tend to sound like impersonal corporate robots, spitting jargon at customers. Small companies in contrast can be personable, friendly and direct. So don’t make the mistake of pretending to be bigger than you are. Embrace instead your leanness and talk to customers like a human! Got feedback?

Maybe you think that you just weren’t talented enough. However, as these blinks will show you, talent is not enough. What you need is grit. Grit is what made Michael Jordan such a successful basketball player, it’s what made the iPhone possible and the reason you know who Oprah Winfrey is. So what is grit? It’s the ability to work hard and have a get-back-on-the-horse-again mentality. It’s what you need to develop if you want to fulfill your dreams.  In these blinks, you’ll learn why daydreams can be dangerous; how Jia Jang’s failure as an entrepreneur made him famous; and how to write a bestseller at the age of 98. Have you ever had the feeling that others excelled without trying, seemingly coasting on their talent? In schools the world over, some kids never study yet get great grades while others are bent over their books all the time just to keep up. But the truth is that those who rely on talent won’t get far in life. In fact, talent is totally overrated. That’s because plenty of talented people have the potential for greatness, but realize from a young age that they can get by on their talent without hard work. On the other hand, less-talented people strive for success and self-improvement. They seek out subjects and jobs they care about, not just ones they are naturally good at.  So, while it might seem as though talented people are the winners of the world, it’s actually those that have to work harder who end up being the most successful. That’s because while talented people dream, others achieve.  Take a look at a study conducted in New York by the psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen comparing the study habits and later careers of graduate students. The analysis found that the students who spent more time daydreaming about their aspirations than actually knuckling down to work ended up with fewer job offers and smaller paychecks following graduation than those who put in long hours!  Hard work will help get you the job you want. For instance, the authors run an advertising agency, and a few years ago they were desperate to land a big new client – the restaurant giant Wendy’s.  Their strategy? They pulled 70- and 80-hour weeks for months, even going as far as to work at Wendy’s themselves to learn the inside scoop on their operations. Not a waking minute went by that they weren’t preparing for their presentation. Well, they landed the contract and Wendy’s said they chose the firm because they worked the hardest – and therefore would be the best. When the highwire artist Nick Wallenda traversed the Grand Canyon on a 1,400-foot-long wire, he slipped and had no safety net to catch him. But he didn’t fall. Instead, using nothing but his ability and intensive training, he managed to stay on the wire.  And just like Nick, there’s going to come a time in your career when you need to lose the proverbial safety net. That’s because if you’ve got grit and passion, your career will take off, and if you want to ride the rising tide of this success you will have to let go of your safe zone. This is the moment when people with grit start taking calculated risks and diving headfirst into uncharted waters. But that doesn’t mean you should jump into just any situation. For instance, say you’re the CEO of a company and are itching to enter a new market. It’s essential to scope out the risks and competition first, because there’s nothing worse than failing to assess potential dangers and taking your company down as a result.  However, if you do fall short, grit will help you embrace and learn from rejection. For example, maybe you were an aspiring entrepreneur but couldn’t face being turned down by investors. Well, while rejection might sting, you can always shine a positive light on it.  Just take Jia Jiang, who left the safety of his tech job and, inspired by Steve Jobs, set out as an entrepreneur. He kept getting rejected and pretty soon was on the verge of giving up, but instead buckled down and turned his rejection to his advantage by starting the 100 Days of Rejection project. Jiang endeavored to do a different task every day for a hundred days – like ordering just a quarter of a shrimp at a restaurant or trying to borrow $100 from a stranger – each of which was meant to help him overcome his fear of rejection. He put his project online and became famous in the process. Now he’s got a book deal and has appeared on TED talks.  Did you know that Van Gogh only sold one painting before he died? It might come as a shock since his paintings have wowed art lovers across the world and fetched record-breaking prices. But even though he didn’t get recognition during his lifetime, Van Gogh still produced over 2,000 paintings! How? Through dedication and grit.  That’s because most projects take a long time to make real progress and even longer to find success. As a result, many people lose motivation and patience halfway through and simply give up. But there’s another option. You can keep motivated during long-term projects by taking joy in the little achievements that mark your way. For instance, state attorney Mike Moore, made famous by his legal battle against Big Tobacco, spent years trying to hold huge tobacco conglomerates responsible for countless lung cancer-related deaths. But his attempts were rejected time and time again by a variety of different state attorneys.  However, over the years, he slowly built a stellar team, was motivated by the small measures of support he did receive from other state attorneys and finally got the courts to force tobacco companies to pay $100 billion to 46 different states, covering the medical costs of smoking. But some people will feel that as they get older, less is possible. Therefore, it’s essential that as you age, you keep your motivation up and never settle. Instead, make productive use of your time by planning every year. Don’t let a “not-yet” attitude rule your decisions and never feel like you’re too old to do the things you’re passionate about. You aren’t too old, and you never will be.  For instance, Captain James Henry, who was raised on a farm but went on to become a fisherman, didn’t learn to read until he was 92. Not just that, but he wrote an autobiographical bestseller called In A Fisherman’s Language at the ripe age of 98. We’ve all experienced failure and everyone knows it can be tough. However, it’s not your failures that define you, but what you do with them. For instance, even star poker players are dealt losing hands some of the time, but the best of them know how to learn from their mistakes and grow through them. And it’s not just true for card players. Regardless of what you do, over the course of your career you’ll inevitably face failure and seemingly insurmountable obstacles, but every single one of these challenges is a chance to learn and improve. For instance, Eleanor Longden was diagnosed schizophrenic after hearing voices in her head that played on her most deep-seated fears of failure and abandonment.  But she didn’t let her illness defeat her. Instead she began studying psychology, earned her Ph.D. and is now on the board of a global support and research organization that helps people with the same mental illness she has.  However, rising from adversity doesn’t mean that grit should come from the fear of losing everything. Instead, it should be about gaining more than you’d ever imagined. In fact, people with grit aren’t successful because they fear failure, but because they see what they stand to gain by accomplishing their goals.  This way of thinking enables people with grit to accomplish what seems impossible and conquer any challenge they meet. In other words, they don’t fail, they fail forward. For instance, early on, Oprah Winfrey was demoted from her first job as a television anchor because her boss didn’t think she was “made for TV.” But obviously she didn’t give up. She was determined to succeed and we all know how she turned out: one of the biggest TV stars in history. Do you ever wonder how humans thousands of years ago managed to survive, despite the elements, diseases and wild animals? The key to their success was group work: helping each other, sharing food and increasing each other’s quality of life was essential to the development of the first human communities. The same is true today. In fact, helping others will actually boost your own motivation. For instance, have you ever lent a hand to an elderly women by carrying her heavy bags? Have you offered a blanket, shelter or food to a homeless person? If you have done these things, or anything like them, you’ve probably felt like a better person and experienced a wave of gratification. Well, it’s this gratification that can increase your grit. Just take Navyn Salen, who used to be a stay-at-home mom with three kids. One day she made the decision to help African children suffering from malnutrition. It took her years to build an NGO and the necessary support to expand her network, but after years of investing her every free moment, she has now managed to help over 2.5 million children in 44 countries. So, helping other people can lead you to do things you wouldn’t have thought possible, but it also helps you build character and meet new people. That’s because helping others will give you a deeper connection to your own emotions and personality. For instance, you’ll see that you can act selflessly and be kind. But you’ll also meet other like-minded people to collaborate with – something that will take your work to the next level. Not just that, but once you meet people who share your values, why not offer some of your grit to them? It’s easy, just teach other people to be kind, resilient, and to persevere. The result will be increased motivation for everyone involved. The key message in this book: The key to success is grit: resilience, patience, passion and hard work. So, instead of daydreaming and coasting on your natural abilities, buckle down and strive for your goals. Doing so means using failure to your advantage, taking calculated risks and courageously facing the unknown.  Actionable advice: Two birds with one stone: run a marathon and give up junk food. Lots of people wish they could run a marathon yet many of us still spend Saturday sprawled on the couch with a bag of chips. But it’s easy to meet this goal while kicking your junk food habit. Just make a training plan and every time you feel tempted to indulge in fast food, reach for your running shoes instead!

Easier said than done, right? After all, with hundreds of different growth models out there, how do you choose the one that’s right for you and your business? Luckily, there’s an expert on hand to help you navigate the murky waters of business strategy: Tiffani Bova, an internationally acclaimed expert who’s literally written the book on how companies can continue growing in the face of stiff competition and an endlessly changing marketplace. Full of practical, no-nonsense advice and illuminating examples gleaned from today’s top international players, this growth guide cuts out the clutter and focuses on ten key strategies you can start implementing today. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how Marvel revived its flagging business by diversifying its product portfolio; why McDonald’s returned to growth after listening to its customers; and why minimizing customer turnover is just as important as winning clients. What makes a business competitive? The most common answer is price. But do you remember how much you spent last time you went shopping? Probably not. How about the last time you had a truly awful customer experience? Now that’s something you can’t forget! So it’s not price but customer experience that’s key to gaining comparative advantage, especially in an era of instantly accessible online customer reviews. In fact, research shows that over 70 percent of customers use reviews to decide which service or product to buy. Acting on that insight is the jet fuel that can get your company off the ground. Take it from Shake Shack, a business that started out in 2004 as a single hot dog cart in New York’s Madison Square Park. Today, it’s a global fast food chain with 136 locations across the world. Its meteoric rise hinged on one thing: a business model that prioritized customer service. Shake Shack, in addition to using high-quality, locally sourced meat, encouraged customers to provide feedback and hosted roundtable discussions. The result? A huge number of positive reviews and posts across the web, which basically means Shake Shack’s customers take care of its marketing! Neglecting customer experience, by contrast, can quickly undermine a business. That’s something Starbucks learned the hard way. In 2007, after a series of expansions into new markets and the introduction of larger menus, the coffee chain’s growth suddenly stalled. When Starbucks asked its customers for feedback, the message came back loud and clear: the emphasis on growth and diversification had ended up undermining quality. CEO Howard Schultz reacted quickly, closing over 7,000 stores for three-and-a-half-hour training sessions and installing high-end Mastrena coffee machines in every outlet. The company also launched a scheme called “My Starbucks Idea,” which encouraged customers to share their ideas about how the company could improve its customer experience. It was a savvy move. Within two years of the decision to reprioritize customer experience, Starbucks was back on track and growing steadily. Growth is all about acquiring new customers, right? Well, not quite. In fact, the obsession with expansion often leads businesses to neglect their existing customers, causing all sorts of problems down the road. That means your best bet is to make sure you’re taking proper care of your customer base. According to an article published in the Harvard Business Review in 2014, it’s certainly the most efficient approach. Winning new clients costs anywhere from five to twenty-five times more than retaining an existing customer. The key to getting the most out of your customer base is data. If you know what your customers like and need, it simply makes sense to focus on them and work toward enhancing their experience and expanding the range of products they buy from you. Repeat customers are both more likely to try out new products and forgive your company when it makes a mistake. Establishing such a relationship is known as customer base penetration. To pull it off, you’ll need to really get to know your customers. Take it from the fast food giant McDonald’s. When the company’s growth rates slumped in 2006, it expanded its menu options in the hope of attracting new customers. The strategy didn’t work. With a menu featuring around 120 items, the company’s employees couldn’t keep up and service quality declined while waiting times increased. It was time for a rethink. What, they asked themselves, did people who eat in their restaurants really want? One thing their customers had been asking for was an all-day breakfast. McDonald’s decided to listen and introduced the All-Day Breakfast in 2016 as well as scaling back the total number of menu options – a move that ended a decade of flatlining growth! Say you’ve cornered your niche market and your business is doing pretty well. What’s the next step? Well, it might be time to enter a new market and start selling your products to different people in different locations. That’s called market acceleration. The key to pulling it off is careful planning. If you want to enter a new market, you’ll need to have a well-established brand that you can use as a launching pad. Take it from Under Armour, a sportswear business founded by Kevin Plank in 1995. The company’s aim was to provide an alternative to standard short and long-sleeved cotton sports t-shirts. Its first product, a synthetic shirt designed to keep athletes cool and dry, targeted a very specific market segment: American football players. Under Armour eventually landed contracts with a number of NFL teams and the brand gradually became known across the sports world. But Plank was convinced it could go on to even greater successes. In the early 2000s, Under Armour began selling its products in new markets in the United States and, later, internationally. Today, it’s a billion-dollar company that can hold its own with industry giants like Adidas and Nike. How did it pull this off? Well, it started by focusing on its niche and established its core brand before expanding. As you can see, careful planning is crucial if you want to pull off market acceleration. Failing to plan is, as the old adage has it, planning to fail. If you want a great example of how not to go about it, look no further than Mattel, the toymaker famous for producing Hot Wheels and Barbie. As kids’ shows and games became more popular and interest in traditional toys began declining, Mattel looked to the international market – which was much more stable – to prop up its business model. The idea wasn’t a bad one, but the company’s planning was a fiasco. Its massive flagship, House of Barbie, was opened in Shanghai in 2009 but closed after just two years, racking up massive losses. Mattel simply didn’t understand the customers it was attempting to sell its products to in, new unfamiliar markets. If the company had done its research it might have realized that its products and the tastes of its would-be international clients weren’t a good match. The needs of your customers are changing all the time. If you want your business to thrive, you’ll have to change with them and learn to anticipate and meet these new needs. The best way of doing that is to adopt a product expansion strategy. That goes for both young and established companies. Take Kylie Jenner, a social media star who used her massive following to build the wildly successful cosmetics brand Kylie Cosmetics in 2015. The business focused on expanding its product line from the get-go and quickly became a household name. By adding new cosmetics categories like eye shadows and eyeliners as well as SnapChat tutorials and special thematic collections to its portfolio, Kylie Cosmetics built up a revenue base of $600 million within two years! Agricultural machinery producer John Deere is a great example of an older company adopting the same strategy. Founded in the early nineteenth century, the company’s first success was the then revolutionary self-scouring plough, a tool first sold in 1837. The introduction of tractors made the plough obsolete, but John Deere kept pace with the times and began manufacturing tractors and combine harvesters. Its network of salesmen kept in regular contact with its customers, giving the company a good idea of what they needed and allowing it to tailor its products to the people who used them. So what happens when you fail to keep up with a changing market? The best example is Blockbuster, the now defunct movie-rental giant. The company basically remained immobile as the world around it changed, continuing to do what it had always done even as customers began embracing new ways of renting movies. That gave upstarts like Netflix, a business whose mail-order model emphasized convenience, a chance to stake their claim. By the time Blockbuster moved online in 2004, it was too late. Netflix had already cornered the market. Product expansion and market acceleration strategies will help your business grow, but you can’t rely on them indefinitely. So what can you do once you’ve exhausted those avenues? One option is customer and product diversification. That basically means rethinking what it is you’re selling and to whom your selling it. The strategy isn’t without its risks, but the potential benefits are huge. It all comes down to market context. Take Marvel, a comic book publisher founded in 1939. By 1993, it was struggling. People had lost interest in comic books and trading cards and the company’s managers couldn’t find an answer to their problems. In 1996, Marvel filed for bankruptcy. One year later, Marvel Enterprises Inc was created in its place. After a period of treading water, the company realized something important: what made the brand valuable wasn’t its traditional product – comic books – but the characters it had created. It was a brilliant insight. Marvel decided to diversify and enter a new market – movies. After the decision to sell the rights to famous characters like Spider-Man and the X-Men to 20th Century Fox failed to generate much profit, Marvel borrowed money and started making their own movies. Their first success came in 2008, with Iron Man. One year later, the company had been sold to Disney for more than four billion dollars! Diversification can be risky, however, and not just because of the costs. That’s something the popular toymaker Lego is well aware of. Trying to keep up with the market, it launched an ambitious diversification program in the late 1990s and expanded into multiple new markets, including computer games, theme parks and clothing. The plan didn’t work. Lego hadn’t conquered new frontiers; it was simply overstretched. Lacking the resources to stay abreast of new trends in multiple markets, it decided to scale back its operation in the early 2000s. This was a good move. After downsizing, streamlining its bureaucracy and ditching underperforming products, it finally returned to growth. Knowing what to sell and to whom is the bread and butter of successful entrepreneurship, but it’s not enough on its own. You also need to know how to sell your product. That’s all about optimizing sales, a strategy geared toward making sure your customers have a positive experience when they interact with your company. Convenience is king in the modern business context. If companies want to make the most of the opportunities associated with the internet, they need to understand how to make the technology work for their customers. That means making the buying experience as smooth and effortless as possible. Walmart took that lesson to heart when it expanded into e-commerce in 2016 after purchasing jet.com. It was a good move. Within a year Amazon announced its entry into the grocery market by buying Whole Foods. Had Walmart hesitated, it would’ve been entirely unprepared to meet this formidable challenge. Optimizing sales isn’t just about selling more, though. In fact, unrealistic targets and an overly competitive sales culture can actually undermine your company. There’s no better example of this than Wells Fargo, a bank that’d been a firm fixture on the American high street since 1852. After over a century and half of steady business, the company decided to up its game under CEO Dick Kovacevich. The idea was to sell, sell, sell. Wells Fargo developed an ultra-competitive company culture in which its employees were placed under incredible pressure to secure sales. By 2016, things had gone undeniably south. The bank was engulfed in public relations scandals as details of its unethical practices emerged. Some 5,000 employees were laid off and multiple executives were axed. An investigation into the affair later concluded that the high-pressure environment had created a toxic culture where wrongdoing had become routine. It estimated that as many as 3.5 million accounts had been opened without customer permission between 2009 and 2016. As we’ve already seen, acquiring new customers is much more expensive than retaining your existing ones. That means the cheapest way of avoiding growth slumps is improving your customer-retention rates. Put differently, you need to minimize your churn. That said, you can’t eliminate churn entirely. Some of it is simply part and parcel of running a business. Customers move on for all sorts of reasons. Things change and they no longer need your products or services. That’s obviously not something you can do anything about. What you can control is product quality and customer experience. Spotify provides a great example of how thinking carefully about these kinds of things can help a company retain customers. So how do they do it? Well, Spotify lets its users choose from a wide variety of different account types. One of the most interesting options is an account downgrade to a more affordable alternative, which is definitely an effective way of preventing churn. Customers thinking about leaving might decide to downgrade first. Although they’re paying less, they’re still Spotify customers. Netflix is another subscription service that’s good at keeping its existing customers. Its decision to produce its own content is especially effective as it allows the company to set itself apart from the competition and gives its customers a good reason to prefer its services over those of rivals. Churn isn’t just bad for your bottom line, however – it’s often also a sign that there’s something wrong with the way your company works. Take it from Blue Apron. Founded in 2012, the company sends customers packaged ingredients and recipes for the creation of home-cooked meals. It quickly diversified its portfolio and introduced a wine subscription service as well as opening four storage facilities from which to ship products to customers across the United States. Blue Apron enjoys fast growth but is constantly undercut by high churn levels. The problem? The quality of its deliveries is uneven, with many orders arriving late or incomplete. The high churn rate reflects the fact that its customers aren’t happy with its performance. If it wants to become a serious name in the industry, it’ll have to improve its product. Expanding into new markets or diversifying your portfolio can be complicated and expensive. But you don’t have to go it alone. Partnerships are a great way of making your life a whole lot easier and minimizing your costs. Say you want to sell your product in a new market. Why not set up a deal with a retailer that’s already active in that market? It’s a win-win situation and, most importantly, it helps you avoid overstretching yourself. Take GoPro, the manufacturer of action cameras designed for use in extreme conditions. Founded in 2004, the company quickly grew thanks to a series of well-chosen partnerships with big retailers like Best Buy. The deal benefited both partners. GoPro generates 17 percent of its total revenue through Best Buy outlets while the availability of GoPro cameras in its stores has helped Best Buy bring in new customers. GoPro established a similar deal with Red Bull in 2016, a partnership that’s helped both companies expand their customer bases as a result of cross-promotion campaigns. These partnerships worked because both parties trusted one another. You can see how important that is by looking at Apple’s experience. Its decision to launch the iTunes Store in 2003 was a big hit with customers, many of whom loved the idea of being able to download songs for just ¢99 – a deal made possible by Apple’s partnership with artists and record labels. But it ran into problems in 2015 after offering customers a three-month free trial for its new product, Apple Music. Musicians like Taylor Swift criticized the company and demanded to know whether artists would be paid for those free three months. Apple quickly moved to counter the protest and announced that it would always pay artists, but it was a close call – it had almost lost the trust of its partners. Business is usually depicted as a vicious, dog-eat-dog world of endless competition. But that’s not always the case. In certain situations it actually makes a lot of sense to bury the hatchet and cooperate with your competitors. Call it coopetition. Take the car industry. Shaking up a whole industry is usually beyond the ability of a single company. Recognizing that, Fiat-Chrysler, BMW, Intel and Mobileye joined forces in 2017. Their aim? To revolutionize the industry by introducing self-driving vehicles. Initially, only BMW, Intel and Mobileye had been on board, but they quickly realized that bringing in a giant like Fiat-Chrysler would help them bring their product into the mass market for cars. The truce between BMW and Fiat-Chrysler wasn’t the only peace pact. In 2014, Tesla announced that it would make its patents available for free. Why did it decide to literally give away its ideas? Well, if the electric car industry takes off, the market for batteries and charging stations – the products Tesla develops – is likely to be huge. In the end, everyone involved stands to gain something. Such alliances are usually the exception rather than the rule. It’s not hard to see why. Coopetition between natural enemies isn’t easy to pull off and the strategic interests of competitors rarely align. When it does work, it’s usually because every party involved understands the concrete rewards of cooperation. That said, it’s important to remember that your temporary allies are still rivals. Proceed with caution. There are two types of companies – those that simply sell their products and those that want to do something bigger. There’s nothing wrong with the former, but they’re not nearly as exciting as businesses that try to change the world around them. That’s why you might want to consider adopting unconventional strategies. Few things are as likely to inspire your customers as pursuing a unique mission. Take Toms Shoes, a company founded in 2006 with a unique selling point: for every pair of shoes sold, it donates another pair to children who can’t afford adequate footwear. Within six years, Toms had an annual turnover of $300 million, allowing it to ramp up its support of charitable causes. In total, the company has donated $70 million and provided 175,000 weeks of clean water to impoverished areas. That makes it incredibly attractive to consumers. Today, its model of “conscious capitalism” is becoming ever more popular. But whatever strategy you decide to adopt to grow your business, there’s one thing you should keep in mind: timing. That’s all about monitoring, preparation and execution. Knowing the ten growth paths we’ve covered in these blinks won’t get you anywhere if you choose the wrong strategy at the wrong time – in fact, you might just end up creating losses. So here’s what you’ll need to do to prevent that. First off, monitor your company’s performance. Keep a careful eye on the metrics related to your chosen growth path. Good data prevents poor decisions. Secondly, prepare. Ask yourself if you have the resources to move into a new market right now. Finally, execute. If you want to successfully embark on a growth path, you’ll need to prepare your resources, your channels of communication and your people to ensure a smooth transition. So treat the ten growth paths covered in these blinks as a source of ideas, recognize when to use them and reap the benefits. The key message in these blinks: Whether your company’s stuck in a rut, enjoying a jet-fuelled growth spurt or showing the first signs of decline, you need a growth plan. But here’s the problem: few things in business are as misunderstood as growth. Generic, off-the-shelf strategies often just don’t work out in practice. Successful growth management depends on picking what’s right for you. So how do you do that? Well, you can start by getting a handle on your business context and then applying one – or more! – of the ten growth paths outlined in these blinks.  Actionable advice: Don’t focus on only one growth path. What is customer experience? Well, it’s more than just one thing. Sure, interaction with customers is important, but making sure your sales channels are accessible – which falls under the category of optimizing your sales – is just as vital. The lesson here is that growth paths intertwine. One thing influences the next, and it’s never enough to simply focus on strategy. So if you want your business to grow, start by getting a sense of how its different parts interact and plan your strategy accordingly. Got feedback?

Plenty, as it turns out. On his twenty-year journey to invent and fine-tune the technology for his famed printing press, Johannes Gutenberg encountered many of the same obstacles as modern Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, including cash-flow problems and back-stabbing venture capitalists. Despite these difficulties, his invention is perhaps one of the most influential in history, comparable to the potential of the internet today. In these blinks, you’ll find out how Gutenberg is like Steve Jobs; what Gutenberg’s beta version was; and why the influence of the internet on humanity may have only just begun. In the 15th century, religious, political and economical change was brewing in Johannes Gutenberg’s hometown of Mainz, Germany. In addition to a power struggle between the emerging middle class and the old aristocratic families, the city itself was drowning in so much debt that creditors forced it to take austerity measures. As we know today, such periods of change and disruption often spawn entrepreneurs. At the age of 40, Gutenberg, a goldsmith, embarked on his first venture, which was perhaps less grandiose than one might expect: manufacturing and selling small mirrors to pilgrims. This endeavor was financially fairly successful, but, more importantly, it taught him crucial startup skills: how to recruit a team, set up a legal structure and raise funds. You see, Gutenberg had bigger dreams than vending trinkets to pilgrims. In secret, he was developing the invention he’s remembered for today: the printing press. This new technology required massive innovation, improvement and optimization on many fronts. For one, the type needed to be cast from molten metal. Here, Gutenberg’s invention of a versatile mold and the right mixture of metals helped achieve a previously unheard of production pace; a single foundry worker could cast up to 3000 letters a day. This greatly sped up the printing process. Another key technological innovation was the press itself, which Gutenberg modeled after the contraptions used in wineries, thereby vastly increasing printing precision. Meanwhile, finding the right ink also took some innovation; Gutenberg mixed it from soot, amber and linseed oil to produce that rich dark tone still common today. Developing and fine-tuning all these components took nearly 20 years, so you couldn’t say Gutenberg owes his fame to a sudden flash of innovation. Of course, like any good tech entrepreneur, before launching his final product, the Latin Bible, Gutenberg started with a prototype, a beta-version, in the form of a Latin grammar book. The book was downright ugly, its pages crammed tight with words; it proved, however, that the press worked. Have you ever seen a copy of Gutenberg’s best-known printing product, the Latin Bible? It is widely considered to be sublimely beautiful. In fact, the commitment to perfection and harmony evidenced by the print and page layout calls to mind another perfectionist entrepreneur: Steve Jobs. But unfortunately for Gutenberg, the publication did not go smoothly. You see, like many modern entrepreneurs, Gutenberg had a cash-flow problem. He had substantial upfront costs and investments to make, including paying 20 workers and buying some 230,000 pages of paper, all before selling a single Bible. So where could he get the necessary funds? In Gutenberg’s case, he managed to generate some earnings by printing indulgences for the church. But the main part of his funding came in the form of interest-free loans from ruthless businessmen and from an early venture capitalist named Johann Fust; in total, he got 1,600 gulden (roughly $300,000 today). Gutenberg intended to print 180 Bibles, which were so pricey at the time that his earnings would have easily covered his own investments and those of Fust. But right when the books were nearing completion, Fust struck: he sued Gutenberg, demanding repayment of his loans, with interest. Because Gutenberg had yet to sell a single Bible, he could not pay, and Fust took over Gutenberg’s primary workshop, most of his equipment and the task of publishing the Bible. This would not be the last time an entrepreneur regretted being incautious when dealing with financiers. So what does an entrepreneur do when his work and trade secrets are snatched from under his nose? He goes open-source. Gutenberg began training printers in his methods, thereby spreading this new industry across Europe. And as you’ll see in the next blink, his invention would have a lasting and profound effect on all of humanity. Gutenberg’s invention was to play an immediate role in the Protestant Reformation that soon swept across Europe. For one, the press was used to print the very indulgences for the Catholic Church that so incensed Martin Luther. But more importantly, the new technology also allowed Luther’s famed 30 tracts to be printed and spread far and wide across Europe, thereby fanning the flames of the Reformation. Considering this phenomenon, one can spot parallels between Gutenberg’s press and the internet today. Both are platforms on which it is possible to trigger revolutions in politics, religion, art, science and culture. Consider the role of Twitter in the Arab Spring, for example. Some scholars posit that the Internet is in fact completing a circle that Gutenberg began: Before the printing press, information was passed along by word of mouth, with little mention of the original “author.” But thanks to printing, authorship and ownership of creativity could be preserved and documented clearly. Today’s knowledge and information, however, are shared, modified and linked online, once again muddying the question of ownership. This is something copyright holders are all too familiar with. It is noteworthy, though, that the true cultural impact of Gutenberg’s technology took a while to become apparent. Yes, many books were printed in the first 50 years after Gutenberg’s invention, but they were often derivative of the scribes of that period, imitative of their style and genre. It was only after a half-century that totally new genres and styles began to emerge. This makes one wonder if, despite the perception of creating lightning-fast change, the internet isn’t also only beginning to exert its influence on our lives, with the most profound cultural impact still to come. For it to realize its full potential, the internet must be protected against government and corporate control. In only this way will it become as influential a cultural force as Gutenberg’s printing press, creating entirely new sciences, professions, social classes and perhaps even nations. The key message in this book: Gutenberg spent decades perfecting the printing press, only to be betrayed by his financier before the launch of his main product. Ever since, his printing press has wielded a tremendous influence over humanity, and we can see similar potential in the internet.

But if you’re a programmer yourself, you know that programming is a very creative process, akin to painting. Just like artists, good programmers focus on creating great things, and the possibilities of what you can do are virtually limitless. And this is not the only misconception non-programmers have about programmers. Yes, programmers may dress unfashionably or act awkwardly in social situations, but this is mostly because they’re smart people and couldn’t care less about social conventions. It’s this rebellious spirit that makes them so good at programming, a state of mind that could help anyone come up with innovative ideas. In these blinks, you’ll discover: what programming languages are and why there are so many, why the motives of computer hackers initially baffled the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and why perhaps it’s time you too learned how to code – if you want to become obscenely rich. What do you think fashion and morals have in common? At first glance, not much. But actually both phenomena are limited to a certain time and place. Obviously, fashion sense is tied to a specific time: take a look at photos from the 1990s and you’ll see how far tastes have come since then. And if you look at images from foreign places like Japan, for example, even today you may be astonished at what is currently in fashion there, too. It may be a surprise then to realize that morals are just as temporary and location-dependent. These moral fashions affect a whole spectrum of moral issues, including how you should treat other people and what values you cherish the most. An extreme example: the moral compass of many Germans during World War II was very different than from the values of citizens in modern Germany today. So, both clothing fashions and moral fashions are constantly changing. Can you think of any subgroup in society that is oblivious to these changes? Of course: nerds, or smart people who are not socially adept and so don’t try to fit in with their peers. Nerds use their time and energy to become smarter without bothering to adhere to fashionable conventions, because being fashionable isn’t a goal. This may be most apparent if someone you know wears a neon denim jacket every day for five years, but it also applies to moral fashions. The result is that nerds are not very likely to be popular among their peers, especially in high school. To be voted prom king or queen, a student usually has to be in tune with the current moral and clothing fashions. But thankfully after high school – in the real world – where being fashionable doesn’t matter much anymore, nerds seem to do just fine. If you think of the word hacker, what comes to mind? Most people probably imagine a cold, calculating person who illegally breaks into computers through tedious, analytical work. Now, think about an artist, like a painter. You’ve probably conjured up an image of an inspired genius who pours her soul on to a canvas. Let’s clear up a few misconceptions. First, in the computer world, the term hacker refers to an outstanding programmer who can do almost anything, not necessarily a criminal. What’s more, hacking requires a very creative mind, closer to a painter’s than say, a mathematician’s. In fact, both hackers and painters are similar in the sense that they both solve problems by creating concepts rather than implementing them. For example, the author was originally taught he should work on computer code on paper until it was perfect, and only then, transfer the code to a computer. But he found that an artistic approach worked far better: he would just start writing code and solve problems as they occurred, much like a painter might just start sketching something and work from there, rather than perfectly planning her work beforehand. Another similarity is that both hackers and painters produce work that has abstract value, which is hard to measure through metrics such as tests or media attention. The only measure of value for such “work” is how well people like it. For software, this depends on how well the software pleases the user by meeting his needs, and for art, on how well the work pleases the audience. The author came to understand these similarities when he went to art school after graduating with a degree in computer science. He found both fields to have more similarities than differences, because both aim at the same fundamental goal: making good things. You may think that successful computer programming requires you to adhere rigidly to rules and conventions. After all, not doing so would result in a bunch of errors, right? In fact, becoming a hacker often means violating some rules. Just like in any other profession, you can only learn to hack by looking at the work of those who came before you. And if you want to take a really close look, you may well have to bend and break some laws yourself, as it’s possible that the work you’re interested in is protected by intellectual property rights. Hackers have a kind of intellectual curiosity about current technologies such as cutting-edge software, and yet to study it, they may have to break into someone else’s computer. These endeavors are often illegal. Hackers are thus considered criminals, even though they’re most likely committing a crime out of curiosity, rather than to steal anything. Originally, when breaking into computers was first classified as a crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) struggled in its cases, as often a hacker’s main motive was simple intellectual curiosity. As far as criminal motives go, this was – for the FBI – totally unheard of. You may now be thinking that hackers should simply abide by the law, but in fact it is their rebellious nature that makes them so good at what they do. Why? Because being rebellious means questioning authority, whether the government or experts in your field. And questioning established ideas is the only way to come up with innovative ones, a prerequisite for good programming. Most hackers are nerds in that they are smart people who don’t really care about social conventions, so they are especially skilled in challenging everything – and then improving on it. In the following blinks, you’ll find out how nerds use their rebellious genius to make tons of money. Many people dream of one day starting a company around a great idea they’ve had. But if you’re a good programmer, you really should go for it and found your own company. Why? Because launching a start-up really is one of the fastest ways to becoming rich. When working for a large corporation, your wage won’t substantially increase no matter how hard you work. If you found a start-up, on the other hand, you’ll have to work very hard but at least every hour of work you put in will make it more likely your company will succeed and you’ll get a big payout. This is what happened to the author. He and his start-up’s two co-founders worked long hours on their online shopping application called Viaweb, and eventually sold it for millions. Some may protest that this is the wrong goal, and that the whole dynamic of concentrating wealth in the hands of the rich is a mistake. But actually, concentrating wealth is not only fair, it’s good for everyone. Why? Because wealth is not the same as money. Wealth constitutes the things that people want, whereas money is only the medium of exchange that people trade for wealth. With this distinction in mind, it’s obvious that wealth can be created by anyone, without diminishing the wealth of others. For example, if you own a classic car and refurbish it in your spare time, you’re creating new wealth without depriving anyone else of it. This means wealth is not limited, so the rich aren’t “hogging” it. Also, isn’t it possible that the richest individuals, such as CEOs, professional athletes and so on, really have worked harder and more productively than others, so that they deserve their wealth? For example, if you have to work ten times harder in your start-up than the average corporate employee, isn’t it fair that you earn ten times the income? Especially when in doing so, you’ll create a product that everyone can enjoy and benefit from. As discussed before, just like painters have to please an audience, hackers need to please a user. This means that when you found a company and begin designing your product, the end user has to take center stage in your mind. First of all, you should create and launch a prototype of your product as soon as possible to collect feedback from real users. This strategy is called Worse is Better, because launching even a pretty stripped-down prototype early on gets you valuable feedback that allows you to fix mistakes and improve the product to better suit your users’ needs. One example of the efficacy of this approach comes from a surprising source: the famed author Jane Austen. Before finalizing her books, she used to read them aloud to her family, who then made suggestions about what they would like to hear in the book. They were the first users for her “prototype.” If you succeed and manage to make a product that matches users’ needs and interests, they will probably want to buy it. Otherwise they won’t, no matter how many other sophisticated features it has. For example, if you were to design a chair, do you think anyone would buy it if it looked great but was horrendously uncomfortable? Probably not. To gain users, you have to satisfy their needs, and the more users you have, the more successful your company will be. This is also a virtuous cycle: users generate revenue, which you can then reinvest to make your product even better and get even more users. What’s more, if someone is considering acquiring your company, they will value it based on the number of users you have. An app that has 100,000 users will have more potential buyers than an app with just 300 users. “C++, Python, Java…” You’ve probably sometimes heard programmers listing all the languages they can code in. What they’re referring to are the programming languages in which they are able to give commands to computers. But computers don’t actually understand these languages. They only comprehend machine language, meaning specific combinations of ones and zeros that tell the computer what functions to perform. This means programmers also need a compiler to translate the programming language into machine language. This sounds reasonable, but it might beg the question: why do we need so many different programming languages? The reason is simply that different programming languages are good for different kinds of tasks. Just like with spoken languages, it can be easier to express certain things in one language than in another. For example, if you want to tell your computer to add variable Y to variable X, you can do it in two lines of code in the language Lisp, whereas you’d need four lines in the language Perl. Sometimes the necessary concepts for your program don’t even exist in the language you’ve chosen, so you have to either switch or find a workaround in the first language. For example, if you tried to add Y to X in the language Python, you’d run into trouble because it doesn’t fully recognize variables like that. So you’d have to find a workaround, which in this case would mean writing six lines of code. This is why there are so many languages in existence. But the field is far from stagnant: existing languages are constantly evolving and new ones are being developed. This is because languages are developed by programmers who adapt them according to their own preferences and requirements. Up until the 1980s this was not possible, since programming languages were developed only by institutions and large companies. These days, anyone can afford the necessary technology to adapt and develop current programming languages, or even come up with new ones. If you were to look at 1,000 paintings and divide the good from the bad, you’d obviously make that judgment based on your own taste. The same is true for hackers who decide between good and bad programming languages. They appreciate good taste in the programming languages they use, and as they advance as programmers, their own taste changes and develops, too. For example, if you’ve designed your own programming language and years later, publish a new version, it will surely be better than the previous one. This is because you didn’t have the skills to make the original version as good as the updated one, and your taste has also improved along the way. So what’s a good programming language? One that caters to a hacker’s needs. For example, if a language is too complicated or limiting, hackers will simply use another one. If, however, a language meets the needs of hackers, it will become popular, which means they will embrace it and develop it further to perfect it. So good languages will inevitably get better over time, as hackers voluntarily work on finding and fixing bugs in it. Good examples of this dynamic can be found in open-source languages such as Perl and Python, which were privately designed by individuals but later released to the public so anyone and everyone could change and improve them. If you’re not a programmer and want to start a business that requires programming, you probably have no idea which programming language your company should use. So how should non-programmers like business managers and project leaders choose the language for their programmers to code in? In general, businesses prefer using popular, widespread languages. This is because a program written in a commonly used language will likely be compatible with many other programs written in that same language. Another reason is that it’s easier for companies to find and recruit programmers who code in popular languages. This can sometimes be crucial: if you’ve recruited someone to write a program in a rare language like Lisp and she suddenly quits her job, you’ll be in real trouble. Chances are you won’t be able to find a replacement and will have to throw the whole project away. Since companies have more demand for coders with popular language skills, it also means that there will always be more hackers using them than obscure ones. Despite these arguments in favor of popular languages, there are certain downsides, too. Since certain programming languages are optimized for certain tasks, forcing programmers to use a popular language for everything means you’re possibly not getting the best performance from your product. Most likely, your competitors have this same problem. So if you were to switch to a more optimal language, you could gain a significant edge. What’s more, your competitors could no longer analyze your position based on their own, since your products would be based on completely different technical platforms. This is what the author did when he created Viaweb with the little-known language Lisp, giving him a technical advantage and leaving his competitors wondering what exactly he was doing. It was mentioned earlier that a good hacker can do virtually anything. One fun example is tackling a problem you’re probably all too familiar with: spam, the seemingly unstoppable flow of unsolicited advertisements that bombard your inbox. So if you’re a hacker sick of spam, how would you deal with it? You’d probably come up with a few different methods. First, you could approach the problem by looking at the individual properties of spam emails. For example, many spam emails begin with something like “Dear Friend,” so you could write a piece of code that automatically puts all messages starting with this phrase in your spam folder. Second, you could employ statistical filtering, whereby every word in an incoming email would be analyzed, with the computer calculating the probability of the message being spam. Then the computer would put the likely offenders in your spam folder. Perhaps the best option however would be to personalize this statistical approach, saving certain messages from the spam folder even if the statistics indicated they might be spam. For example, the author decreed any messages with the word “Lisp” as non-spam, as the word was included in many legitimate emails about the programming language. He also decided that messages from the addresses he had corresponded with were safe. But if you’re a good hacker, you will also consider the consequences of your actions. In this case, by stopping spam you risk also missing some important emails, because spam filters are never 100-percent accurate and can easily intercept legitimate mail, too. So you’ll probably have to sift through your spam folder every now and then to check for legitimate messages, but afterwards you can always improve your spam filter to not make the same mistake again. So while spam can be extremely irritating, trying to filter out all spam can also bring its own problems. The key message in this book: Contrary to what most people think, computer programming is artistic work, and a programming nerd’s rebellious nature can result in the creation of inspiring, innovative things. By founding a start-up around a great idea, a computer programmer can even make a fortune. Actionable advice: If you’re a programmer with a business idea, go for it! Very few people can become wealthy working as programmers for big corporations, as a company’s success has little or no impact on wages. So if you want to become rich and you have a good business idea, go for it: found your own start-up! Yes, you’ll have to work much harder than at a regular 9-to-5 job, but at least you can make your own decisions about what to do, create interesting new products that benefit your users and at the end of the day, every hour you put in will increase the chance that you’ll sell your company for a fortune.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

But now, with so many new possibilities in online marketplaces, it’s a whole new ball game. Online business may present a host of new problems, but it also provides an unprecedented amount of data, not to mention the ability to communicate with customers in amazingly useful ways. These opportunities – to test your product and learn from customers – are two of the key factors in hacking growth. These blinks explain the growth hacking playbook. They provide a systematic way of collecting, analyzing and testing data that just about any business can use to quickly make the most of its time and resources. In these blinks, you’ll also find out what a college football team can teach us about efficient business practices; how data about your customer’s internet connection can be a game changer; and how to find your company’s North Star. Here’s a common scenario that any number of entrepreneurs face today: you’re the CEO of a small business, and though you’re making a nice profit, you need to find a way to take it to the next level. What you need to do is prioritize growth by establishing a growth team. A growth team is made up of members from different departments within your company, and it harnesses the power of collaboration to focus exclusively on finding ways to grow. Let’s look at a real-world example. Prior to forming a growth team, the software company BitTorrent had 50 employees working in the traditional departments of engineering, marketing and product development. This brought them good results until 2012, when their growth plateaued. The problem was that too many customers were using the basic, free version of their product. And despite making improvements to the premium, paid version, few people were making the upgrade. Things changed, however, when an innovative project-marketing manager (PMM) came aboard, created a growth team and sparked the kind of fresh perspective they needed. By looking at engineering issues from a marketing point of view, it became clear that the lack of upgrades wasn’t due to a quality issue. Most customers were simply unaware of the premium version and what it offered. Armed with this insight, the marketing and engineering teams joined forces to raise awareness by prominently promoting the premium version to users of the free version. As a result, upgrades skyrocketed, and revenue increased by 92 percent. But in order for your growth team to succeed, it needs to have a strong leader. It needs someone who can unite the interdisciplinary team and keep them on course for improvement. This leader will identify the target area, set clear goals and establish a time frame for the accomplishment of these goals. For example, he or she may decide it’s best to focus on developing new marketing channels and set a goal for the team to come up with three potential new ones by the end of the month. The growth leader is also responsible for keeping the team focused on moving forward and steering them clear of distractions. While attractive new ideas can be distracting, the team leader must recognize when these ideas don’t serve the current goal and need to be put on the back burner. There are countless entrepreneurs hoping to come up with the next Airbnb, Yelp, Facebook or Amazon. Each of these companies experienced rapid growth, and that’s probably because they all have something in common. They each released a must-have product or service that people loved. Even if you’re already sure that people love your product, you’ve got to get a grasp on your customers’ experiences and opinions by reaching out to them. Only then will you really know if your product is a must-have. The must-have survey is a simple and reliable method for figuring out how your customers feel about your product. And all it takes is asking at least a few hundred customers a single multiple-choice question. Here’s the question: “How disappointed would you be if this product no longer existed tomorrow?” And here are the three possible answers: A. Very disappointed B. Somewhat disappointed C. Not disappointed You can be confident that your product is a must-have if at least 40 percent of your customers choose “Very disappointed.” Once you reach this milestone, you are in the perfect position to start using the growth hacking techniques that are described in the blinks ahead. However, if the amount of customers answering, “Very disappointed” is under 40 percent, you must continue to improve and develop your product. If this is the case, don’t fret – there are quick, efficient and inexpensive ways to experiment with how you can communicate your product’s value. One method is A/B testing, which is a way of testing the effectiveness of two different messages or product variations. The project-management tool Basecamp used this method to test potential marketing taglines, for example, and that’s how they discovered that the prompt “See Plans and Pricing” attracted twice as many new customers as “Sign Up for Free Trial.” Plus, the great thing about A/B testing, whether it’s being done face-to-face or online, is that it doesn’t have to be expensive. Crucial insights can be gained by testing out new approaches, like showing test audiences a simple video demonstration or an inexpensive prototype that highlights potential new features. Even if the tests prove unsuccessful, the feedback you’ll get will prove extremely valuable. In the movie Field of Dreams, the main character hears a mysterious voice: “If you build it, they will come.” And, sure enough, after spending every penny he has to build a baseball park on his property, people miraculously arrive. While this might make for an inspirational Hollywood story, in reality, you’ve got to do more than just build something great if you want people to come and keep your business thriving. One of the best ways to drive traffic to your product or service is to figure out which metrics matter most to generating growth. Standard metrics for online businesses include web traffic, user acquisition and returning users, but your business is sure to have specific metrics that are uniquely relevant to your growth. It’s important to identify these unique core metrics as soon as possible. If you don’t, you may find yourself drowning in data and distracted from what really matters. To find out which specific metrics you need, ask yourself this question: Which customer actions can be measured to reveal how positive their experience with your product is? Facebook’s core metrics include how frequently users log in, how much time they spend on the site, how active they are in creating posts and comments and how many friend requests are being sent. Since Facebook’s revenue is based on selling ad space, these are all very important metrics. Each shows how many people are looking at the site and how engaged they are. Nevertheless, it’s important to find one key metric to serve as your North Star. Your North Star is the one metric that, above all others, best measures the core value your product is delivering. This measurement will keep teams focused on growth and the efficient use of time and resources. At Facebook, the North Star is the number of daily active users. This is more important than the number of posts being made or friend requests being sent because it offers a simple and general indication of Facebook’s growth. Now that we know which stats to monitor, let’s look at some real growth-hacking techniques. At the start of the 2008 season, the Baylor University football team had been struggling for over a decade. But things changed that year: the new head coach, Art Briles, introduced to the team a fast-paced, no-huddle offense. This new high-speed game helped Baylor not only out-hustle its opponents on game day; it also allowed the team to run more plays during practice. In other words, Baylor was able to learn more in less time. And this is the kind of efficiency you can implement by embarking on the four-stage growth hacking cycle. The first stage is known as the analyze stage, which involves collecting and analyzing your data to gain customer insight. For this you can prepare a series of questions, such as, “How do our customers typically behave?” “What are the characteristics of our best customers?” “What events lead customers to stop using our product?” For each question, you should prepare a list of probing sub-questions, like, “What time of the day are customers most actively purchasing the product?” The marketing experts should use surveys and interviews to collect this valuable data, and, once it’s been analyzed, trends and patterns should become apparent. These insights can then be shared and discussed in a team meeting, where members can begin brainstorming some growth-hacking ideas. This brings us to the second stage, the ideate stage, which is when every member of the growth team helps develop ideas based on their area of expertise. After getting things started at the team meeting, you can give members the next four days to submit as many ideas as they can think up. All proposals should go through the idea pipeline, which works by offering a structured format to log, track and evaluate all the incoming ideas. This would involve giving each one a short name such as “Loyalty Rewards” and briefly describing the proposal’s who, what, when, where, why and how. Make sure you note both the action and the expected beneficial outcome, like this: “By rewarding customer loyalty, we’ll increase the number of returning customers by 30 percent.” Finally, don’t forget to make a note of the metrics that can be used to track how well the idea is performing. In the case of a customer loyalty program, the effect could be tracked through the customer retention rate. While the first two stages of analysis and ideas are about finding and implementing growth hacks, the final two stages are about testing your new ideas. The third stage is to prioritize, which involves putting the ICE scoring system to use. To prioritize your ideas using the ICE system, each member of the growth team rates their ideas based on three factors: impact, confidence and ease. Impact is determined by quantifying expected growth – the greater the growth, the greater the impact. Confidence is determined by the team member’s conviction that the idea will succeed, which is something that should be backed up by hard data. Ease should be rated according to how much time and resources the idea will require during testing. Each of these categories receives a score between one and ten. For example, if a team member suggests offering customers a $10 credit for any referral, the impact on new sign-ups might be a seven, while the confidence rating might only be a four due to having limited data on user referrals. And since the idea is rather simple to implement, the ease rating could be an eight. To arrive at the final ICE score, you must first add each rating and then average out the sum. So in this case, you’d get a sum of 19 and then a final average of 6.33. After each idea is given a score, they should then be sorted from highest to lowest, with the best-scoring ideas getting immediately shortlisted for further team discussion and testing. This brings us to the fourth and final stage in the growth-hacking cycle: the testing stage. This is when you bring ideas before customers and determine which ones deserve to be fully implemented. At this stage, it’s recommended that you work with a data analyst to come up with strict guidelines so that you produce a reliable set of results. For example, always use a statistical-confidence interval of 99 percent that indicates a 1 percent margin for error in the results. That way you can be sure that your tests are providing accurate insights. Remember, as with the Baylor University football team, the more often you can repeat the growth-hacking cycle, the more you’ll learn and the more growth you can achieve. Attracting new customers is always a challenge. But, as crazy as it sounds, it’s not always worth the effort. These days, a lot of businesses spend more money on acquiring new customers than those customers will ever generate in revenue. This raises a pressing question: How can you attract new customers without going bankrupt in the process? The first message your business presents to a potential customer plays an extremely important role. It must quickly communicate information and resonate with them in a meaningful way. These days, the average attention span of someone online is a mere eight seconds – so that’s how long you have to explain why your product is beneficial to a potential customer’s life. Short-and-sweet taglines are particularly useful. Just consider the slogan for the original iPod: “1,000 Songs in Your Pocket.” Of course, we can’t all be a marketing geniuses like Apple’s Steve Jobs, but we can learn from him and use words that a typical customer would use to describe why your product is beneficial. These words can be taken from a social-media post, a product review or a customer survey. You can perform a creativity hack by collaborating and brainstorming dozens of variations on a single message, picking out the ones with the greatest potential and using them in a simple A/B marketing test. You can also bring some extra focus to your efforts by limiting how many marketing channels you use. Here’s how: Start by creating a list of possible channels that fit your business model. For example, if you plan for people to find your product via a search engine, then you would make sure that search-engine optimization is at the top of your list. When you have your list of possible channels, you can then test them to find out which ones you should prioritize. This test is based on six different criteria: how much testing will cost, how much time the tests take to set up, how much time it will take to collect the results, how well the test targets your desired customers, how flexible the test is to adjustments and how many subjects will be tested. Give each of these categories a score between one and ten, add up the sum and then average out the score. Then test the channels with the highest score. Even if you succeed in attracting potential customers to your product, the next challenge is to turn them into purchasing customers. Only 2 percent of most sites’ web traffic leads to an actual sale. But look on the bright side of this teeny percentage: there’s lots of room for improvement. A great way to help bring in customers is to create a funnel report, which allows you to pinpoint where customers tend to drop off. You can start a funnel report by mapping out all the main steps a customer takes, from first contact to making a purchase, and then note the conversion rate between each step – that is, the percentage of customers who actually proceed from one step to the next. If you were to do this for Uber, the first two steps are to download the app and create an account. And let’s say that, last month, 10,000 customers downloaded the app and 8,000 of them went on to create an account. This gives an 80-percent conversion rate. Step number three is booking a ride. Let’s say 500 of the 8,000 customers take this step. Well, the conversion rate would be quite low, at 6.25 percent. Looking at this funnel report, a manager at Uber would spot a red flag and try to fix the problem of customers signing up but failing to actually use the app. Maybe the booking process needs to be simplified? As you can see, once you pinpoint where the customers drop off, you can begin to spot the problem and come up with solutions. Customer surveys are also a good way to do this, whether they’re emailed to customers or appear as pop-up surveys on your website. Whichever method you use, these surveys should always be brief and focus on learning why the customer did or didn’t take the next step. To help solve Uber’s problem, a couple of days after a customer creates an account, the app could produce a survey asking the question, “Is there anything preventing you from ordering a ride?” Given the prompt, customers could provide useful information, like feeling uneasy about riding alone in a car with a stranger at the wheel. This would help Uber brainstorm and test different ways of reassuring customers, such as highlighting the fact that all drivers have undergone background checks. If you’ve ever struggled with a big lifestyle change, like trying to start a new diet or exercise regimen, you know that the first couple of weeks are the toughest. But if you’ve managed to stick with it, then you also know that it gets easier over time. This process is known as the power of habit formation, and it applies to growth hacking as well. Many businesses have found success by helping customers form habits by offering rewards through a process known as engagement loops. Amazon is a prime example (no pun intended), since their Amazon Prime program is a perfect engagement loop. The company makes an offer, rewards customers for taking it and then provides an excellent service to keep the customer happy and coming back for more. Let’s take it one step at a time. First, Amazon makes the offer of signing up for a Prime membership, which it does through promotional emails, displays on their website and various other notifications. Once a customer signs up, this is followed by the most important step in the engagement loop: rewarding the customer for taking the offer. By signing up for Amazon Prime, the customer gets a number of benefits, including instant streaming of movies and TV shows and free two-day shipping. So the customer gets instant gratification. Then Amazon reassures customers that they made the right decision by reminding them about how much money they’re saving every time they make a purchase. These rewards feel good, and it doesn’t take shoppers long before they come to expect this good feeling every time they go to an online marketplace. And since Amazon is the only business with a reward program like Prime, it’s built a very loyal customer base of habitual Amazon shoppers. Prime has been so incredibly successful that the results even surpassed Amazon’s expectations. Each year, more than 90 percent of the Prime subscribers have renewed their membership. A good way to start your own engagement loop is to test different reward strategies in order to find out what customers value the most. You can start with two of the most successful types of reward programs: social recognition and user achievements. Social recognition is what Yelp uses by designating its most active users with “Elite” status, which includes invitations to special parties and events, and a badge to highlight their status on their online profile. Rewarding user achievements is another effective way to make customers feel good. For example, the fitness company Fitbit sends a congratulatory notification to its users when they take their ten thousandth step. At this point, you might be thinking that all these tips are great, but when do we get to growing revenue? Indeed, increased revenue can be one of the best signs of company growth, and knowing where the majority of your revenue is coming from is truly valuable information. That’s why identifying and understanding your customer segments is a growth hack that will lead you to increasing your best revenue streams. You can break down customer segments in a variety of ways, from age to location to membership type. But that’s not all. Once you’ve segmented on a basic level, you can look for similarities between segments and the revenue they’re bringing in. This is another piece of data that can generate both ideas to test and potential growth hacks to implement. For example, HotelTonight is an app that helps users book last-minute accommodations. It once segmented its customers into two groups: those who accessed the app via Wi-Fi and those who accessed it using cellular data. This led to the surprising revelation that twice as much revenue came from the cellular-data segment. The possibility for this discrepancy might be that a slower and more expensive cellular-data connection made the customers more eager to make a quick purchase and not hunt for more bargains. So the HotelTonight team decided to test advertising directly to data users, an experiment that paid off handsomely. More of these users signed up, and profits increased. Another way to optimize revenue is to always be developing and unveiling new features. This is especially useful in making your current customers happy and willing to keep revenue coming in. Meanwhile, you can find out what kind of new benefits and features your customers want through the use of surveys. For example, One of BitTorrent’s surveys asked customers to rate six different potential features – such as previewing files before downloading – that they were thinking about adding to an updated premium version. To help persuade customers to fill out the survey, all participants were automatically entered to win a free upgrade. No matter what kind of business you’re part of, there will always be customers to listen to, valuable data to analyze and a new growth-hacking cycle just waiting to get started. The key message in this book: Growth hacking is a proven and effective business strategy that can be adopted by companies of any size, in any field. Its key tenets are cross-functional teams, rigorous data collection and analysis and rapid experimentation and testing. Actionable advice: Launch a pricing optimization survey. Start getting the most out of how much your product costs by asking your customers the following four questions: At what price point would you no longer consider paying for (your product)? What is the most expensive price that you would still consider paying for (your product)? What price point would you consider a great deal for (your product)? What price point would you consider too inexpensive and cause you to doubt the quality of (your product)? The answers to these questions will point you toward the optimal price range for your product. And with further testing, you can find the perfect final price. Got feedback?

But more than that, it gives you a clear roadmap toward your company’s future and acts as a benchmark against which to measure your future progress.  That being said, writing one can feel like a daunting prospect. How can you show your readers that you and your venture are worthy of funding? And what information do you really need to include to have the best chance of success? If these questions seem tricky then don’t worry – you’re in safe hands. These blinks will show you what to write and how to write it. Packed with helpful tips and practical insights, they lift the lid on what your investors are really thinking and reveal how you can make your business plan go straight to the top of the pile.  Whether you’re starting a small business from your bedroom or launching a large scale venture, you’ll learn how to get your audience as excited about your dreams as you are and convince them to hop on board your fledgling project. Along the way, you’ll discover  what your business plan needs to say about the internet; how you can wow investors with your writing style; and  why every entrepreneur needs a cash flow forecast.  Money doesn’t come easily. If you want to secure funding for your business, whether from a bank or a private investor, you’ll need to impress. That’s where your business plan comes in – a collection of pages with the power to set you and your ideas apart from the crowd. So just what ingredients go into the recipe for the perfect business plan? Firstly, you’ll need to include an opening statement on what your business entails, the amount of money you want and what the funds are for. Make this brief – two sentences are enough.  Next, you’ll have to provide some insight into the market your business is aimed at. It’s a fact that most investors think business success relies on locating a sizeable market and selling to it. After all, you might have the best invention since Henry Ford’s automobile, but without any demand for your brainwave it’s still going to be a nonstarter. With that in mind, you should assume that this section will make the biggest impact on your audience. After you’ve completed your opening statement and an analysis of your target market, you’re ready to give your reader some information about the person you know best: you. Make sure you include details of any relevant training or qualifications you have, as well as an overview of your previous achievements. Next, you’ll want to describe your product’s unique benefits for customers. Although you might have plenty you want to talk about in this part, it’s best to stick to accurate facts and precise figures.  In the final sections, you’ll need to tell the reader how you plan to establish your business and how you see it progressing over the long-term. As you get to work on this part of your plan, consider the following questions: How will I market my products or services? Who will manage the day-to-day running of my business? And where exactly will I carry out my work or produce my product? As you answer these questions, take care to make your plans sound concrete and sensible. As well as explaining your start-up phase, it’s also important to address the longer-term prospects for your business. Potential investors need to know whether they are looking at a short-term venture or one that will keep being profitable for a long time. So ask yourself: Is this going to be a slow-growing business whose rewards will gradually accumulate, or will it burn fast and bright? In the next blink, we’ll take a look at the financial information your business plan needs to set out.   Preparing a cash flow forecast strikes fear into the heart of many budding entrepreneurs. But this financial document is vital to the success of your business plan. Even if you’re hoping for a small loan of no more than a few hundred dollars, your bank will always want to see one. Luckily, with a little forethought, completing this exercise doesn’t need to be difficult.  This all-important forecast is simply a prediction of what your financial activities will look like in the future. It’s typically expressed as a spreadsheet with one column for each month. For every column, you just enter how much money you predict you’ll have coming in from sources such as sales. Then you set this incoming money against any outgoing payments you predict you’ll make for costs such as overheads, supplies and whatever salary you’ll pay yourself and any employees you might have.  Completing this forecast is crucial because it will inform your loan negotiations with the bank. This spreadsheet lets everyone know how much money you actually need for your venture and how long you’re likely to need it for. Armed with this knowledge, you can negotiate with the bank about the amount of money you can borrow and reassure them that you will have the ability to repay it.  Although convincing a lender to provide financing is the main purpose of the cash flow forecast, completing it also has other benefits for your fledgling business. Producing a forecast, for example, will give you more awareness of the real-world impact that your ideas will have on your financial situation. This knowledge may prompt you to recalibrate and make different, more cost-effective decisions. You might rethink your advertising budget, for example, or your decision to purchase that new car for the business.  In fact, if you want to make your planning decisions as good as they can be, it’s even worth making multiple forecasts with variations on how funds are allocated and how many sales are made. Although making several forecasts will take time, they could make your future business much more profitable!  Lastly, after you’ve shown your forecast to the bank and secured funding, don’t make the mistake of binning it. Instead you can use this document to keep an accurate overview of your finances and make a regular comparison between what you planned for and what actually transpired. By doing so, you’ll get a swift warning when things are going off course as well as an indication of where the problem area is in your finances.  Owning a little store on the main street is a dream many people have. Unfortunately, the reality of throwing yourself into the world of retail can be a nightmare. From the upper echelons of trade downward, it’s stiff competition, with ruthless corporations undercutting small shops and making it hard for the little guys to earn a crust. What does this mean for you? Well, if you’re a budding retailer you’ll need a showstopping business plan to make yourself an attractive proposition for a bank loan.   But there is some good news for would-be store owners. One benefit is that the person who reads your plan will probably have a decent idea of what your business entails. Even though the average bank manager will struggle to understand manufacturing proposals involving engineering or scientific jargon, they will have visited stores and will be familiar with buying and selling. So, you won’t need to spend too much time explaining things in your plan.  However, the space you’ll free up by needing less explanation must now be filled with information about another crucial topic: the market.  Be sure to give your reader a sizable amount of information about the existing market for the goods you want to sell. Specifically, your potential lender will want to know that a big enough market exists in your store’s local area. They’ll also want to know how much of this market you’ll have to capture in order to make a decent profit. Other useful information you can include is the number of people that will walk past the store every day, what percentage of this footfall can be expected to actually come in and how much money each customer would have to spend to give you sufficient profit each year.  Once your business plan has answered these questions, you’ll need to set out what your buying policy is going to be. In other words, your decision-making process regarding what stock you buy, how much of it and when you buy it.  Outlining this policy in your plan is crucial – banks know that stores often lose money through making poor buying decisions. You’ll need to write down how you plan to make these decisions and how you propose to keep track of your existing stock. A potential lender will want to know, for example, whether you are physically going to walk around and count your stock, and if so, how often you plan to do this.  Although millennials may find it tricky to remember a world without the internet, this incredible technology has only been with us for less than 30 years. This relative newness means that today’s businesses are still learning how to make the best use of it. For every online company that’s become indispensable to our daily lives, like Facebook or Amazon, there are hundreds of others that have made fatal mistakes. So when it comes to the internet, how can you avoid the hidden pitfalls and show your business-plan readers that you know your stuff? You can start by familiarizing yourself with the most common mistakes companies make online.  Many new businesses, for example, jump straight into buying a particular website design before they even know what their website needs to do or what functionality it needs. Another typical error is buying a website that has been designed using technology owned exclusively by the designer. This means that when you need to alter the website in some way, the designer is the only one able to make the necessary changes. That usually means extra costs and delays in getting updates online. Ironically, another common error is that businesses constantly put off getting online altogether because they are so scared of making mistakes like these!  If you’ve sidestepped these pitfalls and have already established a functioning website for your enterprise, then your business-plan readers will want to know something about it.  They’ll want to know, for example, how many visits your website gets each month and how many of these are repeat visits. They’ll also be interested in learning how these visitors find your website. Are they being directed to you through social media, for instance, or from search engines, or via other website referrals?  Don’t forget to include some information about what your visitors do once they land on your website. Specifically, how many of them instantly click away from it. The percentage of visitors who do this is called the bounce rate. Lastly, your plan should address your website’s conversion rate. This refers to the proportion of people who visit your website and also end up buying something on it.   The prospect of gathering all this information might seem daunting, but your website’s web analytics tools should make finding these various statistics and rates quite straightforward.  For some entrepreneurs, borrowing money is a big no-no. These cautious folk want to grow their business under their own steam, gradually reinvesting profits in the company until it grows to its full potential. But for other new business owners, the scenic route is too slow. They want fast growth – and that means borrowing. If you want to steer your business into the fast lane, though, make sure you look before you leap – poor borrowing decisions have sunk many business dreams!  Luckily, you can avoid making costly financial mistakes by understanding what type of borrowing your business requires.  If you’re starting a plumbing business, for example, you might borrow money to buy the tools you’ll need in order to start working for customers. However, you probably won’t require this money for long because you’ll be paid in cash by your customers and can expect to be paid swiftly after completing jobs for them. You can therefore assume your bank balance will be in the black after the first few months, without the need for borrowed funds.  In this case, it doesn’t make sense to arrange a long-term loan to provide your plumbing business’s start-up money because the loan’s interest payments would still have to be made on the balance, despite you no longer being in debt. Therefore, the best solution to your borrowing needs is to take out a basic overdraft. Then, as you begin to get jobs and payments, you can pay back this overdraft as quickly as you like.  In contrast, many new businesses begin trading in a more complex financial situation - and that’s where the need for a proper loan comes in. Let’s say, for example, that you want to start a manufacturing business for which you will need a team of workers and costly production facilities. In this scenario, although you may win a lot of contracts as soon as you start trading, those contracts will not be paid until after your workers have already been working for a substantial period of time. Nonetheless, you must still spend money on your staff’s wages and on producing the goods in the interim. The money that a business needs for production before they can be paid is called working capital. To obtain your working capital, you’ll need to secure a long-term loan and, if you’re smart, try and negotiate with the bank to ensure you get a lengthy holiday period. This refers to the period before you have to start repaying the loan, which would ultimately give you a bit of time to start getting paid by your customers.  Now that you know what’s going into your business plan, it’s time to present this information in the best way possible. When it comes to writing your ideas down, there is a right way and a wrong way to go about it. Get it right and you’ll have an engaged reader who’s eager to lend you money. But get it wrong and you’ll bore your audience and significantly reduce your chances of a cash injection.  You can help your business plan hit the spot by keeping certain style elements in mind as you write it.  Firstly, try to express your ideas as clearly and simply as possible. Remember, your reader will probably have other things on her mind when she looks at your plan and you may not have her undivided attention. So never use a long word when a short one will do and don’t pack each line with lots of ideas. Long, complicated sentences are a sure-fire way to confuse your audience.  Secondly, make sure your business plan is as brief as possible. Your potential investor will disengage if your plan is overly long with unnecessary detail. If you’re unsure how much to write, then a good rule of thumb is to think about how much money your plan is asking for. Your bank manager won’t be interested in reading lots of pages if all you’re requesting is three hundred dollars. On the flip side, if you’re asking for a loan of half a million dollars then investors will want more information about your venture’s strategy and prospects. So, for example, if you want to start a retailing business with substantial amounts of borrowed funds, then your business plan should contain plenty of explanation about the market that exists for your goods and how you’ll position yourself within it. Lastly, aim to be completely truthful in your business plan. Making exaggerated claims might seem like a clever ploy at this stage, but this approach will backfire further down the road. You can avoid overstating things by setting down figures instead of vague statements. So rather than proclaiming your product “the cheapest,” prove how cheap it is by writing the price of your product compared to its competitors instead. After all, your audience is likely to be highly numerate; they’ll appreciate precise numbers more than words.  Your future success depends on your ideas being both coherent and viable. Luckily, there’s no better way to test them than by setting them down on paper. So think of your business plan as the first step to making your dreams a reality. Good luck!  The key message in these blinks: A great business plan is your key to unlocking funding for your new project. To secure your reader’s investment, you’ll need to demonstrate an understanding of your industry’s challenges and address specific topics such as the market for your goods, your cash flow forecast and your online presence. Lastly, be sure to express your ideas in simple language that focuses on precise figures and avoids vague statements.  Actionable advice: Expanding businesses need a plan too.  If you’re looking for a cash injection to expand an existing business rather than to start one from scratch, then your business plan will still need to address the same topics. However, you should give two of these topics extra attention. When writing about your target market, for example, you’ll need to demonstrate that there is sufficient demand for a larger amount of your goods or services. Secondly, when writing about your methods, you’ll need to show you’ve considered that a bigger business might require a different management structure and that you have plans to appoint additional managers if necessary.    Got feedback?

But does the fact that start-ups are ubiquitous mean that successful entrepreneurial ventures are easy to create? Well, not really – especially if you don’t have the guidance and knowledge you need to get you started on the right track. First of all, you should make sure you have passion, a great idea and a great product. But what then? These blinks will show you. As a practical guide on how to go about launching a start-up, they’ll provide you with useful advice on everything from product development to hiring and managing employees. In these blinks, you’ll also learn what a former executive at LinkedIn and PayPal has to say about delegating work; how to present your start-up to others without confusing them; and why the homepage for the start-up Wufoo makes dinosaur sounds. Did you ever build a house of cards as a kid? These flimsy constructions need a strong base and consistent design if you want them to stay standing. Similarly, all start-ups need solid foundations to achieve sustainable growth. So how can you ensure you get off to a good start? By working with more than one founder. A start-up with two or three founders stands a good chance of sustaining itself because it has multiple skill sets built into its foundation. Say one founder is a strong business developer. He’ll need a cofounder with great people skills, and perhaps another with more technical knowledge. In this way, cofounders can compensate for each other's weaknesses, creating stronger foundations overall. Other crucial aspects in creating a sustainable start-up are simplifying and delegating. Let’s first take a closer look at how founders can boost their start-up by keeping things simple. According to former Linkedin and Paypal executive Keith Rabois, simplifying processes can increase overall performance by 30 to 50 percent. For instance, don’t come up with a long list of growth initiatives and try to pursue all of them at once. Instead, distill that list down to three items or less. This will help everyone understand what is important and allocate their time accordingly. Rabois also advises founders to delegate projects to employees. But this doesn’t mean assigning a team member a task and then micromanaging them every step of the way; this only slows processes and makes teams disgruntled. Instead, it’s best to let employees take the initiative and get their creative juices flowing. Feel free to guide your team through critical decisions by explaining your perspective. But if you really want them to start innovating, you’ll need to get out of their way! On top of great founders, simplification and delegation, there’s another ingredient central to sustainable start-ups: team members. Not everyone has what it takes to work in a start-up, so what should you be looking for when hiring? And when should you hire? In the beginning, it’s best to do as much as you can yourself. You’ll need to save every penny to create your product and market it to customers. As your business grows, you’ll need a few extra hands to get things done – and by then, you’ll be able to afford it, too. But because your start-up is still likely to be quite small, it won’t make sense to go out and hire an entire team and a bunch of interns. Nope, one or two all-rounders are all you’ll need. Just look at Airbnb, which only hired a total of two new employees in its first year of existence! Just as founders handle duties across several fields, early-stage employees should be comfortable managing everything from product development to PR to logistics. Once you’re ready to hire, seek out someone who can handle a wide variety of tasks. Of course, in order for employees to stay motivated while taking care of multiple responsibilities, they need to be passionate. This is something that Airbnb took very seriously when hiring. CEO Brian Chesky actually asked interviewees if they would still work for Airbnb if they had one year to live. Those who said they wouldn’t were not advanced in the hiring process. Unfortunately, not all hiring processes are foolproof. Sometimes new team members who shine in interviews lose their enthusiasm after the first few weeks. If things just aren’t working out, you have to let them go. In these early stages of a start-up, you simply can’t afford to have people on your team who aren’t committed. Once you’ve found great employees, their happiness should be a top priority. After all, you want them to stick around! Give them credit for what they achieve, and help them make their work feel like less of a job and more of a calling. If you’re getting ready to go to a job interview, go on a date or meet a group of new people, you would probably try to look your very best. Everybody knows that first impressions go a long way, so why would we think any differently about the first impressions that we give customers? Our first interactions are vital to developing stable relationships with them. To grab the attention of new customers and keep them coming back, you’ll need to make a good first impression. From e-mail campaigns to public billboards, it’s important that each customer’s first experiences with you are positive and memorable. Sometimes all it takes is a small special feature to get customers engaged. When customers visit the homepage of online survey service Wufoo, they are greeted by the cute little roowwwrrrrrrr! of a cartoon dinosaur. Gestures such as these put smiles on the faces of customers, giving them positive and lasting memories about your company. Unfortunately, most companies aren’t able to charm all of their customers with a cartoon dinosaur. Different demographics have different needs and values, as do individuals within those demographics. Responding to an individual customer’s needs is a challenge, especially for younger, smaller companies. For this reason, start-ups often need to be resourceful with the team that they have. For Wufoo, solving the problem of answering the needs of each customer meant having their software development team spend time helping and supporting customers directly. What did this entail? Well, each developer spent 30 percent of their working week interacting with customers who were having problems. While this might seem like a lot of effort, it allowed the developers to tap directly into the needs of their customers. As a result, they were able to respond to these same needs when designing the overall service. Fishing is, a lot of the time, about waiting. Once you’ve tied your line and cast it, all that’s left is to wait for the fish to bite. Fishing for customers, however, is a different story altogether. If we want customers to bite, we need to actively seek them out. Most start-ups already know who their ideal potential customers are. But do they know how to find them? The key here is building relationships, even on personal levels. And conferences are a great way to make one-on-one connections with prospects. But choosing the right conference to attend is crucial. Firstly, the conferences you attend should be relevant to your business. That is to say that, if you run a fintech start-up, you’d be best served heading to fintech conferences where you know you’ll meet people interested in your business. It’s also best to visit smaller conferences, as they offer you a better chance of making small talk with potential customers, engaging with them personally and thus letting your business stand out. Keep in mind that talking to customers doesn’t mean giving them an exhaustive account of your product’s features. That won’t get you very far! What really works is listening. When we listen to people, we show them that we care for and understand their needs. For this reason, people tend to have faith and trust in those who listen to what they have to say. In your case, this faith and trust may result in people buying your product. But what if customers don’t seem interested after your first attempts? Don’t despair! That’s what follow-ups are for. After all, we all get caught up in the pressures of our daily routines. Sometimes all it takes to get customers on your side is a little reminder. By frequently following up with a potential customer, you can show them that you are reliable and eager to help them with any problems they might have. Therefore, as a rule, it’s perfectly fine to make regular and continuous attempts to follow up on first interactions until that potential customer shows a clear sign of interest or disinterest. Most of us would want to get our start-ups up and running with a minimal amount of investor money. After all, it always seems more impressive that way! But at some point, virtually every start-up will need help from investors. In fact, it’s better to get their support while you’re ahead; this protects you from rival start-ups keen to take the lead. So how can you charm investors onto your side? Investors are always on the lookout for companies with real products that customers love and which are making money. This demonstrates that a start-up is sustainable, that the entrepreneur can stand on her own two feet and that there’s market interest in the product. Investing in these start-ups seems less risky and much more appealing. Start-ups with investor support are then able to grow and compete more effectively. But having a great, working product isn’t always enough. To win over investors, you’ll need to present them with the perfect pitch. A perfect pitch should include three things: your product, the market size and your growth rate. Make it clear what it is your start-up does by imagining your listener has no idea about the company or its context. Say you had to explain Airbnb to your grandmother; you’d probably say something along the lines of “We let people rent out extra rooms in their houses.” Keeping things simple is the key! Next, tell your potential investor about the size of your target market and your opportunities to reach interested customers. This will help them get an idea of their chances of getting great returns on their investment. Finally, show investors how fast you’re growing with the help of key statistics. Here’s an example: “We started in February, and now we’re already growing at a rate of 35 percent each month. Our sales total is $10,000 and we have 6,000 users and counting.” The key message in this book: Building a start-up isn’t easy. By taking steps to ensure you start off right, whether in your marketing, hiring processes or even your founding team, you can put your start-up on the path to success. Actionable Advice: Check your user activity and follow the curve!  Next time you’re wondering why and how your product needs to develop, start checking your user activity. Calculate the percentage of users that are active at least once per month, draw a retention curve based on when they signed up for your service and update it monthly with your data. An asymptotic curve means you’re going in the right direction, and can start making the most of growth tactics. But if the curve keeps plummeting without flattening out, you need to work on getting a product-market fit. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

He’s one of those guys who moved to Dallas, Texas for the sunshine and the women. But he is also one of those extraordinary characters who took a little and turned it into a lot. Specifically, he is the founder of MicroSolutions and Broadcast.com, which he turned into multi-million dollar businesses, and also happens to be the owner of an NBA basketball team. Want to know how he did it? In How to Win at the Sport of Business, Mark Cuban serves up his knowledge and personal experience from the business world on a silver platter. He also offers priceless tips on how to make your own business prosper and become a great success. In these blinks, you’ll discover why whining is a good thing after all; how Mark Cuban turned his passion for basketball into a business; and how to get ahead of your competitors. When Mark Cuban moved to Dallas at the age of 24, he was looking for three things: sunshine, job opportunities and women. He had a broken-down car and a few polyester suits, and started off sleeping on the floor of an acquaintance's tiny apartment. Cuban had several jobs, which he knew would help his career because they all represented opportunities to learn. While many people assume they need to find the perfect job right after college and commit to it, that’s not necessarily the best way to start your career. Rather, it’s better to build and develop a variety of skills first.  As a young man fresh out of college, Cuban spent a few months at Mellon Bank, where he learned about computer systems. As a budding entrepreneur, he also endeavored to improve the company without consulting his boss first – which got him fired.  After moving to Dallas, he got another job working with software. He bought himself a computer for $99 and started teaching himself programming. He devoted his time to this new pursuit rather than returning to university, as it was an opportunity to get paid while learning.  When working a number of temporary jobs, there’s another valuable lesson to be learned: other people’s methods won’t always be best for you.  Working a variety of jobs helps you learn about yourself, your skills and your ambitions, but it can also teach you a lot about where businesses or bosses go wrong.  When Cuban found that his bosses weren’t open to their employees’ ideas, he decided that he simply couldn’t work there any longer. So he left and founded his own company, MicroSolutions, which sold PC software and configured computers.  Microsolutions had its share of problems – at one point, a secretary stole nearly all the company’s money – but Cuban was able to grow it into a strong company that eventually brought in revenue of over $30 million. A few years after Cuban had started MicroSolutions, he sold it for $6 million.  When you’re starting a small business, it sometimes feels like it will stay small forever. But as Cuban showed, any kind of business can end up making it big.  After MicroSolutions, Cuban founded AudioNet, which he later renamed Broadcast.com. It was an internet radio platform that allowed people to tune into NBA and NFL games online. Yahoo eventually became interested in the company and, in 1999, Cuban and his partner Todd Wagner sold it to them for $5.9 billion.  Like Cuban, you can also reinvest the money you earn from your first success into a new business that’s more in line with your personal interests. If you’re passionate about something and have the money, why not find a way to invest in it? Cuban wanted to make his mark on basketball, so after he sold Broadcast.com, he used the money to buy the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA.  Next, he decided to make some changes. Cuban had learned about the importance of customer satisfaction during his early years in Dallas, so he started selling tickets to Mavericks’ games for as little as $2. He went to the team’s games often but he didn’t sit in the front row; he wanted to sit among the regular fans, so he could have the same experience as his customers.  Cuban’s success relied on his brilliant entrepreneurial skills and good sense of timing. The next blinks will look at his most important business mantras and the lessons he learned while achieving his success. Cuban learned some of his most valuable lessons in his early adulthood, while working day and night to grow MicroSolutions into a successful business.  One of the most important lessons he learned was to never stop learning.  Take any opportunity you can to educate yourself. One example is simply to read, and to read about anything you’re interested in. Most people don’t take advantage of the vast array of reading material that we have instant access to, so follow a different path and read as much as you can.  Cuban spent all his time studying, while other people were watching TV or out having fun. He read about programming, famous entrepreneurs and studied software manuals; he did everything he could to get ahead of everyone else.  Business is a competition. If you want to win, you have to preempt your competitors, so keep your head in the game. Never stop trying to gain an edge on them.  After all, there will always be someone trying to put you out of business. Imagine that you’re one of your competitors, looking for any possible way to take your business out. What weaknesses in your company could a competitor take advantage of? Identify those weaknesses before someone else does! You should also run your company as if you’re going to compete with the best. If you’re aiming to compete with Google, start acting like it – it will prime you to deal with less dangerous competitors.  In business, you need to have an edge. You need the will to win and to be the smartest and most prepared person in the room. You have to be willing to sacrifice long hours while maintaining a positive attitude and treating the people around you well.  The game of business never ends, either. As long as you’re working, you’re competing. Don’t ever settle and think you’ve won, because there’s always another company out to get you! It’s not humanly possible to control every aspect of your business. But if you want to make it, you’ll have to work a lot.  In fact, you should be prepared to work day and night toward achieving your goals. There are a lot of unpredictable variables in sports and business alike, but there is one thing you always have power over: your own effort.  In business as in sports, you have to commit to staying up late every day, training for long hours and educating yourself. Work with customers and potential customers during the day, and prepare for the upcoming days at night.  That’s exactly how Cuban made MicroSolutions so successful. Even though he works with the Mavericks now, he still reminds himself every day to work hard and build on his success.  A good work ethic isn’t all you need, however. You also have to decide which opportunities to take, because you can’t take all of them.  More and more opportunities will start popping up as your company gets rolling. Don’t make the mistake of going for them all – it will distract you from your core goals and will probably end up hurting your business.  For example, there had been talk within the NBA of expanding the league to the international level, but Cuban said no. He knew that doing so would distract him and his team from focusing on where they were at that moment, and what they had to do to improve. Never lose sight of what you really want.  So, achieving success is about sticking to your goals and working hard. But if you want to get ahead in business there’s another crucial thing you need: money. When you’re a small business owner struggling with money, it’s tempting to look to big investors for funding. Even so, taking money from major investors can actually harm you and your business.  It’s likely that a venture capitalist will be able to help you out with financial matters in the beginning, but there’s a good reason why they’re often called vulture investors. If someone pays for your company, you’re under their control; if you can’t deliver on what you promised, you’ll be held responsible. It’s even possible for you to be replaced within your own business.  Instead of relying on big investors, learn how to be okay with slow growth. You don’t have to establish your business quickly – in fact, it’s sometimes better to grow slowly and build on your work with just a few employees.  MicroSolutions was initially formed just by Cuban and his friend Scott. The two learned about software and dedicated most of their time to finding customers and making a name for themselves. The company grew slowly.  When your business does start to grow, don’t lose sight of the most important part: your customers. It’s tempting to focus on growth instead, but remember that keeping your customers happy is always the most important aspect of any business. Even if you’ve got the greatest idea in the world, don’t forget that your customers are the ones who will bring you your success.  Cuban always wanted to be informed whenever his companies received customer complaints. He would try to respond to them personally, even after becoming a successful billionaire; he wanted his businesses to stay customer-focused.  In the last blink, we’ll look at the importance of sales and loving what you do – and learn how whining can actually be an asset! If someone calls you a whiner, you might feel insulted or embarrassed. But you shouldn’t! Whining isn’t always a bad thing.  In fact, whining can help you. It draws attention to things that are wrong and motivates you to address problems.  If you feel the need to whine, it means you’re facing some problems or challenges. When you let yourself whine, you’ll be motivated to fix those problems; otherwise, you’ll be stuck in your situation and will whine even more! That’s exactly why Mark Cuban loves to whine. When he saw the opening night of the Mavericks’ 1999 season, for instance, he complained about the general lack of energy and fun in the building. He figured he could create a better atmosphere, so he bought the Mavericks himself.  But, of course, you have to do more than just whine. You and your team still need to love the work you do and be able to sell your product.  It’s not enough for just you to love what you do – everyone who’s involved needs to love it as well. You and your team won’t have the stamina to push through all the hard work ahead of you if you aren’t genuinely passionate about what you’re doing. Without passion, you’ll just run out of steam.   For this very reason, you should only hire people who are as motivated as you are. Seek out team members who are dedicated to growth and progress.  Cuban hired Scott to work for MicroSolutions because he was equally passionate about growing the company. Scott even quit his previous job so he could fully commit to MicroSolutions, and spent days learning about different PCs and how to install various kinds of software.  All in all, Cuban’s story is a tale of dedication and staying true to oneself. If Mark Cuban can find his own way in the sport of business, you can too.  The key message in this book: Anyone can turn their dreams into real success, but it takes a lot of hard work. Stay dedicated, even if it means sleeping on a friend’s floor. Shoot for something realistic before breaking into your dream field, but never stop trying to get better and remember to pace yourself. Don’t forget that customers are the most important part of any business and, when the time is right, feel free to whine. If Mark Cuban did it, so can you! Actionable advice: Always be prepared for unexpected opportunities.  You never know when a great opportunity will arise. So stay prepared – don’t be afraid of something just because you weren’t expecting it to happen. The game of business never takes a break; if you get a chance to do something great, don’t let it slip away.

This catchy song should be your new mantra. Why? Because hustling will give you an edge and help you break away from the boring, mundane work life that’s dragging you down. To hustle is to make the small tweaks that will propel you into a new and better life. In these blinks, we will look at what that entails. You’ll learn to think like a hustler and discover actionable tips on how to get where you want to be in life. In these blinks, you’ll learn how half of Americans under 30 view the American dream; what the three M’s are and why you need them; and how POP is not just an email protocol. Are you one of those people who considers her job to be perfect and wouldn’t change a thing about it? Well, the majority of folks don’t fit that description. In fact, many people feel that their daily working life amounts to no less than a daunting, repetitive slog. Just take a Gallup poll which found that around 90 percent of the world’s workers don’t feel emotionally connected to their jobs. While the majority of people want to move away from this lifestyle, doing so is nearly impossible because of the way society is structured. After all, people end up in these jobs by following a very specific and common path. They go to college, maybe even graduate school, because they are told that’s the only way to land the kind of career they are expected to want. But education is expensive. Outstanding student loans in America rose to a staggering $516 billion in 2007. By 2015, that number had climbed to $1.2 trillion! This travesty means that the average college graduate owes over $30,000 in student loans. For graduate students, that number easily climbs to six figures. For most people, going to college means loading up on debt. Simultaneously, salaries have dropped and technology, paired with globalization, has meant an overall decline in the number of jobs. And who knows when people who are lucky enough to have jobs will be hit by the next major crisis and put out of work? In this frightening climate, people take jobs to pay off their debt and cover their bills rather than fulfill their dreams. Just take a 2015 study, in which researchers asked 18- to 29-year-olds if they thought the American Dream was dead or alive. While 49 percent answered “alive,” 48 percent said “dead.” But what other option is there other than doing these unfulfilling jobs? Well, that’s exactly what we’ll explore in the blinks that follow. By now it’s probably clear that lots of people are unfulfilled in their work lives and don’t see any way to break out of the pattern they’re in. However, there is an escape route: hustling. Hustling is an approach to life that’s designed to get you money, meaning and momentum. While some people might assume this means taking advantage of others, that’s absolutely not the case. Contrary to popular belief, hustling is not about stepping on the toes of other people, stealing, conning, or anything like that. It’s about forging ahead despite obstacles and difficulties. In other words, to hustle is to pursue your dreams. But if you’re an artist, do you really even need money? Well, historically, some artists haven’t. These creative practitioners claim to do their work solely for the sake of art, and, for a few, money is even repellent. Just take the copywriter and cartoonist, Hugh MacLeod. He says that artists inevitably compromise their art when they’re offered money for it. That being said, you need money to sustain your hustle, and if you can’t sustain your hustle, you can’t make your art. After all, if you don’t have the money to pursue your dreams, you won’t find meaning in your work or build the momentum to sustain your passion. The truth is, lots of artists were only able to pursue their work, and thereby create meaning and momentum, by turning a profit. Picasso is a great example. If it wasn’t for his financial success, he would have stopped making the paintings that both fulfilled him and captivated audiences for generations to come. Picasso even said that an artist must succeed enough to sustain his art. Money, whether people like it or not, is key. Do you own your dream? It may seem like an odd question, but most people are merely renting theirs. In other words, they’re playing by the rules of the rigged system and closing their eyes to what truly brings them joy. Such an outlook means accepting the dreams doled out by the system and never having ownership over your own. It means doing the job you don’t like and telling yourself it’s a great opportunity. So how are you going to achieve your dreams? To reach your goals, you need to hustle, even if it means taking a gamble. Hustling is all about risk-taking; it’s about setting out on a journey that might afford you new opportunities, change and even the fulfillment of your dreams. Just take the electrical engineer Ernesto and his wife, a nurse named Luci. In their native Cuba, businesses are burdened by an overbearing government bureaucracy that siphons away people’s hard-earned money. Ernesto often thought of starting a business but wanted to do it beyond the reach of the government, which would mean serious risks, even jail time, if he were caught. While it was a tough decision, he finally decided to start off doing small projects for friends and acquaintances, which slowly grew into a bigger business. By the end of his career he’d earned a handsome chunk of money and, while the hazards were real, it was all worth it in the end. His family had enough to take care of their basic needs and even afford a nice car. Breaking out of the convenience of a sheltered life – even one that’s monotonous and unfulfilling – can be tough. But to snag your dream while you still can and make truly life-altering changes, you’ll need to push yourself into territory that’s somewhat painful and uncomfortable. However, you only need to takes small steps at a time. What if you dream of being a star public speaker but you’re terrified of appearing in front of crowds. Instead of talking to a massive crowd straightaway, start giving short speeches every night at the dinner table. Doing so might be uncomfortable, but this discomfort is actually good. It’s a small dose of discomfort that you can overcome, improving in the process. Then, when your dinnertime speeches are a piece of cake, make them longer, or speak to more people. Slowly but surely you can broaden your experience until you’re living your dream. And remember, such momentum can bring luck. When you push through and persevere, luck becomes more likely. So, while you might feel like giving up, whether on a job, a book, or a personal project you’re invested in, persisting will pay off in the end. When famous director Francis Ford Coppola was filming Apocalypse Now, practically everything went wrong. There was bad weather on the set, the schedule kept getting pushed back and the costs were getting out of hand. Not just that, but Coppola was in constant conflict with his actors, who were regularly drunk or stoned. He wanted nothing more than to quit, but he didn’t. He persevered instead and, all of a sudden, luck started to come his way. The weather cleared up, the actors gave powerful performances and, by the end of it, they had produced a film that won multiple Academy Awards. By now you know a decent amount about hustling, but you don’t know the Three Unseen Laws: heart, head and habits. The first of these is crucial because doing something that’s close to your heart will move you to action and keep you forging ahead. You might have a feeling of joy, anger or revenge that will push you to accomplish your goals. Maybe you’re pissed off that your smartphone earbuds keep getting tangled up in your pocket and are certain there’s another way. Before you know it you’re thinking through the design for a pocket-sized box that keeps your headphones neat and tidy. Next, you must use your head to observe and benefit from things that aren’t immediately visible. Just imagine you’re the captain of a ship. You naturally need to stay abreast of the wind and waves to navigate accurately, but you also need to check the undercurrents. You might want to avoid them or you might be able to use them to arrive at your destination faster. The point is, while lots of people only see obstacles, a hustler keeps her head cool and sees opportunities wherever they might be. And finally, it’s important to make a habit of setting milestones and deadlines. After all, everyone needs closure at one point or another. Setting intermediate goals will commit you to doing a certain amount of work, and deadlines will push you to get it done. Say you want to write a book. You could set a one-week deadline for writing 10,000 words and make a daily habit of waking up at seven in the morning and writing for two hours. Once you achieve your one-week deadline you can set another one and keep moving toward your goal. Do you have a portfolio of your work? If not, you should definitely consider putting one together. After all, a Personal Opportunity Portfolio, or POP, is a great way to showcase you and your work while attracting people and companies that will help you attain your dreams. This tool, which consists of four parts, lays out exactly who you are, which is invaluable in making progress. While a resumé describes what you’ve done so far, a future employer really wants to understand where you’re going. That’s where the first part of the POP comes in: potential. If your dream is to be an online marketing manager for a cosmetics company you might try experimenting with different brands and writing up your experiences on a blog. If you can get enough traffic flowing to your site, you’ll have demonstrated the potential you have to engage in the field. The next pillar of your POP is people, which naturally is all about your network, both on and offline. A great way to expand this network is to connect others. By facilitating such connections you’ll benefit others, but you’ll also pull people into your own network. The third piece is projects. This portion of your POP should detail everything you’re currently working on, whether it’s volunteering at the Red Cross, writing your blog or pitching ideas to new acquaintances at meetups. This section presents your interests while showing your ability to do work and get results. And finally, the proof section is essential to demonstrate your credibility. After all, if you can’t back up your words with evidence, you’ll never be able to impress the right people. Anybody can say that they write compelling blog posts, but very few people can provide links, references and examples of such captivating work. Being able to do so will show that you can deliver what you say you will. The key message in this book: Hustling tends to get a bad rap but actually, it’s a positive way of persevering and shooting for your dreams. You’ll always be able to find a way to reach your deepest goals as long as you’re willing to step off the conventional path, push ahead no matter what and aim for what you truly want.

There are many reasons why we don’t act on great ideas. You probably felt overwhelmed by the complexity of starting a business from scratch or were intimidated by the amount of capital you might need to get started. But times have changed. The fact is, it’s never been easier to set up a company, quickly and with little or no investment. These blinks show you the steps, from day zero to infinity, to starting a business and keeping it going once you’ve begun. The secret? Optimize, automate and outsource. In these blinks, you’ll learn why a lack of available funds is not a deal breaker for an aspiring entrepreneur; how to build and manage a remote team of workers; and why customer engagement is crucial to a company’s success. Many people believe that starting a company requires years of careful planning and diligent market research. But sometimes it’s best to seize an idea spontaneously and run with it. While it might sound crazy, it’s possible to bring a start-up to life in just 24 hours. This isn’t mere hyperbole, as it’s been done! In August 2015, authors Ari Meisel and Nick Sonnenberg were having dinner when they came up with an idea: a company that provided virtual assistants. Both friends had extensive expertise in maximizing business efficiency and productivity, so it seemed quite feasible. Just one day later, their business was up and running. How did they realize their idea so rapidly? And why did they feel the need to act immediately? Their timing was propitious, as Zirtual, one of the largest US-based virtual assistant firms, had just folded. This left 2,500 clients without assistants and 400 assistants without a job. Ari and Nick saw the opportunity of a lifetime – but only if they responded quickly. The authors knew they had a narrow window of opportunity. This is, of course, true for all start-ups, regardless of industry. Savvy entrepreneurs know to grab an opportunity while it’s hot. The duo that night made a quick sketch of their virtual assistant business. Their first clients and assistants were secured from the Zirtual fallout. Within 24 hours, their company, Less Doing Virtual Assistants, was up and running, using free online tools and apps as infrastructure. They didn’t need a penny to get started, and their business was scalable and profitable from day one. Over the year, Ari and Nick consolidated their company, dealing with challenges as they arose. These blinks tell the story of that adventurous year. The authors were well aware of the flaws of other virtual assistant companies, and knew that their start-up could address such problems more effectively. One of the major limitations of the virtual assistant business model was that it offered either on-demand assistants or long-term dedicated assistants. On-demand assistants are assigned simple, one-time assignments, such as coordinating a delivery or arranging an appointment. Because there’s no continuity or long-term relationship, they can’t work on large projects. Dedicated assistants, in contrast, are responsible for a wide range of tasks for a single client – but can also represent a bottleneck, since one person only has so many hours in a day. Under the Zirtual model, all of the client’s needs, whether booking meetings, conducting marketing research or designing a website, would be delegated to a dedicated virtual assistant. But it was unlikely that the virtual assistant would have a sufficiently broad skill set to manage the variety of tasks assigned. This is where Ari and Nick identified the market opportunity: there was room for a new model to match a client’s needs with assistants specifically suited to a task. It’s a simple truth that business success starts with offering customers a different or better service than what is currently available. The duo’s business acumen armed them with the knowledge that busy executives were looking for a one-stop solution for hiring virtual assistants. Ari and Nick came up with the innovation of addressing both issues with one solution: a client’s specific needs would be matched with the specific skills of an assistant, but through one channel – their company. Clients would benefit from a team of assistants. The team would be small enough to remain intimate and personal, but large enough to ensure that each client request was completed by a person uniquely qualified for the task. A manager would lead each team and serve as the client’s point of contact, thus ensuring a personal touch and maximum efficiency. If you think a start-up can’t launch without sophisticated, expensive infrastructure, think again. A new business can be run easily with software tools that are not only free but also easy to use. To manage client tasks, Nick used a free management program called Trello. Trello’s structure is straightforward. It offers boards for specific projects; lists that give the status of a project; and cards that show which tasks still need to be completed. Nick found an innovative way to use the software’s project boards, deciding to assign a board to each client. He then created a template to make uniform lists for each client, ensuring continuity. Each board now reflected a client’s requested tasks and the status of each – fulfilling the basic operational needs of the start-up at no cost. The next step was to ensure that the new business wasn’t merely offering basic services but was going above and beyond each client’s expectations. The virtual assistant industry mostly targets demanding, high-earning professionals, so guaranteeing a maximum of quality would be key to the company’s success. To secure the most talented assistants in the market, Ari and Nick committed to paying employees two to six times the going rate for requested services. Doing so also meant the company would charge clients four to eight times more than other virtual assistant companies. Offering top-notch services was how they justified the higher prices. They also billed by the second and openly shared all timesheets with the client. Here’s just one example of the start-up’s focus on premium service: they created a business website for a client of theirs, a real estate agent named Chip, and had a virtual assistant follow up on the leads coming through it. The assistant only booked appointments for Chip if the lead was qualified – so all Chip had to do was show up on the date and time of the appointment to seal a deal, allowing Chip to do less but win more. This was exactly the kind of time-saving service that the company’s name promised! Applying for jobs is a grueling process. But hiring employees isn’t a walk in the park either – in fact, hiring can be one of the most energy-consuming tasks for a young company. So when you begin to look for new team members to grow your start-up, you need to have a thoughtful, efficient strategy in place. Once Ari and Nick had established their start-up’s infrastructure, they were ready to hire some high-quality assistants to build the business – seeking maximum returns for minimal effort. First, they created two email addresses: jobs@lessdoing.com and interview@lessdoing.com. Candidates would send an application to jobs@lessdoing.com and receive an automated response detailing the position available. The applicant was then instructed to send a two-minute video pitch and upload it to YouTube, sending the link to interview@lessdoing.com. Right off the bat, this two-step process eliminated about 80 percent of applicants. Those who couldn’t figure out the instructions properly or created a poor-quality video were immediately filtered out. Ari and Nick figured that if an applicant couldn’t come up with a creative solution to the problem, then that person certainly wouldn’t make a good virtual assistant. Second, the team made sure they identified proactive candidates with a winning attitude. Top-notch virtual assistants need to have not only excellent problem-solving skills but also the ability to plan ahead and seize opportunities when they arise. One of Less Doing’s many experienced virtual assistants offers a prime example of this ideal type. By following the Facebook posts of an important client, the assistant learned that they loved a particular brand of whiskey. The company could then send the client a bottle as a special birthday present. It is this attention to detail and dedication to customer service that sets a proactive worker – and business – apart from the rest. Networking is essential to moving your company to the next level. You can’t just make a great product; you have to get out there and show it off. In November 2015, Ari and Nick were invited to speak at a Genius Network event that Ari had participated in a few years earlier. Joe Polish’s Genius Network brings together industry leaders, well-known authors and high-powered entrepreneurs. They didn’t have sufficient time to prepare for the event, however, and delivered their presentation off the cuff. Yet the two entrepreneurs had so much to say about their start-up’s methods of tracking and outsourcing tasks that they held the audience rapt for some three and a half hours! Audience members also posed some questions about the service, giving Ari and Nick the opportunity to demonstrate their company’s approach to solving problems right then and there. After the workshop was over, 90 percent of the people in the room had signed up to Less Doing’s virtual assistant services – a networking success! Getting a flood of new clients is good news, right? Sure – but sometimes growing quickly also brings new challenges and might require restructuring. The start-up had to quickly come up with a way to deal with this boom. Nick built a new tool, a custom-coded dashboard that would give him and Ari an overview of all their Trello client boards. The dashboard enabled them to easily see all tasks and each task’s status, so they could optimize where to focus their attention and the attention of their team. Now the team could keep an eye on the company’s overall performance while maintaining rapid growth. When you’re nurturing a project that you feel is your “baby,” it’s not always easy to hear negative feedback. But when you do, it’s vital to act decisively to fix the issues, before they bring down your company. By January 2016, Less Doing was thriving, but some customers were complaining that the onboarding process wasn’t smooth enough. When Ari and Nick realized that this was costing them clients, they started to proactively attack areas of improvement in the company. One of their tools was the 5 Whys method. First, articulate the nature of the problem, then ask why the problem exists. Once you find an answer, ask “Why?” again. Repeat the questioning process three more times. By the end, you’ve led yourself to the root of the problem. This method led Ari and Nick to realize they needed to simplify their software interface and also provide clients with better instructions for using it. Once tweaked, the onboarding process for clients was seamless. To avoid future client complaints, the entrepreneurs decided to encourage employees to think proactively by using another tool called the Kaizen method. This method was pioneered by Japanese companies such as Toyota and Mitsubishi. Kaizen translates to “change for the better.” With the Kaizen method, every person in a company – from cleaners to C-level leaders – is asked for input on what the company could improve, based on personal experience. For Less Doing, this meant asking every virtual assistant to submit one idea per week on how to improve the company’s processes or methods. Immediately Ari and Nick were presented with a problem with an easy solution. They learned that some virtual assistants weren’t sure how to properly charge clients. It turns out that assistants had been performing extra administrative work free of charge, leading to some frustration. The Kaizen method raised this issue to a level where it could be addressed, taking care of both the clients’ and assistants’ needs appropriately. By the time your business is going strong, you will have acquired many skills and a lot of insider knowledge. You’ll then have the opportunity to create a secondary source of income through teaching other entrepreneurs what you’ve learned along the way. To gauge the potential of training as a new offering, Less Doing advertised on Facebook that it would sponsor a business boot camp. Some 20 participants signed up, and the presentation overall went well. But feedback after the event made it clear that the authors had come on too strong, overloading the audience with complicated technical terms and demonstrations. While the experience on the surface seemed like a setback, it provided Ari and Nick with some useful data. They realized that hosting live events required a huge time commitment and also wasn’t the optimal format for the information they wanted to share. This is an important lesson: you need to be flexible and ready to adjust course as you develop a new branch of your business. Ari and Nick didn’t put an end to their teaching venture; they instead reconfigured their strategy. By moving all its operations online, it eventually became a sustainable arm of the business. Building a successful company requires an entrepreneur to constantly optimize operations, such as considering which tasks can be delegated or even outsourced. Many managers try to keep a tight grip on a business as it grows, but sometimes it’s smarter to let go and step back from the day to day. Until April 2016, Ari managed Less Doing’s dashboard, ensuring no assistant was late in completing a task and that all clients were satisfied with the company’s services. Eventually, he delegated this task to a virtual assistant who performed so well that she was named general manager just two weeks after taking the reins. Ari and Nick decided to train another virtual assistant to handle the company’s financial and payroll needs. Soon afterward, she was named the financial head of Less Doing. Each of these situations was certainly win-win for Ari and Nick, who now had more time to dedicate to improving other aspects of the company. And there was much to improve! It’s not enough for a company to offer a great service; it has to ensure that clients are truly engaged with the product. Less Doing still struggled to get its clients to commit fully. For example, some clients continued to perform tasks themselves that a virtual assistant could have handled. The authors sought the help of behavioral psychologist Nir Eyal, author of the bestselling book Hooked, to help them find a better strategy to increase client participation. They discovered that they needed to invest more time and energy in the onboarding process to ensure new clients got hooked on the Less Doing service. So the company changed its approach. Instead of spending 15 minutes on the phone with a new client, virtual assistants were to spend at least an hour coaching clients on how to best use Less Doing software to address personal and professional needs. This process better acquainted clients with the range of Less Doing services, allowing clients to use their time more efficiently and commit to relying on more virtual assistance. Once you’ve solidified the processes that keep your company running, it’s time to start working with your performance numbers. When Ari and Nick took a hard look at their company’s numbers, they realized the next task was to optimize the company’s “churn rate.” This industry term describes the percentage of clients who drop a company’s services or product after a given period, such as within three months. Using a tool called ChartMogul, the company tracked exactly how long customers used Less Doing services. The authors soon discovered that clients who ended up dropping the service were those who used it less than once every few weeks. This knowledge helped Ari and Nick to establish a best practice. When a client was inactive for two weeks, they made sure to personally reach out to the client and address any issues, to ensure Less Doing didn’t end up losing the client’s business. This sort of extra effort might seem time-consuming, but it’s always better to invest in your company than to lose clients based on inaction. It isn’t always easy to muster the motivation to go this extra mile, of course. It can also be frustrating to discover that after a year of hard work, you’re still sinking a lot of time and money into your company. But remember: if you want to grow, you have to keep investing. By mid-2016, Ari and Nick were still working hard to improve the company. Ari logged dozens of hours talking to inactive clients, working to drive the company’s churn rate from 11 percent down to three percent. Nick automated several aspects of the dashboard to help further in removing menial tasks from the team’s plate. They also strengthened outreach efforts by personalizing the company’s newsletter and increasing its presence on Facebook. At this point, Less Doing’s managerial team had grown, so the founders decided it was time to give key players an equity share in the company. These moves paid off, and as of July 2016, Less Doing had its most successful month ever, chalking up $100,000 in revenue. Not too bad for a company that started as a dream over dinner! The key message in these blinks: You don’t need a lot of money to launch a start-up. All you need is the ability to use existing tools to create a solid company structure and the tenacity to search for ways to improve your services.  Actionable advice: Be tough when you’re running a services company. To make sure virtual assistants were providing the best client experience possible, Ari and Nick implemented a policy of “three strikes, and you’re out.” If an assistant made three crucial mistakes, the person was fired. It might seem harsh, but such a policy ensures that only the best people are working for you. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

And yet, the modern world demands constant change and innovation from those who are serious about achieving their goals. What’s more, the pace of change is only going to accelerate in the future, so we’d better get used to this constant state of flux. But change doesn’t have to be scary. Let’s go on a journey with Beth Comstock, former vice chair of General Electric. We’ll take a close look at Comstock’s career and discover how she has successfully led change and navigated stumbling blocks in one of America’s most prolific corporations. We’ll learn how this introverted female publicist conquered a male-dominated company that had operated in the same way for over 125 years and dragged it into the modern digital world. In these blinks, you’ll learn what huge life-change Comstock made to succeed; how introversion can help you conquer the business world; and why conflict drives better innovation. Beth Comstock was the first female vice chair of General Electric (GE), one of America’s biggest companies. But Comstock’s professional life wasn’t always so promising. When she was in her early twenties, her life was headed down an entirely different track. That’s when she took big risks to change her life and shake up her career. Though she had long had ambitions of becoming a science journalist, by her mid-twenties, her career was stalling. Holding down two jobs as a part-time waitress and a minor news reporter in her hometown, she couldn’t seem to land any of the more promising jobs for which she applied. Disillusioned, she did what her parents and her small-town society expected of her. She settled down with her college boyfriend, got married and fell pregnant. Within only a few short months, she felt trapped. She knew there was a better life waiting for her if she only had the courage to reach for it. Throwing caution to the wind, she told her husband she wanted a divorce and moved with her infant daughter to Washington DC. Though she was choosing to become a single mother, with all its accompanying challenges, it was clear to her that only by embracing imperfection, complications and mistakes would she be able to get the full life she desperately wanted. Soon, her gamble paid off, and she got a job working in publicity at NBC’s news bureau in Washington. Within a short space of time, she was promoted and put in charge of the entire department. Significantly, she largely attributes her success to her capacity for action. She believes that most people labor under the idea that only those with considerable power – those of us who are already “leaders” in some way – have the capacity to take action. More often than not, those of us who don’t consider ourselves to be powerful are content to accept that we cannot effect change, whether in our personal or professional lives. But Comstock has always tended to take decisive action. Whether it was divorcing her husband and starting a new life or boldly implementing new ideas at work, she is proud to say that she has never made excuses to herself about why she can’t do what she needs to do and take the next step along the road to a better future. By 1998, Comstock’s media career was flourishing. Now 38 years of age, she was vice president of NBC News and had helped transform the network into a major media player. But once again, risk and change came knocking when the CEO of GE – the famous Jack Welch – asked her to join his company as vice president of corporate communications. She readily accepted, not knowing that this would be her toughest assignment yet. When she joined GE, she anticipated that pivoting from the world of media to that of industry would be a major challenge. But what she didn’t expect was the intense sexism she would face from her new colleagues. During the late 1990s, GE was an extremely male-dominated environment. So much so, that at the hotel the company used for its annual executives’ conference, the women executives had to use an improvised restroom next to the hotel’s kitchen as the actual women’s restroom in the conference hall was turned into a men’s restroom. This male-dominated culture was even more pronounced in GE’s headquarters. Comstock’s male executive colleagues frequently failed to invite her to crucial meetings and made it clear that they couldn’t stand the idea of a woman entering their domains, much less being in charge of important strategic decisions. Luckily, she had a secret weapon at her disposal when it came to handling this sexist hostility: she was an introvert. Although she was often not given much latitude to contribute to meetings and was generally made to feel like an outsider – she didn’t mind too much. As an introvert, she was already used to being a quiet outsider in the business arena, which is typically dominated by those with more extroverted personalities. So, to cope with her new environment, the author fell back on the natural advantages she possessed as an introvert. For instance, introverts may not make their voices heard in meetings, but they tend to be very good listeners and observers, capable of thoughtfully processing the ideas and discussions going on around them. In this new hostile environment, she was able to harness this introvert tendency to focus more on the ideas being expressed by her new colleagues, than on the colleagues themselves, who were often hostile toward her. In other words, her introversion gave her the ability to distance herself from her colleagues, focus only on their ideas, and not make it personal. When frightening situations occur, we often want to hunker down and take comfort in what’s safe and familiar. But believe it or not, these times of stress and adversity can also be hidden opportunities to try something new. On September 11th, 2001, Comstock was preparing for another ordinary day at GE. But then the first plane hit the World Trade Center – suddenly, the whole of America, including GE, was thrown into a state of crisis. In the days following the horrific attack, many of her communications colleagues tried to keep their heads down and get through the crisis as best they could. But Comstock knew that GE, and the country at large, needed an inspirational message in their darkest hour. As a company with a lot of business interests tied up in the aviation and airline industry, GE found its finances were hit particularly hard in the days after 9/11 when planes across America were grounded. With the company’s employees deeply shaken, Comstock decided that as the company’s communications chief, she had a duty to reassure the workforce. Additionally, she believed that GE, as one of America’s largest corporations, had a responsibility to act as a beacon of hope and leadership to the whole nation. She decided that GE needed to put out a special advertisement in America’s top newspapers to demonstrate strength in the face of adversity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of her colleagues thought she was mad. This was a time of national crisis. It would be business suicide for the company to seem to be profiting from this tragedy. But against all her colleague’s advice, the author decided to follow her gut and put out the advert – a full-page print ad depicting the Statue of Liberty rolling up her sleeves and stepping off her plinth. The text underneath was a simple message proclaiming that Americans would stand together, move forward, and never forget. Thankfully, the author’s creative gamble paid off. Within days, the advert had been cut out and taped to the walls of thousands of New York businesses, including the New York Stock Exchange. Amazingly, the cartoon itself became a symbol of New Yorkers’ defiance in the face of adversity. This just goes to show that you shouldn’t automatically reach for what’s familiar or comfortable in a crisis. Instead, triumph over adversity often requires bold innovation – imagining yourself forward through the darkness, toward the light. In the early 2000s, traditional television networks around the globe found themselves competing with a strange new player in the media world – cats playing the piano. New digital platforms such as YouTube and MySpace were suddenly vying for consumers’ attention. Traditional media networks would have to change to survive. But, as Comstock found out, there would be no change without conflict. To ensure GE’s television network, NBC, moved with the times, the company assigned Comstock to be NBC’s new head of digital. Her job was to oversee GE’s investment in new digital content for its media network. Unfortunately, some of her colleagues weren’t happy about this new allocation of resources – and they weren’t afraid to show it. In her efforts to bring about much-needed change at NBC, she faced particular hostility from the head of NBC’s TV group, Jeff Zucker. Zucker had experienced a meteoric rise through the NBC ranks after successfully transforming NBC’s The Today Show into the most-watched morning show in America. Unfortunately, Jeff couldn’t see past television. As the author attempted to drag NBC into a digital future, their conflict exploded. Zucker began to shout at Comstock in meetings, belittling her in the presence of the entire division. When the author suggested making cuts to his department to free up money for digital, things turned physical. Zucker grabbed her by her collar and physically dragged her out of his office after one particularly heated argument. When he found he couldn’t stop the digital onslaught this way, he tried another tactic – feeding stories to the New York Post that Comstock was a terrible person to work with. Unsurprisingly, Comstock was deeply shaken by these increasingly personal attacks. Nonetheless, she understands the company’s decision to allow her and Zucker to fight it out. Why? Because conflict is an indispensable part of change and progress. Great leaders accept that tension is not only inevitable but can also fuel innovation. Conflict often improves products and ideas because the innovator is usually forced to consider divergent viewpoints in the creation process, and often the idea evolves into something better as a result. In Comstock’s case, she eventually oversaw the successful acquisition of major digital platform iVillage in a deal worth $600 million. Change, as we all know, is inevitable. But in the modern economy, with its constant stream of new technologies, start-ups and disruptions to traditional industries, change comes ever more rapidly. Economists have even coined an acronym for it: VUCA – volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Unfortunately, during her tenure at GE, Comstock has witnessed the company having to learn about this uncertainty the hard way. In the early 2000s, things were looking rosy for GE, and stocks in the company climbed to an incredible $60. By 2007, however, the company’s finance department was starting to report incidences of company deals where the numbers weren’t adding up. Concerned, GE hired strategy consultants McKinsey to crunch the organization’s finances. The results of the analysis? Everything was fine, said McKinsey. But everything wasn’t fine. Just one year later, the subprime mortgage crisis hit. GE’s capital unit had invested in these mortgages, and the fallout from the crisis led the company to the edge of financial ruin. GE’s stock price crashed to a low of just $6.66, and the federal government was forced to bail the company out of impending bankruptcy. Interestingly, Comstock learned a valuable lesson during these tumultuous times: each uncertainty holds the promise of a new and better future. But to reach this better future, you have to be able to make sense of the uncertainty and build a coherent story around it. Too often, a story or narrative is something that corporations tack on to the end of their strategy as a final decoration. But in an uncertain world, stories shouldn’t be an afterthought; they should be front and center. After a distressing or unexpected event, whether at a personal or organizational level, people and organizations tend to lose all sense of meaning and purpose. After the humiliating near collapse of GE, many of its employees felt that their work didn’t matter anymore. This is where storytelling comes in. By creating and disseminating coherent stories about why the collapse had happened, and where the company was heading, the author found that her employees were finally able to start making some sense of this distressing event. And once they could do that, they could move on with building the company back up again. The mantra of the digital age is openness. In today’s economy, open and easy access to information and ideas has brought about a radical change in the way the world does business. Old hierarchies have been replaced by networks, and centralized business bureaucracies have given way to new platforms that are shared and decentralized. So where does GE fit into this brave new world of information sharing and openness? From 2007, GE saw how profitable this new generation of digital companies, such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, were becoming. Soon, GE’s top executives began to want a piece of this new digital pie for themselves. But the question was, would they be capable of the change needed to get it? Significantly, GE was a company born in a different time: the industrial age. This was a period when huge emphasis was put on top-down control, productivity and certainty. Therefore, to GE’s senior executives, the hyper-collaborative spirit of the twenty-first century’s networked era seemed like hippie-inspired insanity. GE’s power had always been based on first developing and owning knowledge, and then jealously guarding this knowledge and treating it as a major asset. But Comstock knew that this approach would not serve them in the digital era. Why? Because today’s problems, such as the environment, technological challenges and healthcare, are just too complex for one company to solve alone – even for a behemoth like GE. Additionally, power in the digital era is open, peer-driven and participatory. Just consider the enormous clout of social media companies such as Instagram and Twitter, which rely on the participation and content of millions of users. In an attempt to usher in this new age of collaboration and open participation at GE, she introduced an initiative. Under her guidance, GE created a high-profile event called the GE Ecomagination Challenge. This was an exciting new contest in which inventors and entrepreneurs from all over the world were invited to submit sustainable energy innovations. In collaboration with venture capital firms, GE selected the best ideas and gave the winners a share of $200 million to develop their innovations. At the end of their first step into the world of open collaboration and ideas sharing, GE had invested a total of $140 million in 23 new start-ups. Some of these start-ups were very successful, like Opower, a digital service helping households to conserve energy. This just goes to show that even the most traditional companies are capable of change. The key message in these blinks: To make any sort of meaningful progress, whether in the workplace or your personal life, you can’t be afraid to make bold changes. Being a cheerleader for change often brings conflict, resistance and uncertainty, but you shouldn’t let that hold you back. It is usually only when we take risks and lean into the unknown that brave, meaningful change happens.  Actionable advice: Don’t be afraid to dabble. During her tenure at GE, the author has often found herself called a “dabbler” by her colleagues. Why? Because she wasn’t afraid to test new ideas and innovations – to dabble in them – even if there was a good chance they wouldn’t be successful. Dabbling is a crucial part of the creative process. Psychologists believe that the difference between exceptional creatives and their more mediocre peers is not that they fail less often, but that they have a greater number of ideas. So if anyone accuses you of being a “dabbler,” remind them that science tells us that theories, insights and connections are born of more ideas and innovation, not fewer. Got feedback?

They fear how people perceive them and struggle to shake off the nagging doubts that they are small and insignificant – that their voice doesn’t matter. Well, Jessica Honegger is living proof that you should do away with your fears, step outside of your comfort zone and live a life of meaning and purpose. Honegger once hosted a jewelry sale to fund her goal of adopting a Rwandan orphan and generate income for poor artisans in Uganda at the same time. She didn’t know it at the time, but her home jewelry sale would, over several years, grow into a $17-million business run by 4,000 Noonday ambassadors, supporting thousands of artisans, many of them women, in countries across the globe. With no business know-how but some Christian faith, more than a little fear and a whole lot of determination, Honegger stepped outside of her comfort zone. In doing so, she achieved her dream of adoption, built a socially responsible business and discovered a life of purpose. In these blinks, you’ll learn why courage, even imperfect courage, is better than comfort; the importance of showing vulnerability; and how you can stop chasing impossible ideals and value yourself as you are. Jessica Honegger never intended to start Noonday, her jewelry and fashion business; it all kind of happened by accident. What she initially intended to do was adopt a child. Years earlier, on a trip to Africa, she held a young child, orphaned after her parents died from AIDS, in her arms. From that moment on, she knew in her heart that the next step for her family would be, eventually, to adopt. Unfortunately, international adoption is expensive, and just at the time their plan for adoption was coming together, the housing market collapsed. Since she and her husband were making a living from refurbishing and reselling properties, their income disappeared too. Honegger needed a side hustle, and she needed it now. She remembered that friends of hers in Uganda had been bemoaning the fact that two incredible local artists, Jalia and Daniel Matovu, a husband and wife team, had no way of selling their artisan crafts for a price their work deserved. Honegger made a decision. She would host a sale for the Matovus’ products to friends and family back in Austin, as well as clothes from her own closet and anything else she could find. She wasn’t sure whether it would work; in fact, she was slightly afraid none of her friends would turn up to her sale, and of what people would think of her. But it worked. Her friends showed up. They cared about her journey toward adoption and were captivated by the connections between fashion and impact, style and history, profit and purpose that came together in the sale of these beautiful Ugandan objects. After an hour, Honegger had sold almost everything. That night, she realized she was on to something. Her first sale led to a second, and a third. She emailed the Matovus asking for more stock while wiring money back to them. Honegger had no experience in business, but she had a whole lot of courage - the courage to stand up and pursue what she cared about. With the help of friends and a little common sense, she turned her hustle into an international business employing and supporting, among others, thousands of women in the United States and around the world. And what started as a dream for adoption later turned into a reality, as the following year, the Honeggers welcomed Rwandan orphan Jack Honegger into their home. For those of us from privileged backgrounds, comfort is an easy option. Staying in your comfort zone is, well, comfortable. For most of us, settling in on the couch to binge-watch Netflix while sipping a warm tea or glass of wine sounds like an ideal plan. It brings a sense of safety, security, comfort and the nice feeling that things are alright – after all, not much can go wrong during a Netflix binge. Many of us go through life seeking comfort, choosing a pizza night on the couch over going out and learning something new or meeting new people. It seems we can’t get hurt by staying in and sticking with what’s familiar. But what does this comfort really offer us? A boring life, in which we have no impact and live in a spiritual void. A better approach is to choose courage, not comfort. For the author, courage had always meant complete fearlessness. Courage evokes thoughts of Martin Luther King Jr, who stood up for what he believed in, despite facing threats to his life. Or of the firefighters who ran toward danger on 9/11, while everyone around them ran away from it. But the truth is that for most of us, courage is something a little less bold. For the author, courage was pursuing her adoption process despite having a near-empty bank account; courage was opening up her home for a jewelry sale, not knowing whether any of her friends would turn up. It may have been imperfect courage, but that was the only kind she had. And making that choice, to embrace risk instead of accepting her lot in life – to run scared toward her goal – changed her life profoundly. It led to her successful adoption and also launched a business career that she, as a house flipper and educationalist with no business experience, never imagined she could lead. And, in doing so, she managed to forge connections with thousands of inspiring women, who themselves were finding their own courage daily, in the company’s US offices and abroad. Do you also have goals in life but feel unable to break through your fears? What follows is a guide to how you too can find the imperfect courage that you need to get up and chase your dreams head-on. A study by political scientists at Brigham Young University recently found that if women are the minority in a group that is trying to solve a problem they speak up to 75 percent less than the men in the group do. Girls and women are trained by society to be nice, polite and humble, and not to speak out. But if you want to achieve your full potential and follow your dreams, you have to speak up. When the Honeggers’ adoption of their child, Jack, was nearly complete, there was just one final, crucial step. They needed official permission from a local judge in Rwanda – and they needed it urgently. On very short notice, Rwanda was changing its policies on international adoption, and any delay could mean losing the opportunity to adopt Jack. Unfortunately, their attorneys told them that immediate granting of permission almost never happened. So Honegger went and waited at the judge’s office, along with her husband and other prospective adoptive parents. Facing up to the possibility of losing her new baby boy, the author decided that she couldn’t just wait for her family’s fate to be decided for them. She had no idea of acceptable etiquette in such a situation in Rwanda and was wracked with nerves. But she stood up, stepped forward and addressed the judge. She told him what an honor it was to be in his country and to meet with him. And she told him that all those present would be honored if they could be granted permission to take their children out of the orphanage that day. To the shock of the attorneys and the judges’ staff, he acquiesced. Everyone’s adoptions were approved that day. If Honegger hadn’t had the courage to stand up and speak out, the process could have dragged on and all the scheduled adoptions would have been in jeopardy. Whenever Honegger is tempted to keep quiet, she thinks back to that moment and is reminded of the power of embracing her fear, standing up and speaking out. So if you ever find in life that you have a nagging feeling in your gut and that you should stand up and say something, then listen to it. Respond to those thoughts and don’t let your fear hold you back. There is a world of opportunity out there if you’re willing to stand up, step out and reach for it. When Honegger was a schoolchild, she hated sports. In particular, she hated one exercise in gym class. A teacher would hand one end of a rope to Honegger and the other end to one of the fastest kids in school. The other kid was told to run off at her normal pace, and Honegger just had to try and keep up. Sweating and panting, she’d chase around, desperately trying to maintain the pace. It was a miserable experience, but sadly one that millions of women are replicating every day. Too many women have internalized the idea that they need to keep up with others. This is particularly true when it comes to body image. One international study showed that 98 percent of women want to change at least something about their physical appearance. So unless you are one of the incredibly lucky 2 percent, chances are that you are chasing what you believe is a better version of yourself, instead of loving who you are. So how can we get better at embracing our true worth? First, take a global perspective. In the United States, thinness is highly prized. According to the author, though, many African women regard big hips as beautiful, because they show you are living a life of plenty. And, she says, many Latin Americans value gold front teeth as both beautiful and a sign that you can afford dental treatment. So whatever your imperfections are, from frizzy hair to a little extra cushion on your bones, remember that there is a culture somewhere that values these traits as beautiful. Recognizing that standards are subjective is one thing; another challenge is to speak and think kindly to yourself. One practical way to get better at this is to reconsider the labels you attach to yourself and to others. If you call yourself “unstylish,” change that to, “I’m a person who struggles with style sometimes.” If you find yourself saying, “I’m flat-chested,” say instead that you are “a person who has smaller breasts.” Why? Well, you may struggle with style, your breast size, your weight or any number of your features of traits, but this does not define you. Put yourself, as a whole person with dignity, at the center of your own conversation. We all have parts of ourselves – particularly those parts that contain our fears and anxieties – that we prefer to keep to ourselves. The thing is, it’s only when we share those parts that we can truly connect with others, invite support, empathy and compassion, and build true and meaningful relationships. It’s not always easy to reveal our vulnerabilities, but doing so can have a powerful effect. It could even be a life-changer, as in the case of a young Ugandan girl named Hope. In Uganda, HIV carries a huge stigma and, as a result, many people hide their positive diagnoses. Hope’s mother had contracted HIV and passed it on to Hope during pregnancy. When Hope discovered her condition as a girl, she was filled with shame. She denied the reality of her condition and became iller. Hope’s mother pleaded with Jalia Matovu, Honegger’s artisan friend, to persuade Hope to take treatment. For Hope, admitting her vulnerability – in this case, her HIV diagnosis – to Matovu, was the first step in her treatment and was almost too much for her to bear. But Matovu not only heard Hope’s story, she accepted it with empathy and compassion. Hope’s sense of shame disappeared, and she learned that owning her vulnerability was the only way she could emerge from her pain. Today, Hope lives like someone with nothing to be ashamed of. In treatment, and open about her condition, she is both happy and healthy. Early on in Honegger’s journey, she also spent a lot of time hiding her vulnerability: her anxiety that when it came to business, she wasn’t the real deal. She was worried that if people knew the truth behind her business story – that it all started in a spare room in her home and that she muddled her way through – then they wouldn’t regard her as a legitimate businesswoman. Working with other women and listening to their stories, Honegger started to see the benefits of practicing vulnerability and embracing the truth of her life and business. Whenever she got invited to speak on a panel with super-successful business leaders, she’d be honest. She’d introduce herself by saying that she didn’t want to fake it anymore, and would openly admit that she had no experience leading an executive team, just a lot of experience hustling. And the more open she was about her vulnerabilities, the more she experienced true connection with other people, because she was able to show her whole, true self. Try it yourself and embrace your own vulnerabilities. After all, what is a more valuable thing to share than the reality of who you are? Have you ever encountered another woman in a store, at the beach or in a cafe and judged her? Perhaps because she looked more attractive and thinner than you, you resented her at that moment? Or maybe because her kids were misbehaving, you felt a little disdain for her parenting? Honegger once found herself in such a situation in a shoe store. Another woman was shopping while her children were causing a fuss, making noise and crashing into displays. But as Honegger found herself slipping into judgmental thoughts, she remembered that, on a different day, this could have been Honegger herself, with her own kids. So instead of judging, she started to play with one of the children. She also started talking with the mom, who said she had recently moved to Texas from Egypt. The mom, Honegger realized, was doing her best, struggling with everyday tasks while adjusting to a new life. At that moment, Honegger also realized that if you want to build a better world, women need to look at each other with compassion and understanding, not judgement. Women need a Sisterhood. And this Sisterhood, at its best, can be an unstoppable force. After Noonday took off, Honegger’s Ugandan partner, Jalia Matovu, hired new women for her workshop in Uganda. One of them, Nakato, often arrived at work with a bruised face and body. She was obviously upset, and Matovu suspected domestic violence but wasn’t sure what she could do. When Nakato arrived at work one day so badly bruised that she could barely open her eyes, Matovu decided enough was enough. She summoned up her courage, walked down to the police station and demanded an arrest shouting, “you will support this woman!” Matovu couldn’t afford to bribe the police to convince them to take action. But what she lacked in money, she made up in sisterly tenacity. So she resolved to go to the police every day until they did something. Day after day, she arrived, until eventually, the police could no longer ignore her. Thanks to Matovu’s efforts, Nakato’s husband was arrested and sent to jail. This just goes to show that when sisters decide not to stand back, but to stand up for one another, they can achieve great things. We all know that there are many problems in the world, from girls’ education in rural Africa to urban poverty in the United States. But sometimes, the scale of the challenge can be intimidating. It can seem impossible to solve the world’s problems, so we stay focused on our immediate surroundings – our work, our friends and our family. But the truth is, just because you can’t make a big contribution doesn’t mean you can’t do anything at all. A few years ago, a friend of Honegger’s, Dee, welcomed Ugandan teenager Rachel to her home. Rachel required major brain surgery, and while a charity had organized a medical evacuation from Rwanda to a hospital in Texas, she would need a local foster family to take her in and look after her following the surgery. As a busy mom, Dee didn’t have much time or money, but she had a big heart and volunteered to help. Dee had never met Rachel before, but she spent nights by her side in the hospital. She took her home, bathed her, nursed her and was her friend and foster mother for 18 months. During this time, Honegger herself was particularly busy with work commitments, and she felt a little guilty that she couldn’t do much to help Dee. One day, while grocery shopping, Honegger realized that just because she felt unable to make a large contribution, she could still help. She loaded up her cart with groceries and goodies and dropped them off at Dee’s house. From then on, she just kept doing the same, week in, week out. This story reminds us that even if we can’t all do big, incredible deeds, such as what Dee did, there is always something we can do to help make the world a better place. So what can you do? You don’t have to turn your world upside down. Think about how you could make a small adjustment to your current life that would have an impact in the world. For example, if you are a photographer, why not help out Heart Gallery, an organization that takes and showcases compelling photo-portraits of adoptable children to help them find parents. If you are an accountant, you could choose a local charity and help it get its accounts in order. Whoever you are, whatever you do, you have the power to make a difference in our world. Use it. When Honegger’s daughter was days old, Honegger admitted that, amidst the exhausting chaos of having a newborn, she wished she could put the baby back inside her. Her doctor told Honegger to give the baby to her own mother and get some sleep. Five hours later, Honegger felt better. The challenge of motherhood was still a large one, but it felt more manageable. You can't always be available for others; eventually, you will simply burn out. It’s essential to dedicate some time to taking care of yourself, so here are some practical tips for avoiding burnout to make sure you pace yourself and take the occasional break. First up is meditation. For Honegger, meditation is simply about spending ten minutes affirming her value in front of God. She has found a mantra that she repeats to herself until she believes it saying, “In your presence, I have nothing to change, fix or prove.” So take ten minutes out of your day to affirm to yourself that you don’t need to be thinner, harder working, a better mom or anything else except what you are, right there and right then. It will help remind you of your own value. The next tip is to be present. If you, like many people, struggle to put down your phones and really connect with people around you, give your children, husband or friends permission to unplug you. When Honegger gets home, she operates phone-free until the next morning. And if she gets caught breaking the rule, her children have permission to hide her phone. To date, they’ve only forgotten where they hid it once. Finally, celebrate effort. When Honegger talks to her Noonday ambassadors on Facebook Live and asks what there is to celebrate, she’s not looking for results; she wants to hear about the new girl who pushed through her fear to lead her first sale or the teammate who made the bold decision to miss out on short-term sales in order to properly recover from an illness. Effort is worth celebrating because it’s effort that, in the long run, brings results. There’s no point in getting to where you want to go in life if, when you arrive, you aren’t in one piece. So take care of yourself. You will flourish, and you will be able to make your best possible contribution toward a continually evolving world. The key message in these blinks: Many women know, deep down, that something more fulfilling is out there. But instead of pursuing their deepest desires for a meaningful, impactful life, they stay in their places of safety and comfort. If we do find our courage and step scared but hopeful out into the world, huge opportunities await. Stop letting fear keep you on the sidelines, and embrace your courage today.  Actionable advice: Unwrap some of the bubble wrap surrounding your life.  Consider enrolling your children in a public charter school. Shop at a grocery store where you rub shoulders with people different to you. Make friends with foster families and diverse members of your community. Try to take off a little of the bubble wrap surrounding your life, and you’ll find you’ll not only learn more about the world, but you’ll also be better positioned to help make it a better place.

These blinks shine a light on the breakthroughs being made by female innovators today, from their academic success to their innate knack for business, and instigation of vital social change. It also reveals the incredible challenges that women face, due to gender discrimination that is deeply – but not irredeemably – rooted in the industry. Astonishing statistics and inspiring personal tales make these blinks a fascinating read and a reality check. In the following blinks, you’ll also learn how 2001: A Space Odyssey and a brilliant female innovator brought live sports to your living room; the euphemistic technical term for only hiring white male nerds; and how sexual harassment killed a multi-million-dollar deal. Think about some of the great innovators in the technology industry. Who comes to mind first? Founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, or Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame? Or perhaps, Kay Koplovitz? If you haven’t heard of Koplovitz’s groundbreaking work, here’s the reason why: She’s a woman. Why is it that we usually associate the technological advances of recent decades with only the men behind them? It’s not the case that women don’t have what it takes to innovate, in fact, quite the opposite. A study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that females matched males in mathematical achievement. Moreover, for every 100 men that enrol in higher education, there are 140 women. Not only do women excel academically, they are also no less business-savvy than men, if not more so. Another study completed by Babson’s Global Entrepreneurship revealed that female-led high-tech start-ups have noticeably lower failure rates than those that are male leaders. Despite this, the technology industry itself often praises the achievements of men only. In fact, even over the past few years, the TechCrunch Crunchies Awards (the Oscars of the tech industry), have often been exclusively awarded to men. As a result, we’re often left unaware of the achievements of female innovators like Kay Klopovitz, who you should thank if you’ve ever watched a live sports game on TV. In 1977, Klopovitz singlehandedly brought professional sport to cable television in the United States. Inspired by a talk given by the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke, she brought the future to life by developing the novel idea of using satellites for commercial rather than military purposes. If only we heard more about success stories like Klopovitz, we’d see that women might even have an edge over men in their abilities to innovate. This is exactly what we’ll be exploring in the next blink, as we take a closer look at the tech businesswomen we rarely hear about. Did you know that women actually have a knack for success in entrepreneurial ventures?  In 2009, a Kauffman Foundation study showed that women were more capital-efficient than men. Or, in plain English, women in business spend the money they start off with more wisely. They also see more stable or greater returns on this money. Not only do women in business have a knack for managing money, they also demonstrate sophisticated people skills. Women generally place a higher value on personal and professional networks than men, and spend more time cultivating good business partnerships. Another distinctive way in which women make great business leaders is what Whitney Johnson, cofounder of Rose Park Advisors, calls disruptive innovation. How exactly can something be disruptive and innovative at the same time? Disruptive innovations outperform existing and outdated ideas or businesses. For example, email is a disruptive innovation, when we consider how it blew the almost-obsolete snail mail out of the water. Women are disruptive innovators in the way that they build and maintain networks outside of their organizations. A professor of the Harvard Business School has demonstrated this in his research, showing the way women work “outside the box” to bring new ideas and people together in a novel way. Of course, anyone can dream up novel ideas, but it seems women in particular are also highly successful at turning these ideas into profitable companies. This can be seen when we look at companies backed by venture capitalists: highly selective and demanding investors who invest in small businesses so they can grow. One study showed that on average, the successful venture capital-backed companies have double the amount of women in their highest ranks, indicating the value of their contribution. The CEO characters that you see in TV shows and movies all tend to look the same – middle-aged, suited-up and male. But this pop culture stereotype is far from reality – while we don’t often see powerful female CEOs depicted in the media, female-led and -owned businesses shouldn’t be overlooked. Not only are women beginning to lead their own companies, they’re also enjoying large amounts of success. And they’re no minority either – the Center for Women’s Business Research says that as many as 41 percent of private businesses in the United States are owned by women. These businesses also tend to be highly successful and consistently outperform their male-owned counterparts. After surveying highly profitable firms in 2013, American Express found that among businesses with revenue greater than $10 million, those owned by women enjoyed a 47 percent higher rate of growth. Moreover, from 2002 to 2012, female-owned businesses grew 28.6 percent, while other businesses only grew 24.4 percent. Once again, women-owned companies came out on top! Despite their success, businesses led by women often struggle to acquire funding. Another study, also by the Center for Women’s Business Research, discovered that in spite of the large portion of private businesses owned by women, as little as three to five percent of these actually receive venture capital-based funding and support. A significant reason for this can be directly tied to gender bias. Venture capitalists often talk about their skill in pattern recognition, or their aptitude for spotting bright entrepreneurs with profitable ideas. What this often means, however, is that these venture capitalists look for people that remind them of themselves. Of 89 venture capitalists on TheFunded.com’s top 100 list, only one is a woman. So “pattern recognition” is really just a euphemism for investing in white, male nerds. Not only are women making waves in technology, they’re also making a difference in the world. Many female innovators have utilized technology to address worldwide poverty and inequality. As entrepreneurs, women have a vested interest in overcoming an oppressive status quo. Women all over the world are socially and economically marginalized, and this is particularly clear in developing countries. For example, in Mexico, the prevailing macho culture forces women into traditional gender roles and often prevents girls, particularly in rural towns, from completing their education. However, there is now a growing current of social change in Mexico, as women begin to set up microenterprises – very small businesses, usually started from a low- or no-interest loan. 36 percent of microenterprises are run by women, which amounts to around two million small companies. These new developments are highly promising, but unfortunately up to 90 percent of microenterprises fail in their first year. This is something that female entrepreneurs like Leticia Casanueva are working to change. Her company provides training and tools like simple inventory tracking software to help rural women start and run financially stable businesses. Not only do entrepreneurial women help to boost the rural economy, they also work hard to provide a much-needed source of female employment in these areas. A leading example is the work of Resha Jazrawi as the co-founder of Acumen – a firm that makes investments specifically aimed at creating jobs for those who need them most, i.e., women. Acumen’s investments are called patient investments, as they allow a business to develop slowly without the expectation of fast returns. One example of Acumen’s impact can be seen in the A to Z textile mills in Tanzania, which manufacture anti-malaria mosquito nets. Aside from providing a helpful product, this investment has created as many as 80,000 jobs, 90 percent of which are designed for women. Right from the outset, women in technology struggle against the industry’s gender bias. In fact, this sort of discrimination begins before they can even launch their careers. Many women and minorities are actively discouraged from pursuing a career in science, technology, engineering or mathematics. These disciplines, known as the STEM fields, are rife with gender stereotypes – countless women talk even of high school teachers who deemed them not good enough to make a career in STEM, despite their exceptional grades. Female students are often judged using unfounded assumptions, such as that women are “too sociable” to work in science. A 2010 Beyer Corporation survey found that as many as 40 percent of female and/or minority chemists and chemical engineers had been discouraged from pursuing their careers. If, despite this discouragement, a young female student makes her way through her studies with excellent marks and begins to search for a job, she will yet again be met with discrimination. In tech, hiring policies are so skewed that certain jobs are effectively “men only.” Bright Labs found these gender discrepancies were overwhelming in the United States: 92.7 percent of network engineers, 91.5 percent of PC technicians, 90.4 percent of IT support workers and 90 percent of software engineers were men. Despite this obvious imbalance, high-earning companies have yet to show any initiative to rectify things. A 2012 survey by McKinsey & Company found that only eight percent of larger companies had women in more than 25 percent of the top jobs. This is a reality we can see statistically and socially. For example, when attending a tech conference in Uruguay, female telematics engineer Agustina was briskly told by a key investor: “I don’t have much to say to you because I’m a techie nerd.” The investor assumed that women weren’t interested or knowledgeable, nor had anything to say about technology. It’s easy to admire the success of a high-powered male professional. But you should remember that these men enjoy an advantage: they have been free to pursue their career, unlike women, who are forced to decide between career and family in order to achieve their goals. This is a great challenge for female professionals, especially as workplace culture makes technology industries notoriously unfriendly places for single mothers. The collective mind-sets of many start-ups are geared toward the single male rather than a woman with family responsibilities. For example, the simple act of leaving work at 5 p.m. is considered a faux pas in the industry. Female employees frequently report being stigmatized by their male colleagues for working “mommy hours” to accommodate school and child care, even if these women come to work as early as 5 a.m. and work just as many hours! The entrepreneurial environment also involves networking during “happy hours” – late nights and weekends. As a result, many women are forced to pay a “female tax” by not participating in these extracurricular activities, because they look after their children instead. Thankfully, formal support systems are starting to assist career-oriented women with families. Some progressive countries have legislation to support women during maternity leave and ensure companies don’t discriminate against them when hiring. Germany, for example, has developed the Elterngeld system, which pays either parent 67 percent of their earnings during leave. In many cases, however, men do not take up their parental leave. So mothers are frequently called upon to be the primary caregiver. This was highlighted by a study conducted by Stanford University, which found that mid-career men were four times as likely as their female counterparts to have a partner who took responsibility for household and children. And yet our cultural norms still dictate that only “bad mothers” would place the same importance on their career as their family. Although we wish it were a thing of the past, sexual discrimination is still alive and well. In fact, it’s something women have to deal with on a daily basis to varying degrees. Remember the “female tax” we learned about earlier? Well, it also extends to what female professionals wear – make-up, style and sex appeal are all things women have to worry about before they even start the day. Some businesswomen have even internalized this, instructing younger employees to pay attention to how they dress as a critical factor in their career success. Unsurprisingly, many women, such as Catherine Rose, project manager for interactive teaching tool LightAide, are dismayed that they are not valued by their PhD or MBA, but for their outward appearance. This trend is also seen in the mainstream press. For example, when interviewing entrepreneur and technology executive Kim Polese, Fortune magazine chose to run the story with a close-up of her face, and used the angle that Polese was a tech industry “femme fatale.” Polese had explicitly asked beforehand that the story focus on her software management company Marimba. Worse still, women in technology also unfortunately suffer outright sexual harassment. Heidi Roizen, the former worldwide developer for Apple relations, experienced this first hand. While working for a multi-million-dollar software company, Roizen was on the verge of signing a company-defining deal with large computer manufacturer. She was invited to sign the deal over supper in a luxurious restaurant and during the meal, the vice president of the manufacturer lewdly tried to coax her hand onto his crotch. Naturally, she stormed out of the building, and the deal fell through. Millions in revenue were lost. These are just some of the manifestations of the sexism still sadly prevalent in the high tech industry. From what we’ve seen of the workplace culture in the technology industry, the challenges for women are deeply entrenched. Which makes one wonder – is change even possible?  Not if we deny the problem, which only reduces accountability and maintains the harmful status quo. Instead, gender imbalances need to be discussed in a public forum, though such dialogue may not be received warmly. For instance, in 2010, co-author Vivek Wadwha published a widely read piece called Silicon Valley: You and Some of Your VCs have a Gender Problem that exposed the shocking gender imbalances in high tech companies. It was met with a huge uproar, and many senior figures publicly attacked the author on social media. Some colleagues even emailed him, saying “there are easier ways to get laid.”The article also brought Twitter under fire, by exposing the imbalanced demographics in the company: all of Twitter’s board members and executives were male. Its leaders vociferously attacked those that attempted to bring the gender issue to light. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo actively denied the existence of the issue. However, in 2014, Twitter added an additional female board member, and a flurry of other tech companies followed suit. Clearly, it took a large-scale public relations embarrassment for Twitter to bring positive change to their company and others. Positive change in the technology industry should begin with reform in a crucial area: hiring policies. If recruitment pools are broadened, there is a chance to bring about gender equality. Universities have equal numbers, if not greater numbers, of female STEM graduates than male. If firms recruit directly from graduate programs, a higher percentage of female applicants are instantly available. Another way to increase diversity is through a quota system. This has been successful in other fields such as sports management. For example, the “Rooney rule” employed in National Football League ensures that minorities are interviewed for management positions. This could be an effective approach in the technology industry, ensuring that a certain percentage of positions are filled by women.  The key message in this book: The technology industry is a boys club that needs to be exposed. Firstly, for the sake of the talented women, who are challenged daily despite being instinctively business-savvy high academic performers, and arbiters of social change, not to mention mothers. And secondly, for the progression of the technology industry today and in the future.  Actionable advice: Girls make great geeks!  If you are turning away from a career in technology, perhaps because you feel it’s only for geeky guys, then you’d better think again! There are many innovative, powerful and inspirational women in the technology industry today, all proving that it’s not only possible for women to be tech leaders, but vital.

All it takes is knowing how to employ the right strategies and understanding the key to being a successful entrepreneur – innovation. This doesn’t have to mean inventing something – you can also be innovative in the way you do things. In this book, you will find out: How and where to look for innovative strategies; How IBM profited from their rival’s idea; Why business strategies are like launching a rocket to the moon. How do entrepreneurs become successful? Some say luck, others say hard work. But the truth is – to be a successful entrepreneur you must always be on the look-out for sources of innovation. That is, events that offer the impetus for innovation. These sources can be internal – occurring within a business, market or industry – or they can be external, from a field such as politics, academia or science. Let’s take a look at the internal sources of innovation. The first internal source is the unexpected. This happened to Macy’s, New York’s largest department store, when customers started buying more and more appliances. Macy’s hadn’t planned this – the trend just happened. When the unexpected happens, a clever company or entrepreneur will exploit it. Macy’s wasn’t so slick, however. When confronted by this unexpected success, they actually tried to curb the sales of appliances, as it wasn’t normal. As a result, they lost a lot of their market share. Other department stores such as Bloomingdale’s also experienced the same phenomenon. In contrast to Macy’s, though, they took advantage of the trend and invested money in marketing their appliance departments, which led to increased profits. Another internal source of innovation comes from changes or development in an industry or market. For instance, in the 1960s the automobile industry suddenly changed from a market where each country was led by local companies to an international market dominated by multinationals. Companies like Volvo took advantage of this change and aggressively marketed themselves globally. Consequently, Volvo went from a small manufacturer that was barely able to break even to a worldwide success. Other companies like Citroen, however, didn’t adapt to the changes and lost out as a result. So the more you can utilize the unexpected and know how to leverage a changing market, the more you will benefit. So far we have talked about two internal sources of innovation. But there are two more – process need and incongruities – which we will explore in this blink. Process need focuses on finding a weak link in a process, because a weak link is a perfect opportunity for an entrepreneur to innovate. To illustrate this, let’s take a look at the process of eye operations. In the 1950s, one of the most common eye operations was cataract removal. Although the process was nearly perfect, there was one problematic step where a ligament had to be severed. This sometimes led to bleeding, which could damage the eye. Pharmaceutical salesman William Connor spotted this weak link and found a solution. He discovered a way to use an enzyme that could dissolve the ligament without cutting it, and a way to store this enzyme for long periods of time. Connor's innovation became an accepted stage in the cataract-removal process and allowed him to sell his company for a handsome profit. The second internal source of innovation is incongruities, or gaps between the reality of the situation and people’s perception of it. Where there's a gap, there's an opportunity to innovate. For example, before the 1950s, shipping companies tried to make their ships faster in order to move from port to port more quickly. But at the same time, shipping costs rose dramatically. The problem was actually the shipping companies’ misdiagnosis: it wasn’t the speed between ports that was important, but the time that ships spent lying idle in ports. Thus, there was an “incongruity” between what the companies thought the issue was and the reality of the situation. This gap was closed through the innovation of the container ship, which could be loaded and unloaded much more quickly. As a result, shipping costs fell by 60 percent. Not all the opportunities for innovation come from within an industry, market or business. Some come from the outside world, like social, political and academic fields. These are known as external sources of innovation. Let’s take a look at them. One external source of innovation comes from understanding demographics, because when the population changes, so does the market. Demographic changes can refer to changes in the make-up of a population, such as its size and age. This alters market demands as different people desire different products and services. Those who can foresee these changes and prepare for them stand the best chance of success. For example, after the Second World War there was a sharp rise in the birth rate, which led to the “baby boom” in America. Melville, a shoe retailer, took advantage of this. In the early 1960s, Melville began targeting the teenage shoe and also clothes market, just as many of these “boomers” were reaching adolescence. This strategy proved highly successful. Another external source of innovation is knowledge-based innovation. This source, which involves the development of a new idea or invention, is what people often picture when they think of innovation. But the use of knowledge to create a successful innovation is usually an extensive process and requires many different types of know-how. Take the computer, for instance. This was the result of centuries of work in mathematics, electronics and programming. Development for the computer really began in the seventeenth century with the invention of a binary number system. In the early nineteenth century came a system used to create a simple calculating machine. Then, in 1880, a way of programming instructions into a machine was invented. However, it wasn’t until 1946 that the first computer became operational. Obviously, not all inventions take centuries, but we can see that knowledge-based innovation can be a very drawn-out process. It is often thought that innovation is a phenomenon limited to small, hungry entrepreneurs, but this isn’t true. Businesses can also be innovative. However, in order to do so they must follow certain steps. The first is to have standardized policies that create an environment where innovation can flourish. To get the right policy, businesses should ask themselves, “How can we become a company which welcomes and desires innovation?” To answer this question, a business needs to adopt a policy where they can be ready to abandon outdated practices as necessary and look for innovative changes. It is important to realize that every product, service and technology has a limited lifespan, which means that alternatives need to be found. Finally, the business needs to make a plan of when innovations are likely to be needed in order to be ready to take advantage of them. The second step a business needs to take is to create an organizational structure that rewards entrepreneurship. New innovative projects should be structured separately from old ones, given their own space and have their own high-level manager in charge. Lastly, there should be an appraisal system within the company to improve its entrepreneurial performance, as it is essential to know if the results of its efforts meet its expectations. For example, one major bank built a feedback system that allowed them to know what they could expect from new ventures. By building up this feedback they could estimate when new ventures should start producing results. A company should review all of its innovative efforts. One of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies does this by reviewing new drug developments annually to check whether they should proceed with them or abandon them. By following these steps, businesses can also be entrepreneurial organizations. All new enterprises need to have a plan. Specifically, they need to plan what they are doing now so they can continue in the right direction. To build an effective business you need to follow four steps. The first step is to focus on finding a market. Most entrepreneurs actually end up succeeding in a completely different market than that in which they expected to, so it is important for a new venture to keep an eye on a variety of markets. For example, one small Indian company bought a license for a European-designed bicycle with a small engine which they thought would be ideal for India. Surprisingly, no one wanted the bicycle, yet the engine was in high demand. As it turned out, it was perfect for irrigation pumps. Because of this finding, the company owner was able exploit the unexpected market and profit from it. The second step in building a new business is to have the right financial focus. It’s not only about trying to maximize profits, but making sure that money is available for investments, expansion and survival if the company hits problems. One good guide is to have a clear view of how much cash is needed 12 months in advance, and for what purposes. The final two steps are: build the best management team as soon as possible, and decide on the role of the founding entrepreneur. The founder should start building a management team before the business becomes too big for one person to control. With the team in place, the founders should ask themselves how they can best serve the company. Specifically: “What am I good at?” and “What could I do best to further the company?” It is important to realize that in some cases it may be better for the founder to leave the company if they can no longer add value to it. When you enter a market as an entrepreneur, you need to find a way of securing yourself a market share. In order to stand the best chance of doing this, you should adopt an entrepreneurial strategy. One such strategy is to be the “Fustest with the Mostest,” meaning the aim to be the first in your field and then exploit that advantage. To get there first you need to go all-out. You only get one chance to be the first entrepreneur in your field, so you have to push hard to get there. For example, in the 1920s, Hoffmann-La Roche was a small chemicals company manufacturing dyes in a competitive market. Then it look a gamble in a new field. This field was vitamins, which were newly discovered but had attracted little interest elsewhere. After acquiring their patents, Hoffmann-La Roche hired discoverers with huge salaries and invested all the money it could come up with, including large borrowed sums, to manufacture and market the vitamins. Their gamble paid off. The company got to the vitamin market first and remained the world leader 60 years later. This strategy is very risky, however, because if you miss your target, you can’t start over. In addition, if you don’t get there first, you lose the dominant market position. To hit the top spot you need to ensure that you know the market inside out, that the opportunities you are aiming for are viable. If you make the wrong choice, you will fail. This is much like aiming a rocket at the moon: you need to get the calculations and measurements right at the beginning, before you launch. If your aim is even slightly off, you’ll miss the moon altogether.  The next entrepreneurial strategy involves finding the gaps that your rivals ignore. The author defines this as a “Hit Them Where They Ain’t” strategy. There are two ways to do this: creative imitation and entrepreneurial judo. Creative imitation is where an entrepreneur imitates a pre-existing idea but applies it in a way that is more appealing to customers. For example, in the 1940s IBM built the world’s first computer. But very soon after, they abandoned their work on it. Why? Well, a rival’s version of the computer caught their eye and they immediately recognized its potential. The rivals was called ENIAC, a company whose computer IBM thought was perfectly suited to business tasks such as completing payrolls – something that ENIAC hadn’t thought of. So IBM decided to imitate the ENIAC computer and adapted it with more features that would appeal to businesses. Consequently, IBM’s version became a huge success and the standard computer model. Another entrepreneurial strategy is entrepreneurial judo, which involves hitting your rival’s weak spots. A great example of a weak spot in many established companies is arrogance. Often, companies think that their way of doing something is the best, which causes them to dismiss new ideas. Fortunately for other companies, this can be exploited. For example, in the 1970s, the transistor was invented by a small company in the United States. The big American firms rejected it because it wasn’t invented by one of them and it therefore wasn’t considered important enough. But one little-known company at the time did recognize the potential of the transistor. The company was Sony and they exploited the arrogance of their larger rivals by buying the transistor for $25,000. Sony used it to design the world’s first portable transistor radio and within a few years had captured the market in the USA.  Quite often, an entrepreneur can be successful if they specialize in one particular area. The author defines this strategy as ecological niches, and there are various ways to discover them. The first is that you can follow a toll-gate strategy, where you gain market control through a product or service which is a vital aspect of another product or service. A perfect example of this is the enzyme developed by William Connors, which became a crucial stage in the removal of cataracts. The advantage of this strategy is that your product will remain the leader, because it’s not worth your competitors’ while to try to beat it. In Connors’s case, surgeons cannot complete the cataract removal process without the enzyme. However, its cost is negligible compared to the cost for the whole operation, therefore there isn’t a high demand for a cheaper product. The market for the enzyme is also relatively small, so a cheaper version wouldn’t be very profitable. Therefore, Connors’s company is in a very solid position. It is important to note the danger of this strategy, though, as it is dependent on the other product. If someone discovered a medicine that replaced the eye operation, for example, Connors’s business would go bankrupt. Another strategy is to follow the specialty skill and specialty market niches. These two are very similar. They involve building up a knowledge of something that others don’t have, be it skills to do something or a unique knowledge of a market. For example, in the early years of the automobile industry, manufacturing companies were expert mechanics, but they knew very little about the electronics needed in each car. So many electronics firms who had those missing skills profited from this. Bear in mind, however, that there is a risk that your specialty skill could eventually become universal, meaning that you lose your niche. In this final strategy, the innovation isn’t a product or a service, but the strategy itself. It centers on taking an established product and creating a new customer demand for it. Let’s look at two ways of doing this. One way to innovate is by creating customer utility, whereby you take an established product and improve it to further satisfy a customer’s needs. With this strategy you don’t change the product itself; instead, you find a way of bringing it closer to what the customer wants. For example, a set of “good china” was what many American brides wanted on their special day. But a full set was too expensive as a present and it was hard for guests to buy individual pieces, as they didn’t know which ones to get. So The Lenox China Company had an idea. They responded by adapting the bridal register system: the bride would identify which pattern she wanted from the company’s range beforehand and the guests could then choose what to get from those pieces. The Lenox China Company cunningly found a way of satisfying the customer demand without changing the product. Another way to bring something new to an old product is by following a pricing strategy. This strategy ensures you focus not on the cost of your product but on what people are willing to pay. For example, when Gillette safety razors were released, they cost more than going to the barbers. Gillette realized that people weren’t willing to buy a razor that cost more than a shave and so decided to sell their razors at a loss. But by ensuring that Gillette razors could only use Gillette blades – which were sold at profit – they made their money back. In the long term, Gillette profited from their pricing strategy. The key message in this book: There are sources of innovation that you must keep an eye on in order to become a successful entrepreneur. The ability to identify these sources will provide you with the perfect opportunity to overtake your competitors. Most importantly, to be a successful entrepreneur you must be customer focused, not product focused. This means identifying a market and ensuring that your products or services match its demands.  ","headers":["What’s in it for me?

This rings especially true in the workplace, where we often have to deal with conflicting ideas and drawn-out meetings. Simplicity, the author argues, can help solve these problems. In these blinks, you’ll discover how Steve Jobs turned Apple into the most successful computer company in the world, why iPads and iPhones only have one button and how to make your projects and teams effective, streamlined and focused on designing beautiful products. Have you ever bought a new computer with such complicated new features that you couldn’t get it to work? This type of complexity is a problem in our modern world because humans, just like all other life on the planet, prefer simplicity. We know that nature doesn’t choose the most complicated way to solve a problem. Rather, it finds the simplest way. In fact, it’s often the simplest species that are the most successful. Take earthworms for example: they’re incredibly simple organisms, yet they’ve outlived thousands of more complex species. Simplicity seems to be natural, and as humans, we prefer it when our lives are made as simple as possible. This can be seen in the way we choose the products we use in our everyday lives: we tend to prefer simple ones over complex. Product complexity became an issue for Microsoft when they created the Zune Store. Instead of allowing customers to simply pay for a song with their credit cards (as Apple does), customers first had to convert their money into Microsoft Points. Microsoft’s designers didn’t think about simplicity and, consequently, the Zune Store never caught on. This shows that, given a choice between a complex or simple way to reach a goal, people will most likely choose the simplest option. Companies that understand this know to make their products as simple as possible. Apple’s stores are a great example. As soon as you step inside, you’re greeted by a minimalist decor and your options (to buy or repair something) are clearly demarcated. That’s why the stores are so popular, especially in comparison to Microsoft’s stores, which are over-packed with products and offer too many choices. By understanding the human need for simplicity, you can build enduring business-customer relationships. A lot of us believe the best way to come up with a solution is having many minds working on it together. Yet this isn’t always the best approach. Sometimes a small team is better. Often, the larger and more complex a company’s hierarchy, the longer it takes to make progress. Some companies have giant, complex structures, with staff working together across many departments. However, this can seriously complicate the decision-making process. Take Dell: it has many different departments, such as customer support and sales, and each has a different CEO. Due to this set-up, it takes a long time for anything to be accomplished. This problem was made concrete when Dell attempted to create a new branding strategy. The project ran for several months across different departments, but didn’t make any progress. Eventually, because the different teams couldn’t find a satisfying approach, the project was discarded. Apple, however, has enjoyed success by doing the opposite as Dell. At Apple, teams working on projects are kept as small as possible. Steve Jobs was even known to kick people out of meetings if he thought their skills weren’t vital to its success! Aside from small teams, another way to run an efficient company is to ensure that everybody receives direct and honest feedback straight from their project managers. Unfortunately, in many companies, feedback isn’t given directly, but passed down from manager to supervisor to employee. This drawn-out process not only eats up precious time but can result in inaccurate feedback. At Apple, employees usually receive their feedback personally after presenting their work to their boss. This streamlined process prevents misunderstandings and misconstrued information. Have you ever sat at an insufferable meeting full of people talking for hours with absolutely no progress being made? Many of us have experienced this scenario and are desperate to avoid it. In order to prevent such inefficiency, you need to streamline your work. One way you can do this is by creating small groups of smart people to keep projects running smoothly. Instead of having large teams made up of good people, build small teams of excellent, highly-skilled people. That way everyone in the team will contribute and no one will hold the rest back. This proved effective at Apple, where the core design and marketing teams never had more than a hundred people. Steve Jobs came up with this number, as this was the maximum number of names he could remember! This rule was so strict that if somebody new wanted to join the team, another person would have to leave it. This meant the new person had to be better suited for the role than the person they replaced and, consequently, teams grew increasingly efficient and their skill levels rose. Once you’ve developed a highly-skilled team, have them work as efficiently as possible by giving them tight deadlines. People actually tend to work better and more efficiently if they’re given a limited amount of time to come up with a high-quality result. Apple, for example, allows a total of three months for marketing projects, from the brainstorming process to the launch of the ad. This is enough time to choose and develop the best ideas, and to prepare a launch strategy without it becoming overly complicated or allowing too many conflicting ideas to arise. It is sometimes thought that the best way to get ahead in business is to emulate successful companies. However, in truth, business success relies on innovation and creativity. If you’re the first to come out with a new product, you’ll most likely be the market leader. Being the first to introduce a product to a market gives you an edge over your rivals. While they struggle to innovate a product that competes with yours, you’ll already be working on better, next-generation models. For example, Apple was the first company to successfully come out with an MP3 player – the iPod. The company went on to dominate over 70 percent of the market, constantly introducing newer and even more profitable generations of iPods, leaving other companies to play catch up. Aside from being innovative in product creation, you also need to be innovative in your marketing if you want to stand out from the competition. For example, Apple has launched some of the most successful marketing strategies in history by exploring new ways to create ads. This is evident in Apple’s “Think Different” campaign, which didn’t even advertise a specific product. Instead, it highlighted the values that were most important to the company. The campaign was successful because it made people associate the company with innovation and creativity. The way Apple markets its products is also unique. Whereas many companies will list all of a product’s different features, Apple only uses one picture of the product and lets the design speak for itself. This innovative marketing approach sets Apple apart from its competitors. Apple is renowned for its simple approach to everything. As we’ve seen, simplicity influences the company’s marketing and product design, and even the size of its meetings. But when was this approach adopted? It started when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 and made simplicity his main goal. One of the first things he did was introduce a chart made of four quadrants to illustrate the new and simple direction Apple would take. Instead of producing many different models, he wanted to have only four computer models: laptops for professionals and consumers, and desktops for professionals and consumers. Ever since, nearly every Apple product has been the result of a simplification process. In fact, all Apple products undergo a process where unnecessary features that complicate the design are removed. Just take a look at an iPhone or iPad. You’ll notice they only have one button. Why? Because, apart from zero, one is the simplest number imaginable. The idea behind this is that even if the product has a vast array of features, we feel secure that with one single click, we can return to the familiar home screen. In addition to simplifying products, Apple also simplifies its customer experience. It understands that it creates a sense of insecurity if it gives customers too wide a range of choices, which can make them question whether they made the right choice in the first place. Therefore, in Apple stores, customers have limited choices and a simple way to recognize which product is best for them. This leaves them satisfied with their choice, instead of regretting not purchasing a slightly different model. This simplicity is the trademark of Apple and one of the main reasons why it has become so immensely successful. Life is too short to do something that makes you miserable. Let’s be honest; if you aren’t passionate about something, you won’t pour all your energy into it. Passion is vital, and Apple’s success can be largely attributed to its passionate team. After all, Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built the first Apple computer out of sheer passion to produce simple, user-friendly computers. This devotion led to Apple becoming the most successful technological company of all time. Even after Jobs left in 1985, he still regarded the company as a beloved child and, when it ran into difficulties in 1997, he decided to return. Although he sacrificed his own personal life to turn the company around, Jobs made it his policy to hire people who shared his vision to make Apple one of the world’s greatest companies. Soon after, he had assembled a passionate team. At Apple, staff members have to be passionate about creating change in the world and technology. The company also knows when to wield its famous “simple stick” to ensure they’re creating the best products. When a project becomes too complex, it must be simplified (i.e., hit with the simple stick!). If a product was overly complicated, it was not sold until it satisfied everyone, including Jobs, who was known for his incredibly high standards. For instance, in 1997, the marketing department spent weeks on designing a new iMac ad. But Jobs hated it because he thought that it didn’t fit with Apple’s simple image. As a result, the department worked long nights to satisfy Jobs. This eventually led to the creation of one of the most iconic advertisements ever made: the award winning campaign \"Think Different\". This never would’ve been possible if the team hadn’t been passionate about its work. One of the most iconic public figures of the twenty-first century, Steve Jobs is celebrated for having revolutionized the entire computer industry. But how did he get to where he did? His popularity started gaining momentum when he directed Apple to focus on simplicity after its near-collapse in the 1990s. In 1997, Apple was only a few months away from going bankrupt, the company having lost its former image of producing simple, high-quality products. When Jobs returned, he took it upon himself to restore the company’s reputation, reminding both employees and customers of the core values of simplicity and innovation that Apple was founded upon. He also abolished the different departments that produced their own Mac models and software products, and refocused Apple on producing only a select few products. This approach quickly took effect with the success of the first iMac in 1998: Apple’s former glory had been reinstated. Jobs created an image of Apple that would shape the company’s success for decades to come. This came in the form of his vastly successful “Think Different” campaign, which was launched even before there was an actual product to sell. Instead, it sold the values of creativity and innovation, which increased Apple’s sales even before the introduction of the new iMac. In fact, it was the first campaign in the history of selling computers that profited before there was a new product to sell. The campaign worked because it focused on how Apple should be perceived and what its customers should value. Furthermore, it restored the image of Apple as a cutting-edge, innovative brand. Jobs made people feel that if they invested in Apple, they could help keep innovation and creativity alive in an environment that had a very traditional approach to marketing and product development. The key message in this book: Apple is so successful because, thanks to Steve Jobs, it adheres to the concept of simplicity. Streamlining and simplifying processes, such as keeping teams small and having team leaders directly interact with projects in progress, enables the company to reap the benefits of keeping ahead of its competitors. Actionable advice: Stop inviting everyone to meetings. The next time you plan a meeting, don’t invite everyone just to be polite. Instead, make sure only the people who are essential to the meeting are present. This will keep it running smoothly and effectively without it being weighed down by those who don’t have the relevant skills or input for the project or problem at hand. Make shorter deadlines. Allowing a long stretch of time to complete a project can be a breeding ground for conflicting and unresolved ideas. By keeping to a shorter (yet still reasonable) deadline, you will increase the chances of more streamlined and effective projects and problem-solving.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Mostly this is because the product manager’s role has been poorly defined or the person is incapable of filling that role. Hence, many CEOs wonder what characteristics to look for when hiring product managers. In fact, a wide array of attributes and skills is needed. Essentially, product managers solve customers’ problems, and this requires them to understand their customers and empathize with their problems as well as be intelligent and insightful enough to come up with solutions. Product managers must also be engaging and versatile communicators. They must interact with lots of different stakeholder groups from engineers to executives, and hence need to be “bilingual” in the sense that they understand both the technology and business sides of the product. Finally, product managers bear full responsibility for delivering products as promised. They face long hours at work and a constant overload of tasks, so they need to have a strong work ethic and good time-management skills. Above all else, they must know how to prioritize. Their mantra is: “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.” So where can you find such people? A great and obvious source is within your own company, where it is easier to find and assess candidates just by asking around. Look everywhere: Great future product managers can be waiting in virtually any department, from engineering to customer service to marketing. Typically, they will have already expressed some interest in playing a stronger role in the product. Once you find them, train and mentor them to fill the role successfully. Great product managers are intelligent, focused and “bilingual” in technology and business. A product manager has two main responsibilities: evaluating product opportunities and defining the products to be built to address those opportunities. To allow her to focus on these tasks, the product manager needs a product team around her, much like a CEO needs a management team to run a company. This team comprises several well-defined roles: User experience designers create the product’s interface toward the customer. This crucial role means they must work closely with the product manager. Engineers, also a vital component of the team, build the product that the product manager has defined. This makes them the product manager’s peers, not subordinates. To help engineers understand what the product needs to do, the product manager must involve them early in the process and have them actually meet and observe real customers. A dedicated project manager is also recommended to oversee the work of engineers in the execution phase. This allows the product manager to focus on discovering and defining new products while the project manager schedules and tracks the projects required to build and launch them. A separate product marketing person is needed to tell the world about the product. Naturally, both she and the product manager should give each other input to help formulate marketing messages and product requirements respectively. Finally, every product team can benefit from seeking out the smartest people in the company, regardless of function or position, and making them unofficial “deputy product managers.” If asked for ideas and feedback, they can deliver a surprising amount of value just based on their smarts. Product managers need product teams around them with clearly defined roles. Good user experience (UX) is a vital component of good products. The iPod, for example, owed much of its success to the pleasant and effortless UX. To create a good UX, the product manager must work intensively with a UX design team, which ideally comprises four essential roles: An interaction designer works to understand the target users’ requirements and thinking, and then creates a wireframe design of the product based on this understanding. After this, visual designers contribute the look and feel of the user interface on top of the wireframe. Essentially, these two roles create the user experience, making them a key part of the product team. They should be involved early on, taking part in everything from deciding on the product strategy to participating in customer visits. Note that the importance of visual designers is often sadly underestimated. Their work has the power to evoke emotions in the customers, and if Apple has shown us anything, it is that products that evoke strong emotions, like love and craving, tend to be smash hits. In addition to these two roles, you need a rapid prototyper who can quickly create prototypes of the product and a usability tester who then has users test the product, thus generating input for another iteration of the design process. To allow her UX design team to fully contribute, a product manager must let them complete their work before tasking engineers with building the product. This is because good designers want to experiment with multiple designs, but the engineering process is not agile enough to facilitate this. Make user experience design a priority: Build a complete UX team and help them contribute. Opportunities for new products are everywhere around us, and new ideas, innovative technologies and shifting competitive landscapes create fresh opportunities every day. They exist even in seemingly saturated markets. Remember AltaVista and Infoseek? Their dominance of the search engine market seemed unassailable until Google came along. In this endlessly shifting landscape, a product manager must constantly and quickly evaluate product opportunities and decide which ones to pursue. To help achieve this, she should answer a list of questions used to help define and communicate such opportunities, called a Product Opportunity Assessment (POA): What problem will this solve? Who are we solving a problem for and how big is that market? What alternatives do competitors provide and why are we the ones who can succeed in this? What factors are critical to success (e.g. partnerships with distributors)? What metrics will we use to measure our success? Why is this the right time to enter the market and what is our go-to-market strategy (i.e. how will we sell the product)? Based on the above questions, is this an opportunity we should pursue? This light and easy-to-understand tool can greatly help analyze and communicate product opportunities without resorting to rigid and overly long documentation methods. Its results can then be discussed with senior management and a clear go/no-go decision can be reached, thus helping the product manager focus her efforts. Note that all questions in the POA are geared toward understanding the opportunity, not presupposing a solution. Only after finding a product opportunity to pursue does a product manager begin the product discovery phase: defining the right product to fit that opportunity. A product manager must constantly seek out and assess product opportunities. To be successful, a product must be: \nfeasible: your engineers must be capable of building it. \nusable: customers must be able to use it. \nvaluable: the product itself must deliver value to customers, so they want to buy it. All three criteria need to be tested and validated before building the product. To facilitate this, the product manager and her UX interaction designer should first come up with a minimal product prototype: one that has the bare minimum functionality necessary to be valuable, and yet delivers a realistic enough user experience for real users to test. Involve an engineer in defining the minimal product so they can gauge its feasibility and help the product manager decide which features to cut and which to leave in. This ensures the engineers are confident that they can implement the features that remain, and hence no more cutting is required later on. In short, the product should now be feasible. Once a minimal product is arrived at, a prototype can be built and tested with real users to validate whether it is usable and valuable. Once you’ve validated a product and delivered the specifications to engineering, you must make a fundamental mindset shift from product discovery to execution. There should be no further changes to the product specifications after this. If management requests changes after this point, don’t lose focus on execution but rather start a new discovery process for version 2.0 of your product to run in parallel with building version 1.0. Product discovery: Validate that your product is valuable, usable and feasible by defining and testing a minimal product. A key responsibility of a product manager is to deliver accurate product specifications to the engineering team. The most effective way to do this is to build a high-fidelity prototype: a prototype with minimal functionality, but a realistic user experience. In the case of simple websites, for example, the prototype may just comprise clickable buttons that lead to different pages. The end-goal is a prototype that anyone can easily interact with to understand the product, without necessarily having to look at any product specs. In addition to being a handy tool for communicating product specs, a hi-fi prototype allows product managers to immediately test the product with real users. The sooner this happens, the easier it is to adjust the product according to the feedback. So how does this testing happen? When setting up a prototype test, first of all you’ll need test subjects. Gather them from whatever sources you can: friends, family or Craigslist recruits. All are fair game. Second, be sure to prepare thoroughly beforehand. Define what tasks you want the users to complete, focusing on the tasks they are expected to spend the most time on. During the test itself, the less you say, the better. Don’t taint the test subjects’ experiences with your own expectations. Your goal is to observe and understand where your model might be inconsistent with how a user thinks. Just watch: Can they complete the tasks easily? Do they find what they’re looking for? If you identify obvious problems after the first test subjects, fix them immediately. This way, the next users can already test your new solution. Use high-fidelity prototypes to convey product specs effectively and to test your product on real users. If you’re a product manager, understanding customers is a critical part of your job. In fact, it’s so important that you should attend every site visit, customer interview and usability test as well as use whatever market-research tools are available to really gain a deep understanding of customers. Note, though, that customers are notoriously poor at expressing what exactly they want from a product. Therefore, don’t let their input directly steer the course you take with your product. Instead, stay focused on identifying customer needs, and think for yourself how to address those needs. A great way to gain deep customer insights is a charter user program (CUP). Basically, this is a program where you find and recruit 8–10 customers from your target market who suffer from the problem your product aims to solve. You then work with these customers as partners to develop and test a product to address this issue. Your end goal is to develop a product that works for your whole target market, so don’t fall into the trap of making a specialized product for just one or two of your charter users. Using a CUP is beneficial for the participating customers because they gain early – usually free – access to the product. Remember, it solves a painful problem for them, so the earlier they can use it, the better for them. You, on the other hand, gain extensive access to users from your target market, allowing you to rapidly test prototypes of your product and refine it accordingly. Eventually, when you launch the product, you can realize the second big advantage of a CUP: use the participants as satisfied customer references, which are essential for any successful product launch. Use a charter user program to understand your customers and gain references for your launch. Effective product management means constantly prioritizing and making choices: Which product opportunities should be pursued? Which features should be included in the product? Which tasks are most important? These decisions are difficult because, typically, every stakeholder in the company will feel strongly and differently about them. To help resolve these tradeoffs, you should define a set of product principles: your beliefs of what’s truly important to the strategy of this entire product line and the company. In the case of a start-up, the company’s mission statement often embodies these principles. Despite their strategic nature, the principles need to be specific enough to help guide any decisions regarding features, target customers, etc. For example, if an online auction provider has decided that its primary product principle is safety, then it should not hesitate to increase security measures for customers, even at the cost of usability. Another excellent tool for making difficult product choices is the use of personas: fictional user profiles of (imaginary) typical customers. These personas are created by the product manager and interaction designer based on what they know about their potential customers. For example, you could say that your potential customers are “Marys” (professional, tech-savvy women in their 30s) and “Freddys” (male students with limited income). Depending on whether you prioritize “Marys” or “Freddys,” you will likely choose very different features to include in your product. Such simple archetypes help align the whole product team on who the customer is and what is important for them. Just make sure that at some stage, you also talk to real users and verify your personas are accurate! Product management is about making choices: Use personas and product principles to help you with this. When improving existing products rather than launching new ones, many product managers fall into a modus of just fixing bugs and adding features as requested. But bolting on features indiscriminately to please specific customers often makes the product less appealing to the rest of the market, hurting its success in the long run. Just as with new products, product improvement should start with an understanding of what your goals are. You must understand the product’s most important business metrics and gear any improvements toward affecting those metrics. Say your product is a website where a key metric is what percentage of visitors become customers – currently 5%. You may then introduce a new feature to raise that percentage, like an easier sign-up process. If the percentage rises to 10%, you’ve just added a very valuable feature! An especially valuable time to make changes to a product comes right after the product launch. Lots of lessons can be learned in the first week when the product is actually live. During this time, consider yourself in “rapid response” mode, addressing issues or lagging key metrics quickly. When improving products, be careful that you don’t unwittingly abuse your users, i.e. release changes that they don’t appreciate. To avoid this, ensure you deploy changes gently. This means you inform customers of changes well in advance and make the transition as painless as possible. Redouble your quality assurance efforts, and for major changes, consider running the old and new versions of your product in parallel, at least initially, allowing users to opt in as they please. When you make changes to your product, think carefully about what you want to achieve and deploy them gently. The key message in this book: A product manager’s main responsibilities are assessing product opportunities and defining products to address those opportunities. The product manager and her team must ensure the products launched are feasible, usable and valuable, by creating a prototype of the product and testing it with real users as soon as possible.

In reality, however, most great inventors are more likely to wear sneakers and jeans than a lab coat. Indeed, some of the greatest success stories of the modern world – Twitter, Facebook and Pantone – were all created by fairly “normal” individuals. So how did they go about it? And could you do the same? Those are the questions that these blinks seek to answer. They contain both a historical account of many great inventions and a list of factors that any aspiring inventor would do well to consider. In these blinks, you’ll discover how the wheeled suitcase came to be; why Adam Smith believed that every factory worker was a great inventor at heart; and whether you have what it takes to be a Super-Encounterer. Do you own a wheeled suitcase? If you do, you know how much easier it makes traveling; instead of lugging your luggage through train station and airport, you can simply and swiftly wheel it along. But did you know that these suitcases are a relatively recent invention? Before the 1970s, everyone had to carry luggage by hand, no matter how heavy it was. It took Bernard D. Sadow, the vice president of a luggage company, to recognize this problem and come up with a solution. Inspiration struck while Sadow was walking through an airport and struggling with two heavy suitcases. All too familiar with the problem, Sadow hit upon the solution when he saw an airport employee pushing a wheeled platform, atop which rested a heavy machine. “Why shouldn’t luggage have wheels, too?” Sadow thought. Soon, he’d developed and patented a prototype. His first design sold well, but it wasn’t perfect: The wheels were placed on the long side of the suitcase and if you tugged too hard it would bump your legs, not to mention that turning corners caused it to topple. Since Sadow only used his product while on vacation, he saw no need to spend time improving it. But an airline pilot named Robert Plath, in need of more than a mere holiday suitcase, decided to tinker with the trundling travel bag. Eventually, after much work in his own private workshop, Plath developing the suitcase we know today: He put the wheels on the correct side and added a solid handle so the suitcase wouldn’t tip over or roll into your legs. Plath’s design went on to become the universally loved product that people use whenever they need to travel. So, why was Robert Plath able to build a better suitcase than Sadow? Well, since Plath had to travel every day, he had a better understanding of the problem, which, in turn, enabled him to hit upon a better solution. As we’ll see in the next blink, such familiarity is key to success. Have you ever spent months or even years with a nagging problem – and then, one random day, hit upon an ingenious solution and exclaimed, “Why didn’t I think of this before?!” Well, don’t feel bad. Complete understanding of a problem usually only comes with repetition. Adam Smith explained this in 1776: He wrote that one benefit of having factory workers is that they can become inventors through confronting the same task, or problem, on a daily basis. One such factory worker was a boy in charge of pulling a lever every day. The constant repetition prompted the boy to think inventively: He automated the lever by tying a string around it and connecting it to another part of the machine. Now he could stand back and watch as the machine’s lever pulled itself. Sure, encountering the same problem over and over again can lead to frustration, but it can also lead to great inventions. For this to happen, however, three components must be present: First, the frustration has to come from a hidden problem, one that’s difficult to detect. Second, you should be able to tell how solving this frustrating problem will affect a lot of people in the future, not just you. Third, you have to accept that it might take ages for the invention to become successful. Let’s look at the example of Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter: In 2000, he came up with an idea for text-based broadcasts that send messages about location and activities to friends. He found it frustrating that this simple and useful idea wasn’t available. The solution to his problem was difficult to detect because few people at the time had the right kind of phone to send these messages. But sales of smartphones were on the rise, so he was able to predict that his idea could become successful – it just might take a while. And his patience paid off. Six years after Dorsey identified a problem and developed a solution, the rest of the world caught up and Twitter took off. Do you ever have the feeling that you’re blessed with good luck? If that’s the case, you might be great at finding solutions. Psychology professor Richard Wiseman suggests that people who feel lucky are more observant and better at identifying useful solutions. In one experiment, Wiseman brought together a group of people, all of whom considered themselves either lucky or unlucky. He gave everyone a newspaper and asked them to count the photographs in it. On the second page of the paper, a message was written: “Stop counting – there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.” It turned out that the lucky people actually did have a higher likelihood of noticing the message. They found the solution in only a few seconds, while the unlucky ones took around two minutes. The author has a term for these fantastically observant people: Super-Encounterers. Super-Encounterers make great inventors because they don’t narrowly focus on a problem. Instead, they explore, especially when they are unsure of the answer. This widens their outlook, providing more chances to discover and create. This behavior also presents itself in an experiment conducted by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He set up a room, opened it up to art students and told them to pick out and draw objects within it. Two groups evolved: One group chose objects and started drawing immediately with one concept in mind. One such student simply picked up a book and a hat and drew them. The other group took their time observing different objects in different ways. These students looked at things through a glass prism and opened books to see the individual pages. As a result, their drawings were based on improvisation, exploration and discovery. Seven years later, Csikszentmihalyi checked in with the students and found that most of the first group couldn’t support themselves and had stopped painting. But many people from the second group went on to become professional artists or teachers. As you’ll learn in the next blink, however, luck is no longer enough. Today, data is what drives discovery. Did you know that Viagra was actually invented by accident? In fact, many medical discoveries are stumbled upon on paths that scientists thought would lead to something else. And these days discovering something by accident has never been easier. This is because we live in the digital era. “Big Data” has become such a common theme that a new class of scientist has emerged: the bioinformatics people. Instead of waiting for a lucky break, bioinformatics people create their own luck by using computers and checking the results of thousands of past experiments in order to reveal hidden connections. A McKinsey report from 2013 shows that this form of research actually has value. It’s called data-mining, and they estimate it to be worth around $100 billion per year. One of the major advantages of making discoveries through data-mining is the time it saves; by letting computers search through the huge piles of data, you save the time and money it would cost for teams of scientists to do it. This way you can analyze thousands of medical trials in a single afternoon! As you might assume, the amount of medical-industry data is enormous. In fact, it’s already measured in petabytes. And one petabyte equals one million billion bytes! Today’s data-mining algorithms can check this otherwise unused information in record time, leading to surprising discoveries, like new uses for old medications. For example, consider imipramine. It was developed as an antidepressant, but research discovered that it could also be used against small-cell lung cancer. Before data-mining, making this kind of discovery would have taken decades. Today it can happen incredibly quickly, and in the case of imipramine, researchers went from analyzing the data to clinical trials in around two years. But data-mining isn’t the only advantage we have these days, as we’ll see in the next blink; it’s also easier to create something out of nothing. Did you know that there’s a color code for the brownies in Ben & Jerry’s ice cream? It’s true, and it was generated using a system that was created out of nothing. This invention dates back to the 1960s, when Lawrence Herbert was co-owner of a printing company called Pantone. During this time, Herbert was in charge of ordering inks, and he noticed a problem: every supplier used different color pigments. So, depending on who you ordered from, every color would be different. Herbert had a brilliant idea: A color-coding system called Pantone that would work like a universal language, something everyone in the printing industry could use. Each color has a corresponding number. For example, Daffodil Yellow = Pantone 123. He created a sample page and went to work convincing the industry of its potential. Though introducing Pantone wasn’t easy, Herbert never gave up, and it eventually caught on. By the 1970s Pantone was making more than $1 million a year in licensing fees. Herbert managed to create a valuable invention out of nothing; all he had was an idea and a piece of paper. And we still find this kind of inventive magic today. Just consider an important discovery about the human gut. Modern research shows that the microbes in our gut are crucial to our health. But if the levels of these microbes become unbalanced, the consequences can be deadly, resulting in ailments like the stomach infection Clostridium difficile, or “C-diff.” Here’s where the out-of-nothing invention comes in. Scientists discovered a unique way of curing people with C-diff: with healthy human feces. Doctors use microbes from the feces of a healthy donor and “transplant” them into the sick person’s gut through infusion. With this method, what would otherwise be a fatal infection can be cured within hours. This shows us that brilliant new ideas can come from anywhere, and it’s another example of an amazing invention being created from nothing. Furthermore, you don’t need big funding or a team of scientists to create an amazing invention. As the next blink makes clear, all you need is imagination. Wayne Gretzky was perhaps the greatest ice-hockey player ever. And there was a secret to his success: he always went where the puck was heading, not where it had been. This is exactly what you need to do when inventing. It’s called forecasting, and it’s no easy task. To help with this, you can play the Wayne Gretzky Game: Picture the world a few decades from now and try to imagine what technology will exist. Base your thoughts on how you believe human desire and technology will continue to evolve. To see this game in action we can look at Xerox: In the 1970s, Xerox forecasted the future and figured out what tech-savvy people would want – a personal workstation for the consumer market, with a mouse, a word processor and a graphical user interface. But forecasting accurately isn’t always so easy. In the mid-1960s, strategist Herman Kahn tried to determine just how good we are at it. He asked the leading minds of the time to give 100 technological predictions for the year 2000. It turned out that the predictions for communications and computing were about 80 percent accurate. These included accurate forecasting for the internet, VCRs and cell phones. The worst predictions had to do with transportation, medicine and architecture. These included misguided predictions about hibernating spaceships and appetite-control pills. But these predictions show that an accurate one can catalyze change. Take Moore’s Law, for example. It states that computing power doubles every 18 months. Gordon E. Moore himself later said that after he proposed his theory in the 1960s, he noticed that it launched certain behaviors. People in the technology industry began to realize that if they weren’t moving fast enough they would fall behind Moore’s Law. In this way, the prediction became a self-fulfilling prophecy, and a driving force for new inventions. Coming up with a great new invention isn’t easy, but, as we’ll learn in the next blink, everybody has the power to do it. The mind is a powerful tool and you can use it to conjure up your ideas and inventions. Many of our greatest inventors use their imagination to envision their ideas before they sketch them out. Someone famous for taking this approach: Nikola Tesla. As a child, he would spend sleepless nights imagining new cities and structures. At the age of 17, he began turning these thoughts into inventions. Tesla could see his inventions so clearly in his mind’s eye that he didn’t need any models or sketches to allow him to start creating. For him, the visions were so clear that he dreamed of inventing a camera that could capture them from his mind. Recently, inventor Elon Musk continued this dream by building a system that allows people to design an object by moving their hands through the air. So how do you make these thoughts a reality? Start by asking questions and getting your mind going. As a writing teacher, the author has watched many students explore their creative minds. One student told him that he had the plot for an entire movie in his head; it was just a matter of putting it on paper. When the author met with him a week later, the student still wasn’t able to write it all down. He understood the story, he just didn’t know how to get started. To help, the author asked the student all the questions about the story he would ask himself: How does the movie start? Whose point of view is being used? Even, what odors do you imagine there to be? With every invention you can imagine, there are hundreds of details that can be turned into questions like these. Ask yourself as many questions as you can to help design and realize your idea. Imagination is the precursor of invention. And as everyone has an imagination, anyone can come up with a great invention. Chances are you probably haven’t heard of John Harrison. He was an English carpenter and clockmaker who solved a problem for the British Parliament in 1714 and won £20,000 – the equivalent of about £2 million in today’s money. Harrison’s story shows us that it’s often people outside of a specific industry that find the best solutions for its problems. Back in the 1700s, sailors weren’t able to calculate their longitudinal position, and this left them in danger of crashing into rocks or other vessels, and sinking down to the watery depths. For example, in 1707, 2,000 British sailors died when an English fleet crashed in the ocean. So, in 1714 the British parliament offered a reward to anyone who could find an accurate method for calculating the longitude while aboard a ship. People assumed the solution would come from an astronomer or someone from the Royal Observatory, but it was John Harrison, a simple carpenter and clockmaker, who took home the prize. He created the marine chronometer, a clock that was accurate to the second and allowed sailors to tell the time back home and compare it to the time where they currently were, giving them a fixed position. Another example is Adam Rivers: He’s a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Georgia in the marine sciences department who, in 2012, solved a problem for the food industry. A company was having trouble getting the right food coloration for their health shake. While the problem was proving hard to solve for a food scientist, Rivers quickly connected the dots and solved the problem over a single weekend. Using his knowledge of marine biology, along with some tools he bought at Walmart, he managed to chemically alter the mix of metals in the water to create a more pleasingly colored beverage. So it really doesn’t matter what industry you currently work in. To become a successful inventor, all you need to possess is initiative and perseverance. The key message in this book: Everyone has the potential to come up with a great idea. The next amazing invention can come from anyone, anywhere, especially if that person works outside the main field of action. What helps is a deep understanding of the problem and the ability to foresee where society is headed and what people will need. Actionable advice: Launch a crowdfunding campaign. If you think you have a great idea, launch a campaign on a crowdfunding platform and seek the feedback of real people.

People appear willing to change their opinions because of just one tweet that comes up on their feeds, or will follow some foolish fashion trend that clashes not only with their body types, but their country’s climate. But of course, you would never let yourself be influenced in such obvious ways – or would you? As these blinks will demonstrate, our thoughts and behaviors are influenced by external forces and factors far more than we might like to admit. Luckily, you can learn how to spot this invisible influence, and even use it to your advantage. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the unexpected benefits of attending every class session in your college course; why some people get paid for not wearing something – without being nude models; and how a big hurricane might influence the name you give to your baby. Have you ever thought of the reasons behind the clothes you wear or the car you drive? Most people would chalk these things up to objective features like price, mileage or design, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. In reality, we’re quite easily influenced by social pressure. While many of us are reluctant to admit that others have power over us, they most certainly do; they affect our actions, preferences and even our self-perceptions. Consider the neighborhood you grew up in: it has a profound impact on you because of things like the quality of nearby schools and the peers that surround you. If every kid in your neighborhood teased bookworms, think about how that could cause you to develop negative feelings toward reading. But what is it about humans that allows us to be so easily influenced by others? One reason is that we’re vulnerable to all manner of subtle factors. Take one study by psychologist Richard Moreland of the University of Pittsburgh: he instructed four women who were considered equally attractive to attend a large college class and act like normal students. The four women were to attend zero, five, 10 and 15 sessions of the class, respectively. At the end of the semester, Moreland gave the students photographs of all four women and asked the students to rate the women based on their looks. The majority of the class preferred the woman who’d attended 15 sessions, but weren’t aware of ever having seen her! Simply put, the study suggests that we prefer familiar people, and social influence is a powerful force in this regard. However, if you are aware of it, it will have less of an effect on you. A child may not help but be influenced by the bookworm-hating kids in your neighborhood – that is, until she realizes how they’re influencing her. After that, the other kids won’t be able to discourage her so easily. When faced with such an issue, she might ask herself whether people who read a lot are, in fact, losers. She might then consider all the prolific, illustrious scientists and writers who immersed themselves in books, and be encouraged by them instead. Knowing what you now know about social influence, do you still think you’re a totally independent person? Well, if you do, you’d be wrong; we’re highly prone to adopting the behavior and opinions of those around us. One reason for doing so is simply that it saves time, because we don’t have to figure things out for ourselves. But we also do it because of social pressure. For example, in 1951, psychologist Solomon Asch did an experiment in which groups of people were asked to match the length of a line shown to them on a card with one of three other lines drawn on another card. Each participant was then called on individually to match them. The correct answer should have been obvious – except six of the seven participants were actors, all instructed to give the same, incorrect answer. The one real participant was called on last and, in one-third of the cases, he or she conformed to the group opinion and gave a clearly incorrect answer. But imitation doesn’t just affect logic. Another such type of conformity is called emotional mimicry, wherein, when we see another person expressing an emotion – say, smiling joyfully – cells in our brain, called mirror neurons, begin to fire, making us smile as well. Imitation can even explain various forms of media hype. While publishers and producers would love to know how popular a book, song or movie will be, it’s nearly impossible to tell because of the power of social influence. Just take a study in which teens were asked to listen to songs by unknown artists and download the ones they liked. One group of participants undertook the process without outside influence, while the second group could see the number of previous downloads within their group. The second group gravitated toward songs that had been frequently downloaded by previous participants, showing that participants affected one another’s choices. However, the songs that were popular in the first, independent group, did also experience some popularity within the second, indicating that quality also played a role. So, what others think can influence us tremendously. But there are also instances when we don’t imitate others – that is to say, we don’t always want to be like everyone else. Let’s take a look at this important factor next. Imagine you’re in love with a new band that only a select few people know exists. Then, all of a sudden, the group goes mainstream and everyone else is obsessed with them too. Would you be annoyed by this? If so, you might be a bit of a snob – but you’re definitely not alone. Traditional economic theory argues that we make choices based on quality and price. In this system of thought, if outside influences have any effect, it’s that we follow others’ lead. But there’s actually another force at play: the snob effect, which refers to the basic principle that the more the general population likes something, the less interested many of us become. People like this don’t just want to appear different; they want to appear better, smarter, richer or more sophisticated. This yearning to differentiate oneself may even explain why so many well-known athletes have at least one older sibling. The first born often strives for academic achievement and the second, in an attempt to differentiate himself, gets into sports. While some people do yearn to distinguish themselves, not all of us do. The truth is, the extent to which such distinction matters to you is a result of your background. For instance, in the United States, people feel a strong need to differentiate themselves, whereas the average East Asian cares more about societal harmony and connectedness. But there are also differences within the United States, especially along class lines. So, while a middle-class person will be more eager to set herself apart, say by owning different material objects, working-class people are more likely to imitate one another’s choices. In fact, people from lower-income backgrounds will often like something more if many others do too. This might be because, in working-class communities, familiarity and cooperation are valued more than uniqueness. Can you imagine a brand paying you to not wear their clothes? Well, for celebrities like Mike Sorrentino, a character on MTV’s reality show Jersey Shore, this is a reality. In fact, brands and people alike go to great lengths to ensure that they’re not confused with something or someone else – especially if that other entity is undesirable. Brand-name clothing is one way to communicate something about the identity of the wearer, and brands work hard to distance themselves, and their customers, from unfitting identities. For instance, Abercrombie & Fitch paid Sorrentino to not wear their clothes because he didn’t conform to the brand’s preppy image. Or take the luxury brand Burberry, whose unique Burberry pattern used to mark its wearer as a distinguished gentleman. Nowadays, however, this upscale image has been overtaken by a very different one: certain groups of soccer hooligans have made the pattern integral to their uniform. As a result, Burberry removed the pattern from the majority of their product line. So, proving what you’re not can be just as important as proving what you are, and sometimes people harm themselves trying to do the former. For instance, studies have found that many young African-Americans, especially those with lighter skin tone, intentionally underperform at school to avoid being misidentified as white, or as “acting white,” and end up damaging their career prospects in the process. Taking this into account, if you want to distinguish yourself, it’s safer to stick with costly and disposable goods. After all, you can’t stick out by using something that everyone needs and can afford, like bread or toilet paper. Expensive products and activities, on the other hand, are great for distinguishing oneself, as long as others see you using or performing them. In the end, the fact that not everyone can afford these inessential things makes them inherently exclusive. Such costs could be monetary, like purchasing a yacht; time costs, like the time required to learn Esperanto; or an opportunity cost, like risking unemployability by sporting lots of piercings. Imagine an evil witch has cursed you and, from now on, every single breakfast you eat for the rest of your life will consist solely of chocolate pudding. That doesn’t sound so terrible, does it? After all, who doesn’t love familiarity – or chocolate for that matter? Humans tend to prefer familiar people and things, and with good evolutionary reasons: being attracted to familiar people increases our chances of forming close-knit groups. Likewise, familiar foods, even chocolate pudding, are a better bet for survival than those interesting-looking mushrooms in the garden. In fact, this pull toward the familiar goes so far that, in the wake of big hurricanes, parents often give their children names that begin with the same letter as that of the storm, like a family in New Orleans naming their daughter Kathy after Hurricane Katrina. These parents prefer such names simply because they’ve been exposed to the sound of the letter so much. But, while familiarity is a favored attribute that we seek out, humans also crave novelty. Just like all other mammals, we are always searching for new experiences. For instance, the Coolidge effect describes a mammal, a male hamster for instance, losing all interest in a female of the same species after copulating with her several times. Then, when a new female is introduced, the hamster in this case becomes frisky, excited by the potential for a new experience. The same effect takes place in females, although it’s not as powerful. But regardless of how much we desire a new person or thing, we’ll often remain on guard until we know that it’s safe. In this sense, what we’re really seeking is the middle ground – and that goes for our identity as well: we want to be familiar and different. For example, we all want to be unique in our social circles. But to be a part of such a group in the first place, you also need to be familiar. So, you might diverge from your peers by driving a white car instead of a silver one, but won’t go so far as to insist on driving a tractor. Why do so many people join groups when working toward goals like losing weight or qualifying for competitions? Well, it’s often because others can help us perform better. But they can also distract, and whether or not social influences will help or hinder us depends on how complex a task is. When a task is relatively simple, we perform better under the gaze of spectators, competitors or companions, since such people keep us motivated. For instance, you’re more likely to stick with a diet if other people are holding you accountable; similarly, you’ll run faster when in competition with others. However, if the task is quite difficult and involves learning, the presence of others can hamper your performance for a variety of reasons. First off, other people can be distracting, either because they make us focus on looking good instead of completing the task at hand, or because they involve you in activities unrelated to your goal. But the presence of others will also make you more physically alert. Your body will be ready to fight, flee or play, none of which are much help when solving a complex mathematical equation. At the same time, you can use social influence to motivate others to act differently, but this tool has its limits. For example, you can make people consume less energy in their households by appealing to their competitive spirit. In one study, when it came to energy consumption, the thing people cared most about was how much energy they saved relative to their neighbors. This turned out to be a much bigger motivating factor than, say, protecting the environment. However, this strategy only works if there’s hope that you can beat out the competition. So, if a student is so far behind in his schoolwork that he has no chance of catching up, comparing him to his classmates will only be of further detriment to his morale. The key message in this book: We’re influenced by others in everything we do, even if we’re not aware of it. From imitating someone word for word, to doing the exact opposite of someone else just to be different, other people are always guiding our actions. The good news is, the more we understand this influence, the better we can handle it.  Actionable Advice Mimic your negotiation partner.  The next time you’re in a negotiation and things aren’t looking good, try using mimicry to win the other person’s trust. By simply leaning back when your interlocutor does, scratching your head when he scratches his and otherwise subtly copying his behavior, you’ll make the other party feel more connected and trusting. Negotiators who mirror their counterpart’s behavior are five times more likely to reach an acceptable agreement. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Suggested further reading: Contagious by Jonah Berger Contagious examines what makes a product, idea or behavior more likely to be shared among many people. The book explores the question of whether contagious things are accidents or the results of good marketing, or whether contagiousness is an inherent feature of a product, idea or behavior. It argues that, far from being merely a matter of luck, the majority of very popular products and ideas are the result of a combination of savvy planning and execution.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

So what more do you need? The right kind of analytics, of course! No matter how smart or motivated, an aspiring entrepreneur should always be aware of that deadly pitfall: building something that nobody wants. By showing you how to use good metrics to assess your success, this book will ensure that your start-up is heading in the right direction. So, what are the basic concepts you need to analyze your start-up? And how can you apply these concepts to make your start-up grow? These are some of the questions that Lean Analytics sets out to answer. You’ll also discover that some data can be good, but too much can be fatal; how stickiness can drive the growth of your start-up; and which number should matter most. What is a start-up, exactly? It's an organization that aims to build a sustainable and replicable business model. Perhaps you’ve dreamed of founding one yourself? If so, you'll need to stay informed about data. Data, in addition to guiding you along your journey, makes it hard to delude yourself. So what is data? It’s the numerical information that's vital to your business. If you run a media site, for example, you'll need data about ad-click numbers. If you're an investor, you'll need to know all the figures about the returns on your investments. One reason that data is so crucial is that entrepreneurs often lie to themselves a bit when assessing their success. After all, they often need to convince other people (like investors!) of their ideas without having any hard evidence that these ideas will actually work. However, if you believe too much in your dreams, your start-up probably won't survive. You need to stay grounded in reality – and that's where data comes in. Data is the antidote to self-delusion. By allowing you to soberly measure your success, it keeps you on track: you'll know exactly where you stand as you work toward your goal. You shouldn't become a robot that just follows the numbers, however. Your personal judgment is important too! You don’t want to be data-driven; instead, stay data-informed. Though data is undeniably important, collecting and analyzing it can become addictive. Moreover, you'll run into trouble if you use data to optimize just one part of your business. Imagine, for example, that you run a website, and your data shows that pictures of scantily clad women increase your click-through rate. If you just blindly follow that by filling your page with models in bikinis, you might undermine your business's image or integrity. So don't become a slave to your data. Remember: data is ultimately just another tool. So what's the goal of staying data-informed? Ultimately, your data should guide you to the right product, and the right market, before your money runs out. But you also need to find an effective way to measure your success. That means finding good metrics that provide you with relevant and meaningful data. Good metrics have three important characteristics: they're comparable and understandable, and they're most effective as ratios. A comparable metric tells you how things are developing. You should be able to compare a metric to different time periods, groups of consumers, or competitors. The phrase “increased revenue from last week,” for example, provides more meaningful information than just “2 percent revenue.” A good metric is also understandable. Your data should keep you moving in the right direction, but if nobody can comprehend or remember it, it'll just turn into a burden. It won't lead to any positive changes in your organization. So keep your metrics simple, like “revenue per week.” The most useful metrics are also ratios. There are a number of reasons for this. First off, ratios are easier to act on. If you're running a media site, for instance, you'll have information about your ad-click numbers. Ad click per day, however, is much more useful: it tells you if you're achieving your ad-click goals. You'll know if you need to improve on this or not. Secondly, ratios are inherently comparable. They allow you to compare short-term metrics over a longer period of time. “Ad clicks per month,” for example, is one metric. But the ratio of ad clicks per day over average clicks within a month will tell you if your site is more popular at a certain time, or if viewers are starting to taper off. The key to thriving as a start-up founder is finding where the demand for your product and your ability and desire to answer that demand intersect. So first, find a business you're truly passionate about. Building a start-up isn't just about creating something that works. Ask yourself: What do you really want to do? Don't start a business you'll end up hating, because if you don't enjoy what you're doing, you almost certainly won't succeed. Furthermore, investors typically look for founders who truly care about solving a specific problem. You won't attract investment if you're unenthusiastic and disengaged. Second, make sure you're doing something you're actually good at. If you identify a real niche in the market, you won't be the only person trying to fill it. You need to be able to satisfy your market's demand better than your competitors. And remember: Never start a business where everyone can compete with you equally. You need some sort of advantage, like a network of friends and contacts that will improve your chances of success. Finally, be sure you can earn money doing what you do. After all, this is what starting a business is all about: getting people to pay you to do what you want. That means you need to earn enough money from your customers for the product or service you're offering. You also need to do this without spending too much time or money acquiring them. So be careful – don't waste your time building something you’re uninterested in or that nobody wants. There are several ways to understand start-up development. The Lean Analytics framework says that start-ups go through five distinct stages: Empathy, Stickiness, Virality, Revenue and Scale. In the first stage, Empathy, you identify a need that people have. This points you in the right direction: you'll know where your niche in the market is. Next, in the Stickiness stage, you figure out how to answer your customers' need in an effective way that they're willing to pay for. Then you enter the Virality stage. That's where you build the product, features and functionality that'll attract your customers. Once you have a base of loyal customers, you start the Revenue stage, during which your business really grows and expands. The Scale stage comes last. In the Scale stage, you'll start trying to break into new markets or expand, and your start-up will begin looking more like a larger company. The Stickiness, Virality and Revenue stages all drive your start-up's growth. How? Stickiness ensures that your customers keep using your product. You can assess your stickiness by measuring engagement, a key metric for predicting success. Facebook, for instance, had low engagement in the beginning. They had few users, but they got them to keep coming back. Facebook soon became enormously sticky. There's a metric for Virality as well. Its key metric is the number of new users each established user brings in. The more users your current users add, the faster your business will grow. Facebook was designed to function better as it gained more users, so, as more people encouraged their friends to join, it went viral rather quickly. Revenue, of course, is the ultimate metric for identifying a sustainable business model. Facebook now has a good one: it generates revenue by placing highly personalized ads on its users' pages. One of the keys to achieving success in your start-up is staying focused. That means you need to concentrate on the single metric that's most critical to whatever stage you're going through. You should always know what your most important metric is at any given time. As a start-up founder, you'll have to keep track of multiple figures, like revenue per customer or customer satisfaction. Some of these numbers will matter immediately, and some you'll store for future use – when you present your company's history to an investor, for example. Don't lose yourself in your business's data, however. Concentrate on the right thing at the right time. If you're running a media page, for example, don't stress out about your ad-click rates before you've attracted a sizable base of customers. Your ad-click rates won't matter before then. The number you should be focusing on at the moment is your One Metric That Matters, or OMTM. Your OMTM helps you set clear goals and measure your success along the way. In the restaurant industry, for example, the ratio of staff costs to gross revenue is a great OMTM. It's simple, immediate, actionable and comparable: it's a single number you can generate every night; you can adapt your costs to it quickly; and you can easily track it over time and compare it with other restaurants. You could set a clear goal by aiming for a ratio of 0.25, for instance. That would mean that each of your staff costs should produce four times the gross revenue. If you're below, maybe you're under-serving your customers. If you're close to this figure, you probably have a good balance between customer service and customer profitability. A lot of start-ups are based on truly creative ideas and some manage to attract large groups of people. Few start-ups actually make money, however. Even big organizations like Facebook and Twitter have struggled to make money from their user bases. That's why your business model is so important. As a start-up founder, you need to define yours. So what's the simplest business model? It would probably be a lemonade stand where you sell your lemonade for more than it cost to make it. A real business model, on the other hand, is the description of your business's core concepts. It outlines the ways you'll get people to use your product. And keep in mind that your product is more than just the thing you're selling – it's also a mix of other factors, like your service, brand, support or packaging. When you buy an iPhone, for instance, you aren't just getting a phone. You're buying a piece of Apple's character, too. Business models work in a similar way. They're a mash-up of several aspects of the business – sales tactics, revenue sources, product types and delivery models. You'll have to carefully consider these different elements when you construct your business model. Also, a good business model helps you separate your valuable customers from those that might be harmful. Unfortunately, not all users are good for you. Some might only be good in the long term, like people who use a free, basic service and only sign up for a paid account after a few years. Other users might never become paying customers, but could still provide free marketing or bring in other users who will pay. Some users, however, might only harm your business. They could distract you, consume your resources or spam your site. So make sure your start-up prioritizes and meets the needs of your most important users. If you're like most people, you've probably bought several things online during the course of your life. E-commerce companies are very common nowadays. In fact, they're probably the most common kind of online business there is. E-commerce companies focus on customer loyalty and acquisition. They usually make money by selling products they can deliver electronically, like music downloads on iTunes, or physically, like shoes from Zappos. Some e-commerce companies are loyalty-focused, like Amazon. Amazon builds a strong relationship with its customers, and ensures they’ll keep coming back, by offering them a wide range of products and keeping its services simple. There are other e-commerce companies, however, that focus on acquiring new customers and making big, single sales instead of building loyalty. A website that sells second-hand cars and charges a fee for its services would be an example of this. That site wouldn't need its customers to come back – it would focus on one-time sales. There are several metrics to use in e-commerce, but the most important is revenue per customer. Revenue per customer is the combination of a few other figures. It includes your conversion rate, the percentage of visitors to your site who actually buy something. It also factors in the rate at which your customers return to the site to buy your products again. This particular figure tells you if you should focus more on building loyalty with current customers or on acquiring new ones. Your shopping cart size is also critical. That figure tells you how much your customers are actually spending. Revenue per customer is the combination of these two figures. It’s important for all kinds of e-commerce companies, regardless of whether they're focused on loyalty or acquisition or a mix of the two. Revenue per customer lets you know how efficiently your business is running. Google's search engine and CNN's website are both examples of media sites, and much of these sites’ revenue comes from advertising. So if your business model is a media site, you'll probably be focused on earning money from advertisements, too. Inserting ads into online content is fairly easy, and a lot of websites rely on the money from advertising to pay the bills. Ad-based monetization can be a fallback revenue source, which subsidizes, for instance, a cheaply priced game, or it can pay for the operating costs of providing free content. You can earn revenue from ads in a number of ways. Some sites make money from displaying banners, while others have sponsorship agreements or affiliate relationships. For example, imagine a sporting news site that has a partnership with a local sports team, and a standing contract to display banners for it. The site might also sell sports books through an affiliate relationship with an online bookstore. Media sites focus on their click-through rates because ad revenue is usually tied to the number of clicks an ad gets. That's why click-through rates or display rates are so important – they represent real money. However, media sites have other concerns, too. They need to make sure their visitors stay as long as possible and visit a lot of pages. They also have to know how many of their visitors are returning and how many are new. You can tailor your ads to suit these different figures. For media sites, advertising is everything. The key message in this book: Start-up founders need to focus on what they're good at and enjoy doing. If you follow your passion and keep a data-informed mindset, you can effectively use metrics to move through the Lean Analytics stages, reach your goals and bring your organization great success. Actionable advice: Question yourself. Before you start, ask yourself: Have you identified a problem that's worth solving? Have you got a good solution to it? Do you actually want to solve this problem? Is this something you're good at? Make sure you're in the right field and you have the right mindset before you start down your start-up path.

Lean is a business approach, most famously used by Toyota, designed to cut waste and inefficiency, while at the same time allowing a company to be flexible, innovative and customer focused.  Lean has been applied to many businesses, from start-ups to established companies, and in many areas, from meetings to product creation. These blinks take the principles of lean and apply them to the world of design. If you want to be more efficient and more creative in your approach to design, read on! In these blinks, you’ll discover why you should draw your design on paper first; why the best design teams have more than just designers in them; and why, if you want to succeed, it’s better to test, test and test again. Do you ever see the designers that work for your company? If your business is like most, it likely keeps the design team separate from everyone else, which means that they work in their own little bubble.  Luckily there’s a way to overcome this. It’s called Lean UX, and it connects designers to a greater collaborative process in which every team member contributes to design. Basically it’s a mix of design thinking, agile software development and lean start-up. But what do these terms all mean? First, design thinking is the idea that every aspect of a business can be approached with design in mind. For instance, when a company encounters an issue, it can solve it like a designer would. One key to this strategy is to involve many people when brainstorming, thereby producing more potential solutions.  Second, agile software development allows designers to deliver greater value to the customer while cutting product cycle times, which it accomplishes by involving everyone in a collaborative product development process. So, instead of a traditional approach, which would see work divided into departments, agile development means everyone working together from the start! This strategy’s main benefits are twofold, in that many hands make light work, and since collaboration builds team spirit while fostering creativity.  The third aspect of Lean UX is the application of the lean start-up method to product design, a strategy that implies fast-paced experimentation and validation.  It works like this: Prototypes are turned out as fast as possible to test market assumptions early on. This early testing then generates feedback almost instantly, telling you what works and what doesn’t. This way, inaccurate assumptions and weak ideas can be scrapped with little effect, freeing up the resources for your best ideas to flourish.  Now that you’ve learned the basics of Lean UX, it’s time to explore the four steps of the Lean UX cycle. So, how do you put Lean UX into practice? The process has four simple aspects, and the first is to create assumptions. But what does this entail? Assumptions are written expressions of your unwritten ideas and beliefs. Take a recruiting company, for instance; an assumption of theirs might be that customers, in their case employers, will utilize their service to interact with potential employees. But while most of the company’s employees might assume this, assuming isn’t enough. This assumption now needs to be tested, and that’s where the rest of the process comes in. Once you have an assumption, your next task is to turn it into a testable hypothesis statement using the three remaining aspects: outcomes, personas and features.  Start by generating an outcome, that is, the result you want your product or service to achieve for users. For instance, the recruiting firm’s outcome might be to get more job seekers to sign up for their service.  Once you’ve decided upon an outcome, design your personas – sketches of your model users. Start by making a small drawing with a name and age, say, Kathleen, 32. Then, list behavioral and demographic information about your persona. In Kathleen’s case, this might include being married with three kids and working as a consultant.  Next, write down your persona’s difficulties and needs – perhaps she’s struggling to balance her kids’ educations with her job, and might be interested in a work-from-home position. You can now finalize your persona by adding potential solutions to their problems. Maybe Kathleen needs a platform that showcases her skills to potential employers and helps her land a new job.  The last step is to add features, actual products and services that might achieve the outcomes you desire for your personas, such as a service that helps employers and potential employees connect easily.  Once you’ve done this, you can bring all four aspects together to write a hypothesis statement that explains the features you intend to offer to your personas, while highlighting your desired outcomes. It’s common for companies to leave designing to the designers. After all, why should others be involved when it’s not their job?  Lean UX turns this practice on its head, and for good reason: bringing every member of the product team into the design process from the get-go makes for faster development, and design that is better suited to your company. This is because design processes normally involve a design team being briefed by someone else, and subsequently creating a product based on this secondhand information. If the design doesn’t work, it is then sent back for reworking, a process that can go on forever.  Lean UX gets around this problem by putting designers to work with other employees right away, allowing the team to fix problems immediately and move the process along.  Consider a designer and a developer going back and forth in an informal dialogue to design a dashboard. It takes them a few sketches and adjustments but they soon agree on a design. The designer is then free to iron out the specifics, while the developer writes the infrastructural code. But maybe you want a more formal approach to implementing collaborative design. Look no further than design studio, a strategy that simply brings different team members together in the same room to develop design solutions to any problem.  Design studio works because collaboration between product managers, business analysts, software developers and designers on a single problem provides a diversity of skills, outlooks and expertise that make the process run smoothly and efficiently.  So, your assumptions and hypothesis statements are ready and your team is prepared to collaborate. Now you’re ready to dive in by developing experiments to test your hypothesis. You might be wondering what actually makes the Lean UX process “lean”? In fact, it all relies on testing product ideas in the most efficient way possible, in order to decide which ones are worth your time. Doing so means trimming the fat to ensure more resources go to the products that do work.  The best strategy for testing product ideas is with the Minimum Viable Product, or MVP. Here’s how it works: The MVP is essentially the smallest thing you can make or smallest action you can take to test the validity of your product. For instance, say you want to start a newsletter, a venture that is both time consuming and costly. You start by questioning the very idea of the newsletter, asking yourself, “is a newsletter necessary and will it be worth my while to make it?”  In order to test this, you need an MVP – in this instance, it could be a signup bar on your website that can measure customer demand. If too few people sign up, you’ll know that the interest isn’t there, allowing you to drop your idea without wasting any additional resources.  But an MVP could also be a prototype that you experiment with before fully committing to a product or service. There are two approaches you can use to design such a prototype: First there’s paper prototyping, a low-fidelity process that can be completed in as little as an hour by using flaps to hide and reveal different information on a page, thereby mimicking a user’s on-screen experience. The drawback of this technique is that it’s highly artificial and can produce a simulation that sometimes inadequately mimics the real experience of the final product.  Medium- or high-fidelity options would be the right choice for products in the more advanced stages of design. While these options boast a visual and interactive quality, and can come close to perfectly matching the final product, the downside is that they are time consuming to produce and maintain. So, an MVP is a great tool to test your hypothesis, but how can you conduct this testing effectively? First, it’s important to know that a commitment to continuous product testing through customers is central to Lean UX. Doing so provides constant market feedback that helps you prove or revise your hypothesis quickly.  For instance, a common Lean UX strategy is to test your MVP once a week with three different customers. A typical week practicing this strategy could look something like this: On Monday, you decide what you’re going to test and which customers to approach. On Tuesday, you fine-tune your MVP to make sure the design clearly communicates exactly what you want to test. On Wednesday, you put the finishing touches on your MVP and write a test script for your moderator to administer to participants.  On Thursday, you actually test the MVP with customers for no longer than an hour and then review the results. On Friday, you use the information you’ve gathered to either validate your hypothesis and move on to the next phase of design, or to revise it and retest the following week.  But Lean UX is all about collaboration, and the research phase is no exception. So don’t put the task in the hands of one expert outsider; instead, bring your whole team into the process.  Outsourcing your research is actually a poor strategy because it adds external bias. It’s better to include one specialized researcher on your team, but to conduct the research as a group. For instance, when deciding the aspects you’re going to test, make sure to involve both developers and designers to ensure you produce a well-rounded test.  Now that you know what Lean UX is and how it works, it’s time to learn how to best integrate this practice into your organization. As you now know, Lean UX isn’t just a series of processes – it’s a mindset and management ethos that requires some organizational shifts to ensure successful integration. It’s essential to push your team members to look beyond their individual roles, because doing so will help foster a collaborative environment.  For instance, in “normal” companies, employees tend to conform to their job titles and descriptions. As such, they’re often discouraged from overstepping the limits of their responsibilities. The problem with this is that it leads to their full range of skills going untapped.  So, while each person has a primary ability, such as design, research or development, every team member can also contribute to other disciplines using their secondary skills and interests. For example, a software developer with a creative mind could also be involved in design.  The result is a more engaged and friendly atmosphere that comes with increased collaboration, creating the right climate for avoiding silo thinking and making your whole team accountable for their results.  But how can you better promote this type of environment? Create an open workspace that fosters collaboration and dialogue between your team. There are a few ways to accomplish this: For one, it’s essential to remove any physical obstacles to collaboration. Perhaps cubicles isolate your employees from one another, or the floor plan of your office forces the separation of departments.  Another productive change is to ensure enough space for whiteboards that allow people to sketch things like personas and prototypes, and where team members can leave feedback and support.  But sometimes it’s just not possible for your whole team to share a single space. In cases like this, your best option is to use tools like skype or regular get-togethers to foster collaboration.   The key message in this book: The web-driven economies of today, dominated by software-based products, have led to ever-decreasing product life cycles, as the continuous nature of software has made rapid product updates essential. To keep ahead of the curve, it’s key to experiment constantly while seeking user feedback, tasks that Lean UX is perfectly suited to tackle through its collaborative dialogic approach.

Over time, these seed-size ideas germinate and may even develop into a fully fledged business model. Hewlett-Packard used the little bets approach with its scientific calculators; Pixar took little wagers on its journey to becoming an animation powerhouse, and many others succeeded in a similar way. There are a number of tricks and strategies that can help you implement and get the most out of the little bets approach. These strategies will also increase your creativity, help you become more innovative, and uncover new insights to place your little bets on. After reading these blinks, you’ll know why improvisation is not just a useful skill for performers; what an embedded journalist can teach you about creativity; and how to be the good kind of perfectionist. A common lesson MBA students pick up in business school is that there’s no point starting a new business till they have a “great idea.” Wrong! Exceptional entrepreneurs don’t work like that. Rather than beginning with a great idea, they discover them when they’re already working on a smaller concept. Google didn’t set out to dominate the internet. They just wanted to improve web searches. To see your small concept grow into a Google-sized success, you should steer clear of top-heavy planning, as this hinders your chances of discovering new ideas and opportunities. Hewlett-Packard co-founder Bill Hewlett understood this, and bolstered his firm’s fortunes by making a brilliant “little bet.” HP needed to expand, but was surrounded by established markets which were already full of competitors. So in 1972, under Bill Hewlett’s guidance, HP introduced the first scientific calculator to the market, even though research advised against it due to its hefty price of $400. It was niche, and they didn’t have to “bet the farm” when they went into production. The calculator was a success, and HP were free to explore a new market without having to contend with competition. A “little bet” has the advantage of being cheap, quick, and of letting you work your way through uncertainty. Market trends and technology can be unpredictable, but because small steps are low-cost and can be launched speedily, companies won’t collapse if one bet fails. If HP had tried to change their entire company from root to branch, and over-planned their next move, the pressure on everyone not to fail would have been stifling. No one would have wanted to take the risks required to be truly innovative. Another great thing about little bets is that even if they go wrong, they allow us to fail swiftly and learn from the outcome. An uncompromising top-down approach can mean a slow-burning, more damaging result. As you’ll see, a little-bets approach cultivates a growth mind-set, which leads to fresh ideas. What’s a growth mind-set? And how can you come up with little bets? The next blink will show you. Aspiring to ambitious goals is healthy and should be encouraged. But what really makes entrepreneurs successful is their ability to abandon ideas that may have once seemed great, rather than just sticking to a single vision. This means being growth-focused and flexible, and not letting failure discourage you. Far from being a disadvantage, errors and mistakes help you delve into creative ideas and gain knowledge from the experience. To be creative, you need to make friends with failure and mistakes. Pixar, for instance, recruited director Brad Bird for The Incredibles, despite his last film being a box-office flop. Pixar executives didn’t let his previous blunder put them off. On the contrary, they explicitly hired Bird to shake things up. Learning from his earlier bad experience, Bird and his team came up with more elaborate storyboards that mimicked the camera’s movement, which enabled animators to pick out the scenes that needed the most work. Eventually, this new approach allowed Pixar to make the film at less cost per minute than their previous release. This is a clear example of how people with growth mind-sets tend to accomplish more than those with a fixed mind-set. According to research conducted by Dr Carol Dweck at Stanford University, we generally bend either toward a fixed or a growth mind-set. A fixed mind-set means we believe intelligence and ability are immovable, whereas a growth mind-set means we believe abilities can be improved through practice and effort. While people with a fixed mind-set interpret obstacles as threats, a growth mind-set lets you move forward and maintain your self-esteem, undeterred by failure. Dr Dweck views Michael Jordan as having a growth mind-set; rather than explaining his success as coming from natural talent, Jordan attributes his accomplishments to effort. Striving for excellence requires you to exercise a certain amount of attention to detail, and hold high standards for the task at hand. But too much perfectionism can paralyze your creative process. You should therefore aim for healthy perfectionism. Extensive psychological studies have revealed two kinds of perfectionism: healthy and unhealthy. Healthy perfectionism is internally driven by personal values, such as quality and excellence, and results in contentedness, happiness, and high levels of well-being. In contrast, unhealthy perfectionism is driven by external factors, like worrying about mistakes or parental pressure, and can bring about eating disorders, anxiety and depression. We all possess both forms of perfectionism, so the key is to avoid the negative consequences of unhealthy perfectionism, while letting healthy perfectionism take the lead. One way you can find a balance between healthy and unhealthy perfectionism is by prototyping. A prototype is a primary model of a product, which you can use to test an idea. The advantage of prototyping is that it’s fast and cheap, and therefore it’s a small bet that allows you to fail and learn quickly. Entrepreneurs call this “failing forward.” Prototyping is also a smart way to overcome writer’s block. For example, to conquer her fear of the blank page, author Anne Lamott writes “shitty first drafts” to get the ball rolling. This way, she gets something down on the page. She’s rarely happy with the results, but the next day she goes through the text, writes a new lead paragraph, a better ending, or adds improved descriptions. Following this, she rewrites the draft. Lamott holds that every great writer uses this method, allowing them to fail and learn quickly with impressive results. Aside from nurturing healthy perfectionism, we’ll see in the next blink how creative industries should play with a variety of concepts and ideas. How can you create fertile ground for new ideas and insights that might develop into a small bet? Try creating an environment where playing and improvisation are prioritized and encouraged – not just tolerated. We now know that a jovial, lighthearted environment often enables the improvisation that unleashes creativity and experimentation. For instance, Dr Charles Limb, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, ran a study on how improvisation affects the brain. In the study, musicians were placed in an MRI machine with a piano keyboard and were randomly asked to play structured music or to improvise a new melody. Interestingly, as the musicians changed from playing structured music to jazz, the region of the brain connected with evaluating and censoring became deactivated. So when this area was switched off, the musicians could come up with off-the-cuff melodies. Creativity flourished when the brakes were removed. Improvisation has another benefit – it’s great at beating the side effects of unhealthy perfectionism such as fear and doubt. One improvisational way to cultivate innovation is known as “accept every offer.” Say that you’re performing on stage and improvising a skit, and your fellow performer makes the first suggestion, like “Let’s go get an ice cream!” A performer well-versed in improv will accept the offer by agreeing and adding another suggestion, such as, “Yes, and let’s go to the park afterward.” So rather than suppressing both yourself and your thought process for new plans with a “No, but . . .” response, do as the improvisers do and say “Yes, and . . .” It can work wonders for new ideas. Though it sounds like a blatant contradiction, limitation can assist your creativity. You can actually use constraints to limit the breadth of your project and pinpoint problems that need to be tackled. If you present yourself with too many opportunities and possibilities when an idea is in its early stages, you can cause self-doubt and stress. This is why constraints are so beneficial: placing boundaries around projects reduces the fear of indecision and encourages innovative ways of approaching a problem. Take architect Frank Gehry’s approach to the acoustics of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. The challenge was to collate the recommendations and requests of the city, and to design a hall that looked less ordinary than others, without impairing the quality of its acoustics. Taking note of all this, Gehry decided to do away with the standard shoebox concert hall design and conceive an incredibly acoustically sophisticated structure. He created a vineyard-like seating layout, where seats surrounded the stage and rose up in terraces, which also expanded the area through which sound could travel. Because of this cozy seating configuration, people referred to the hall as the “living room” of downtown Los Angeles. Gehry had allowed the acoustic limitations to lead him to an even more creative solution. But what if the scope of solutions is limitless? Well, then you can self-impose constraints. If a project is over-complex, break down larger problems into manageable steps that can be easily attained. For example, the game company Electronic Arts (EA) refers to this method as “smallifying.” Software teams at EA pare down tasks into small, workable units that can be addressed in under two weeks. This means that developers can’t go down unnecessary paths, and need to find creative ways to finish their tasks on time! Did you know that new insights stem as much from geographical and psychological places as they do from being playful and working around restrictions? Well, get ready to discover new territory and go beyond your comfort zone. Valuable insights and ideas are frequently buried beneath the surface. By venturing out into unfamiliar terrain and being attentive to what people “on the ground” are thinking, you’ll be far more open to new perspectives and ideas. You may even find solutions to problems you never knew you had! Useful insights can actually be gained from a worm’s eye view (as opposed to a bird’s eye view). One example of a worm’s eye view is the “embedded” journalist, such as a reporter linked to a military unit in the midst of a conflict. A great example that demonstrates the value of immersion for seeing previously unseen solutions is 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. In 1974, a severe famine wreaked havoc on India, and drove starving people into the main cities. At the time, Yunus was an economics professor at Chittagong University in Bangladesh. Unable to ignore his fellow citizens’ poverty, he decided to conduct some field research and get to the bottom of the problem. His team interviewed a woman who made bamboo stools. The problem was, she had to borrow money from a middleman to buy bamboo for each stool, leaving her with a meager profit. Yunus discovered that when people could access small loans at reasonable rates, they could lift themselves out of poverty. These little bets became what we now know as microloans. Microfinance was a success – in 1983 Yunus institutionalized lending money to the poor with fair interest rates and founded the Grameen (or “village”) Bank. We now know the benefits of delving into unknown environments, but what about a broad approach, such as interacting with people from different backgrounds, jobs and experiences? Successful entrepreneurs do this often. So what are the benefits of being around a large variety of people? One is that learning from people with different perspectives feeds creativity. For example, in his book The Medici Effect, author Frans Johansson draws on substantial psychological research showing how the collaboration between diverse and talented groups of people is more likely to produce innovative results than the solo efforts of one individual. The wealthy Medici family put this into practice hundreds of years ago in Italy. They brought together a wide range of creative minds, including Leonardo da Vinci, from across Europe to cooperate and exchange ideas. The Medici’s patronage is believed to have been the catalyst for the Renaissance. Another thing you can do to benefit from others’ reactions is to test your ideas and products with extreme users or early adopters. These are the fans who can predict the needs of the masses and act as movers and shakers. Average users don’t think about solving problems, but extreme users do. They analyze your product carefully and can provide worthwhile insights and solutions for further development. After feedback from extreme users, the idea can be tested with the masses and introduced to a wider market. The multinational conglomerate 3M Company, for instance, discovered in the mid-1990s that collaborating with its most frequent individual users to develop new products was highly advantageous for the company’s growth. One study on Hewlett Packard in 2002 even found that singling out active customers and working with them to develop new ideas generated an average of $146 million after five years. Now that you have some tools for nurturing creativity, how do you keep moving forward? The trick is to use incremental successes or “small wins” to assess how much progress you’ve made toward your goal. The psychologist Karl Weick’s definition of a small win is a “concrete, complete, implemented outcome of moderate importance.” These small wins provide us with the signs and guidance we need to proceed in an alternative way. They’re the little gains you get as you’re working on your project or product. Maybe you couldn’t build the prototype exactly the way you wanted, but perhaps you were able to source the rare parts you needed despite that. Small wins can function as landmarks to success or indicate a point of return. As landmarks, they reassure you that you’re heading in the right direction, while points of return inform you that you should alter your path. For a fantastic example of this, see Pixar’s emergence as a film company. Pixar started out making special effects and hardware for George Lucas’ Lucasfilm, but was losing money, selling a mere 120 units of its Pixar Image Computer. But when Steve Jobs bought the company in 1986, he saw potential in the team that created animated films to promote the computer. Tin Toy was Pixar’s first short animated film and it was a small win that encouraged Jobs to let lead executives Ed Catmull and John Lasseter expand the role of the company’s animation division. The short film went on to win an Academy Award in 1988 for best animated short, and later, Jobs decided to steer Pixar further toward digital animation. Then, in 1991, Disney partnered with Pixar to release the hugely successful Toy Story (based on Tin Toy), which shot Pixar to international fame. It’s clear that small wins act as fuel for larger projects and can combat frustration. In addition, they also signpost new directions, as we saw with Pixar. The key message in this book: You can use the little bets approach to make rapid progress in your projects. By taking these mini steps, you’ll boost your creativity, act more often, embrace uncertainty and take risks. Taking little bets will allow you to reap the benefits of failing quickly and learning fast. Actionable advice: Set constraints on your project. When you’re feeling swamped by a mammoth project, try imposing some constraints. For example, try limiting your resources or taking some smaller tasks and setting a deadline of a few days to complete them. These limitations can help propel you forward.

Well, their successes were the result of pursuing loonshots – ideas that seem downright crazy right up to the moment it becomes unthinkable that anyone ever did things differently. But here’s the thing: for every world-changing idea, there are dozens – if not hundreds or thousands – that don’t pan out. As Thomas Edison once put it, progress is measured in failures: each defeat rules out one possibility and brings you that much closer to the solution. On the one hand, that makes experimentation vital. On the other, it means that real progress is expensive, time-consuming and ultimately risky. Those three words fill every risk-averse, efficiency-maximizing organization with an eye for the bottom line with dread. That’s why they often end up missing out on the next big thing. So what’s the answer? Well, as you’ll learn from the examples in these blinks, there is a way to balance innovation and what the author, Safi Bahcall, calls franchising – keeping the already successful parts of an organization ticking over. The secret is to separate the two activities and provide a sheltered, protective space for creatives to work on their ideas. Think of it as a loonshot nursery. So read on to learn how the most successful organizations do that, and why the US military took a pass on an early radar prototype; how even proven innovators can end up in blind alleys; and what loonshots can tell us about the history of the West. Innovation takes time, money and work. The greatest ideas fail a thousand times before they succeed. But here’s the rub: organizations often get cold feet before path-breaking projects ever get off the ground. What could have been the next great thing ends up as little more than a pipe dream. In other words, they fail at nurturing loonshots – ideas that seem positively unhinged right up to the moment they turn the world on its head. So what’s the right way to foster innovation? Well, it’s sometimes argued that it comes down to culture – the informal rules governing organizational life. There’s a problem with that explanation though: it’s wrong. Take Nokia. The Finnish multinational enjoyed a three-decade hot streak between the 1970s and the early 2000s. Its innovations included the world’s first cellular network, car phone, all-network analog phone and the GSM phone, making it one of Europe’s most profitable businesses. Experts attributed the company’s success to its culture. Magazines like Businessweek ran features on Nokia’s egalitarian ethos while the CEO put it down to the fact that employees were encouraged to have fun and think outside the box. Fast forward to 2004. Internally, nothing had changed. In fact, the engineers behind all those hits had just had another eureka moment: an internet-ready touchscreen phone with a state-of-the-art camera and an online app store to go with it. Nokia’s leadership shot the project down. Three years down the line, Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone. The rest is history. What went wrong? Well, Nokia’s structure had changed. That’s often part and parcel of growth. When organizations start out, employees have a high stake in success: if a small biotech firm produces a wonder drug, for example, everyone involved won’t just be incredibly rich – they’ll be heroes! Failure, on the other hand, means they’ll be out of a job. Perks like fancy titles and promotions don’t mean very much in such a free-flowing, high-stakes environment. As organizations grow, that changes. Those bonuses become ever more attractive, and individuals’ stakes in projects decrease. That breeds a conservative mind-set, and companies become franchise operations dedicated to protecting the parts of their businesses which are already successful. The outcome? Innovation falls by the wayside as decision makers come to view loonshots like Nokia’s proto-iPhone as intolerably risky. But that isn’t a law of nature – organizations can put structures in place that encourage innovation. Let’s see how. The Allies’ victory over Nazi Germany was a century-defining moment. But if there’d been prediction markets in 1939, the odds would’ve favored Hitler. Why? Well, the Allies lagged behind in what Winston Churchill called the “secret war” – the race to develop more effective weapons. That wasn’t because they didn’t possess the necessary know-how. In fact, the Americans held the key to winning the great aerial and naval battles of the future decades before they entered World War Two – they just didn’t know it. Unlike their Axis counterparts, who were developing a new generation of submarines and planes, they weren’t nurturing breakthroughs. Take radar. In 1922, two American radio scientists named Hoyt Taylor and Leo Young made a remarkable discovery: when a ship passes between a radio transmitter and a receiver, the strength of the radio signal doubles. Keep an eye on the strength of the signal you’re receiving, and any radio receiver will tell you an enemy ship is on the move. This had the potential to revolutionize naval warfare, and Taylor and Young told the US Navy about their findings. The answer? Silence! Eight years later, Young was still experimenting with radio signals. During a field test, he noticed that transmitting radio signals upward into the sky had the same effect: when they hit passing planes, the signal that returned to earth was doubled. Incredibly, that worked on planes at an altitude of up to 8,000 feet. Young wrote to the US military and asked for a $5,000 grant to pursue research into his prototype for an early warning system for enemy aircraft. It was denied. According to military planners, a project that couldn’t be expected to yield results for at least two or three years wasn’t worth their time or money. They did eventually thaw and took a gamble on Young’s loonshot, but the delay proved fatal. On December 7, 1941, the warning system was still being field-tested when 353 Japanese bombers launched a surprise attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii. Dozens of battleships and hundreds of planes were destroyed. All in all, 2,403 servicemen lost their lives. It was a shocking lesson in the dangers of complacency and the cost of failing to pursue innovation. As we’ll see in the next blink, few people took it to heart more than Vannevar Bush, the man who would pioneer a new approach to military planning. So what were military planners doing that was so important they couldn’t free up resources to pursue research into radar? Well, they were running a classic franchise organization: producing ever-greater quantities of tried-and-true conventional weaponry. Generals were convinced that tomorrow’s wars could be won with yesterday’s tools – infantry, guns and bayonets. That was an attitude the engineer Vannevar Bush had seen firsthand while working with the US Navy after the First World War. Nothing, he believed, was more damaging to the nation’s long-term interests. His answer? A military research department run by non-military men like himself and given free rein to explore the seemingly bizarre. After a meeting with President Roosevelt in June 1940, Bush got what he wanted: a new, civilian-led unit called the Office for Scientific Research and Development or OSRD for short. Bush’s stroke of genius was to recognize that he couldn’t change the military’s conservative culture, but he could change its structure. Establishing the OSRD as a separate department was a way to nurture loonshots while letting the generals get on with what they knew best: marshaling the ranks and fighting the good fight. And it worked. By the end of 1940, the OSRD had commissioned 19 industrial labs and 32 academic institutions to carry out research on its behalf. Even better, it had recruited an eccentric investment banker called Alfred Lee Loomis who dabbled in technological research. Loomis had heard about Germany’s worryingly advanced weapons development programs from exiled European scientists – among them Albert Einstein – who’d visited his private laboratory. When he got the call from Bush, he dropped everything and assembled a crack team of engineers and physicists to help the Allies catch up. Their goal? To develop a portable radar system using microwave, a radio wavelength that produces radar images so precise that they can be used to detect objects as small as submarine periscopes. That was valuable in solving one of America’s greatest logistical headaches in the war with Germany: keeping supplies flowing across the Atlantic. Allied convoy ships were regularly picked off by German submarines, with 4.3 million tons of cargo lost to sub attacks in 1941 alone. By 1943, 514,000 tons were being lost each month. But that number dropped decisively after microwave radar was deployed – just 22,000 tons per month were lost between March and June of that year. As the German Admiral Karl Dönitz admitted, Germany had “lost the Battle of the Atlantic.” Vannevar Bush rescued a large organization whose focus on its franchise operations and neglect of innovation had landed it in an existential crisis. But nurturing loonshots isn’t solely about winning wars – it’s as vital to success in business as it is on the battlefield. Take it from Theodore Vail, a boardroom pioneer who did for a struggling telecommunications giant what Bush would later do for the US military. But before we get to that, let’s rewind a little. In 1907, the financier JP Morgan bought the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, or AT&T. A direct descendant of the world’s first telephone company, AT&T had an illustrious past, but its future was less certain. The original patent for the telephone had expired, and thousands of competitors had eaten into its margins. Morgan hired Vail to turn things around. Vail hit the ground running, making the bold promise that Americans would soon be able to call anyone anywhere in the country. But long-distance calls faced a seemingly insurmountable obstacle: electric signals faded as they traveled down a line, and no one understood why. The electron had recently been discovered and the science that held the answer – quantum mechanics – was still in its infancy. It looked like Vail was setting himself up for an epic fall. Undeterred, Vail established a new department to pursue “fundamental research” and hired the MIT physicist Frank Jewett to head it up. Eight years later, AT&T astounded the world with a public demonstration of a call from its New York headquarters to San Francisco. But that was just the beginning. Over the next half century, Vail’s brainchild presided over a stunning run of breakthroughs. The transistor, solar cells, the Unix operating system and the C programming language, were all developed within AT&T. Along the way, the company’s researchers picked up eight Nobel prizes and made their employer one the most profitable corporations in the United States! And here’s where our stories intersect. When the two men met during the First World War, Jewett made a lasting impression on Bush. Once Bush had set up the OSRD, Jewett was one of his first recruits, and his experience would prove indispensable to the war effort. In the next blink, we’ll learn how the ideas of Bush and Vail complemented each other and provide a blueprint for other organizations. Innovators are often viewed as lonely geniuses single-handedly translating their brilliant visions into reality. In truth, innovators need someone to champion their work. Like careful gardeners, these loonshot enablers tend their plots to ensure the best ideas take root and thrive. Doing that, as both Bush and Vail realized, is all about applying a couple of basic principles – call them the Bush-Vail Rules. Here’s the first rule: shelter the people responsible for high-risk, early-stage ideas – the artists – from the soldiers responsible for managing the already successful parts of an organization. Embryonic ideas usually come covered in warts, and soldiers – like the military planners who dismissed radar – often struggle to look beyond these. They want products and projects ready for instant roll-out, and that means they’re likely to bury loonshots that don’t fit the bill. The result? Well, ask the film studios that passed on an incomprehensible screenplay called The Adventures of Luke Starkiller – the prototype of Star Wars, one of the most successful movie franchises of all time! That said, artists and soldiers are equally important – that’s rule two. It’s a lesson Apple learned the hard way. During his first stint at the company, Steve Jobs nicknamed the people working on the Mac “pirates.” Those working on the less glamorous Apple II home computer, on the other hand, were dismissed as “regular Navy.” Tensions between the two camps ended up tanking both products and costing Jobs his position. When he returned to Apple 12 years later, Jobs reevaluated his approach and supported both artists like Jony Ive, the designer behind the iPhone, and soldiers like Tim Cook, the architect of Apple’s return to financial health. Which brings us to rule three: act as an intermediary between artists and soldiers rather than trying to micromanage loonshot projects. Both Bush and Vail kept out of the technical details of the projects their departments pursued. They saw their role as managing the weakest link in the chain that leads to breakthroughs: the transfer from creators to users. Take aircraft radar, one of the OSRD’s great contributions to the war effort. When it was first adopted, pilots ignored it. The reason? Radar boxes were too complicated and fiddly to use in the middle of an aerial dogfight. When Bush heard that feedback, he demanded a redesign. The result was a much simpler display which pilots actually used. So far we’ve explored the importance of balancing innovation and franchise operations and the rules that effective loonshot nurturers have adopted to do just that. In this blink, we’ll take a closer look at two different types of loonshots in action: game-changing products and strategies. Let’s start with product-driven innovation. Few companies in American business history relied as heavily on cutting-edge products as Pan Am airlines. Founded by JT Trippe in the 1920s, Pan Am started out as a taxi service flying wealthy New York couples to Long Island. It was a popular route, but there was a problem: the repurposed World-War-One-era planes Trippe was using only seated one passenger. His solution? Import state-of-the-art French engines, move the fuel tanks to the outside of the fuselage and add another seat. It was the kind of tech-driven hack he’d repeat again and again. By the 1960s, Pan Am had launched the Jet Age – the beginning of our era of cheap mass aviation – and became the largest airline in the world. All of that was down to the early adoption of the latest products, especially new types of aircraft engine. In 1965, Pan Am signed the largest corporate deal in history and launched its fleet of Boeing 747s. Pan Am prospered – until disaster struck. In 1987, the US government deregulated the airline industry. For 50 years, the price of everything from seats to cocktails had been overseen by the central authorities. Now, the market set the rates. Pan Am was suddenly surrounded by competitors who could offer cheaper tickets and pay their workers much less than Pan Am’s pre-deregulation contracts required it to. Pan Am had the best jets, but no one wanted to fly in them. It was the beginning of the end. In 1991, the company went bust. Other airlines prospered in the new business environment. Their secret? Well, take American Airlines. Rather than focusing on glamorous new products, it concentrated on strategic innovation. Shortly after deregulation, it introduced America’s first two-tier pay system. Employees hired before 1978 retained their old salaries while later hires entered the lower-pay “B scale.” Those savings allowed American Airlines to buy new planes, expand the company, create new jobs and keep skeptical unions onside. It was a canny move: by lowering average labor costs, American leveraged the benefits of being a large company and closed the gap on start-ups with smaller overheads but more limited reach. We’ve discussed a couple of reasons organizations miss loonshots, but there’s one culprit we haven’t gotten to yet: overweening leaders who champion their favored loonshots come hell or high water. Call it the Moses Trap – the reliance on holy leaders. Let’s take a look at one of the most innovative companies of the twentieth century to see how it works. Established in 1937 by Edwin Land, the consumer electronics giant Polaroid was responsible for a breathtaking series of advances in photography. Over 30 years, Polaroid pioneered sepia and black-and-white prints, automatic exposure, instant color printing, the SX-70 all-in-one foldable camera and sonar autofocus. But in 1977, Polaroid took a wrong turn when Land presented the Polavision camera. It was a technological masterpiece. Weighing less than most hardcover books, it could process beautifully rendered, high-detail three-minute film negatives in 90 seconds. The press hailed it as Land’s crowning achievement, and Polaroid began churning out hundreds of thousands of Polavisions. So why you haven’t heard of the Polavision? Well, consumers didn’t want it. To begin with, it was expensive: in 2018 dollars, the camera cost $2,500. The single-use film cassettes, meanwhile, came in at $30 a pop, making both regular videotapes and Super 8 film much cheaper. More importantly, digital cameras – the true product of the future – hit the market shortly after Polavision’s launch. So why did it take Polaroid until 1996 to produce its first digital camera, over a decade later than Sony, Canon and Nikon? Here’s the crazy thing: recently declassified US government documents show that Land knew all about the advantages of digital photography – in fact, he’d been instrumental in persuading President Nixon to adopt it for military purposes as early as 1971! Remember the Bush-Vail Rules? Land pretty much flouted them all. Soldiers just weren’t very important to him. And rather than creating a favorable climate for the best ideas to thrive and taking a back seat, he literally held the keys to the company’s research labs. Land’s decisions always took precedence over his team leaders’ calls. And what Land really loved was film, not cameras. When the Polavision project ended in failure, Land brought a visitor to the warehouse in which the cameras had ended up. Asked why he wanted to show anyone such a sad scene, Land replied that he wanted him to “see what hubris looks like.” So far we’ve looked at organizations’ internal structures. In this blink, we’ll zoom out and take a look at loonshot nurseries on a macroscale to see what we can learn about the context in which they operate. To get us started, let’s think back to that Luke Starkiller script. In a parallel timeline the Star Wars franchise wouldn’t have ever seen the light of day. So how did “Jedi,” “lightsaber” and “Sith” become household names? Here’s the short answer: Hollywood had more than one studio. Put differently: all the scriptwriters had to do to get Star Wars off the ground was keep asking until someone said yes. And that’s true of loonshots in general. As long as there’s another door to knock on, every crazy idea has a chance. That’s why the context outside an organization matters so much. The best example of that is the ultimate loonshot – the Scientific Revolution. That’s basically the idea that the world is governed by universal laws of nature which can be discovered through empirical observation and experiment. Today, that’s pretty much commonsensical, but for millennia, truth was determined by the say-so of rulers and religious authorities. That changed when we first figured out that the Earth and planets followed an elliptical orbit around the sun. That discovery is usually credited to a sixteenth-century Danish astronomer called Tycho Brahe and his assistant Johannes Kepler, the author of the 1609 book New Astronomy – the text that kickstarted the Scientific Revolution. But here’s the thing: a Chinese scholar called Shen Kuo had already reached the same conclusion almost half a century earlier! But as we know, China – once the world’s most advanced power – declined while the West went from strength to strength. Why? Well, context. Both Shen and Tycho fell out with their rulers when they asked for money to confirm their findings. Shen, however, lived in an empire with a single, all-powerful ruler; Tycho, by contrast, lived in a continent divided between hundreds of smaller, competing states. When Shen lost his backers, his ideas were quashed for good – the only studio in town had turned him down. Tycho meanwhile quickly found someone else willing to take a gamble on his loony ideas – King Rudolf II of Prague. That just goes to show how important it is to protect fragile ideas, create structures that nurture out-of-the-box thinking and leave artists to do their thing without excessive meddling. The key message in these blinks: Loonshots – ideas that seem too crazy ever to work but end up changing everything – make the difference between failure and success in both business and war. They can even determine the fates of nations. But risk-averse organizations often miss out on these great leaps forward because they’re so focused on immediate results that they overlook the importance of creating structures that encourage experimentation and innovation.

Richard Branson is certainly unique: an adventurous and fearless risk-taker, but with razor-sharp business acumen. This combination, wrought with imagination and determination, was his recipe for success, which came not without many failures and challenges along the way. In Losing My Virginity, Branson describes the many life events that shaped his character – his naivety, his sense of adventure and steely resolve – and led him to revolutionize the music and airline industries. If you tend to think of business as a tedious and dull endeavor, these blinks will change your mind. By immersing yourself in the stories of Branson’s exciting and unpredictable life, you will come to understand why choosing to not play by the rules can provide you with a massive advantage in business – and in life. Also in these blinks, you’ll learn how Branson flew into Baghdad to recapture British hostages from Saddam Hussein, just as the Gulf War broke out; how to buy an island for a fraction of the initial asking price; and how to balloon across the Pacific, after losing half your fuel on the first day. Born in 1950 to a family with an independent spirit, Branson was, from a very young age, pushed by his family to test the limits of possibility. As a result, young Branson developed a taste for adventure, eagerly rising to the challenges that his mother, or life in general, presented to him. When he was only eleven years old, his mother sent him to visit relatives who lived more than fifty miles away – on a bike and without directions. This was meant to teach him stamina and orientation. And, when finally he returned to his family home the following day, instead of a hero’s welcome he was greeted simply with the instruction to go to the vicar’s house to chop some logs. But this wasn’t the first time his family had set him an arduous challenge. On a fortnight’s family holiday in Devon, when Branson was just four years old, his aunt bet him ten shillings that he couldn’t learn to swim by the end of their holiday. Rising to the challenge, he spent hours upon hours in the sea. Unfortunately, by the time the final day arrived, he still couldn’t manage to keep on top of the waves. But, to him, this was far from the end of the matter. When he spotted a river during the twelve-hour car journey home, he seized the opportunity and asked his father to stop the car. Springing from the car, he tore his clothes off, raced toward the riverbank and, as soon as he reached the water’s edge, jumped in. He immediately began to sink. Gradually, however, by kicking slowly and regularly, he managed to push himself to the surface. As he made his way to the middle of the current, he saw that his family was clapping and cheering, and that his aunt was waving a ten shilling note. When Branson emerged from the water, his father gave him a big hug, himself dripping wet. Seeing his son dive headfirst in the stream had greatly unnerved him, so much so that he had jumped in after him. Failing to achieve academic recognition in university – due partly to his independent attitude, and partly to his dyslexia – Branson began looking for alternative occupations. He and fellow student Jonny Gems founded the magazine, Student. Initially intended as an outlet for criticisms of their school, it quickly turned into a celebration of pop student culture and contemporary issues. But getting the magazine off the ground was not without its problems. One of the biggest difficulties Branson and Jonny faced was finding the money to publish Student – which meant finding advertisers for a magazine which didn’t exist yet. Even though most of the companies Branson approached were reluctant, he ultimately did find an effective way to hook them in: In an attempt to get National Westminster Bank to buy ad space, he told them that Lloyds Bank had just taken out an advertisement. Wouldn’t they like to advertise alongside Lloyds? The strategy was successful, and soon they received their first check for £250. Working on Student quickly gained priority over schoolwork, so Branson and Jonny left Stowe and moved into a London basement. There they edited and distributed their magazine, cramming increasing numbers of fellow students into one tiny room to help them with the workload. Despite Branson’s dyslexia – the root of his academic struggle, and the reason his grades were usually at bottom of the class – he put more time and effort into editing and writing articles for the magazine than into any of his coursework. Ambitious as ever, he and Jonny wanted to report on international events, like the wars in Biafra and Vietnam. So they asked the Daily Mirror whether they would be interested in the story of a young reporter going to Vietnam. Indeed they were: the Mirror bought the story and Student was able to send one of their staff, making a similar arrangement for Biafra. However, despite its political interests, the key element of Student was its involvement in the music scene – be it exclusive interviews with Keith Richards, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, or reports on club events and concerts. Due to his insight in the music scene, Branson realized people were very excited about records, and noticed their distribution via record shops went unrivalled. Simply because there was no alternative, people who’d never spend 40 shillings on a meal would gladly pay that same amount for a new Beatles record at a large record store. But Branson had an alternative in mind. He saw that a mail-order system would be popular with people his own age, who’d prefer to order records by mail at a lower price, than at retail price at a big store like WH Smiths. He discussed his idea with the Student staff, and they decided the new venture would need a new name. It should have a broad appeal, beyond the student population, and should be eye catching. After considering several names, one of the staff suggested “Virgin,” as they were all complete virgins at business. And so Virgin Mail Order was born. In the last issue of Student, Branson placed an ad for record mail-order, bringing in more inquiries and cash than they had ever seen before. But the sweetest part of their venture was that the company received the money for orders in advance, which provided the capital to buy records. Because of this, they were able to build up a large balance rather than have to wait for the money to come in. Branson brought on his childhood friend and Student co-contributor Nik as accountant, and together they determined where they’d buy the records from and how they’d send them to customers. They decided that, by making a deal with a local record shop that could obtain records directly from the record companies, the Virgin team would be able to sell records at a discount. Throughout the 1970s, Virgin Mail Order flourished. Then a potential disaster struck: in January 1971, the Post Office went on strike, which meant that Virgin customers were unable to send checks and couldn’t receive records. In 1971, the record departments of large retail stores were dominated by a bland interior and almost zero excitement for what was going on in rock music. When the postal strike occurred, Virgin was impelled to set up their own record store. They wanted it to be an extension of what they’d established with Student: a place where customers were not merely encouraged to buy a record and leave, but a welcoming place where they could exchange views on their interests. Noticing that a shoe store in Oxford Street had a staircase leading to an empty first floor, they struck a deal with the owner to set up their shop there. However, there was no way they could pay the rent. With typical charm and sharp business sense, Branson talked the shop owner into letting them use it for free, emphasizing the number of potential customers who would have to pass through his shop as well. The first Virgin store proved to be a huge success – so much so that Branson and Co. decided to shift their focus to opening more stores. Meanwhile, they would keep the mail order intact, ready to resume business as soon as the postal strike was over. By Christmas 1972, Virgin had expanded to fourteen record stores, all over England. Their lifestyle concept was such a success that the balance between maintaining the atmosphere they desired and keeping it profitable tipped towards the former. In other words, their stores were crowded but no one was actually buying anything: their atmosphere was so relaxed that Virgin stores had become a place to hang out. To rectify this situation, they installed brighter lights and moved the counters and cash register nearer to the window so as to inform people that they were entering a shop, not a club. The strategy worked: after a couple of months, sales recovered. Soon, Branson figured out that there were even greater profits to be made in running a recording studio and record label. He also noticed that most studios did business in a very formal way. They operated with strictly appointed time slots, overbooked rooms and few musical instruments. Such formality was too strict for the wild and spirited pop and rock culture that had begun in the 1960s. So, in 1971, at just 21, he started looking to buy a country house he could convert into a recording studio, imagining this to be the most conducive and attractive environment for bands to come and record. After searching for weeks, he eventually found a beautiful seventeenth-century manor, replete with iron gates, and set in the fairy-tale countryside. However, there was the matter of the asking price. This property was going for £30,000 – nearly half a million pounds in today’s terms – far more than he had. Sure, his other ventures were going well, but Virgin was not making that kind of profit. After investigating the sales figures of Virgin Mail Order and Virgin Music Store, though, the British bank Coutts made the astounding offer of a £20,000 mortgage. His aunt re-mortgaged her house to lend him £7,500, and he was able to transfer the full amount to the estate agent to secure the sale. In addition to the studio, he founded the music label Virgin Records. Having a label integrated with the Virgin group allowed them to sign their own artists, offer them a place to record (and charge them for it), publish and release their records (and make profit on them) and promote and sell their records through their own chain of music shops (and make the retail profit margin as well). The first artist they signed was Mike Oldfield. Oldfield recorded Tubular Bells at the Virgin Manor throughout 1972 and 1973, a record that eventually sold over thirteen million copies, making Branson’s company successful beyond his wildest dreams. In 1976, Virgin was headed towards trouble: aside from Mike Oldfield, all of the label’s acts had lost it money. But the mid-1970s was the high point of punk in the UK, and Virgin was desperate to sign one of the new bands. Eventually, in May 1977, Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, signed the band to Virgin, hoping to be quickly dropped from their contract due to indecent behavior, as they had done with EMI and A&M before. Virgin closed the deal just in time to release the song “God Save The Queen” for Queen Elizabeth’s 25th anniversary as queen, when the Sex Pistols staged a concert in front of House of Commons, resulting in massive publicity and the arrest of McLaren. However, since Virgin didn’t have any shareholders to protest their actions, McLaren’s hopes of being dropped by the label were dashed. In 1977, the Sex Pistol’s album “Never Mind The Bollocks, Here’s The Sex Pistols” was released and widely advertised in Virgin store windows throughout the UK. A Nottingham store manager was arrested due to the public use of the word “bollocks.” Furthermore, the police were also threatening to injunct the album. Branson needed to take action. He brought in linguist James Kinsley for the court case, who went on record explaining that “bollocks” did not refer to “testicles”; rather, it was a nickname for priests. Kinsley went on to argue that, surely, not even the church would be offended by a title that meant “Never mind the priests, here’s the Sex Pistols.” Then the prosecutor asked him why he was so certain that the church wouldn’t be offended by such a title. Kinsley simply folded down the collar of his polo neck shirt, revealing a clerical collar. Branson had truly lucked out: as his witness, he’d managed to find a linguist who was also a reverend. The case was dismissed. In 1978, Branson was in New York, as he wanted to be close to Joan, his future wife, who was in the process of splitting up with her husband in New York. After the divorce was finalized, Branson was asked whether he had named his company after the Virgin Islands. Although that wasn’t the case, it certainly seemed like the perfect getaway for the pair. He had heard that if one expressed genuine interest in purchasing an island, a local estate agent would put you up in a villa and provide a helicopter to fly around the islands. So, he contacted an estate agent and mentioned that he was searching for a place for Virgin Music’s artists to relax and record. Joan and Branson flew to the Islands, where they were put up by the agent and were shown one of the most remote and beautiful islands – Necker Island. Although initially he had no intention of buying it, he asked for the price. It was a staggering £3 million. With nothing to lose, he made an offer of £150,000, which got the couple thrown out of the villa. Back in London, he learned that the owner of Necker Island, a British lord, needed to make a quick sale in order to finance another building, which would cost him £200,000. So Branson upped his offer to £175,000 and the agreement was – incredibly – settled at £180,000. From trying to bag himself a free holiday, Branson ended up buying an island for a fraction of its asking price. But the purchase wasn’t the trip’s only result; it was on the Virgin Islands that Branson set up his next venture: Virgin Airways. When his flight back to Puerto Rico was cancelled, he simply chartered a plane for $2000 and, on a blackboard, wrote: “Virgin Airways: $39 Single Flight To Puerto Rico.” Although having signed the Sex Pistols and several young New Wave bands got Virgin into new musical territory, it proved far from profitable. In 1980, Virgin Music was running at a £900,000 loss. Still, Branson gave the go ahead to keep signing new artists, such as Simple Minds, The Human League and Phil Collins, much to the dismay of the financial director who saw that Virgin was spending money it didn’t have on artists that weren’t known yet. The financial director left, selling his 40 percent share to Branson, making Branson owner of 100 percent of a company that seemed very close to going bust. What no one had expected, however, was the popularity of the Compact Disc. Due to its success, people started to buy albums on CD, even those they already owned on vinyl. Virgin was able to resell their back catalogue on compact discs, and Mike Oldfield’s first record, in particular, sold extremely well on CD, restoring Virgin’s cash balance. Additionally, Branson’s trust in his musical scout and advisor, Simon Draper, finally paid off, with almost all the bands he had brought in selling extremely well. For instance, The Human League’s third album, Dare, shot to number one on the British charts, selling one million copies in Britain and three million worldwide. Furthermore, the roster of young artists that Virgin had broke into the industry – artists that were absolute newcomers at signing – seemed endless: Phil Collins, Boy George and the Culture Club, Simple Minds, XTC or Heaven 17 all proved tremendously successful. Virgin had become the undisputed independent label, with more money rolling in than they’d ever expected: a £2 million profit in 1982 on sales of £50 million and a staggering £11 million profit in 1983. Having toyed with the name Virgin Airways in the late 70s, Branson was already keen on the idea of opening an airline. So in 1984, when a US lawyer named Randolph Fields called to inquire whether Branson would be interested in operating a transatlantic airline, he was ready for the challenge. His senior management opposed the idea, however Branson remained adamant, arguing that if they could lease just one airplane for one year, they would limit the amount of money they could lose, and could retreat from the project if it became unsuccessful. After two months of tough negotiations, Boeing finally agreed to lease Branson a Jumbo for one year. Nevertheless, there were flight permits to obtain, time slots to be fitted in, advertisements to create and a ticketing system to install. To get the permit, a test flight had to be made with an official on board. It was on that test flight that the plane – which was uninsured, due to the lack of a license – flew into a flock of birds. As a result, one of the engines exploded and the test flight was aborted. Yet again, Branson was in trouble. The first commercial flight was to be in two days time, but he still needed a license and an engine – which ended up costing him £600,000. After installing the new engine, acquiring the license and going on Virgin’s maiden voyage, Branson realized that the £600,000 had exceeded Virgin’s £3 million overdraft, which the bank was unwilling to extend. Virgin was teetering on the brink of insolvency. To escape this fate, Branson collected as much money as possible from his overseas stores. It was enough to keep Virgin Airways operating, and the airline soon became legitimate and successful, under the leadership of Branson, who had just turned thirty-three. In 1984, Ted Toleman was seeking a sponsor to cover the cost of a catamaran he was building to cross the Atlantic Ocean at a new record speed to recapture the Blue Riband Trophy for Britain. Branson was keen to sponsor, realising that being involved in a world-record Atlantic crossing would serve to attract attention to his transatlantic airline. With round-the-world yachtsman Chay Blyth already on the team, Toleman and Branson started in New York and set off for England to beat the current record, which had been set at three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes. But after three days at sea and with just 60 miles left to go, they were hit by a storm, which split open the hull of the catamaran, causing the Virgin Challenger to sink. The crew retreated to a life raft, and was eventually rescued by a cruise ship. Surprisingly, it was on this boat that Branson also first saw his newborn son – one of the passengers had a copy of the Evening Standard which had covered the birth of the billionaire’s baby. Determined to win the Blue Riband, Chay and Branson decided they should build a single-hulled boat rather than a catamaran. This became the Virgin Atlantic Challenger II, which left New York in 1986 in a second attempt at the trophy. However, yet another mishap occurred when the filters for the fuel pump became clogged, choking the engine. Moreover, they would need to be replaced every couple of hours. Because of this setback, there was no chance they would reach England in time to beat the current world record. Cunning as ever, Branson reached out to Downing Street and spoke to the right people: an RAF plane was then allowed to pick up new filters and drop them on board. With new filters, they were able to keep the engines running, finishing their journey in three days, 8 hours and 31 minutes – setting the new world record for the 3000-mile voyage. In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. This left the world in a tailspin and doubled the price of aviation fuel, from 75 cents to $1.50 a gallon. As Branson was about to take his children to school, his phone rang. It was Queen Noor of Jordan, whom Branson had met and befriended during one of his earlier adventures. Over 150,000 refugees had fled from Iraq to Jordan, with neither blankets nor a water supply. And though the Red Cross was setting up water distribution, the government of Jordan still required around 100,000 blankets to prevent a catastrophe. Branson and his staff tried to figure out the logistics of locating and then flying 100,000 blankets to Jordan. By contacting the Red Cross, the Foreign Office and the Overseas Development Office, they were able to gather 30,000 blankets, with still more to come from UNICEF. Additionally, Sainsbury’s (British supermarket chain) offered to donate several tons of rice. As for how to fly these supplies to Jordan, Branson and crew decided to remove all the seats from a Boeing 747 and load the plane with over 40,000 blankets, medical supplies and tons of rice. Also, on their way back to the UK, they picked up British nationals who were stranded in Jordan. But there were still a number of British nationals detained in Baghdad who had now been taken hostage. Branson called upon his friendship with the King of Jordan – this time to negotiate a deal with Saddam Hussein: in exchange for medical supplies, Hussein should release all children, women and sick men. So, on October 23rd, Branson and a volunteer Virgin crew set off for Baghdad, entering the world’s most dangerous airspace on a commercial plane. They arrived safely and were allowed to take most of the hostages with them. Yet they were forced to leave the men behind at the airport, which was devastated only a few weeks later. Crossing the Pacific by hot-air balloon was an attractive challenge to Branson. He had attempted it once before, with Per Lindstrand in 1989, but their balloon fell apart just before lift off. In January 1990, they met in Japan for a second attempt to cross the Pacific, by flying a hot-air balloon into the 200 MPH jet stream. Their goal was to arrive in California within two days and thereby secure the world record for fastest speed, and for being the first to cross the Pacific in a balloon. Seven hours into the journey, it was time to drop one of the empty fuel tanks in order to jettison weight and fly faster. However, due to a mechanical failure, they dropped not just the empty tank, but two full fuel tanks as well. They now had just half the fuel required to cross 6000 miles. If that weren’t bad enough, they lost contact with their control center, just after hearing of a frightening storm below. They were left unable to communicate their route with the outside world. Fortunately, they managed to stay in the jet stream which carried them at 170 miles per hour. Unfortunately, a propane leak caused the capsule to catch fire. Reacting swiftly, Lindstrand and Branson took the balloon up to 40,000 feet, where the lack of oxygen would extinguish the fire. After the fire was out, their radio began to function again, restoring contact with the control center. What they heard, however, was bad news: the jet stream had pivoted and would blow them back to Japan unless they came down to 18,000 feet, where another stream was heading north, towards the Arctic. After almost 48 hours, they landed in Canada – 3000 miles away from their original destination – having flown their balloon further and at a faster average speed than anyone ever before. In the 1990s, Branson was enjoying unrivalled success, but his success in the aviation industry wasn’t greatly appreciated by British Airways – the traditional British carrier – who started several campaigns to put him out of business. They had even put together a team whose sole purpose was to undermine Branson and Co. Not only did BA contact Virgin customers, offering them cheaper flights, claiming that Virgin’s flights were overbooked or cancelled, but they also hacked into the Virgin database to gain access to their booking information. Additionally, they contracted several private detectives and public relations representatives to investigate Branson, his family and his company, in order to discredit his image. For example, after seeing a TV documentary on the feud between BA and Virgin, a Virgin customer contacted Branson’s office, reporting that she’d received a number of calls by people claiming to work for Virgin. They’d called to inform her that she’d been bounced off her flight, and asked her whether she would like to take the Concorde on the following day instead. BA denied any involvement. Even with this information and several former BA-employees willing to testify, the officials responsible for viable competition between airlines refused to see a dirty tricks campaign. They decided that Branson’s claims were unfounded. It was only when Branson and his team were given a hard drive containing all the logs and conversations between top BA executives – revealing that, indeed, senior management had made a decision to discredit Virgin – that Branson and his lawyers felt confident enough to take BA to court. With such damning evidence in Branson’s hand, BA abruptly changed their strategy, from denial to settlement. Setting a record for the highest, uncontested libel payment, BA had to pay £500,000 to Branson and £110,000 to Virgin Atlantic as compensation for personal and corporate libel. Moreover, they had to make a public apology and admission of guilt. The key message in this book: You can have fun while making a fortune, if only you’re bold enough to rise to every challenge and audacious enough to conquer every obstacle in your way.

Glei","summary":"It seems like there has never been a better time to be a creative. The explosion of the internet has provided opportunities for people to turn their skills and knowledge into business opportunities. Yet despite this chance, most of us have no idea how to start turning our passions into viable, profitable businesses. These blinks, inspired by the opinions of luminaries such as Seth Godin, Chris Guillebeau and Warren Burger, show how anyone with the right drive and skills can become a great entrepreneur. In these blinks you’ll discover why every email you write at work should be available to the whole team; and why the perfect leader is a servant. Though it might sound strange, many start-ups and entrepreneurs struggle to answer a simple question: “Why does your business exist?” Many point to their product’s awesome features, or talk about how their service is cheaper than the competition. Yet these replies don’t answer the question. Regardless of what you offer or how it bests the competition, you will never be successful unless you can answer this simple question. Why? Because the answer outlines your purpose. Every successful business has at its core a purpose which aims to make society a better place and which its products and services aim to embody. No matter how many features your product may have, if it doesn’t solve someone’s problem, it can’t succeed. So, before you even begin your business venture, you need to figure out your purpose: How do you hope to benefit the world with your product or service? Nike, for example, is famous for its innovations, connections with sports stars and cool image. Yet behind all this lies a purpose: to help people reach their athletic potential. As your business develops you will need to constantly ensure that your actions align with your purpose. One good way to do this is by always asking “why.” For example, whenever you want to add something to your product or service, ask: “Why does this matter?” Why, for example, would you want to add a voice command function to your kettle? Answers like “because it’s cool” or “no one else has it” are unacceptable, since they don’t relate to your purpose. On the other hand, if you are trying to solve a problem for arthritic customers who want to make a cup of tea, then your development has a clear purpose and you have a reason to proceed. While your purpose is fundamental to your success in business, it’s not the only piece of the puzzle. You’ll also have to develop your business in a way that actually moves you closer to achieving that purpose. The best way to do this is by developing a flexible operating system. Indeed, many visionary companies, including Facebook, Airbnb and Dropbox, have adopted a Responsive Operating System (OS). An OS is a company’s DNA; it is the method by which they get things done. A Responsive OS means that flexibility and a tolerance for risk are ingrained in a company’s practice. A Responsive OS enables an enterprise to more easily take risks – and learn from them. In a more traditional OS, companies develop the practice of limiting their risk as they grow. In other words, they want to maintain their position rather than innovate. Responsive OS companies take the opposite approach. Their strategy revolves around constantly looking for opportunities to take chances and learn from the results. For example, a Responsive OS company will launch a new product or service if they see a promising opening in the market, even if it’s unclear whether it will succeed. If it succeeds the company gains a market advantage; if it fails, at least they’ve learned which area not to explore in the future. In order to pursue innovation, Responsive OS companies utilize a much leaner, more reactive structure that allows room for change. Traditional companies often acquire large amounts of assets and resources as they grow, making them both sluggish and resistant to change. Responsive OS enterprises, on the other hand, focus on being as lean as possible. This offers them a high degree of flexibility to experiment and make changes. Many responsive companies follow the “two pizza rule” for meetings and projects: only teams which can be comfortably fed with two pizzas are allowed, thus keeping them small enough to make quick decisions. When we think of creative genius and entrepreneurship, we often imagine prolific inventors who are able to come up with huge numbers of novel innovations. However, when it comes to business success, you don’t need lots of good ideas and products. You really only need one. In fact, trying to develop too many things simultaneously will simply leave you with lots of half-finished projects, i.e., nearly there products. Instead, concentrate your efforts on creating just one great idea that people will love, and then developing it as far as you can. This is exactly the approach that successful men’s clothing company Bonobos took. Their story began when one of their co-founders realized that many men don’t feel comfortable in any of the range of pants styles offered in stores. So they created just one type of pants that fitted the way they liked in various colors and began selling them online. Their idea was a huge success: in six months they were generating a run rate of $1,000,000, and after another six months it had jumped to $2,000,000. Only after this initial success did they think about branching out to other wares. However, it’s not enough to simply create a great product, or even the best product. You still need to get people to take notice of it. One way to do this would be to have your product stand out in some way, just like a book cover entices you to read a book. You could also ensure that your product is simple to use and quick to understand. According to entrepreneur Scott Belsky, once you have a potential customer’s attention, you have less than 15 seconds to entice them to buy. It’s your job, then, to make the process from discovery to purchase as fast, simple and streamlined as possible. When you see a product in a store, how do you think that it was conceived? Did it come as a stroke of genius to someone in R&D, complete and in its finished form? Unlikely. In fact, all great products are the result of tweaking and development, not someone’s muse whispering in their ear. Your initial product, too, will nearly always be less than perfect. Luckily, you have plenty of opportunities to improve it through a process of experimentation and failure. Indeed, no matter how imperfect your initial product or idea may be, you have the chance to make it and test it, and solve any problems along the way. According to Sebastian Thrun, one of the masterminds behind Google Glass, developing a product is a bit like climbing a mountain that has never been scaled. Sure, you can study the maps and carefully plot a route, but since no one has successfully done what you’re setting out to do, the map will likely be useless. Instead, the only way is to try first hand: find a path, test its suitability and discover whether it’s passable. If it’s not, then you go back and try another. If it is, then you’re closer to your goal. But you don’t have to conduct these experiments by yourself. In fact, your customers can help you along the way. Giving customers access to your product in the early stages of development will provide you with accurate information about what works, what doesn’t and what you could do instead. For example, Jane ni Dhulchaointigh, the inventor of the moldable glue Sugru, tested her initial product with users. She learned that they became confused by its physical consistency, and used her product like modeling clay instead. She discovered that in order to get customers to use the product correctly she would need to provide them with clear instructions. When a company releases a statement or an offer online, they often “hope” that it will go viral and win them lots of attention. However, the most successful companies do this not in hope, but in expectation. For example, when entrepreneur and author Chris Guillebeau posted a single blog entry asking for donations to his Clean Water for Ethiopia campaign, he was able to raise $22,000 in a single day, all without “going viral.” But how? Guillebeau had built an army of fans, who act as his supporters and cheerleaders. So how can you create this kind of following for your business? According to Guillebeau, one way to gain followers is to give them something that they want. This could be anything, really. TED, for example, gives its users free access to paid content. While you can pay to go to a TED event, presentations are put online shortly afterward for anyone to view. You could also provide a paid service to customers for free. For example, although she normally charges for her coaching sessions, Pamela Sim also offers monthly “Ask Pam Anything” sessions for her fans for free. If you don’t yet have a following, then it’s important to remember that every army starts small. In order to recruit your first users, you’ll need to go the extra mile. Although it runs against common business practice – in which everything you do should be scalable – going above and beyond for your first customers can help you form a large following of fanatic fans. For example, when Airbnb started, they had difficulty finding people willing to open up their houses to strangers. They simply couldn’t get people interested in the service. So the founders went out of their way to attract the first users: they held meet-ups, stayed with their first customers and listened intently to their views and concerns. This extra effort helped them start a community which continues to grow to this day. Do you know anyone who owns a coat made by the mountaineering clothing brand Patagonia? And have they ever been mountaineering in that coat? Probably not. How can this brand be so popular despite the fact that so few people use its products for their intended purpose? The answer lies in the stories they tell. Indeed, the most successful brands tell stories about themselves which relate to the views and beliefs of society. Patagonia tells a story which many people can relate to: as passionate environmentalists, they were among the first companies to give a percentage of their profits to charity and to create a line of goods made from recycled materials. This resonates with our will to be better people and create a better world. And of course, by positioning themselves as an “activity” company, Patagonia likewise appeals to our desire be fit, inquisitive and adventurous. Looking at the entirety of Patagonia’s messaging, you see a good story that matches up with our own aspirations and beliefs. By creating a unique, relatable story, any company can attract many more loyal followers. However, while you can create a good image through a story, modern media volatility makes controlling that image futile. You can merely try to influence it. No matter how well you craft your image, it can be ruined by one bad customer experience propagated on Twitter. All you can do is influence this situation by providing the best service you possibly can, e.g., by carefully training your customer-facing staff, providing customers with little extras, offering free postage and packaging, and so on. This way, you can mitigate any damage caused by the angry customer reviews that will inevitably crop up during the lifetime of your business. Imagine that every email you sent from your work account was automatically sent to everyone on your team. Surely this kind of invasion of privacy couldn’t lead to effective work. Right? Wrong. In fact, the social network managing service Buffer does exactly that, and they enjoy both a loyal team and remarkable successes. You see, making emails available to the entire team is just one aspect of their policy of total transparency. Everything the company does, from its metrics to its decision-making process, is fully available to everyone’s eyes. This works so well because transparency increases the amount of trust within a team. Indeed, your team’s ability to work happily together toward a shared goal is dependent on their ability to trust everyone else on the team. This trust comes from knowing that people are being honest and that everyone will be treated fairly. For example, if you discover over lunch that your new colleague is earning a higher salary than you, it’s a fair bet you’d feel cheated and undervalued. If this information isn’t openly shared, we end up feeling that the information was withheld on purpose. However, if the information is freely available, then we’re less likely to feel personally threatened by things like other people’s career accomplishments. Moreover, openness is essential for innovation. We all want our employees to embrace innovation and experimentation. This means giving them access to ideas so that they can tinker with them. If things like products or business strategies are kept secret, team members won’t get a chance to play with and develop them. In addition to driving innovation, transparency in product and process development also encourages feedback. When employees have the chance to look at everything, they can give you their honest opinions, which can offer you valuable insight into the direction and viability of your idea. Ask creatives if they’d like to be in a leadership position and most will say: “No way! I’d never want to give up my creative work just so I could boss people around. It’s just not me.” While this sentiment is common, it is due, in a large part, to a fundamental misunderstanding of what leadership actually involves. In reality, good management isn’t about bossing people around – it’s actually about serving them. Management’s goal isn’t to get people to do what you want them to, but rather to help them achieve something great. Let’s say your team is responsible for creating a brand new, revolutionary vacuum cleaner that will transform the market. You’ve got a wide range of talent on your team, from creative designers to efficient manufacturers, all the way to persuasive marketers. As a leader, it’s your job to help these diverse talents come together to achieve a common goal. In other words, your job is to help them reach their potential. It’s not enough, however, to simply wish to serve your team. Your ability to do that rests on your skill at communicating effectively. The modern working environment is a flexible one where people work across teams and projects. This makes it difficult for managers to keep everyone working to the same goal. As a manager, you’ll need some ways to maintain communication to keep things on track. In addition to your weekly meetings, you can create a public record of what everyone is doing. One way to do this is through a company-wide group forum where everybody can write down what they’ve been working on. Another way is by constantly and consistently repeating yourself. Even if you have to say something ten times a day, you will nonetheless ensure that the message gets through to everyone on the team. By following these tips, you can help your employees achieve their potential and move your business forward. The key message in this book: There is nothing to stop any creative in the modern world from turning their skills and passions into a successful business. As long as you concentrate on the four key principles of purpose, product, customers and leadership, you can transform your idea into a business opportunity.

You come up with a fantastic idea – one that could help your company save millions. The next day you take it to your bosses, who agree that it’s a superb idea. A project team is set up to turn it into reality. Yet, over the next few weeks, progress seems to go nowhere, no one can work out how to make the idea happen. So gradually everybody’s enthusiasm for the project dwindles, and within a month or so, it’s scrapped altogether, and the idea lost. This is a very common occurrence – many awesome ideas get lost at the execution stage. These blinks show you how to overcome this by using the right mind-set and organization to take your great ideas and turn them into reality. In these blinks you’ll discover why the news feed on your smartphone is ruining your life; how to work like best-selling author John Grisham; and why you shouldn’t hire by experience alone. Your company is gearing up to a sales pitch that will make or break it, and your boss asks you to prepare the presentation. Yet when you sit down in front of your computer . . . nothing. Your mind is blank, and you have no idea where to even begin. Have you ever been in a similar situation? It’s a horrible feeling! Luckily, there is a simple path that anyone can follow to make sure this never happens again. All your projects, no matter what they are, can be broken down into three main categories. First come the action steps, the specific tasks that must be done in order to realize the project. For your vital sales presentation, the action steps might be: “Create an outline for the presentation,” or “Ask my boss which product benefits I should focus on.” Next come references. These are pieces of related information that could prove useful for your project. For that important pitch, the references could be things like sales forecasts for your product, analysis of your market competitors or even the feedback you’ve received from previous pitches. Finally, you have backburner items, project-related ideas or action steps that aren’t immediately relevant but may become so in the future. Reworking and beautifying the slides of your presentation, for example, is a backburner item. Elegant slides and cool graphics are, of course, nice to have, but aren’t actually necessary. It could become an action step, but only if you have time. It’s important to separate the aspects of your project into these categories, as failure to do so will leave you stressed and distracted. If you don’t distill the vital from the trivial, then your mind will simply be too crammed full of thoughts to concentrate effectively. Imagine that a new market has suddenly opened up and your company wants to jump in. The trouble is, you have no product. So you organize a brainstorming session. You bring together the best and brightest minds in your company, and they voice and develop some seemingly excellent ideas. Yet when you get back to your desks, you realize that while the ideas are grand, none of them are actually achievable. How could this have happened? Often, ideas fail because the projects they represent aren’t geared toward action. One reason for this is that much of our work consists of rituals, such as meetings or brainstorming sessions. These are things that we do out of habit, but which don’t necessarily lead to results. Think, for example, of the weekly Monday-morning meeting designed to get everyone up-to-date. “Weekly” doesn’t mean “when something important happens.” It means “every week.” These meetings often end up being a complete waste of time. Think about it: How often do you leave a weekly meeting with something new to do? You can avoid this by always thinking in terms of action steps, and capturing those action steps whenever they come to mind. Imagine that you’re taking a shower and have a sudden realization: You had a meeting with a colleague two weeks ago on a project, and you haven’t followed up with her yet. As soon as you get out of the shower, write down “Follow up with X regarding Y” on your action list. Just make sure your hands are dry enough not to smear the ink! It’s important to capture these action steps, because they create momentum. Even the smallest action steps will make progress much easier, as you’ll be less likely to run into situations where you don’t know what to do next. Spectators at sporting events can often tell which team has the upper hand by asking a simple question: Who is acting – developing offensive moves and strategies – and who is simply reacting by trying to counter what the other team does, while being unable to act positively themselves? Now, think about your job: Are you winning or losing? Unfortunately, most of our time is spent simply reacting to the constant deluge of information and requests from others. This has only become worse in today’s world, where sending messages and sharing information is so much easier. If you had to send a message 100 years ago, you probably would have had to send a letter. Both the preparation and the delivery of the letter took a considerable amount of time, so it just wasn’t worth the effort for smaller issues. These were issues that you’d almost assuredly sort out yourself. However, with email and social networks you can broadcast messages instantly, thereby reducing the cost of sending your message and increasing the number of messages and requests that you send. This constant barrage of messages can lead to a state of reactionary work flow, in which most of our energy is squandered reacting instead of acting. As you’ve seen, you need an organized approach toward projects in order to get things done efficiently, and a reactionary work flow directly impedes this process of organization. Think of it like a swim in the ocean: If you’re preoccupied with trying not to drown, then you’re less capable of choosing a direction in which to swim (preferably toward land). In the same way, we’re less able to prioritize tasks and separate information into those three vital categories. Luckily, you can combat this disorganization by taking only an hour out of your evening to devote to processing time, during which you sort every request and new bit of information into one of the three categories. People think that great innovations such as Edison’s light bulb resulted from a stroke of genius. They think great minds miraculously come up with revolutionary ideas and – ta da! – the world suddenly changes. These people could use a reality check. However great an idea might be, it’s always in danger of abandonment. Ideas provide us with high energy and commitment – but it simply doesn’t last. Once we realize the amount of work required to turn an idea into reality, we easily become demotivated and disinterested. This point is called the project plateau, the time during which we abandon our idea in favor of a fresh, new, exciting one. Thankfully, there are methods we can use to ensure that we don’t succumb to project plateau by using our energy more efficiently. For starters, we can strive to make the most from our initial energy after generating a good idea. IDEO, the product innovation company that designed Apple’s first mouse, encourages its designers to try out ideas without overthinking them. When they come up with new ideas, they don’t spend all their time refining them or brainstorming. Instead, they take their ideas directly to “The Shop,” a multi-million-dollar department that rapidly turns their ideas into prototypes. What’s more, you can adopt working routines that are highly energy efficient and thus essential to overcoming the project plateau phase. Indeed, a fixed routine helps us to sit down to do the work, rather than wasting our limited energy. Best-selling author John Grisham, for example, used rituals that he admitted were “silly and brutal but very important.” He would start every day at 5:00 a.m. with a shower, after which he would go to his office, drink a cup of coffee and start writing at 5:30 a.m., making sure he wrote at least one page per day, no matter how much time it took. So far, you’ve learned some of the tricks you can use to realize your ideas. In the following blinks, we’ll look at how your community can affect your creative productivity. We’ve all heard the names Holmes and Watson, Starsky and Hutch, or Pinky and the Brain. Fiction is full of partnerships between people with little or nothing in common, who are nonetheless remarkably successful. These odd couples aren’t just the work of fiction. In fact, there are good reasons why people with different personalities can become extraordinarily successful when they put their minds together, and this is no less true in the creative industry. When it comes to project realization, there are three distinct types of people: Dreamers are highly creative, and are constantly coming up with new and sometimes wacky ideas. Their amazing innovation comes with a huge downside, however. They always want to start something new and exciting, so have difficulty seeing things through to the end. Doers are pragmatists who focus on feasibility and execution. They’re the ones who make sure ideas make it all the way from conception to completion. They bring a healthy skepticism to their projects and always emphasize what is necessary to finish them. Incrementalists can switch between both roles, being creative when it suits them, but also focusing on execution when they need to. However, this often results in them starting more projects than they can finish, which prevents them from achieving extraordinary successes. As you can see, these types can all have trouble working solo. However, by partnering with their complements or with an incrementalist, they can be very successful. All three types of people were represented within the leadership team at Apple. Chief Designer Jonathan Ive is a dreamer who kept the great designs coming in. Steve Jobs was an incrementalist, not only providing Apple with visionary ideas, but also ensuring that they became reality. Finally, it was Chief Operations Officer Tim Cook, the doer, who ensured that the products were turned into a profitable business. The perfect mix of all three led to one of the most innovative companies of all time. When you have great ideas that seem to have huge potential, do you hug them to you or share them freely? Often, we’re too afraid that someone might steal our breakthroughs, so don’t share them with anyone outside our intimate circle. However, this is totally backward! As you’ve seen, people have a hard time making their own great idea a reality, much less other people’s. Moreover, discussing ideas with others provides us with the important feedback we need to help us proceed and succeed with our ideas. For example, you can often tell how promising your idea is by how many people are willing to join in, which of course you can only measure by openly sharing your idea. That’s why, when Wired magazine’s Editor in Chief Chris Anderson came up with the idea of “Geek Dads” (a blog targeting nerdy, tech-obsessed fathers), he immediately shared the idea on his own blog. Anderson’s reasoning was that if the project didn’t attract a viable team within six weeks, he would simply drop it. Luckily, his idea received enthusiastic responses from readers, and was successful upon launch. Sharing also allows for feedback in the form of criticism. By presenting your ideas to people who have different points of view, you have the opportunity to see problems or opportunities that you couldn’t otherwise find on your own. In addition, sharing our ideas puts pressure on us to complete them ourselves. When we tell people about our great ideas, they will often follow up with us to see how things are coming along, and we thus become accountable for progress. This concept of accountability is behind the prize that’s awarded at the annual TED Conference. Each competitor must give a presentation on their “one wish to change the world,” but before every presentation, a video about the progress made by the previous winner is shown. In this way, prize winners become more accountable for making change happen. But no good team is complete without the right kind of leader. The next few blinks will look at what qualities characterize the best creative leaders. In our previous blinks, we discussed several ways to deal with the project plateau. It starts early – when you’re assembling your project team. When hiring people for a creative team, it’s best to choose initiative over experience. We’ve already seen the dangers of project plateau halfway through a project. That’s why it’s important to make sure your team has initiators, those who will stop at nothing to get things done, to help create momentum and move the project forward. Just look at the hiring practices of John Ellenthal, the president of Walker Digital, the R&D company behind Priceline.com. He used to prefer candidates with a great deal of experience. Over time, however, he realized that “ideas never get made unless everyone makes it their business to do so.” In his words, he would now “trade experience for initiative and the raw desire to do stuff in a heartbeat.” You can easily determine whether a job candidate is an initiator by looking into their past. First, look at their résumé to see whether their previous commitments thematically intersect. This will clue you in on what’s really important for them. Next, look at what they’ve achieved. Not only will initiators have worked in the area that interests them, but they will also have accomplished something there. But a successful team also needs a healthy dose of skepticism. You can think of the skeptics on your team as the immune system that kills off ideas that do more harm than good. During the brainstorming phase you need creatives who can generate new ideas freely without being burdened by overly skeptical colleagues. However, when it’s time to execute the project you’ll need skeptics to guard it against new ideas that threaten to derail it. The majority of people who land jobs in the creative industry will go out of their way to create something different. However, they’ll need a good leader in order to use this power most effectively. The creation of something extraordinary requires a leader who can help foster the right consensus. Often, when great ideas are discussed, they end up being watered down to the lowest common denominator. A good creative leader, however, is open for compromise on anything except a few specific elements that are held to be sacred. This is how Tom Hennes of Thinc Design executes his projects. He is often working in an environment where dozens of stakeholders want to have their voices heard, and thus many compromises must be made. However, his teams first identify a few points that distinguish their project, which they then hold sacred throughout the entirety of the project, while allowing compromises on almost anything else. It was this approach that enabled them to create extraordinary architectural feats, such as the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. Furthermore, good creative leaders listen before they talk. When budding creative minds are asked why they left their old team, they often answer that they felt their ideas weren’t being heard. Usually this happens because more experienced leaders feel that they’ve “seen it all,” and thus speak first and act quickly rather than listening to new ideas. What they should be doing is the exact opposite. Not only does listening reduce the risk of excluding your creative employees, it also brings in fresh and valuable contributions. For example, after working at a company for a long enough time, you might come to accept some of their strange practices, such as the useless weekly meeting. Newcomers, on the other hand, will recognize immediately that your regular meetings are pointless. Listening to their fresh perspective can help you to abandon worthless (but established) practices. The key message in this book: Success isn’t about having the best ideas; it’s about having the best execution. Reaching your goals means treating every idea as its own project, and organizing your timetable around action and execution. Actionable advice: Create an “Energy Line.” Next time you’re sitting at your desk, review your stacks of paper and sort your projects according to their economic and strategic value, from extremely important to unimportant. Be careful not to evaluate them by the amount of energy you’ve already put into them, but rather by how much energy you should put into them. Once you have your Energy Line, it’s far easier to optimize the allocation of your limited energy. Suggested further reading: Manage Your Day-To-Day by 99U and Jocelyn K.

Established “big players” have had the ground cut from under their feet by upstart disruptors playing by an entirely different rulebook. Today’s most successful businesses aren’t like yesterday’s. The corporation with massive overheads and strict hierarchies looks increasingly outdated. The most successful businesses have gone from being headed by a university graduate who’s slogged her way up the corporate ladder for a decade or two, to being the brainchild of a Harvard dropout working out of a garage. Welcome to the startup world, where a good idea and a convincing pitch can kickstart the path to global dominance. Just ask the founders of Facebook or Google! But the phenomenal growth achieved by the tiny cluster of startups that became household names is misleading. Making it big in the startup sector isn’t easy. In fact, you’d better be in it for the long haul and learn to avoid the most common pitfalls. Luckily enough, there’s a hands-on field guide designed to help you do just that... In these blinks, you’ll learn Why choosing the wrong investors might tank your business; What an honest and transparent office culture can do for your business; and The dangers of shortcuts and hacks. Everyone’s heard of the big success stories of the startup world like Google and Facebook. Perhaps you’re thinking that you might be next. After all, if they did it, why can’t you? Well, the truth is that getting a startup off the ground is often harder than you think. Most startups take years to see success and only a small percentage of those that make it go on to make their founders millionaires. Take it from Stephanie Walden, the author of the 2014 article “Startup Success by Numbers.” According to her data, less than 25 percent of early-stage, venture capital-backed companies make any profit at all. Just five percent of all startups provide a return on investments, though those that do often reap millions or even billions of dollars. The author’s startup Moz was founded in 2004 and experienced a huge number of ups and downs until it finally found its groove in 2017. For every success, there was a failure. Raising and spending capital, hiring and firing, and launching and removing products were all tricky balancing acts. A bad decision at any point could have ruined the company. The payoff, though? Around $45 million in annual revenue. It’s important to remember, though, that startup founders don’t earn that much at the outset. Salaries are often lower than those of employees at bigger companies because they’re determined by outside investors. That means if you’re after the big bucks, you’re probably better off working for a market leader than setting up your own company. At Moz, for example, the CEO’s salary remained lower than that of an average Seattle-based software engineer for five years. And even when it was raised, it was never much higher than that baseline. The reason for that is simple: investors expect revenue from startups and know how to take care of their own interests. A startup’s board has access to aggregate salary statistics and won’t hesitate to cap the salaries of senior staff. Getting your startup up and running takes time, effort and dedication. But even if you push through all the challenges you’ll face, you’ll still need to find a buyer for your stock. What gives companies like Airbnb and Uber the cutting edge in their markets? Two words: Market research. If you want to succeed, you need to offer something that addresses customer needs better than your rivals. Take Airbnb. It saw a gap in the market. Lots of people wanted to book vacation home rentals online, but there wasn’t a simple, user-friendly service out there. Consumers were forced to rely on websites like Craigslist which lacked all sorts of useful features. It was the perfect niche for a rental specialist to move into. The good news is that there are tons of similar opportunities out there waiting to be discovered. So how do you go about finding them? Well, a good place to start is to take a leaf out of Airbnb’s book. Like lots of other successful startups, the company focused its energies on improving something that already existed. To do that, it emphasized its unique selling point – that its service was both easier and more enjoyable to use for customers. But identifying these sorts of gaps in the market takes time and humility. You have to put the hours in and conduct thorough research. It’s also important to admit mistakes. Your service won’t be perfect from the get-go; accept that and focus on working toward the perfect user experience. Companies like Uber and Yelp show how this can be done. Uber, for example, identified an opportunity by analyzing search engine data which showed how many queries contained the word “taxi.” Yelp took a similar approach, looking at the number of searches containing “restaurant” and the name of a city. Their painstaking approach paid off. When they launched their services, they knew everything they needed to know about the market they were entering. Okay, so you’ve got a fantastic idea for a startup. Now all you need to do is raise some capital to get it off the ground, right? Well, not quite. As the old saying goes, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. You might want silent partners with deep pockets, but you can be sure your investors won’t see it quite like that... Raising money limits your freedom. Once you’ve got investors on board, you’ll be tying your performance to their expectations. And that means you’ll be under pressure to hit targets and maintain constant growth. They want to see a return on their investment. If your accounts start looking shaky, they won’t hesitate to take action. That could be anything from having you removed from your position as CEO to pushing for high-risk strategies that might end up killing your company. Don’t take all this personally, however. Your investors are also under a lot of pressure to deliver returns to their investors. Most venture capitalists or VCs aren’t putting up their own money but cash they’ve raised from limited partners or LPs. A typical target for a VC is to treble the LP’s investment within ten years! There’s one more thing you’ll want to bear in mind about investment: it’s an extremely risky undertaking. Returns on investments are generally extremely low. That means your investors will be betting on you becoming one of the very small numbers of companies that make it big. Success for investors means nothing less than a billion-dollar revenue stream. That’s pretty rare – in fact, no more than five percent of investment firms ever achieve that goal. When they do, it’s because they’ve spread their bets and have a portfolio containing dozens or even hundreds of investments. Failure is simply part and parcel of investing: five out of ten companies that investors put their money into will fail, while three out of that ten will yield only minimal returns. The figures for startups are just as daunting. According to data gathered by the National Venture Capital Association in 2015, between 30 and 40 percent of well-established startups go bust and fail to return any revenue to investors. That means a solid plan to get your company into that five percent of successful firms is in order if you’re receiving VC funding. Running a startup is tough. So what should you do when problems arise? Lots of founders are tempted to hide the truth in an attempt to protect their team and customers, but that’s often a risky call. A lack of openness doesn’t just put your relationships in jeopardy, it can also undermine your company’s growth and revenue. That means it’s important to confront problems head-on. If a member of your team isn’t performing well, try to find a solution like additional mentoring rather than ignoring the issue. It’s also a good idea to be forthright about financial difficulties. After all, everyone at the company wants to avoid layoffs. Telling your team that things are tough will also encourage them to go the extra mile and hit those important targets. Leaving them in the dark, on the other hand, will likely breed resentment – exactly what you don’t need when you’re in a jam! Openness, especially about weaknesses and setbacks, is also key to incentivizing your team and encouraging them to put their best foot forward. Remember, people like a challenge and are much more willing to help you out if you’re honest with them. And trust is a two-way street. The more you trust your team, the more they’ll trust you. This is great for your reputation as a CEO in difficult situations such as layoffs. In those moments, both your credibility and that of the company as a whole will be on the line. Honesty is the only way you’ll be able to keep everyone on your side. Despite that, an incredible nine out of ten managers don’t share information about imminent layoffs with those affected. That’s a mistake you’ll want to avoid. The same policy goes for customers. Bad news has a tendency of getting out even if you try to keep it under wraps, so you may as well be open. At the author’s startup, that’s company policy. Everyone on the board of executives is asked to write emails and lead conversations as if they were going to be leaked to the public. That creates an atmosphere in which even failures can be openly discussed and employees don’t feel like they’re being kept in the dark. Does your mood affect your work? If yes, ask yourself another question: How much would it affect your performance as a CEO of a startup completely reliant on its leadership? Perhaps you’ve answered no. It’s still a valuable exercise since it’s these kinds of questions that give you a true sense of your strengths and weaknesses. And that makes running your company smoothly much easier. When you’re aware of problems, it’s much easier to start fixing them. Knowing that your company isn’t particularly strong on networking, for instance, means you’ll know that you need to concentrate on that area to boost your chances of hiring the right people. That’s vital because knowledge gaps are an incalculable obstacle to growth. After all, how can you get the best possible product out there if you don’t have the know-how to make it? So here’s the solution: surround yourself with people who have expertise in the areas in which you need to get things done. But your job isn’t done once you’ve decided who to hire. If you want your team to perform at its highest level, you’ll also need to ensure its members’ psychological well-being. That means ditching old-fashioned commonsense ideas of leadership. Displaying vulnerability, for example, is a much more effective way of creating a productive workplace than stereotypical authoritarianism. Sharing feelings, expressing concerns and talking about fear of judgment have been proven to give teams a boost. Project Aristotle, a research project run by Google since 2012, showed that empathy is the most consistent predictor of a team’s success. So being aware of your weaknesses won’t just help you make the right decisions when it comes to hiring, it’ll also make your employees much happier and more productive! One of the most important factors in determining performance is a team’s dynamic. So what exactly is that? Well, it’s basically how well you and your team members get on with one another. The best workplace dynamics are close-knit and complementary. Put simply, everyone values his colleagues – the people he ultimately spends most of his day-to-day life with! But a great team dynamic isn’t down to chance; it can be encouraged and cultivated. One of the best ways of doing that is to assemble a diverse team. Having employees on board with different backgrounds and skills provides a greater range of expert opinions and insights. Take Moz. When one of the company’s workers was pregnant, the people there realized just how bad the office was at catering to certain needs. There just weren’t many private or comfortable spaces. That led to a rethink. Moz upgraded its facilities with a view to accommodating all employee needs. The result? A much happier workforce! Racial diversity has also been shown to boost performance. According to a 2015 study conducted by McKinsey & Company, racially diverse teams financially outperform non-diverse teams by a margin of 35 percent. This finding also applies to gender diversity, with diverse teams beating their non-diverse counterparts by a 15 percent margin. That’s hardly surprising. Customers are diverse. If your team reflects that, you’re much more likely to create products, services and marketing strategies that speak to them. So it pays to consider the user experiences of all sorts of people. Small details like color, layout, font and word choice make a difference if you’re dyslexic or color-blind. The second part of creating a strong team dynamic is a meritocratic promotion process. That’s all about providing clear paths to more senior positions in order to keep your team motivated and reduce frustration. The key here is to allow employees to take on more responsibility without necessarily becoming a manager. The truth is, not everyone is cut out for managerial positions. In fact, lots of people don’t want to be managers. But in many companies, that’s still the only viable route to promotion. So why not implement a dual-track career path that allows people to evolve and grow without taking on managerial tasks? That’s as simple as creating new roles like “product owner” or “engineering architect” and offering the same benefits and salary as a manager would receive. Every company wants to grow. So what could be better than a growth hack? Not so fast. Growth hacks – marketing strategies for rapid experimentation and product development – often do more harm than good. While they might bring in more customers and revenue in the short term, they’re often a bad move for solving long-term issues. That’s because growth hacks are all about quick gains. Selling more now, however, can get in the way of sustainably improving your products to leave you well positioned to meet future challenges. After all, if the balance sheet looks healthy enough today, why bother investing and planning for tomorrow? More importantly, hacks can also undermine your company over time. A promotional strategy that boosts sales by slashing prices, for example, might put your customers off paying the full price for your product later on. The same goes for Minimum Viable Products, or MVPs for short. Sure, you’ve managed to get your product out there quickly, but it might not meet your customers’ expectations. If they think you’re selling shoddy goods, they’ll take their business elsewhere. That’s not to say MVPs aren’t useful. Putting a product out that’s just about good enough to satisfy early customers may give you an insight into their needs. But ask yourself this: Would research achieve the same result? Moz learned that the hard way after launching Spam Score in 2015. The product was designed to assess the likelihood of online search results being spam. The company received some positive feedback and a ton of criticism from users unhappy with Spam Score’s suboptimal features. The result? $500,000 spent on engineering, research and data collection with a minimal gain in customer growth. So here’s a good rule of thumb when it comes to using MVPs: If your company is still in its infancy, it can probably afford the risk since it doesn’t have an established reputation. If it’s already well-known, however, you might want to think again. And if you do decide to go ahead with MVPs, trial them with a smaller sample rather than rolling it out wholesale. The feedback you receive will ultimately help you improve the product before introducing it to a larger market. Growth can become an obsession. It’s all too easy to become overly focused on that next round of funding that’ll give your company its next growth spurt. That’s understandable, of course, but it can get in the way of other priorities like taking care of your existing customers and products. After all, if you’re growing in one area while shrinking in another, you’re not really growing at all. Customer retention is the foundation of your company. If you spend all your time and energy in acquiring new customers, you risk losing the ones you already have. The result is a vicious cycle. As you lose your existing base, you devote ever more energy into attracting new customers, who you may eventually lose. The sustainable alternative is to free up time for your team to resolve issues affecting your current clients. Nothing keeps customers happier than the sense that you’re taking care of them. That’s often as simple as explaining your product’s features over the phone or via email and answering their questions quickly and efficiently. That’s an ethos you should also apply to your product palette. Companies offering just one product are often more successful, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make multiple products. The key is to focus on establishing one product before moving on to the next. Take Google. For the first decade of its existence, it was simply a search engine. Once it had cracked that market, it expanded its operations. The reason that’s so important is simple: Users remember bad experiences. If they’re unhappy with one product, they’re unlikely to try others produced by the same company. Even worse, they usually also tell their friends and families to avoid that brand. Putting fewer but better products out there heads off the danger of establishing a poor reputation among potential customers. So start by making one great product that users love and will pay for and then scale up! The key message in these blinks: Don’t let the hype about superstar startups lead you down the garden path. There isn’t a shortcut to fame and fortune. Getting your company off the ground will be hard work, so you’ll need to ready yourself for the long haul. If you want to make it, you’ll have to foster transparency and honesty. You should also assess your strengths and weaknesses and carefully consider your funding options. Do that, however, and you’ll be well on your way to success. Actionable advice: Consider your funding options carefully.  Venture capital isn’t the only way of funding your company. In fact, its downsides might outweigh its advantages in your particular situation. So rather than jumping on the first offer that comes your way, take some time to carefully consider your options. From micro-VC to bootstrap, angel investment and crowdfunding, there are plenty of funding models out there to pick and choose from. Got feedback?

But as any successful consultant knows, solo consulting isn’t just about amassing a large fortune. In fact, success in consulting involves surmounting a dramatic learning curve and collecting broad and diverse experiences and skills. It brings the possibility to make changes that can potentially impact the lives of tens of thousands of people. These blinks will teach you how to set up your own company and acquire the kinds of clients that will make your million-dollar business. They’ll also give you tips – some of which are quite counterintuitive – for success in this industry. In these blinks, you will also learn: why successful consultants actually fire their clients, why putting relationships before money will actually make you wealthier, how to ask for $50,000, why you should never ever enter negotiations with the “gatekeeper,” and why your free time is your true wealth. What does it take to become a doctor or a lawyer? That’s easy: there is a strict set of requirements you need to fulfill, like passing the bar or doing your residency, after which you’re awarded a certificate that allows you to practice. While the requirements for becoming a doctor or lawyer, like those for many other professions, are quite narrow, virtually anyone can call themselves a consultant. If that’s the case, then what does the word actually mean? A consultant is someone who has a unique set of skills and talents that help to create the value-adding components that their clients’ businesses lack. The value that they add comes from two sources: content expertise and process expertise. Content expertise is earned through study and work in a specialized field, where the wealth of your experience and professional relationships lie. In other words, this is your professional “comfort zone,” where you are the most competent. This expertise is rooted in the specific skills and talents that made you successful in one particular industry or field of study in the first place. If you are consulting for a specialized firm – for example, as an expert witness in a legal dispute – then you are acting as a content consultant. This contrasts with process expertise, which transcends specific industries, is applicable in almost any environment, and involves a set of highly effective methods. For example, the company Bain & Co. has spent years conducting strategic planning projects, and thus has developed the experience and the methodology necessary to consider themselves as having expertise in strategic processes. Consequently, they tend to specialize in just that area, as they know it best. For solo consultants especially, process expertise is often more valuable than content consulting. This is because process expertise has a wider range of applications across a broad spectrum of diverse industries, which can help to make up for a lack of content expertise. Starting a business isn’t easy, and often the biggest hurdle is attracting the attention of potential clients to your services. So how do you do it? There are two major ways in which organizations find consultants: word of mouth and an outstanding body of work. Word-of-mouth marketing is by far the simplest and most effective of these two methods, as it leads the clients directly to you. Unfortunately, since word-of-mouth marketing is based on direct recommendations by clients or someone else who has at least heard about your services, the process is therefore almost completely out of your hands. In spite of this, it can be wildly successful. In fact, the author has traced many of his most valuable projects back to recommendations by clients or other completely unexpected sources. It is therefore important that, apart from delivering first-class work, you treat every single interaction with a prospective client as a personal “moment of truth,” and always think in long-term relationships. In the end, consulting is a “relationship business,” and your success depends upon the relationships you build. Of course, you can also help this process along by asking your satisfied clients for testimonials and recommendations directly. Word-of-mouth marketing must be backed up by actual value, so it’s important to keep a record of your success as well as your intellectual property in order to build your reputation and showcase your body of work. Everything you’ve done – from hard-copy publishing, speaking, interviews and product sales, to websites and newsletters – enhances your visibility. Start producing intellectual property early in order to develop your body of work, and use this as references to your credibility rather than as mere sales vehicles. The best way to get people to see the value you can add to their business is by showing them the value you’ve added to others’. How do you measure the quality of your work? Many consultants get tangled up in quantifying their tasks with arbitrary measurements, like the number of meetings held or reports written. In reality, the quality of your work comes down to one thing and one thing only: the value you add to your client’s business. In this way, consulting is about results, not tasks. If you just fulfill tasks and define deliverables without connecting them to a specific value-adding result, you’re just creating a heavy and unproductive workload for yourself, such as writing reports and sitting through meetings devoid of goals. To avoid this, you should enter an agreement with your client in which “the ‘how’ is subordinated to the ‘what.’” In other words, a fulfilling and positive consultant–client relationship is one in which the end result, rather than the method, is what’s important. However, in order to forge this kind of positive relationship, you will have to clarify to your clients that your work should be measured in terms of the value you add, rather than, for example, the time it takes to complete the project. To do this successfully, you will need to come to an agreement on what the objectives are and how they will be measured before you even write a proposal. This requires collaboration, and, unsurprisingly, the best consultants collaborate with their clients. This is because the kinds of value a consultant adds – roughly divided into resolving an issue or transferring skills – can change depending on the specific needs of the client. Whereas an interventionist imbues an organization with highly effective skills, and an independent expert resolves many important issues critical to a company’s success, only a collaborator is able to do both at the same time. By demonstrating their flexibility, collaborators not only offer the most value to their clients’ organizations but also tend to have the strongest and longest-lasting relationships with the client, and thus the follow-up projects and referrals that come with them. What is it that defines your consulting business and sets it apart from the crowd? Every consulting firm has some unique motivational force behind it that sets out their strategic goals and paves the path for their business. Unfortunately, companies too often formulate mission statements such as, “We want to help clients to achieve the best results possible,” or “We want to be on the cutting edge of our field.” The problem is that these statements are far too vague and generic. Good mission statements get specific in their goals and their intended results. For example, if you want to improve customer service, you might have a strategy like this: “We will design and implement workshops that use customer feedback to create demonstrable changes in behavior on the job.” Or, if you specialize in process optimization, you might “assist clients in enhancing staff productivity through needs analysis, enhanced communication and joint decision making.” No matter how you formulate your strategy, the key is to show how value is added, and thus differentiate your service from others. This strategic goal will always be underpinned by this primary motivator: to grow, both financially and personally. There is virtually no other profession with a steeper learning curve than consulting. Consequently, your ability to add value to your clients’ operations increases with every new experience, gained ability and learned skill, all of which, in turn, justify a rise in your fees. At the same time, every assignment will ideally leave you with a new valuable contact or strengthened relationship with your client, thus improving your network and word-of-mouth marketing. This means that you should always get something out of your contracts. If a business doesn’t meet your growth strategy – for example, if the project doesn’t meet your fee structure, is unchallenging or doesn’t otherwise help you grow – don’t do it. Has your doctor ever told you that there’s something you need to cut out of your life – maybe smoking or candy bars – in order to improve your health? Surprisingly, the same is true in the world of consulting: sometimes consultants fail to grow because they refuse to abandon bad clients. This is because consultancy firms operate differently to other businesses, such as soft drink manufacturers, who will always try to sell to as many people as possible. In order to grow – both financially as well as in terms of client relationships and professional experiences – you will need to let go of less lucrative businesses. As your wealth of experience continues to grow, your fees should grow with them. Not only is this good for your wallet, but it’s also good for your reputation. If you become known as an “inexpensive alternative” desperate to accept any job, you will receive the pay and repute that come with such a perception. Instead, ensure that the quality of your work is always above the quantity, i.e., one $50,000 project will always be more valuable to you than ten $5,000 ones. In fact, the time and cost required to sell a $100,000 project or a $10,000 project is generally very similar, thus making bigger projects all the more valuable to you. And since the value you can provide increases with your expertise and your abilities, it only makes sense for you to raise your fees accordingly. Consequently your strategic goals should incorporate the aim to accumulate increasingly higher-value assignments. One good way to ensure that this actually happens is to look back at all of your assignments every two years and identify the bottom 15 percent that you then choose to no longer accept, thus making room for more lucrative business. If you don’t grow continually, your success will eventually erode beneath you. By constantly looking for opportunities to expand your business, you will steadily climb, growing your wealth with each step. A consultant’s most crucial actions are to differentiate their business and find their niche – but how do you achieve this? The answer lies in branding yourself and building relationships. Although we’ve been told not to, people really do judge a book by its cover. Knowing this, you should be sure you create a personal brand that others will both like and recognize. Like it or not, part of this brand is your personal presentation. Have a few nice suits and accessories, and strive to behave like the professional you are. Try to stay natural, avoiding things like hairdryers, potent fragrances and tanning salons. However, it is not your face, but your name, and the logo that accompanies it, that is your ultimate trademark. Thus you should always use your logo on everything you produce. Potential clients need to be able to recognize your work in an instant in order to make it easy for them to call on you. You also want your business to be a legally recognized entity. Generally, if you’re not incorporated, you’re considered an amateur. You’ll never be perceived as a true professional, and will consequently lose out on many lucrative business opportunities. It’s also important to consider how you differentiate yourself: specialization makes you competitive and differentiated services make you distinct, but your relationship with the client will determine whether you are perceived as a valuable collaborator or a one-timer. The ideal relationship is one where the client has confidence in the consultant to make decisions on his own, act responsibly and in the client’s best interest. One simple way to gain trust is to provide your best clients with your private telephone number. The ability to call upon you during tough times provides a feeling of safety and partnership. In addition, you shouldn’t be afraid to take a stand on crucial issues, even when internal politics threaten the success of your project. In the end, good clients will understand that you are acting in their best interests, and will only trust you more. Consultants who don’t “make it” are often unsuccessful because they fail to convince the client of their value. This is because there are a number of hurdles that can make negotiations difficult. Firstly, you will often find yourself sitting across from a gatekeeper at the negotiating table – someone who is authorized to say “no” but not “yes,” like, for example, HR personnel or a mid-level manager. Under no circumstance should you ever enter negotiations with a gatekeeper and you should always insist on the presence of the person who actually makes the ultimate decisions and writes the checks. Secondly, you will have to overcome the four main reasons clients use to reject your services: no money, no urgency, no need, and no trust. No money or urgency: The key to overcoming this hurdle is to focus solely on value in your negotiations. If you can successfully show how the issues your potential client faces will worsen over time, and explain exactly what kind of value you’ll deliver, then your services will appear more urgently required and your fees more reasonable. No need: Indeed, “the essence of marketing is to create need.” Generally speaking, clients know exactly what they want, but not always what they need. To surmount this hurdle, you’ll need to identify what their needs are, show them why they need these things, and then explain the value you can add by helping them meet their needs. No trust: If you and the client have no relationship, then there is no trust upon which successful negotiations can rest. To develop this relationship, you have to identify the issues that excite or frustrate your client and provide candid feedback, positioning yourself “as potential partner, not as a salesperson or a sycophant,” and convincing them that you have their best interests in mind. If you can succeed in surmounting these obstacles, then they’ll have no choice but to say “yes.” It can sometimes be difficult to translate the services you provide into a dollar amount. Many consultants make the mistake of charging a per diem fee, but unfortunately for them, this is not only counterproductive, but can even be considered unethical. This is because the time you spend on a project has no intrinsic value for the customer in and of itself. The only thing that the client is interested in is improvement, or value. If, however, your fees are based on the time spent on a project, then your goal is actually to maximize time rather than add value. Such a pay scale puts you and your client in opposition to one another: the client wants fast and profound improvement, and you want longer project times. In reality, however, value-based fees and shorter project times are far more appropriate for meeting your client’s need for fast results and your need for personal, professional, and financial growth. The same applies for tasks. Clients don’t care about the tasks – they care about results. Furthermore, since tasks are repetitive, they therefore lose value the more with each repetition due to economies of scale. Outcomes, however, only become more valuable as they accumulate. So how should you structure your fees? Here are some things you’ll want to consider: What qualitative and quantitative benefits will you provide your client? How will affect your client’s reputation? How much emotional energy will you need to invest in the project? You should also consider the scope of the project, the number of people who will have access to your services, and the approximate duration of the project. Ultimately, the only way to get the fees you deserve is to convince your client of the value you add and then simply ask for them. Many people, however, can’t ask for a huge amount of money convincingly. Make it easier on yourself by practicing saying, “the fee will be $50,000” in front of a mirror in order to convey the confidence that justifies the fee. How far ahead do you plan for your future? If you’re like most consultants, you don’t look much further than your next paycheck. This tunnel vision is what causes most consultants to miss the omens of bad times ahead. In order to stay above water, you’ll need to closely monitor the volume and source of your incoming assignments. The pipeline approach is one way to gain perspective on your incoming assignments. Your pipeline indicates all of your long-term, short-term, and immediate projects along a timeline, all of which are “signed and sealed,” thus representing safe income. Your pipeline should be filled with short-term sales you’ve closed, repeat business from current clients, and other business that comes by referral. You should also make plenty of time for prospects and direct marketing targets. And because most companies have a policy that does not allow multi-fiscal-year agreements, most pipelines will represent a 12-month period. For you, this means that your pipeline offers a realistic estimate of yearly cash flow and profit. A poorly structured pipeline, however, can lead to a world of problems. For starters, a dry pipeline puts you under pressure to acquire new, short-term business, which almost always translates into poor business, poor fees, and fewer growth opportunities. Additionally, when your projects are unevenly distributed or clumped together at some point in the pipeline, you will probably have to hire contractors or enter an agreement with another consultant in order to complete all the work. This, in turn, reduces your margin and opportunities for growth. You should also take care to monitor your pipeline. If you notice a lack of new prospects and targets as well as a lack of repeat business from your existing clients, it might be that either your marketing efforts are ineffective or that you’ve failed to form strong relationships with your clients. As a result of the economic crisis of 2008, many consultancy firms suffered a loss of business and drastic cutbacks in their expenses. Others, however, were able to actually grow their business in spite of this economic hardship. So what did they do differently? The answer: they invested in their businesses instead of cutting costs, and made use of their highly diversified services and excellent client relationships. You can think of the economy as acting like a hydraulic system: “When something goes down, something else goes up.” Therefore, with the right strategy, you can actually use a crisis to your advantage. Regardless of the economic climate, however, you should diversify your services – both your content and your process expertise – in order to address the industries that thrive in booms and those that thrive in busts. Indeed, some industries – for example, the pet care and health industries – are quite resilient in economic depressions, and you want to be able to capture that business when the time is right. Another way to protect your business is by expanding your market geographically. This strategy will ease the pain of regional economic downturns and keep you from being overwhelmed by local competitors. And if you do fall into slow times, you can focus your time away from clients and become productive in other areas – most importantly marketing. For example, you could make it a habit to call your old clients and partners in order to maintain a good relationship, write articles for a magazine, or give speeches on the challenges of the crisis. Finally, most competitors will start divesting in times of crisis and uncertainty. Clients, however, will immediately notice the falling quality and value of their services. You should do the opposite, and fill the void left behind by your competitors with your enhanced efforts to make your value noticeable to the clients. In order to be the most successful consultant possible, your ultimate goal must be to become irreplaceable for your clients and to form lasting relationships with them in order to maximize your fees and keep your pipeline filled with assignments. To achieve this, you’ll need to think strategically and in the long term, even discounting your fees for special opportunities that allow you to gain enough knowledge about your client’s organization to make yourself an irreplaceable asset. With every project you are involved in, your worth will increase as the added value of your projects accumulates and the organization imparts more insider information to you. Having been educated about the ins and outs of the culture and business of your client’s organization, you can then be more proactive about finding areas where you could add value, suggest projects, and thus raise your fees. In order to gain these valuable insights, start your project with “roaming time” in order to get an overview of how the organization works and is perceived by the different stakeholders and functionaries within the organization. Roaming time never really ends during your project, as there is always more to learn, but in the beginning, you should take special care to meet all key senior staff as well as a wide cross section of middle- and lower-level managers in order to gain insight into their perceptions, and how they use the resources and technology available to them. Additionally, you can accompany salespeople on the road, and even try to talk to the major customers to get their perspective. Once you’ve successfully completed a couple of assignments and have gained sufficient knowledge about your client’s organization, you have reached the ultimate point in your client–consultant relationship. In the words of the author, “you have become a wise person whose contributions are a synthesis of personal talents, organizational knowledge, and personal relationships established with top management.” Hell-bent on being as financially successful as possible, many consultants end up spending their lives in airplane seats and clients’ offices, leaving only the weekend for their families, if that. Others, however, believe that their real wealth is their discretionary time, and that money is merely the means to achieve that lifestyle. If that’s the case for you, then growing your business may actually mean a decrease in your wealth. In fact, it is a holistic outlook on life, rather than one focused on business, that will truly make you a better consultant. This is because you can draw more energy and creativity from a balanced life, which in turn improves your work and helps clients to see you as both a complete human being and a professional. But how do you achieve the balance between work and play that allows for a more balanced and rich life? First of all, you must realize that there is no strict division between your professional and private life. There is only one life: your life. Consequently, you should eliminate arbitrary time boundaries, and instead do things when “the spirit moves you.” If you want to complete some work on Sunday and go to the beach on Monday, that’s fine! As an independent consultant, you are the master of your time, so use it as you wish. Secondly, the secret to a fulfilling life lies in variety. As Nietzsche once wrote, “a day has a hundred pockets if you know what to put in them,” so you should make an earnest effort to never stop learning and to push yourself to try new things. Avoid isolation, find inspiration in others and help them in order to maintain perspective about the priorities in your life. And lastly, stay healthy and fit, and reward yourself regularly. A healthy body is home to a healthy soul, increases your confidence and curiosity, and makes you more resistant to stress. The key message in this book: Consulting is a “relationship business,” where no one cares about your methodology or degree. The only thing that truly matters is the value you add to your client’s balance sheet. As you continue to grow on your journey toward success, keep in mind that it is your free time – not mere money – that is your true wealth. Actionable advice: Always think in terms of value, not in tasks. Your clients are not interested in the number of tasks you must complete to finish a project. They are only interested in one thing: the results. Consequently, it is better for you – and for them – to approach your fee structure from the perspective of the value you add to their organization, rather than the number of hours it will take you to complete the project. Put potential relationships before money. While sealing a $50,000 deal is a great thing indeed, it’s far better for you to develop the kinds of professional relationships that will lead to repeated $50,000 deals. Your success and your fortune are highly dependent upon others’ perceptions of you.

While these blinks are useful for all entrepreneurs, they offer especially valuable advice for mom entrepreneurs. You’ll learn how to make sure you meet your own goals and not be bound to another person’s agenda.  These blinks also give advice on how to budget your time despite the various challenges which mom entrepreneurs encounter – and on how to find time for all the activities you love most.  In these blinks, you’ll also find out about an inner voice you should ignore at all costs; what a twofer is and why it’s so helpful for your time management; and why it’s actually a good idea to overschedule certain activities. Today’s entrepreneurial mother faces a host of challenges on her way to success. The wonderful wife, the caring mother, the exemplary hostess and the fierce business women: there’s no end to the roles mothers are expected to juggle and perform to perfection.  Women quickly internalize unbelievable social pressure like this and become their harshest critics. But there’s no sense in it. Being a mom entrepreneur is challenging enough – why put extra pressure on yourself?  As a mom entrepreneur, you need a business plan that takes your needs and circumstances into account. You have a finite amount of time on your hands. And if you want to use it well, you need to separate other people’s expectations from the things you really care about.  Start by making a list of the top five things that matter to you. These could be your values, or things that you aspire to, such as independence, integrity and authenticity. Motivators, the things that get you out of bed everyday, are also worth noting. These could be your children, a sense of autonomy or the opportunity to help others. Your passions, whether they’re solving complex math problems or going hiking, also deserve a spot on this list.  Now, take a look at your list. These top five things should be what you put most of your time and energy into. But do you really pull that off?  All too often mothers find themselves sacrificing their time to complete tasks that aren’t truly important to them, like maintaining a spotless household. This is the result of unnecessary self-pressure. By recognizing that your priorities lie elsewhere, you’ll feel this pressure lessen almost immediately.  What do you think of when you hear the word success? Do visions of money or status come to mind? Do you see yourself as that hotshot entrepreneur you’ve always admired? If so, it’s time to put those dreams away. Instead, create a vision of success that fits with your own life. This kind of success is sustainable and feels truly worthwhile.  Before motherhood, many women dream of scaling the corporate ladder, traveling often and coming home to a nice house and car. But if they haven’t achieved this after motherhood, they often feel frustrated, resentful or even angry.  The reality is that becoming a mother changes your life profoundly. You may no longer have the energy or the time to work ten hours straight, like you used to. But so what? That doesn’t mean you can’t achieve success. The trick is to aim for a goal that is aligned with the top five things that matter to you right now, not ten years ago.  Perhaps you loved to work out before you became pregnant and took great pride in how much you could bench press. And now that your child is six months old, you’re ready to start working out again. But after a week at the gym, you realize that you simply don’t have the energy anymore.  Before you start criticizing yourself, take a look at your top five again. Is it really one of your priorities to look super fit and toned? Probably not. Realizing this will annihilate those unnecessary feelings of guilt. By keeping your priorities in perspective, you’ll have more time to focus on what you really value. As mothers, time is our most precious and most scarce resource. Despite this, it seems like we only ever seem to lose track of it. But things don’t have to be that way! Let your priorities be your guide to effectively manage your time.  It’s time to go back to basics: grab a physical calendar so you can start treating time as currency. Every day offers you 24 hours to spend. So what are you going to spend it on?  Sleep, chores, cooking, childcare and time for your romantic life should be automatically blocked off. Block off all time slots on the calendar that belong to regular family activities, such as morning routines, soccer practice or helping with homework.  Next, put in your non-negotiable tasks: your work hours, time with your partner and time off. Now have a look at what’s left. This time is yours to split between your business and yourself. Keep your top five handy and start filling in the free slots in your calendar accordingly.  When you’re arranging your time slots, there are a few things to remember. The first is that energy levels fluctuate throughout the day. So don’t try and schedule laborious tasks for the middle of the afternoon if you’re usually sleepy then! You’ll thank yourself for it later.  Secondly, do your best to stay honest with yourself about when you need a break. You should never feel guilty about needing to relax! Having enough downtime will always make you more productive later, and that’s a fact. So schedule some breaks and some time to reward yourself by doing what you love.  Finally, don’t forget that life inevitably gets in the way. Unexpected obstacles, whether it’s a sick child or a minor accident, can be quite frustrating. Cope with them better by making room for them. How? By over-scheduling certain things. If you want to work out four times a week, schedule it for six. If something comes up, you can always use the next slot you’ve made for yourself to hit the gym.  Burnout is real. Maybe you’ve even experienced it firsthand. If you want to avoid it, there’s one thing you’ve got to make time for between your kids, your work, your relationship and your business: namely, self-care rituals.  These are activities that you do because you enjoy them. But what if you just don’t have room for “me time”? Short answer: you do. It’s all about being smart with your scheduling.  Kill two birds with one stone by scheduling twofers. A twofer means combining two self-care rituals to get double the enjoyment in half the time. You could hop on the treadmill while watching your favorite show on Netflix. Or run around the block while listening to your favorite Blinkist audio book! You can also make a hitlist of the things that make you happy. Keep this list handy so that you know exactly what to fill an unexpected free slot with. Even little things, like a half-hour nap or a cup of ayurvedic tea will lift your mood more than you expect! Once you’ve found time for a few self-care rituals during your week, start making time for more. But what if your slots are all full?  Take a closer look: you might be losing time without realizing it. When was the last time you signed onto Facebook or Pinterest? More importantly, how long did you spend scrolling? Social media sucks up a lot of time. It’s time to break the habit! Delete apps from your phone or log off to reduce the temptation and enjoy your newfound free time.  Another way to free up your time is to let some things go. Learning to say no is a valuable skill, so why not practice it this week? If you don’t help out with the school auction, no one will think less of you! Save your time for activities that bring you closer to achieving your goals.  Finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help! If you’ve got the funds for it, think about getting a virtual assistant or intern to help you out with menial tasks that you don’t have time for. You don’t have to go it alone! Remember: self-care isn’t a luxury. It’s a necessity – and one you’ll truly be thankful for. Mom entrepreneurs often call their business their baby. After all, you bring them into the world, raise them, celebrate them and eventually watch them take off on their own. When raising a child, this process works best when you let things happen naturally. But your business is a different story. As a mom entrepreneur, you have to create a plan for your \"baby.\" The plan doesn’t need to be exhaustive. In fact, one page is all you’ll need! So where do you start? Determine your vision: What need is your business fulfilling? Whose lives will you better through it? Next, work out your mission: What motivates you to run this business? What principles are behind it? Finally, outline your concrete objectives. These goals should be SMART, that is, specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-related. A SMART goal should look a little something like this: “In 2016 I want to earn an income of $85,000”. The next step for your one-page plan is all about putting your vision, mission and objectives into action. For this, you’ll need strategies. If your vision is to give women aged 25 to 35 a product that will improve their lives, then you’ll need to get in touch with them. You could create a targeted marketing campaign or establish a presence at local trade shows.  To realize these strategies, you’ll need resources. These should be accounted for in your plan, too. Ask yourself: What needs to be done next? You might, for instance, decide to hire a web designer to boost your company’s online presence this month.  You may feel a little daunted by your plan as you write it. After all, you’re making a lot of promises to yourself here! If all the decisions to make and steps to take seem overwhelming, just think of all the resources you have.  Your strengths, skills, personality traits, education, work experience, networks and support systems that you’ve developed and perfected over your life will stand you in good stead. Time to make use of them! So, you’ve made a killer business plan and time to take care of yourself. And yet ... something seems to be standing between you and the success you’re aiming for. This would be a good moment to take a closer look at your working methods.  Mom entrepreneurs need flexibility, which makes working from home quite the blessing. But it can also be a curse! If you find yourself doing the laundry during the time slots booked for work when a deadline is nearing, you’ve fallen victim to a form of productive procrastination that moms know all too well.  The first step to ending procrastination is admitting that you’re doing it! So stop pretending that sparkling windows are more urgent than your product proposal. If you’ve booked slots for housework, don’t let it distract you outside of those times.  When you’re working on your business, always ask yourself how productive you really are. There’s always room for improvement! It’s worth checking out the latest apps created to help you boost your productivity in new and innovative ways.  There are also a handful of old-school techniques that will serve you well. All you have to do is chunk it, map it and calculate it. Assign chunks of time to particular tasks: allow yourself just 20 minutes to reply to emails, dedicate two hours to a long work slot and reward yourself with 25 minute breaks. Segmenting your time in this way is a simple yet effective way to keep it manageable.  If you’ve got a big project and don’t know where to start with time management, then it’s time to map it. Break your project down into smaller tasks and outline the time you’ll need to complete each of them.  Finally, get calculating with the 80/20 rule. This means you only deal with the 20 percent of tasks that give you the greatest returns. Armed with these tools, you’re set to show the market just how powerful mom entrepreneurs really are! The key message in these blinks: Being a mom can be tough, and being a mom entrepreneur even tougher! But with thoughtful planning and effective time management, you can achieve and sustain success that you really value. By knowing what really matters to you at this point in your life, you can align your projects to those priorities. That way, you can make sure all your time goes to what you love.  Actionable advice: Whenever you’re stuck, do something you love. Next time you’re at your wit’s end trying to balance your business with other commitments, take a step back. Give yourself some time out and perform one of your favorite self-care rituals. You’ll be better able to reflect on your situation with a clear, relaxed mind.  Got feedback?

Most of you would include Bill Gates or Steve Jobs; a few of you (those who saw that Benedict Cumberbatch film) might throw in Alan Turing. But there’s one person who should be at the front of people’s minds – though he probably isn’t – and at the top of any computer-industry list: Gordon Moore. Hardly anyone has done more to create the modern digitized world than Gordon Moore. As the co-founder of Fairchild and Intel he has played a leading role in two of the most influential companies of the 20th Century. He is also responsible for Moore’s law, which, though coined back in the 1960s, predicted the rise of the modern, highly technological world of today with incredible prescience. These blinks take you on a journey through the life and career of this unparalleled influencer. In these blinks, you’ll discover why an old Buick probably played a key role in computer history; and how wristwatches cost Gordon Moore millions. You've probably heard of Moore's Law, but what do you know about Gordon Moore – the man who came up with it? Gordon Moore was born in San Francisco, in 1929, to Mira and Walter Moore. He was a very reserved child, but also an exceptionally concentrated one. His precocity and extraordinary intelligence led him early on to what would become his lifelong vocation. In 1940, when he was eleven years old, Moore’s life changed forever. After his best friend was given a chemistry set, the pair began using it to make explosives and blow things up. Science suited Moore’s analytical mind, preferring it to math because he could see its visible effect on the tangible world. Moore had found his calling. As he got older, Moore remained passionate about chemistry and experimentation. He took his first chemistry lessons at Sequoia High School, where he was far ahead of the rest of his class, and by the age of 16, he already had a sophisticated understanding of the subject and was very confident in his ideas. Moore also retained his love of blowing things up. He experimented with nitroglycerine at home and eventually began making firecrackers for his friends, who used them to blow up mailboxes. Nor was the chemistry in Moore's life just happening in the lab. In September 1947, Moore met Betty Irene Whitaker, a journalism major at San Jose State. Whitaker was outgoing, lively and headstrong – the very opposite of Moore. Naturally, that drew him to her. She, in turn, was intrigued by his quiet confidence and composure. As Gordon Moore and Betty Whitaker grew closer, Moore began expanding his horizons. He took his first steps toward formulating Moore's Law at Berkeley University, right across the Bay from his childhood city. Moore was accepted to Berkeley in 1948, with the help of recommendation letters by professors at San Jose State. At the time, Berkeley was a particularly exciting place for a young chemist to be. The East Coast had long been the hub of academic science, but, partially due to California's booming economy, that was beginning to change rapidly. Moore had the privilege of working with a number of important people in the field. In fact, two of his professors, William Giauque and Glenn Seaborg, won the Nobel Prize for their discovery of the element berkelium shortly after Moore's arrival. During his first years at Berkeley, Moore was greatly influenced by George Jura, an assistant professor in Berkeley’s physical chemistry department. Jura taught his students that contemporary scientific literature was nearly always wrong, and urged them to disprove it. This opened Moore's eyes to the significance of original research, which also suited his flair for experimentation. Jura also introduced Moore to the art of glassblowing, a talent that proved useful during his later research on his semiconductor equipment. Moore quickly gained a reputation for his studiousness, and, in 1950, he was accepted to the California Institute of Technology, Caltech, which was regarded as one of the best science schools in the US at the time. By then, Betty Whitaker had finished her journalism major at San Jose State, so Moore asked her to come with him. By the standards of the day, such an invitation was tantamount to a marriage proposal. The couple married and began their life-long partnership. When Gordon Moore began his studies at Caltech, the area was booming. Multiple technological advancements had recently been made. In the 1940s, aerospace science, for instance, depended completely on electronics and IBM's special calculator, Harvard Mark 1, a kind of proto-computer that was used for calculations in missile testing and design. It was a thrilling environment for Moore. His work in experimental chemistry flourished, particularly under the tutelage of Professor Richard McLean Badger. Badger was conducting research on nitrogen compounds. His work was supported by the military, which was busy using nitrogenous explosives in the Korean War. Moore's previous work with explosives and nitroglycerine made him a perfect fit for the research, and he was soon working in the field. In 1951, at the age of 22, Moore published his first scientific paper, on nitrous acid, in the Journal of Chemical Physics. He completed his research and finished his Ph.D. in 1953 – a mere three years after arriving at Caltech. After completing his Ph.D., Moore felt finished with student life. He initially hoped to become a professor at a prestigious school, but couldn't find a position that matched his high demands. Badger convinced him to look into industry work instead, as there was a high demand for his skills in the field. So Gordon considered a few companies, looking for one that would give him enough freedom to experiment independently. He eventually decided on Applied Physics Laboratory, a research center funded by the Navy at John Hopkins University. The only downside was that it meant leaving California; he and Betty felt it was time for something new, however, so they bought a Buick and started driving east. In 1947, an important device was invented by scientists at Bell Laboratories: the transistor. Few people (if any) understood its potential at the time, but the invention ended up changing the world completely. The transistor could be used to amplify and switch signals on and off, just like vacuum tubes. Vacuum tubes were fragile and expensive, however, whereas transistors were made up of solid material. They were also much smaller and required less power. Transistors would soon make an array of new technology possible - most prominently the transistor radio, which was ubiquitous by the 1950s. By 1955, over half a million transistors were produced every month in the US alone. Moore had become interested in semiconductors under Badger's tutelage, but he only realized their true potential when transistors became popular. While at Caltech, Moore attended a lecture by William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor at Bell Labs. Two years later, Shockley was trying to produce a new kind of transistor that used silicon as a semiconductor. He needed a talented young chemist to help him in his California laboratory, the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, and Moore's name came to mind. In 1955, he offered him the job. So the Moores got back in their Buick and drove west. Shortly after their arrival, Shockley received the Nobel Prize for his work on the transistor. By 1957, Moore had made significant strides toward the company's goal of creating a transistor that used silicon as a semiconductor. All seemed to be going well. Things began to get tense, however. Moore was confident they'd reach their goal, but, after 18 months of work, the team was still far from finished. Arnold Beckman, Shockley's partner, was beginning to get anxious. Shockley’s apprehension mounted as his team struggled to make a breakthrough. Eventually, feeling that the time had come for something new, Moore and a few dissatisfied colleagues left the company to set up their own. They became known as the “traitorous eight” – and Moore was their leader. Moore and his new colleagues began searching for an investor and soon found one in Sherman Fairchild, one of IBM's biggest shareholders. Their new venture, Fairchild Semiconductor, was born the same week that the Soviets launched Sputnik, the world's first satellite. Moore knew that Sputnik would create an even greater demand for the kind of transistor they were trying to create; a fast-switching silicon transistor. In 1954, Texas Instruments had already offered a small batch of silicon transistors for military use. They were more robust and withstood heat better than other transistors on the market at the time, but they had one major drawback; they were slow-switching. At the end of 1957, IBM secured a contract related to the development of the B-70 Valkyrie, a bomber armed with thermonuclear weapons and capable of flying at supersonic speeds. The engineers of the B-70 badly needed fast-switching silicon transistors, which would enable the onboard computer to switch quickly between electronic signals. And, word had it, there was a small start-up in California that was researching them. Moore's team still had a number of problems left to solve with the transistor, however. They knew that Texas Instruments and Bell Labs (both of which also had enormous budgets) were also researching the technology. Moore had to make sure his team came first – everything depended on it. In August of 1958, a mere year after founding the company, they succeeded. Fairchild Semiconductor became the world's first company to develop a fast-switching silicon transistor and bring it to market. They called it the ZN696. The team had focused so much on producing the transistors that they hadn't thought about actually sending them to IBM. So Gordon went to the grocery store and bought the nicest container he could find – a Brillo box! The silicon transistor soon became the industry standard, and its applications became more and more manifold. More computers, radios and television sets were produced as newer models replaced the old ones that’d relied on vacuum tubes. That wasn't all, however. A new and particularly important technology was also emerging: the microchip. At the end of the 1950s, people still believed it would be too expensive to put several components on one chip, as the advanced technology it required was exorbitantly priced. They assumed it'd always be cheaper to wire individual components together. Moore, however, knew this was wrong. So he started Micrologic, a division of Fairchild dedicated to integrated circuits. He knew that integrated circuits would lead to a new generation of smaller and more complex microchips. His microchips would later be selected by NASA for use in the onboard guidance computer of the Apollo program. Moore had unique insight into the rapidly growing world of transistor-driven electronics. He knew where it was headed. In February 1965, Moore published a journal article, “The Future of Integrated Electronics,” which made some startling predictions. He wrote that, as people developed more applications for them, silicon transistor microchips would become more ubiquitous. Moore noticed that the microchip's complexity (in terms of its number of components) had doubled every year since its development. He predicted that it would continue to double, while its manufacturing cost would halve each year. Moore believed the microchip's exponential growth would lead to an explosion of computational power. His prediction, which became known as Moore's Law, turned out to be right. According to Moore, there would be 65,000 transistors on a single microchip by 1975. In 1965 that sounded like science fiction, even to many of Moore's peers – that year, the number of transistors on a microchip was only 64. In 1968, Moore set out on a new adventure that would change computing forever. Moore and Bob Noyce, his business-savvy partner, were truly the perfect pair – but they needed to find a fresh market. They knew they couldn't compete with the giants in established markets, like Motorola and Bell Labs. They found their niche when Moore noticed that the expansion of computers and calculators was creating more demand for greater memory-processing capabilities. Data was still stored on punch cards, which were cumbersome and took up lots of time to use. So they started searching for another team member – someone who could create the next generation of memory storage technology. That's how they found Joel Karp, a microchip designer at General Microelectronics, in Santa Clara. Karp would go on to create Intel's 1101 memory microchip, which could hold 256 bits of data on 1s and 0s. The new microchip propelled Intel to the forefront of the emerging memory market. The memory market was generating a solid profit for Intel when Moore got a visit from a Berkeley electrical engineer named Dov Frohman. Frohman had an innovative idea for a new kind of memory chip. Earlier chips could only store data when the power was on, but his version would retain data even when it was off. That wasn't what made it revolutionary, however. There were already some memory chips that could retain data without power, but their memories were fixed, that is, the data was physically printed onto them. Frohman's chips, on the other hand, were reprogrammable. Moore immediately realized their potential and put them on the market straight away. The new microchips, now called EPROMs, were a great success. Between 1972 and 1985, EPROM chip sales were Intel's main cash flow. In the early 1970s, the American economy was faltering and unemployment was high. Despite this, Intel's business was booming. But Moore was about to learn an important lesson: change and innovation are an important part of business, but sometimes you should stick to the things you know you're good at. Moore was always looking for potential new markets in microchip technology and the emerging electronic-watch market caught his eye. The Hamilton Pulsar, the world's first fully electronic wristwatch, was introduced in 1972, and cost a whopping $2,100. In today’s money, that’s roughly $12,000. So Moore and Noyce went searching for partners. That’s when they found Microma, a business that was just about to start shipping out their new LCD wristwatches. Moore invested huge amounts in the small company to help them develop. It wasn't long, however, before Microma foundered. Their watches had a number of technical problems and competition from Texas Instruments rapidly reduced their price. Microma simply couldn't compete. Ultimately, Moore would come to understand his mistake. Consumer products were different from what he was used to selling – they demanded a lot more than technical knowledge about microchips. A purely electronic focus would never be enough when it came to consumer goods. Fortunately, he maintained a sense of humor about the loss. He even called his own electronic watch (which he wore a long time after the failure) his “15 million dollar watch.” Moore and Noyce later found another emerging market: home computers. Enthusiasts all over the country, in fact, had started to build their own personal computers. The first “personal minicomputer” set was sold, in 1973, by a small company called MITS. This gave Noyce an idea: Intel could get into the personal computer industry by producing the rest of the kit along with each new chip. He took his idea to Moore, who, still reeling from the Microma catastrophe, exploded: “We are not in the computer business,” he said. “We build computer development systems.” By the mid-1970s, Intel had become a hugely profitable company. Moore was right at the heart of a revolution that would forever change computers. Up until 1979, it was extremely profitable to be in the computer memory industry. Intel's revenue was well over half a billion dollars per year. Competition from Japanese makers started to change that, however. They began manufacturing chips more quickly and at a lower cost. Intel's business gradually became less and less profitable. Luckily, Moore knew where the wind was blowing: microprocessors. Microprocessors were just making their way into the market. They allowed customers to create their own software programs and store them in an EPROM chip. Moore realized that microprocessors could revolutionize the industry and become a universal part of computing. If Intel were to get into the microprocessing market, they couldn't continue doing things by halves. The market for home computers was expanding at a phenomenal rate, and they had to keep up. In 1978, Apple sold 25,000 units of their Apple II computer. And by 1980, 750,000 PCs were sold worldwide – and each of them had an Intel microprocessor inside! Moore realized he'd have to invest heavily in research and development to keep staving off the competition from Japanese producers. They weren't only producing microchips faster; they were producing higher quality ones, too. So Moore invested $100 million into researching and developing Intel's next game-changer, the 386 microprocessor. With a total of 275,000 transistors, it offered unprecedented computational power. Intel further changed the industry when they started collaborating with Microsoft. In 1986, the companies produced their new PC, the Deskpro 386, which ran on Microsoft’s software and Intel's microprocessors. It would rule the PC world for the next 25 years. By this point, it was clear that computers were rapidly changing the world. And the good news for Moore was that all of them still needed microprocessors! In fact, in 1990, the average US citizen spent 40 percent of her time looking at screens: watching TV, playing video games or using a computer. And because Intel had quickly secured a dominant position in the microprocessor market in the 1980s, business was booming. Between 1981 and 1987, consumers spent billions of dollars on software and hardware for personal computers, and all of these computers relied on Intel microprocessors. This led Intel to leave the memory market and focus solely on microprocessors. Intel's dominion was partly due to the industry's high costs. Microprocessors were increasingly complex, and they demanded enormous budgets and facilities. Other companies couldn't compete. By now, Intel was a multi-billion dollar corporation that churned out microprocessors of greater complexity every year. By the mid-1990s, Intel had over 80 percent of the market share in PC microprocessors. And they've more or less been able maintain that ever since! In 2001, for instance, the year Moore decided to retire, at the age of 72, Intel was hugely profitable. The previous year, Intel's revenue had reached $10.5 billion and its stock price tripled. Moore was finding other interests, however. As Moore became less involved in Intel, he started turning to philanthropy instead. He made substantial contributions to Caltech and other educational institutions; the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation joined the ranks of philanthropists – people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet – who’d donated billions. In 2005, Forbes magazine named Gordon Moore the year's most charitable person. So where does Moore's Law stand today? It's actually approaching its physical boundaries, as microprocessor technology nears the level of individual atoms. It's time for another game changer. Who do you think will be the next Gordon Moore? The key message in this book: Gordon Moore followed his passions and talents from an early age. His work in chemistry led him to research semiconductors and microchips, and his success in those fields brought him to personal computers and microprocessors. After revolutionizing our technology with his advancements in memory processing and personal access, he focused on philanthropic work in his old age.

You launch it as soon as you can and have your customers help you refine your product. You invest and try to make your business grow rapidly. And then, suddenly, your business fails – your customer base just hasn’t grown as large as you expected it to. Failing new businesses, even those built around great ideas, are not uncommon. Entrepreneurs forget to ask their customers what they really want, miss out on golden opportunities or fail to pass their business into the right hands. But which is the right path toward entrepreneurial success? In these blinks, you will learn about the different phases of launching your business and making it grow: innovating a product, targeting your market, getting the communication with your customers just right and, finally, refining your product to scale your business. You’ll also find out why you need to spot your customers’ pain; how lazy townsfolk can be encouraged to recycle their waste; and why Yahoo didn’t bother to buy Google when it had the chance. If someone handed you a million dollars today, do you think you could use it to create a successful company? Most people wouldn’t be so sure – and it goes without saying that money isn’t all it takes to develop a successful product. Money can even hurt your business endeavor by breeding complacency; after all, necessity is the mother of invention. As a result, start-ups with little seed capital often know exactly what’s essential to their product. On the other hand, when time and money flow freely, and there’s thus no need to manage either resource carefully, innovation often fails – or never occurs at all. Just take an example from 1996, when the video game developer 3D Realms created the wildly successful game, Duke Nukem 3D. They finished development of the game in around 18 months with very little capital. Then, with the millions of dollars the game brought in, they got to work making the eagerly anticipated sequel, Duke Nukem Forever. Unfortunately, the money they made bought them too much time. Decisions were never made and, in the end, the company wasted 12 years in the development stage before scrapping the game, which was never released. It just goes to show that money really isn’t everything, and the same can be said of “brilliant” ideas. Such seemingly perfect visions often inspire blind trust, and the determination to make these ideas a reality at all costs can prove risky. When they’re convinced that their idea is rock solid, many entrepreneurs take the “ready, fire, aim” approach. In other words, they develop and launch their project as quickly as they can, pouring money into it because they’re certain they’ll be able to adapt to the needs of customers later on. It’s not hard to see why this approach often fails; it leads to products that attract zero demand, like a lawn mower rental service in Manhattan. Because of this failure to account for what customers want, entrepreneurs who follow this model may soon find themselves buried in debt. But if money and great ideas won’t help you launch a thriving business, what will? You’ll find out in the upcoming blinks. Every day, we come up against small and sometimes major annoyances, from faulty tea bags to unnecessarily complicated accounting software. While such failures can be a pain, each of them is also an opportunity. Every one of these nuisances has the potential to be a springboard to a thriving business. All you have to do to make the jump from annoying problem to lucrative company is understand how these issues affect potential customers – and then address them with a neat solution. Just take Steve Jobs of Apple fame. He saw how difficult it was to load music files onto MP3 players and, to deal with this issue, created the user-friendly iPod, along with the iTunes software, which enabled users to easily sync their music to their devices. Or consider the American software company Intuit, which realized what a bother it was for small business owners to sit through the 125 screens it took to set up the company’s standard accounting software. Most of these entrepreneurs didn’t have time for IT matters, and not all of them were computer geniuses. After noticing this problem, Intuit created Quicken, an accounting software geared toward small business owners, complete with a setup process reduced to just three screens. This simple adjustment led to a 20-percent increase in the company’s annual revenue. So, it’s clear that your product must address the pain that potential customers experience, and that’s just as true when you’re catering to individuals as when you’re working for big cities. For instance, Patrick Fitzgerald, founder of the New York-based company Recyclebank, noticed that some American cities spend huge sums of money to dump trash. This expense is caused by the failure of many residents to recycle, which could actually generate income for the city. To solve the problem, Fitzgerald implemented a scheme in 2014 in which residents are rewarded by way of discounts on Recyclebank’s online store, OneTwine, depending on how much they recycle. His solution helped boost the recycling rate in one Philadelphia suburb from 7 to 90 percent; today, Recyclebank operates all over the country. You now know the central importance that solving problems has in the creation of successful businesses. But what if your competitors are already hard at work solving the same problem as you? Apple didn’t invent the computer, the smartphone or the MP3 player, but the company is wildly successful in each of these market sectors. Why is that? Because they innovated by combining existing inventions with new insights. It’s exactly this process that enables successful entrepreneurs to generate incredible improvements. Put simply, innovation is the ability to take an already existing invention and build upon it to create a competitive advantage. Just take solar panels; they’ve been sold commercially for decades and solar-powered cars were even being produced as early as 1962. But they never did very well in commercial markets until engineers adapted the panels to domestic uses. Home solar has gained lots of popularity recently and solar panels are now a multibillion-dollar industry. Or consider Kawasaki, a company that was once the leading manufacturer of jet skis. The problem was that their jet skis came without seats, which naturally made them uncomfortable to ride. So, when competitors like Sea-Doo built jet skis with seats, customers preferred them so much that Kawasaki couldn’t hold its position in the market and all but vanished. In this way, innovation is all about gaining insight, and you can do so by studying the habits and preferences of your target customers until you fully understand their needs. A great example is Sam Walton, who founded Wal-Mart in 1962. He didn’t invent self-service shopping, but he did see this new trend as the future of commerce. He immediately understood the tremendous cost reduction that could be achieved by placing clerks only at checkouts, rather than throughout the store. By carefully observing and interviewing customers at his competitors’ stores, he came to understand how he could improve customer experience – and he clearly succeeded. Each aspect of the store and customer experience was meticulously monitored during this process, from the reaction of patrons as they entered the store to the distance between the checkouts and the front door. When making a big purchase, people tend to seek out information from one source or another, whether it’s a trusted friend or online customer reviews. Regardless of which method works for you, understanding how you, and eventually your customers, learn about products is key to understanding consumer preferences. After all, to run a successful business, you need to understand every aspect of the market you operate in, especially your customers. For instance, where do customers learn about your product? And what do they read about it? Questions like these are of critical importance as you fine-tune your marketing strategy. Just take SuperMac, a company that produces auxiliary devices intended exclusively for use with Macintosh computers. In 1989, when it was close to bankruptcy, two venture firms put up $8 million to revitalize the company. The new vice president of marketing, Steven Blank, made the decision to call customers to get a deeper sense of their behavior. Through this process, it was discovered that, contrary to the company’s assumption, price wasn’t the most important factor for their customers, and neither were the products’ technical specifications. Instead, customers were basing their buying decisions entirely on magazine reviews. Once you’ve identified the factors that influence your customers’ buying decisions, such as peer recommendations or media coverage, you can adapt your communication strategies to fit them. In the case of SuperMac, with the knowledge that its customers were relying so heavily on reviews, the company changed its marketing strategy and was able to pull itself out of bankruptcy. As part of this communications strategy, the company designed its own industry benchmarks to measure the performance of hardware, before promoting them as standards for the whole industry. Not long after, the Potrero benchmarks, named after the street on which SuperMac’s offices were located, were adopted by technology magazines. As the creators of these standards, SuperMac was suddenly perfectly positioned to control the market. How do you beat a chess master at her own game? By developing a cunning strategy. And that’s exactly what it takes to beat competitors in your market. To succeed, your strategy should be founded on solid knowledge of what your customers want. For instance, the online grocery service Webvan didn’t conduct enough market research before launching. As a result, it wildly overestimated the degree to which customers would want to buy groceries on the internet. Following tons of expensive investments, like those needed to build infrastructure, stock warehouses and buy a fleet of trucks, the company discovered that customers were only making 40 percent of the purchases it had anticipated. The company was driven into bankruptcy in 2001, losing $1 billion. To avoid landing in a similar situation, it’s crucial to observe the purchasing habits of your customers and learn how you can cater your product and strategy to their needs. As soon as you manage to turn this knowledge into a strategy, you can use it to fine-tune your business model, making it reproducible. This last factor is especially important, since efficient business models have to be repeatable on a regular basis. In its early stages, a business model will invariably go through major changes, but this should quickly give way to a steadier strategy that only requires minor adjustments to succeed. For example, when it was first starting out, all Apple produced was a kit for people to assemble their own computers. These days, although they release new products from time to time, the majority of their business comes from making slight improvements to their existing products and repeating this process as hardware capabilities improve. And finally, to refine your business model, seek out opportunities that’ll enable you to corner your market, take over your competitors or undertake mergers. There’s a lesson to be learned here from Yahoo, which once turned down an offer to buy the young tech company Google. Yahoo was so busy trying to nail down the markets for online media, sports and finance that the company couldn’t see the incredibly lucrative opportunity at hand. It’s no secret today that Google dominates the market for internet searches; it regularly acquires competitors and is constantly improving its products to become the archetype of an easily repeated business model. Once your business takes off, it might be a completely different beast than you started out with. This process is as normal as a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, but it may well require you to hire outside managers who will need complete control and authority to scale your company. This can prove to be a sticking point because many start-up CEOs have a difficult time letting go of their babies. You’ll have to remind yourself that business managers have far more experience managing large businesses than new entrepreneurs do. Just take Craigslist, a classifieds website that lists everything from furniture to jobs. The site’s founder, Craig Newmark, didn’t think of himself as experienced enough to manage a big company. So, in 2000, he promoted Jim Buckmaster, a Virginia Tech graduate and Craigslist employee, to handle management. With Buckmaster covering this base, Newmark could focus on what he did best: customer service. Since then, Buckmaster has remained in his position and Newmark’s decision helped Craigslist become the multibillion-dollar business it is today. But relinquishing control isn’t all it will take to get you to scale. You’ll also need a proven business model backed up by paying users. After all, scaling your business before you’ve got a strong customer base is foolhardy; before you begin growing, your business needs to at least be self-sustaining. For instance, during the dot-com boom of the 1990s, hundreds of companies were rushing to scale as quickly as possible. The problem was that they had unverified business models and their valuations were based on nothing but hype. As a result, many of these companies burned through their resources before getting a foothold in the market. On the other hand, the e-commerce site eBay grew slowly, expanding in lockstep with the number of users it had, and only began scaling once internet service providers could charge based on the amount of traffic a site generated. This decision helped eBay become the world’s largest e-commerce platform, with an impressive annual revenue of over $8 billion. The key message in this book: Successful entrepreneurs know that customer needs should guide their product development – and not the other way around. So, instead of investing all your money in an idea that seems brilliant, learn about your customers, study the market and test your business plan before going to scale. Actionable advice: Find out what your customers want using A/B testing.  Quantitative methods can give you a clear, numerical picture of what your customers want. One popular method is called A/B testing. To use this technique, simply offer product A to one group of customers and product B to another group. Then, ask the participants in each group how pleased they are with their respective product. By comparing the answers, you’ll find out which product is more popular in general. Got feedback?

For decades, customers loved what you offered and recognized your brand from a mile away. Then all of a sudden competitors have outflanked you – a hungry new rival could even make everything you offer redundant. What are you going to do?  Well, you can either wait on the sidelines and hope to find a new market, or you can act radically. In all likelihood, you’ll need to do the latter – stop treading water and start swimming. In the following blinks, we’ll look at how established companies can install a permanent growth mind-set at the heart of their operations by acting more like start-ups. Even creaky fifty-year-old organizations can learn to move with the freshness and agility of first-time entrepreneurs. In these blinks, you’ll learn when American capitalism began to rot from the inside; why Microsoft’s new CEO had to reinvent the organization; and how Bubble Wrap was invented. Let’s go back in time to the dawn of American capitalism. In the late nineteenth century – the days of the Rockefellers and Carnegies, of venerable mustaches and top hats – big business behaved itself. These were civic-minded, patriotic enterprises, which served customers and country. Businesses looked to provide a reliable product – say, good whiskey or a trusty tricycle – and preserve a connection with the consumers who bought their goods. Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, something changed. By the 1960s, American mega-corporations were focusing on accumulating profit rather than serving consumers’ needs. By this time, they were now more concerned with paying corporate executives massive sums than with fixing customer problems. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith diagnosed this situation in his book The New Industrial State, which claimed that big corporations raked in enormous profits at the expense of the betterment of society. In response to this book, two economists, Michael C.  Jensen and William H. Meckling, published an influential paper titled “Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behaviour, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure.” They also railed against the state of American capitalism. But rather than encouraging corporations to serve customers better, they told them to look after their shareholders. Shareholders, who had been the lowest priority, were growing disgruntled when business suffered a dip in the late 1960s. Worried that their discontent could blow up the economy, many businesses took the advice of Jensen and Meckling and decided that they would prioritize shareholders above all else. The shift to gratifying shareholders meant that business became completely detached from public or consumer needs. Many businesses became obsessed with shareholder appeasement, and abandoned any activity that didn’t boost stock prices. This meant that, naturally, rather than investing capital into developing that new car, computer or fashion line, businesses focused on cutting expenditures. The more efficient they became, the better the ratios were for shareholders. There’s a great metaphor to illustrate what happened next. Picture a small mother-bird with a huge cuckoo chick in her nest. She forgets her own chicks, choosing to feed only the cuckoo, which grows ever more enormous. Similarly, businesses that once looked to serve their customers and grow their enterprises became consumed with tending to their shareholders. Consequently, they stopped innovating and stopped growing. If a great white shark stops swimming, oxygen can’t pass through its gills, so it sinks and dies. When they stop innovating, big businesses tend to do the same. Stasis leads to a gradual – or sometimes, steep – decline. Modern start-ups understand this, so many foster a very different mind-set to long-established companies. Unlike established businesses obsessed with shareholder returns, start-ups look to provide new solutions to customer problems. They seek to identify a “pain point” or “friction point” for consumers. Think of the social media giant, Facebook. Back when it was cooked up in Mark Zuckerberg’s dormitory room, he foresaw a pain point. He sensed that many people – far beyond the Ivy League colleges where Facebook was initially tested – would love to keep in contact with family members and friends, to share photographs and stories across the world. We all know what happened next – Facebook grew to become one of the world’s most successful enterprises. Or consider the food-delivery service, Deliveroo. In this case, the pain point was the lack of delivery options for restaurant cuisine. In fact, Deliveroo’s founder, Will Shu, discovered this pain point himself while working late nights in Morgan Stanley’s London office. Rather than incremental tinkering, start-up culture encourages innovation that leads to long-term growth. Rather than simply tweaking existing products and improving proven processes, the start-up mind-set means embracing risk and facing the future. Although it sounds counterintuitive, in today’s fast-paced commercial climate, this is also the only way that a company can achieve sustainable growth. By continuing to seek solutions for endless customer problems, companies with a start-up mind-set can grow. If we look at the top five companies according to market capitalization in 2018 – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook – we see a common thread. All of those companies have adopted this start-up mind-set, and all continue to innovate and seek new customer solutions. What we’ve outlined here is the New to Big philosophy – the key to taking an idea with potential and letting it grow exponentially. In the next blink, we’ll learn how one established company adopted some of these strategies to save itself. Microsoft is a corporate powerhouse. As we learned in the last blink, in 2018, it was one of the top five companies according to market capitalization. It was on this list back in 2001, too, alongside General Electric, ExxonMobil, Citigroup and Walmart. Between 2001 and 2018, however, Microsoft dropped out of the top five. What happened? Microsoft lost its spark when Bill Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000. When the next CEO Steve Ballmer took over, rather than continuing the world-changing work of the founder, he applied a staid, incrementalist logic. While other tech firms were racing ahead and breaking new ground (notably, Google and Apple), Microsoft offered a series of drab products that imitated others, rather than stamping their individuality on the world. Then, in 2014, a new CEO was appointed who turned things around. This was Satya Nadella, who approached his job at Microsoft – a 44-year-old company with a rich legacy – as if he was taking the reins at a new start-up. He approached his role with a completely new mind-set, which he articulated in an interview in 2015. “We no longer talk about lagging indicators of success – revenue, profit. What are the leading indicators of success? Customer love.” In his book, Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone, Nadella sets out his philosophy, which entails promoting bold new ideas, making space for employees to experiment and fail and keeping an eye on the long view, rather than worrying about quarterly returns. Nadella has successfully shaped Microsoft into a kind of hybrid, where all the resources, capital and brand-recognition of a corporate behemoth meet entrepreneurial risk-taking. Now, with a double-digit profit margin growth every quarter, it’s clear that his tactics are paying off. You could say that Nadella has refounded Microsoft. So, what can we learn from Microsoft’s story? Not just that we can reinvent established companies, but that it’s positively necessary for their survival. In the same way that we should meet new challenges throughout our lives to remain agile, big companies must keep moving to keep their vitality.   What’s the difference between the dinosaurs of the corporate world and their hungry new challengers? A different mind-set, which runs from top to bottom. This is the difference between the Total Addressable Market model and the Total Addressable Problem model. Let’s begin with the Total Addressable Market, or TAM, model. This framework has been used for decades – it’s the main religion of the corporate world. Established companies are hardwired to use it. It addresses the problem of how big a market is, and how big a share of that market the business can reasonably expect to command. It works with what is knowable and battles competitors for a market share, modifying their existing products or services only. Rather than prioritizing new customer pain points, they focus mostly on their own – like stock prices and short-term financial success. And as we’ve seen, businesses that follow this approach in today’s world can begin to stagnate. In the worst circumstances, they can become obsolete. Of course, the TAM model isn’t completely misguided. If you’re in the lipstick business and you want to manufacture a new lip-gloss, you could use the TAM model to estimate how big a market you could reasonably expect to conquer. But, beyond that, it loses its authority. It’s like exploring the flora of a new planet with a guidebook from earth. By contrast, the Total Addressable Problem model is the way to achieve exponential growth. Because the TAP model is based on discovering brand-new customer problems or needs, it can uncover new markets. It is the untouched markets that will lead to growth, rather than those with lots of competition already.  Take the mobile phone. When it first came on the market, it was a bulky device aimed almost exclusively at high-powered executives. The Total Addressable Problem area seemed small. But as they became lighter, smaller and more affordable, demand blew up. Electronics designers had sensed that mobiles were addressing a far larger problem – mobile communication for everyone. This was the untouched market that would yield enormous returns for the first mobile phone manufacturers. Now that we’ve moved to the TAP model, we need to think differently about all aspects of doing business. That starts with anticipating what customers want. Rather than simply tweaking an existing product or idea to better suit the customer, those with a growth mind-set need to begin from where the customers are. In other words, you need to look at what customers actually do, rather than what they say they’ll do. Take the voice of the customer approach, where companies encourage customers to give feedback. Often what happens is that customers are socialized to give the answers they think they should provide. Say a leading tech firm is conducting research for a new app that locates nearby fine-dining opportunities. In their market research, they ask people what they think of the app and how much they’d spend on it. A good number of potential customers reportedly like the app and would spend $15 a month to use it.  A company approaching this in the old way, with a TAM mind-set, would report that the app received a “positive response” and that customers “would spend $15.” A company with a growth mind-set would finish their market research with another question – “Will you commit to signing up for it now?” If the answer to that is equivocal or negative, they’d report that the app probably doesn’t present such a great opportunity. You need to be ready to dump your idea and begin anew if customer research takes you elsewhere. Let’s say you’re a company that makes chewable candy and you’re looking to make a new product, but are aware that processed sugar is viewed negatively. In this case, you’d try to understand your customers and how they really feel. You find that both your die-hard fans and occasional purchasers associate eating your snack with “treating themselves.” So rather than the new sugar-free chewable candy idea that you started with, you’re now in the business of “treats.” Then, rather than manufacturing chewable candy, you can think of other ways that people like to “treat themselves,” like carob snacks, makeup or succulent houseplants. What’s the lesson here? Rather than acting like the focus-group researchers of yesteryear, you need to be a dynamic, flexible observer. Every email sent by the venture capitalist Esther Dyson comes with a footer that reads, “Always make new mistakes!” What does she mean by this? Let’s have a look. The results of productive failure are all around us. Take the lubricant, WD-40. Guess why there’s the number “40” after “WD” (which stands for Water Displacement). That’s right – it took 40 attempts before the company perfected the formula. Or consider Bubble Wrap. It was initially conceived as a futuristic, trendy textured wallpaper. It bombed, and only became a success when the company IBM used it to wrap computer parts for transport. Without this accident, it was destined for the landfill. But, much to its detriment, executive culture is afraid of admitting mistakes. Established companies don’t like failure – it’s not the way they’re wired. The executives who run them are highly competitive people who like winning. The valuable learning process of failure is alien to them. This influences everyone at the company who’d rather tiptoe around the leadership than voice their misgivings about the company’s direction. So, rather than making small mistakes from which the company could learn crucial lessons, a doomed project could be kept alive for too long, leading to a huge waste of money and company time. It’s important, then, to encourage productive failure. If you’re a big company and you wish to create an environment in which employees can experiment and fail interestingly, then you need to create an atmosphere in which it is acceptable to do so. This means allowing for lots of small, fast and cheap failures from which innovators can learn. It also means encouraging leaders to kill off doomed projects and for subordinates and confront their superiors with the truth. Failure is intrinsic to innovation. In the next blink, we’ll look at how companies can create a structure that incorporates this innovation. If you’re a business leader at a TAM-oriented company who wants to switch to a TAP mind-set, you’ll need a great team to make it happen. You’ll likely have the employees you need in your organization already. However, the people who’ve succeeded at your company may not be ready for the challenge of innovative entrepreneurialism. These high-performers will probably think according to the way big companies usually operate – which, as we’ve already seen, is incrementalist and risk-averse. Instead, seek out the iconoclasts, free-thinkers and contrarians. These individuals may have been passed over for promotion in the past because they’re considered “interesting” misfits, rather than smooth operators. There are important traits you can look for to narrow down potential recruits. First of all, they should be adaptable. They need to figure out what to do when tried-and-tested processes and ideas don’t work. For instance, if a project leads them into radically different terrain from where they began, they can change direction without breaking stride. Remember the chewable candy example we looked at earlier? The company junked candy altogether and decided it would move into marketing a “treat” – that is what adaptability means.   High on the list of necessary characteristics is curiosity. In other words, they should be able to detect patterns between what look like disparate or unrelated sources and trends and build innovative business ideas from them. They should also be humble. One important aspect of innovative entrepreneurialism is the ability to work collaboratively. This isn’t about the egotistical individual – it’s about what individuals can achieve together as a team. Finally, they should be passionate about experimentation. This is the superpower – the potential candidate must be a relentless experimenter. They should be something of a mad scientist, absolutely determined to crack the code. In our final blink, we’ll look at how to finance these wild ideas in a way that doesn’t spell disaster for a company. If you don’t buy a ticket, you can’t win the lottery. When investing in new business ideas, it’s a bit more complicated than this. However, the notion of risk is the same, and you can increase your chances of success by following a few of the following ideas.  Firstly, companies need to make it easier to secure permission to invest in new ideas. Though risk-taking isn’t limited to disruptive new start-ups, it can be tricky to get permission to try new ideas at long-standing companies used to refining their existing business model. This is often because budgets are allocated annually, and the process of securing funding can be incredibly bureaucratic and cumbersome. In fact, many new ideas die before they even pass under the nose of senior leadership.  One way to make it easier for funding to flow into new ideas is to install a Growth Board. A Growth Board is a small team at the top of the company. This team quickly judges the merits of new ideas, allocates funding and monitors the development of each scheme. But rather than allocating a large amount of funding all at once – as is often the case in established companies with an inflexible budgeting process – they should invest small amounts at the beginning of each project.  Then, as the project unfolds, more funding can be allocated if it succeeds. At each step, funding can either be awarded or withdrawn – this process instills the kind of combativeness and urgency that all start-ups face. And, importantly, this step-by-step process means that the whole venture can be “de-risked.” If the idea is flagging, the Growth Board can simply withdraw funding at an early stage.   And because most new business ideas fail, it’s best to invest in many at once. The great thing about the Growth Board model is that established companies can keep many different pots on the boil at once. Just like investments in the stock market, the majority of new business ideas aren’t successful. They can be interesting and useful failures, but not viable. But companies significantly increase their chances of hitting on one of those golden ideas – like Uber or Airbnb – if they hedge their bets. With this setup, a company can take risks and innovate. This is called the always-on mind-set – and the results can be incredible The key message in these blinks: Big companies seeking growth must act with the dynamism and flexibility of new start-ups. Otherwise, they face stagnation and obsolescence. The key to growth is to provide new solutions to customer pain points, which can be ascertained by an attentive approach to market research. To introduce this growth model into a big organization, a special team of maverick innovators must be employed.  Actionable advice:  Read outside of your comfort zone. If you’re an executive or corporate type, don’t just read books by other executives and business minds. Read art theory, philosophy and good novels. You might just find that the imaginative truths in works far removed from your own sphere inspire you to develop new commercial ideas.   Got feedback?

What to read next: The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen You’re now familiar with the challenges that big corporations face if they don’t learn to innovate quickly. Just because they have a solid legacy and good management practices, they might still be at risk of falling into serious stagnation. Through historical examples, Clayton M. Christensen explains why it’s the companies that seem to be doing everything right – good management culture, an established brand – that are suddenly blindsided by disruptive technologies. But not only can they survive in the face of these innovations, they can actually harness them to their own advantage.

Even if this prediction is still a longshot, advances in medical technology and better living standards are making it easier for people all over the world to live longer. Needless to say, this growing demographic poses serious challenges to the world economy, such as how exactly countries and markets will be able to support a new generation of centenarians. This dilemma is just one of four major global trends – or disruptions – that are transforming the world today. What are the others? These blinks will show you. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why money is getting more and more expensive; why you might not find your favorite gum in China; and how Netflix is blurring the boundaries of the media business. The quarter-century before the crash of 2008 was a time of unparalleled economic development. Interest rates were low; natural resources cheap; jobs plentiful and workers adequately employed.  But that phase is now over. Today, we’re entering a new phase, marked by four globally disruptive trends. These trends are: a shifting focal point of economic activity and dynamism; an acceleration in technology’s scope, scale and economic impact; an aging global population; and a greater degree of connection through trade, capital information and people.  While these trends certainly present major challenges, they’ve also been the driving force behind pulling some one billion people worldwide out of poverty since 1990.  In short, increased connectivity and advances in technology have spurred economic growth. The shifting locus of economic activity as a result has meant more development in ever more remote regions, further ameliorating the burden of poverty in these areas.  This new world is thus going to be wealthier and more urban, with higher skill levels and better health than previous generations.  These four global trends interact in complicated ways, however, which makes predicting future conditions increasingly difficult. Not just that, but such forecasts are often based on past experiences and outmoded ways of thinking. To succeed in this new world, we need to reformulate our prior notions about how the economy works. For instance, supply and demand traditionally says that when demand for financing is high, capital becomes more expensive; and then, demand will abate. But now the opposite is true. Emerging markets the world over are rapidly building capital-intensive infrastructure and spurring demand, even though the cost of financing continues to rise.  But this is just one example of how old ways of thinking aren’t keeping up with changing conditions. Let’s take a closer look at today’s four disruptive forces. Have you ever heard of Hsinchu? Few people have, yet this northern Taiwanese city is home to many of the world’s largest and most advanced electronics companies.  In fact, about half of global growth leading up to 2025 will originate in some 440 medium-sized cities in emerging markets – many largely unknown. In the years between 1990 and 2010, the world’s economic center experienced a rapid shift, more extreme than in any other point in history, and this shift was directed east, toward Asia.  One reason for this shift was the crisis of 2008 and the subsequent global recession, which had a greater impact on Western countries. The shift also occurred astoundingly quickly.  While Britain, with a population of less than 10 million, took 154 years to double its economic output per capita, China took just 12 years to do the same, with a population of more than a billion. Urbanization is one reason for this stratospheric growth. In just over a decade from now, China will have three times the number of urban dwellers as does the United States today.  The bottom line is that cities are powerful economic engines. At its core, a city is a productivity center that facilitates the rapid spread of knowledge and trends. A dense population means more exchange, but also often better infrastructure and stronger educational systems. Today’s cities are also attracting droves of talented, well-educated young people.  These elements taken together make cities ready-made creative laboratories for innovative companies looking to test new technologies, products and business strategies.  In fact, three-quarters of the gross domestic product gap between the United States and Europe can be explained by the fact that Americans are more likely to live in major metropolitan areas.  Yet urban areas also have their share of troubles, such as congestion, public services shortages and supply problems that can mean high costs for local operations. It’s factors such as these that make the port city of Luanda in Angola the most expensive city in the world. Technology is evolving faster and faster. In the 1990s, it took a team of scientists 13 years and $3 billion to sequence the human genome; today, one machine and $1,000 can do the job in a few hours.  It’s a fact that digitization and mobile internet access is fueling today’s technological revolution. Digitization, or the conversion of information into 1s and 0s, has indeed made it easier to store, process and share data. Physical products such as books can now be converted into digital formats.  But digitization also reduces entry costs and in general lowers barriers to market participation, which allows more entrepreneurs and small companies to experiment and innovate.  The growth and ubiquity of the internet is changing the game, too. Just consider the fact that 20 years ago, less than three percent of people in the world had a cellphone, and less than 1 percent had reliable access to the internet. Today, some two-thirds of all people own a mobile phone, and one-third can access the internet!  The revolution in technology has also meant that consumers are adapting to market changes faster than ever. Once Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, for example, it took some 50 years before even half of American households owned a phone. Yet a mere five years after the first iPhone was introduced, half of all Americans owned a smartphone. In fact, technological revolutions are happening so quickly that companies which can’t keep up will struggle and potentially fail. One poignant example is the technology company BlackBerry, which failed to anticipate the smartphone revolution. So while a company’s first instinct when faced with rapid change might be to play it safe and let the dust settle, companies need to realize that they’re in a race against time – and the technology of today will be old news tomorrow! Would you want to live to be 100 years old? Given the rapid pace of technological development, you just might. Yet a world with a large elderly demographic will present many new challenges. In 2013, approximately 60 percent of the global population lived in countries with fertility rates that were below the replacement rate – the rate that maintains a stable population, about 2.1 births per woman in developed nations, and 2.5 births in developing countries.  This trend means that a smaller global workforce will be reliant on increased productivity to keep driving growth to support a growing elderly population.  But a world with fewer workers and caregivers also makes elder care a question of technology. In Japan, for instance, robots now help elderly citizens dress themselves and go grocery shopping. Over the next few decades, populations everywhere excepting certain African countries will reach peak population for the first time in the modern age.  Some nations may be able to support a declining workforce with an increase in immigration, like Germany is trying to do, but the elderly population will still grow as life-expectancy rates rise.  Even though this trend has been obvious for some time, governments, communities and even corporations have been slow to come up with ways to adapt.  Pension systems, as just one example, need to change to meet rising life expectancies, such as increasing the age of retirement – or many people will simply struggle to survive.  Employers for too long have focused on maintaining a younger workforce. Instead of seeing older workers as valuable experts, they’re viewed as a costly legacy. The elderly have been ignored as consumers, too. So while senior citizens spend less on entertainment and eating out, they do spend more on home furnishings, medication and household electronics. Some companies however have rethought their strategy in tapping this market, like Fujitsu, which is developing a walking cane with a built-in navigation system. You might have studied abroad, or perhaps have close friends who live in another country. At the very least, you certainly have purchased a product that was made abroad. All these things are solid proof that the world is growing more connected every day.  In fact, trade between countries and continents is rising. For instance, while China and Africa booked $9 billion in trade activity in 2000, by 2012 this number had risen to $211 billion. But it’s not just trade that’s become more global; people, finance and data, too, are crossing borders.   Yet this increasingly interconnected world also means increased vulnerability. Shocks in seemingly remote areas, which decades ago would have caused less than a ripple in the global market, now have global repercussions. Unrest in the Ukraine or financial strife in Greece are just two examples of events that affect everyone, not just local citizens. This is a result of trade and interconnectivity not simply growing but broadening and branching out to form a truly global web.  Money in particular is flowing across the globe; despite the 2008 financial crisis, global money transfers are still on an upward trend. Not just that, but people too are more connected globally. In fact, migration numbers in the 1990s doubled during the first decade of the twenty-first century, especially growing between developing regions.  And of course, the labor market is almost entirely globalized. But the most dramatic change of recent years is likely the speed at which information travels around the world.  For business, increased connectivity holds huge potential. That’s because global interconnectivity is opening up the market to greater competition.  One of the many examples of companies that have benefited from this new climate is German micro-multinational company Solar Brush, a Berlin-based start-up that designs lightweight robots to clean solar panels. Today the company has an office in Chile, and supports customers across America and the Middle East.  Without the connections and affordability of modern technology, such a nimble company could never have existed! It’s clear the world is changing. Thriving in the new global economy means living in reality, not the faded glory of the past. One thing that needs to be accounted for is the heterogeneity of the new global consumer class, which makes segmentation and localization more essential than ever.  In 1990, for instance, 43 percent of the developing world’s population lived in extreme poverty. Today 700 million fewer people live in poverty, and the consumer class has grown by 1.2 billion. These people are now online and purchasing items – yet don’t get distracted by the group’s sheer size.  While new markets are growing, they’re also fragmenting. That’s because there’s no quintessential global consumer – companies need to understand local markets. For example, the instant coffee Nestlé sells in China is sweeter than it is in the West; and while chewing gum company Wrigley holds a 40 percent market share in China, it didn’t earn it with its best-selling spearmint but with locally specific flavors.  An understanding of a local market is essential, but so is securing local channels of distribution. For instance, Coca-Cola makes sure to analyze and segment its range of retail outlets, from the biggest stores to bicycle-powered micro-distributors in Africa.  Companies also need to prepare for unexpected competition. In fact, with barriers to entry lowered due to technological advances, small companies everywhere have the chance to take on and beat world leaders. That’s exactly what happened to eBay when it fell second to Chinese-based Alibaba, which a mere decade ago was just a minor player in the Chinese online market.  Technology is also blurring business lines, fostering new competition. For instance, Netflix got its start using the internet to distribute content, acting like a video rental store. But as the company grew, it began to dabble in content production, an activity generally kept separate from distribution.  The result? Netflix today is a formidable content producer, competing with major studios for consumer attention. So you’ve seen how world markets are being shaken up, and that as a result, global businesses can run into trouble. But this shouldn’t scare you out of the game.  However, to stay on track and succeed it’s important to be clear about the risks and opportunities.  Many commodity prices are climbing as demand grows worldwide. At the same time, the global market for resources is growing more connected. Yet there are still other factors contributing to a steady rise in global prices. Environmental costs are becoming increasingly an issue, as extreme weather due to climate change causes market disruptions and a subsequent rise in prices. According to the Brookings Institute, if the health and environmental costs linked to coal were taken into account, the price of the commodity would increase 170 percent! So is there a way to manage these spiraling costs? By producing less waste, building better logistics networks and recycling used products, we can find new opportunities amid scarcity.  But governments will also have to remain vigilant and flexible in policy, as these issues too will affect labor markets, regulations and education. Only by being open and adaptive to change will governments find the right method to tackling the new world’s challenges.  In the future, governments should employ incentives to accelerate change, such as with the pressing need to address aging populations. Fair regulations should be crafted in direct response to these needs, to ensure that information flows easily and businesses are allowed to run smoothly.  Naturally, every country will need to find the right mix of strategies for its particular situation.  Estonia is a great example of a country that has harnessed information to increase productivity. The country’s 1.3 million citizens use electronic ID cards to vote, pay taxes and gain access to over 160 semi-private services, such as property registration.  Before 2008 when world markets were more stable, it was possible to make longer-term predictions. Unfortunately that’s no longer an option.  The demand for cash today is on the rise. By 2030, the world will need to spend some $57 trillion to $67 trillion on improving infrastructure such as roads, buildings, telecommunications networks, ports and water systems. However, it’s still unclear whether this money will even be available. How can that be? Before 2008, cash was cheaper to acquire, yet today things have changed. Capital now is more expensive, which makes investing a challenge; and market systems in general are more volatile. Yet since we can’t say whether we’re entering a period in which expansive monetary policies and the monetization of debt – tactics that have long been viewed as taboo – are going to become common practice, we have to prepare for both scenarios.  So thriving in this new environment means tapping new capital sources, including sovereign wealth funds such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority or the Korea Investment Authority, and dealing with market risks in a more flexible manner.  Another uncertainty is how jobs will develop. While many regions recovered from the recession, an increase in jobs didn’t follow. At the same time, higher-skilled workers are being replaced by technology.  As a result, our very definition of work is transforming, becoming more about what people do wherever they are and less about a fixed location.  But this changing definition brings with it a paradox: while we’re seeing a shortage of highly-skilled labor, we’re also witnessing at the same time a situation in which it’s harder for college graduates to find jobs.  Overcoming this will require companies to adapt creatively. That doesn’t just mean seeking out talent from overseas but also investing in education. The automotive industry in the United States, as one example, has taken the initiative to train its own workers. The Automotive Manufacturing Training and Education Collective partners with car companies and community colleges to create courses designed with employers’ needs in mind. The key message in this book: The world economy is in transition. Poverty is decreasing and consumption is on the rise. These changes are throwing into question long-held assumptions about world markets and how they work. To adapt productively, companies, governments and individuals need to be open-minded and flexible.  Actionable advice: Do your research before entering a new market.  Cities are rising centers of consumption, which means local research is more important than ever. So while consumption patterns in large metropolitan regions like New York or Mexico City are relatively similar, that doesn’t mean consumption in all American cities is comparable to all Mexican cities. Thus you need to do research as close as possible to the regional market you want to tap.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Or, while browsing the store shelves, been suddenly struck with a great idea that will fill a gap, and think: \"Why hasn't anyone invented this yet?\" No matter what your inspiration or motivation is, now’s the time to make something out of your idea. One Simple Idea will teach you how to turn your passion into a business and bring your product to market yourself. The author provides a roadmap to guide you through the sticky terrain of developing your one simple idea into a fully realized successful business, providing you with tools and useful advice along the way. This book in blinks answers the following questions: What does it take to start my own business? How do I bring my product into the market?    How will I be able to grow and manage my business? You might think that, given the recent economic downturn in the U.S., now would be a bad time to create a product and attempt to bring it to market. But you’d be wrong. Even during a financial slump, consumer spending in the U.S. accounts for 60-70% of the national economy. The fact is, there will always be certain products that consumers will find irresistible. As an entrepreneur, your main task is to identify such products, then use the right channels to promote them. The products that sell even in a dismal economy are those which improve customers' quality of life without breaking the bank, because consumer spending is motivated by desire, not by necessity. And when it comes to selling your product, the predominance of the Internet, especially social networks, means that nowadays you can easily work out of your home, selling your product online without having to fight for a place on store shelves. Furthermore, social media can help you to connect with your customers, to understand and address their needs and desires, and — because you're closer to your customers — to react swiftly to the whims of the marketplace. But even with the above in your favor, you’ll still need a lot of guidance. So find yourself a mentor who can give you some practical, firsthand advice — ideally someone who’s already successfully launched a similar product. How do you find one? Begin by looking in your hometown, or search the web for successful entrepreneurs from your region. Once you’ve found a suitable candidate, get your foot in the door by expressing interest in what they’ve achieved, even massaging their ego a little. Most people enjoy talking about themselves and will welcome the satisfaction that helping you to succeed will bring them. There are many opportunities and people out there to help you get your business started. Now you have to grab the chance and start with one simple idea. Starting a business for the first time can be scary, and you might even find yourself wondering if you’re cut out to be an entrepreneur. But no one is born an entrepreneur. Like other apparently innate “gifts,” being an entrepreneur is actually learned, and the first step is to make yourself aware that starting your own business requires, above all, passion for your idea and unyielding persistence to get that idea off the ground. Fortunately, passion drives persistence: if you have passion for your idea, and for your customers and work, it will be so important to you that you’ll be extremely motivated to promote it and share it with everyone – which, of course, will help you to sell your product. Also, passion helps you to face the risks and survive the steep learning curve that starting a business always presents. Believing in your idea will spur you to be innovative and opportunistic whenever the business needs it, and to motivate you to learn from the mistakes all businesses make when they are young. Equally importantly: passion for your idea will drive you to go further and try even harder, so that, finally, you will have transformed your great-but-embryonic idea into a full-fledged successful business. Clearly, passion is essential to starting a successful business. But it’s not sufficient. In addition to having passion, you need to be prepared to take full responsibility for your business. This means that, when starting a new business, you must stand behind every decision and mistake you make and deal with the consequences. As leader of your very own enterprise, it’s your job to lead your employees in the right direction – after all, you’re the boss. Finally, taking full responsibility means working hard, usually for long hours, because you have to juggle many tasks and constantly deal with the kinds of changes and surprises involved in getting a business off the ground. One of the main reasons startups fail is because their idea is too ambitious and too complicated. So, if you want your business to succeed, you should start small and keep it simple – and the simplest way is to make a small modification to an existing, successful product. This offers a number of benefits: First, an established product serves an existing demand, so you don’t have to educate the market about its potential value. Second, you can target a different market niche, by adding a unique feature. For example, CelebriDucks added images of celebrities to the rubber duck, transforming a children’s toy into an adult collectible. Finally, by making your product similar to an existing one, it’ll be more likely to find a manufacturer who can produce it at a reasonable cost. But in order to create a sellable product, you first need to study the marketplace. First, get an overview of the market you want to enter, analyze its trends and major players, and learn your customers’ lifestyles and desires. Next, find your unique selling point by solving a common problem or unmet demand in a new way. Once that's done, test your idea on the market. This will give you the chance to modify your product based on customer feedback. After you’ve gotten to know the market, you need to find out as early as possible whether your idea is a potential “money-maker.” This involves ensuring your product will sell for a certain price and in a high enough volume, and that the costs to produce it will still give you the desired profit. To estimate your retail list price, one simple method is to multiply your per-unit production cost by 5. For example, if your manufacturing and packaging cost is $2 per unit, your retail price should be around $10. All that’s left to do is find out whether the price you need to charge to be profitable is a price customers are willing to pay. So you’ve developed your product idea and gotten to know your market. What now? First, it’s time to make a business plan. This is an invaluable step in setting up a profitable business as it will force you to describe your business clearly and concisely: what you’re doing, how you’re doing it and why. It will also help you to forecast your financials — i.e., projections about revenues and expenses — and thus ensure that your business will be profitable. And if you’re looking for external financing, you’ll need a business plan to present to potential investors and to get feedback on your business concept. Second, you need to start small and simple with your business. You don’t need to spend a lot of time or money in order to establish a professional business entity. You can even start by working from home, as many entrepreneurs before you (but don’t use your “home office” for anything else, and make sure you get yourself a business address, like a PO Box). And the only equipment you need to get started is a phone line, a computer with Internet access and, of course, a website. For tax and legal purposes, you need to set up your business entity and decide which structure fits you the best. For example, becoming a limited liability company or a corporation has the advantage of protecting your personal assets, while a smaller and simpler legal entity saves you a lot of time and effort. Starting your own business doesn’t have to wipe you out financially. With a thorough business plan and a simple set-up your business is ready to launch. If you care about your business idea, then it’s natural to be afraid that someone might steal it. Fortunately, however, there are several ways to protect your great idea from the competition. While patenting is probably the most famous method, it’s not always the best. For a start, it involves withholding your idea from people who could help you realize it and bring it to market. Also, the patenting process is costly and takes some time to complete – and time is precious when you need to get a jump on the market. So what are the alternatives? First, since trying to beat big corporations at their own game is hard, you can outsmart the competition by designing something unique. That way, you can claim and defend your Intellectual property rights. Second, use your smallness as an advantage. As a small company, you’re more flexible than a big company, and can therefore bring your new, great idea to the market before they can. Remember: the first to market usually has a huge advantage, so speed is one of your best allies. Finally, keep the creative juices flowing even if your first idea is a market success; you need to stay current to stay ahead of the pack. Another way to protect your idea is to build relationships with everyone you work with. Forming relationships with some of the major players can convert them from competitors into allies – especially if you offer them a business opportunity. For example, Hot Picks eliminated one of their leading competitors, Dunlop, by contracting them to produce their guitar picks. Building strong relationships with your retailers is equally essential. They are on the front line and can provide great protection for your business if you provide them with great products, service and competitive prices. Being quicker than the competition and keeping good relationships with your partners will give you protection and peace of mind before you introduce your product to the market. Even if you start small and simple, at some point you’ll need cash. Of course, there are many funding options available to you. The simplest way, however, is to use your own money and avoid any external obligations as far as possible. This is because people tend to work harder to keep their own money; they don’t spend it as freely as borrowed money and tend to have more control over it. After all, would you spend your own money on a business-class flight without a second thought? Another reason to use your own money is that you won’t allow as many external constraints or as much external pressure to build, which gives you more freedom to run of your business as you see fit. Of course, this advice has its limits: no one would recommend liquidating all of your assets and depleting your savings to get your business off the ground. So what’s an alternative source of funding that won’t put too much pressure on your business? “Free” money. “Free” money – for instance, via crowdfunding or grants – helps you limit the amount of initial debt you generate, so you can bootstrap until some cash comes flowing in. Crowdfunding means that a group of individuals provide small amounts of money to a startup. You can promote your idea via online crowdfunding platforms, which reach a large number of potential contributors. Non-equity crowdfunding is particularly attractive, since it means you literally get the money as a gift. Grants have the advantage that they oblige you only to demonstrate that you need the money and explain how it will be used for your business. Grants are available to help with both startup costs and growing your business later on. So, to keep it simple and finance your business without a mountain of debts in the beginning, take all the “free” money you can get your hands on, and start growing from there. If you can’t make your product at the right cost, you’re not going to make a profit. It’s essential, therefore, to find the right manufacturer. Most contract manufacturers specialize in a certain area, so some might have the experience and expertise you need to produce your product. To find the right manufacturer, you need to vigorously investigate those you’re considering, by, for instance, getting a referral from someone who produces a similar product to yours, and using due diligence when evaluating other potential manufacturers. Investigate the most promising manufacturers thoroughly by getting into direct contact and, if possible, visiting the facilities. Since you’ll need to make changes to your product, especially in the beginning, it’s best to choose a manufacturer based in your home country. It’s much simpler to communicate and negotiate with such a manufacturer than with one overseas, as that would involve using a sourcing agent. To help you narrow your choices down, ask potential manufacturers for a quotation to check out their prices, capabilities and services. Then choose the option that suits you best. So you’ve decided on a manufacturer. What’s next? You need to set up your supply chain. In order to collaborate with your suppliers and partners to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, it’s crucial to build tight relationships with them so that they can keep you updated about any issues affecting your product, as well as to understand every link in your supply chain. Once you finally do start selling, keep a tight rein on your inventory. At the start, you should have a certain amount of products in stock to serve your retailers on time, and you should also organize your inventory according to metrics, such as: “How long does it take to receive the products from my manufacturer from the day I submit the order?” Keeping on top of your manufacturers and your inventory is crucial, and it’s much easier if you start small and stay close to the process. In today’s consumer-centric, highly-connected world, traditional so-called “push marketing” is not the most promising strategy for small businesses. Instead, what startups need is to understand their customers and to make their products all about them. In other words, they need “pull marketing.” Nowadays, marketing is not about selling a product but providing value to your customers. Small companies have to let their customers know that they are able to give those customers with what they need and want. But earning people’s attention takes time, and new, small businesses don’t have enough money to spend on expensive advertising. So instead of costly print ads, it’s better to make use of cheap or free-of-charge marketing channels, such as websites, social media pages and even Youtube. To make the most of these channels, it’s a good tactic to incentivize word-of-mouth marketing as this will spread the news of your product quickly. Moreover, it’s important to reach out to the most influential people and give them something of value to earn their trust; they will tell the rest of the people how great you and your product are. But targeting and building your customer base isn’t enough. You also need to create a strong brand that appeals to your customers’ lifestyles and needs. Your brand must communicate what your product is all about and what makes it unique. For instance, your brand identity – company name, logo and tagline – has to fit to your product and appeal to your target audience. For example, people typically expect the colors of eco-friendly products to be light green or blue, rather than black or gold. Also, you can communicate your product’s value to your customers by choosing a catchy, suggestive and percussive tagline (slogan or brand tag). As you see, you don’t have to spend lots of money on marketing — you just need a simple idea that customers want, and the ability to connect with them and provide personal value for their money. To sell your product successfully, you have to get it into the stores. But which? Fortunately you’re spoiled for choice: in the U.S. alone there are 1.5 million retail stores, collectively making more than $2.5 trillion each year. The best way forward is to start small with orders from a few local and regional stores. Starting small in this way is important since big stores want to stock only those products they're certain will sell. Moreover, they want to be supplied in fairly large volume at the outset. Placing your products in such stores also means you can stay in close communication with each store and keep track of how your product is selling. It also frees you to make changes to your product based on customer feedback. And if you succeed in getting repeat sales, these stores will continue to stock your product. So your product is on the shelves, and it’s selling well. Now you’re going to want to hold on to those customers, and give them a reason to keep coming back. How? The simplest way is to provide great, personal customer service. As a small business, you can create one-on-one relationships with your customers, giving you a massive advantage against big companies who can’t provide a service that personalized. Such a relationship ensures your customers' satisfaction, and gives you the opportunity to learn even more about your target group to further improve your offers. Also, this kind of customer service means that a large amount of your customers will be motivated to ask stores for your product, which in turn will give retailers a reason to increase the size of their orders. Great customer service means being fully available to your customers, and making good on your promises. If you provide a great product and service, your customers and thus the stores will keep coming back and spread the word to get you even more sales. If you succeed with your business idea, at some point your business will become large, busy and complex. As the captain of the company, it's your job to steer the ship, and the most important levers are your financials and your inventory. Managing a business's finances is a crucial factor in managing that business effectively. This requires that you can pay the bills, so keep your finance records up-to-date and review your monthly reports carefully. You should also negotiate your vendors’ payment terms and incentivize your customers to pay on time so that you're always able to pay on time, too. Finally, while it's normal for a startup to have only a small profit margin for the first couple of years, or even to make losses, if you're not breaking even after two years of work you need to evaluate how you're running the business. Another way to keep track of your now-established and successful business is good inventory management, as this will ensure a steady cash flow. The main consideration here is to ensure you produce enough of your product to fulfill incoming orders immediately. At the same time, you should beware of overproduction: you don't want to pay for the production and storage of products you can’t sell. For example, if you've managed to reach the point where you’re supplying a big retailer, such as Walmart, you'll have to scale up your business and build inventory ahead of time so that you're able to ship immediately. Another method to ensure that there's always enough cash available is by reducing the lag time between your payables (to suppliers) and receivables (from customers). As you can see, keeping an eye on your cash flow will help you manage your inventory by enabling you to better coordinate your production with your customer orders. The bottom line for your business to survive is that its finances are managed well and that a sufficient amount of cash is always available. When successfully growing a startup, you (like most entrepreneurs) will be itching to further expand your brand. But you should be aware that this entails an increased effort in managing your business relationships, monitoring the quality of your products, and even involves hiring new people. You should therefore be careful about expanding your business into new areas, and first make sure that it’s the right fit for your brand. The area you want to expand into should complement your core business. For instance, if you want to launch a new product, you should make sure that it appeals to the same market. Otherwise, because your customers will be different, it will be like starting a completely new business. Consider Hot Picks, for example. Licensing other characters and celebrities like Disney and Taylor Swift worked for them because it was closely related to their core business. The only difference was that the new product design appealed to an additional sub-audience of their target group, which had a different lifestyle. What if you're considering selling up at some point? To prepare yourself for this, you should structure your company in such a way that you can simply hand it off to someone else when you’re ready. This means that your brand has to work and sell without you. So, while setting up your business and building the brand, imagine that you're writing a playbook that someone else can follow in your absence. However, you should remember that increasing your sales is ultimately what will make your business more attractive to potential buyers. The key message in this book: You don’t need millions of dollars in funding nor a solid background in business to build a profitable business. All it takes is one simple idea you’re passionate about. Also, when setting up your business, start small, grow slowly and keep it simple. Finally, use the advantage of being small and flexible and try to build personal relationships with everyone who has a stake in your business. Actionable ideas in this book: Use social media to target and learn about your customers When starting your own business, use social media networks offer to study customers' needs and reach your target group with a product they really want. Also, because you will probably have a very small advertising budget, social media offers an increasingly effective alternative to expensive conventional advertising.","headers":["What is in it for me?

Grove","summary":"During his time as CEO of Intel, Andrew Grove helped the company to overcome numerous apparently insurmountable hurdles to its existence. In Only The Paranoid Survive, Grove draws on his experiences to present a strategic model that can help companies not only to cope with moments of critical change, but also to exploit them and thrive. Terming such moments strategic inflection points – or SIPs – Grove presents invaluable advice for making the most of the sink-or-swim moments in a company’s life. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why it’s not always a good idea for a company to keep secrets. You’ll find out why you should maintain open communication with outsiders like journalists. And you’ll learn why it’s a terrible idea for a company to trust the opinion of someone who feels emotionally attached to it. There are critical moments during the life of any company when its entire strategy needs to be brought into question. These are known as strategic inflection points (SIPs). But what’s behind these moments of crisis? There are six forces at play in the “competitive well-being” of a company which can compel it to consider its strategic options. These forces are the strength of its competitors, suppliers, existing customers, potential customers and complementors, and, finally, the possibility that business can be done in a different way. Any disturbance in the balance of these forces will transform the company’s business environment. Consider, for example, the computer company IBM, which was greatly affected by a major shift in how its business could be done. Once it became possible for consumers to combine components (like microchips, hard drive and software) that were produced and sold by different companies in an individual PC, pre-built computers were no longer as popular. Customers simply preferred selecting their own parts and combining them to make a PC of their own design. Although IBM tried to continue developing its pre-built PCs, their overall design failed to compete with the possibilities of the customizable PC. The result? They sold fewer PCs than other companies sold components. Although it’s clear that any change in these forces may alter the way that companies can succeed in a given market, it can sometimes be difficult for a company to spot even a major change. For instance, while changes in technology are usually quite easy to detect, because inventions or improvements directly linked to the production process or the business itself are ordinarily fairly concrete and observable, a change in the strength of a competitor will be harder to notice. Since some of these six forces are easier to spot than others, companies should be on the lookout for any changes which might affect them. SIPs are not relevant to CEOs alone. Rather, they have an impact on a company at every level – and, therefore, on every single employee. For that reason, all employees should be prepared for such critical situations, as jobs are often endangered at these moments. In extreme cases, an SIP can even result in a business shutting down, which means that every single employee loses their job. But even if the company manages to survive, it might have to restructure, resulting in some workers becoming unemployed. And in still other cases, people are forced to acquire new skills and to adapt to new, unfamiliar business environments. Often, an SIP forces employees to change the way that they operate as individuals in the market. When, for example, the first “talkie” movies were released, actors were impelled to choose whether to stick with silent movies or adapt to the new way of acting that movies with sound required. While some failed to redefine themselves as sound movie stars, others succeeded – though sometimes reluctantly. Charlie Chaplin, for instance, was a bitter opponent to “the coming of sound,” yet ultimately even he was forced to submit and produce his first “talkie,” The Great Dictator. Furthermore, SIPs have even caused some types of jobs to become almost extinct. This is especially true in the case of major technological changes. For example, at the beginning of industrialization, traditional craftsmanship was in danger of becoming obsolete, as factories were able to produce the same products much faster and cheaper. Because their skills were no longer in demand, almost all craftsmen were forced to quit their businesses and work at the factories. The few craftsmen who could survive independently were those who specialized in higher-quality production, thereby distinguishing their businesses. Individuals as well as companies must react to SIPs, and they can do this by properly analyzing their individual situation, specializing or acquiring new skills. The development of the Japanese memory-chip industry had a huge impact on Intel (formerly a memory chip company) because the Japanese were able to sell chips at prices Intel simply couldn’t match. As a remedy, Intel invested heavily in the development of its chips, but to no avail. The company faced an existential crisis. To the dismay of the management and existing employees, Intel decided that it would have to change everything that had been crucial to their success so far, from their oldest plants to their most established departments. Intel had little choice. An SIP can lead to a total catastrophe for a company if its management doesn’t recognize the new situation and react appropriately. One reason that managers ignore new developments is that they’re emotionally attached to the existing way of doing business. A consequence of this is that while a company continues to reproduce the same, once-successful measures as always, the already transformed business environment means that those measures might now result in outright failure – as when Intel tried to fight the powerful Japanese memory-chip industry by investing in the development of its own chips. However, if a company adopts an effective strategy at precisely the right time, SIPs offer them the opportunity to establish and lead a completely new market. Also, having to re-position a business in a new market – but one which also requires a similar business strategy – can have positive effects. In the case of Intel, their strategy in the face of Japanese companies was a combination of technological development and new, strategic positioning of their business. Specifically, they put their focus and their resources into microprocessors, redefining themselves as a microprocessor company – a field in which they became the market leader in a very short time. SIPs can be very dangerous for companies. However, by taking the right action at the right time, SIPs can present a chance for success in the future. When an SIP strikes, there’s a chance of serious confusion within a company. What direction should the company take? Should they make permanent changes, or only temporary ones? This uncertainty demands that someone has a clear sense of the direction the company should take. What’s needed is a leader. In large companies, it’s the CEO who must have a clear vision of the company’s future. They have to communicate their vision clearly and constantly, as failure to do so can have negative consequences. For example, the head of one Japanese company was asked about its general strategy, but he refused to discuss it, fearing the competition would use the information to their advantage. Whether correct in that fear or not, his silence sent a negative message to the company’s employees and to the public. When a company’s strategy must be redefined, CEOs mustn’t be scared of changing the core of the business. This is not easy to accomplish, as they and their staff are usually emotionally attached to the business in its present state. Another reason that redefining strategy is difficult is that it can involve letting a lot of jobs go and employing new staff in new positions. However, again, you must face this task without fear, and persevere with it. For example, until the memory crisis of the 1980s, Intel had been the memory company. Andrew Grove, its CEO (and the book’s author) insisted that the senior staff redefine Intel as “the microprocessor company,” and though there was an initial resistance, eventually many of the staff appreciated having a new vision they could champion. Once a new strategy has been introduced, it then has to be implemented. To do this, you must first deliver the message to the relevant people, and secondly, act as role-models for the rest of the company by committing immediately to the new strategy and all it entails. The confusion that SIPs can trigger over a company’s direction can destroy team morale and cohesion, which means that the people involved won’t be certain of what they should do. This can affect a company both internally and externally. For instance, employees will have no clear vision to follow, and they might be scared of losing their jobs, while a company’s partners and suppliers might fret over how future changes will affect them. In order to avoid such uncertainty, companies must ensure that all their actions are in line with a clearly defined new vision. This means that the redefinition of the business must be reflected in changes to its organizational structure. New staff need to be hired or old staff retrained. And new complementors and suppliers may need to be found. For the change to go as smoothly as possible, the new vision has to be communicated in a simple, effective message, internally and externally. It’s essential to convince all employees of this new vision, as – to remain effective – they need to identify themselves with the new order of things. Also, complementors and suppliers need to be informed of the company’s new vision so that they can adjust to the demands it entails, and they should also be made aware that a future partnership is possible. The simpler the message, the more effective it will be. One reason for this is that simple messages tend to stick in the mind, and they may also give people a sense of security. Another reason is that they’re more likely to be picked up and reproduced as headlines and soundbites by the media. In short, the moment a company arrives at a new vision for its strategy, that strategy should be communicated clearly – in words and actions – so that employees and the outside world can learn of the change and react accordingly. Companies in critical situations often employ consultants to analyze their business, and to suggest an effective course of action. The reason for employing consultants in this role is that they have a more objective perspective on the situation. In contrast, those working for the company are often emotionally involved in the work they do, which means that their opinions are biased. The reason for this level of involvement is that work is often an essential part of a person’s self-image, and a change in what they do brings their entire personality into question. People can feel very comfortable and “at home” in their team, and therefore tend to resist any changes to it. For example, when Intel went through the “memory crisis,” some of its oldest production plants were running at a loss. The result was that they had to be shut down and their resources redeployed to other plants. Many among the senior staff resisted these developments because they were attached to the “origin story” that they’d played a role in; they remembered when those plants were first opened, in the early days of that story. As far as possible, leaders should try to make themselves immune to such attachments, and instead adopt the more objective view of an outsider to shift their own perspective. Seeing the business with fresh eyes can be accomplished, for example, by talking to consultants, or employing new people. At the same time, however, leaders must always be open to the criticisms that will probably come their way. Outsiders are more likely to see the flaws and mistakes that insiders will just as likely miss. Faced with such criticisms, leaders will have to ensure their egos do not get in the way if they’re identified with whatever decision or action is being criticized. Many companies try to keep certain information secret, especially when it concerns new strategies and products. However, this secrecy can mean that a business’s upper management will fail to pass crucial information down to middle management about goals and strategies. Neglecting to maintain open communication between upper and middle management is ill-advised. This is because staff in the middle of the company are often first to identify a business’s problems. For one thing, they’re closer to its daily operations and are therefore sensitive to the slight changes that can accumulate to a threatening situation. For that reason, they should be encouraged to openly communicate their fears and observations, as often they have good ideas about how businesses can be run differently. For example, Grove received an email from a sales manager in the Asia-Pacific area in which the manager discussed a potential competitor. Faced with this new information, Grove decided to initiate a study on the case. Had the sales manager not felt comfortable informing Grove, Grove wouldn't have been aware of the competitor’s existence. Other people with whom companies should always maintain close contact are business partners, outside experts and journalists, as they might have a broader view on the market situation as a whole. For instance, a company should stay in touch with its complementor, as they are a driving force behind the business. And by keeping close to outside experts, a company’s senior management is able to learn of market constellations which they’d otherwise not recognize. Finally, even journalists – if they ask critical questions – can lead a manager to a welcome shift in perspective. Change in the business environment can come from anywhere – even from within. Therefore, it’s important to stay on the watch and get information from as many sources as possible.  The culture of a company can be a decisive factor in its ability to survive periods of great trouble. If people are not challenged with new problems, they become accustomed to the current situation and are then less flexible in times of major change. This kind of mindset can be deadly for a company when hitting an SIP, so it’s essential both that employees are accustomed to acquiring new skills and that the team is flexible. This is because, firstly, people who acquire a variety of skills are able to reflect on a situation from multiple points of view. And those employees habituated to learning are able to adjust to new tasks more easily: if an employee is able to think “outside the box,” with the box being his or her direct working field, he or she will be well positioned to find better solutions to the working process. Secondly, a team that is flexible creates a trusting environment in which new ideas can develop and prosper. Indeed, creativity can grow only in an environment where people are free to search for their own solutions. Thus employees should be made to feel comfortable in suggesting trying out new ideas and practices, such as the redeployment of resources. Another benefit to team flexibility is that staff morale will increase, because it’s quite simply more enjoyable to work in a climate that encourages individuals to be creative, and that remains flexible to individual desires and suggestions. In sum, mutual trust and flexibility lead to a positive working climate. They train people to unite in critical situations and come up with new ways to resolve challenges. Business situations are complex and capable of changing in an instant. In such an environment, only the paranoid survive. This means that companies must be prepared and on the watch for the danger that can come from every corner. Yet in some situations just keeping watch isn’t enough; they need to be prepared for multiple or even unknown scenarios. For that reason, a company should channel sufficient resources to innovation and development because in doing so it can increase its chances of being first on the market with a new product, and thus diminish much of its competitors’ strength. Also, people who work in development are more up to date with technical possibilities, which is valuable knowledge in times of instability, like SIPs. Secondly, if the outcome of a market situation is not predictable, companies should be prepared for every possible outcome. Of course this means that some of the resources will be invested in vain. But, more positively, the skills people acquire in the process might turn out to be useful later on. Also, this kind of preparation can give a company an idea of the possible costs and consequences of implementing a particular technology. A typical example is the tug of war between Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. Since it was not at all clear which of the two formats would become more popular, it would’ve been wise for a company producing DVDs or DVD players to develop solutions for both formats. Of course, part of this investment would undoubtedly be in vain, because one of the technologies was certain to fail eventually. Investments in development are crucial because they can provide a company with the opportunity to react quickly to new situations – or even to be the driving force of the market. But whether the technologies and techniques that were developed are implemented or not, an innovative company is always more likely to stand on its feet in critical and unfamiliar situations. The key message in this book: Managers and employees of companies should prepare themselves for the inevitable moments of crisis that occur in a company’s life. These are termed SIPs – Strategic Inflection Points – and by acting on a few key principles these critical points can be not only overcome, but also exploited for the company’s good. Actionable ideas in this book: Look to outsiders for an objective opinion Even though they might be emotionally attached to a particular image or origin story of their company, managers should always try to view their company’s situation as objectively as possible. If a new, scary situation arises, one should always seek impartial counsel from outside the company, consider all the options one has and then act decisively. ","headers":["What’s in it for me?

In this information-saturated age, if an ad isn’t presented in a unique and instantly appealing way, it’ll remain lost in the noise. There is a way, however, to pierce through the chaos and get your message heard. POP! shows you how to make your messages so compelling that your audience simply can’t resist. You’ll learn the secret ways of wrapping your brand, idea or product in memorable pitches, titles or taglines that’ll get people’s attention – and won’t let go. In the following blinks, you’ll discover: how to get anybody’s attention with your message – and keep it, how to be HUMORiginal, how to learn to paint your own word pictures, and how to develop systematic methods to boost your creativity. Every single day, from the moment we connect to the internet or walk out onto the street, we are bombarded with ads that fight for our money and our attention. But have you ever wondered why some ads are more successful than others? The answer is simple: the ads that grab your attention are the ones that POP! – or that are Purposeful, Original and Pithy. Let’s examine these elements one by one. First comes Purpose. Whether you’re trying to spread an idea or sell a product, your message has to instantly communicate your purpose – and how it positively affects your audience. In fact, the best wordplay in the world won’t POP! unless it does two things: it must precisely articulate the essence of your message and show your audience what’s in it for them. Then comes Originality. You’ve got to remember that no matter how brilliant your product or message is, someone else is probably trying to do something similar. Therefore you need to distinguish yourself by every means possible, and in particular, by being original in what you do. Keep in mind that people’s yearning for something fresh is so strong that even if the essence of what you’re doing is not new, it still has a chance of taking off if you can make it original. Finally, there’s Pith. The word pith means the essence of something – a concept that’s crucial, as the human brain can actually only hold about seven bits of information in short-term memory! This means that you have to be pithy and convincing in a second, or your idea will soon be forgotten. It’s no coincidence that the top slogans of the twentieth century, as selected by Advertising Age magazine, are all less than seven words: De Beers’ “Diamonds are forever,” Nike’s “Just do it,” and Avis’ “We try harder.” When you think about it, it seems obvious: the first step to good communication is always to find out exactly what you’re trying to say. This means that if you want to make a message POP!, you’ll need to have precise answers for the big W’s: what you are offering, who you’re aiming at and what you want to achieve. You also need to consider what value you’re offering your customer and who your competitors are. When you’re answering these questions, keep one guiding principle in mind: you need to examine the essence of your offering from every possible angle, to create a detailed bank of core words. Core words are the key descriptive phrases that articulate the essence of your product or idea. And although it could take ten minutes to two hours to answer these questions to your satisfaction, it’s time well spent. Remember that core words are the foundation from which all POP! messages are built. You’ll be using them regularly to create powerful messages in future exercises. As your product and business evolve, you should repeatedly evaluate your answers to the big W’s and your core words to make sure your branding is as fresh as your latest creations. As they say, there is nothing new under the sun – which means being original is close to impossible. And yet people still demand originality if they are going to give you their attention. So what can you do? You have to do your best with the most powerful tool you have – the core words that embody your idea – and catch people’s attention with an original phrase. This means you need to push your creative potential and create a one-of-a-kind name. And if you’re successful, the media will help you out for free. Why? Because the media is always on the hunt for the next big thing to report. This means that if you can come up with a catchy word or phrase, you not only get the attention of your customers but also get free advertising through media coverage. So, how can we create an original phrase? One way is to use “Spell Chuck,” and discard the normal way of spelling things. For some reason, beauty salons seem to be very good at this: Consider Shear Genius, Curl up and Dye and Cut and Dried. Another way of creating an original phrase is to run your core words through the alphabet, from A to Z, and keep modifying the first syllable until you find something that corresponds with your idea or product. For example, the word entrepreneur can be transformed into a variety of trademarkable terms – a spiritual business owner could be a “Zenpreneur,” for example. You can extend this wordplay approach and try playing with the last syllable, or add a prefix (e.g., re-, multi-, pre-) or suffix (e.g., –ly, -ology, -ish) to your core words. For example, consider the new word re-newlyweds that describes couples who have renewed their wedding vows later in their marriage and are “wed” once more. We all love music: it fills us with energy, it takes us to the highest highs, the lowest lows and back again. But did you know that you can use musicality to increase the memorability of your messages? One great way of using musicality to increase memorability is by using alliteration: words that start with the same sound can have a pleasant ring to people’s ears. For example, what do you feel when you say these words: Bed, Bath and Beyond; Dunkin´ Donuts; or Rolls Royce? Isn’t it pleasant to say and hear them? Aren’t they intriguing and memorable? This is the magic of alliteration. Review your core words and try to find new words that form a series of alliterations. You can also run the first syllables of each word through the alphabet to potentially create an interesting neologism while you’re at it. Another way of increasing memorability is summed up in a Duke Ellington song title: “It Don’t Mean a Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing.” Indeed, rhythm and rhyme are powerful tools of easing comprehension, and can make even longer strings of information memorable. Take the alphabet song, for example: A, B, C, D, E, F, G – pause – H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P. Many of us still use the song to remind ourselves which letter fits where! A good way of applying rhythm to your own idea is to try and use an iamb. In an iamb, or iambic meter, we accent every other beat in a sequence, as in “Ta DUM, Ta DUM, Ta DUM.” Try reading the following commercial jingle out loud to understand iambic meter: “Double your pleasure, double your fun, with Doublemint, Doublemint, Doublemint gum.” If you still doubting that rhymes help you remember, try this on for size: if you were asked to think of two instinctive human responses to danger, what would they be? I’m betting your answer was, “Fight or flight!” As we saw in a previous blink, to ensure your message sticks, you have to make it personal. So if you want your message to POP!, you need to relate your message to your customer’s world, thoughts and everyday life. How? Start by asking yourself: what do your current or future customers say or think when they experience the need your idea fills? What could a possible “Eureka!” or “At last!” moment feel like, when the customer’s problem is finally properly addressed? By placing yourself in your customer’s shoes, you’ll realize exactly what they need – and how to tell them that you’ve got it. Another powerful method of making your message personal is to relate it to a celebrity or popular piece of media. For example, consider the questions: who is also doing what I do, or what also represents certain core aspects of my idea that everyone knows about? Amy Rosenthal did this brilliantly when she wanted to spread ideas about being a loving mother and juggling many responsibilities at the same time. She understood that young babies react very strongly to our temperament, which makes it very important to maintain calm. So, she asked herself, who is internationally known for being calm, peaceful and tranquil? The Dalai Lama! She then ran the name through the alphabet and voila, there it was, Dalai Mama, two words that instantly communicated what Amy wanted to say. Another more systematic approach to making your message personal is to relate it to a popular piece of media. Review your core words once more and use your favourite movie, song and book search engine to find a match with a popular piece of media. Everyone loves a good laugh, and most of us would love to be funnier – especially when we’re trying to create memorable messages. But can humor really be taught? Probably not – but there are some methods you can use. First, pay close attention and learn from the humorous moments around you. Family celebrations are often an excellent source of humor, as are TV shows and movies. Remember, inspiration is better than information, but if you do borrow a joke, remember to credit the original or it will be perceived as a rip-off. You can also raise your sensitivity to the timing and context of your humor, which is just as important as the content. Watch carefully how comedians deliver their lines, and try to be surprising and out of the blue with your jokes. But when it comes to creating your memorable messages, remember to pay attention to your purpose – don’t be funny for funny’s sake, and always relate your jokes back to your core words to keep on message. The problem with jokes, however, is that they can easily lose their novelty factor. And there’s nothing more deadly to your likeability than using clichés. However, rearranging clichés to make them fresh is fair game – and can even be powerful. Here’s a systematic approach to rearranging clichés. First, enter your core words into a cliché search engine, like ClichéSite. Then write down everything you read that makes you giggle or creates a quirky connection to your core words. Then, substitute or rearrange the key elements of the original cliché with your core words to turn an eye-roller into an eye-opener. A good example is business writer Steven Pearlstein’s powerful title for an article about a group of managers who were concerned about not having access to their BlackBerries, due to pending litigation. The title? “Big Firms Caught with Their Patents Down.” As they say, an image is worth a thousand words – which means that if you can create an image with only a few words, you’ve increased the power of those words a thousandfold! But before you start creating visualizations for your idea, you need to ask yourself what attributes your product has, and how those attributes are embodied in the real world. Let’s clarify with an example: What are the attributes of superglue? Answer: It’s really strong. And what is something real, that is really strong? The brand Gorilla Glue answered this question with an 800-pound gorilla, which became a powerful symbol in their ads. You can use your answers to create meaningful metaphors that empower your message. The best method for creating personalized and unique metaphors is to focus on the three A’s: Avocation (e.g., a hobby), Achievement and Adversity. To do this exercise, you need to take a fresh piece of paper and on it, draw three vertical lines. Use one column for avocations you are passionate about, one for your proudest achievements and one for all the adversities you have faced so far. Now look for similarities and connections between the columns. Can you create analogies and use past experiences to create stories that better explain what you’re trying to say? A good example of the power of this method is how a business executive used his flying lessons as an example to curb micromanaging in his company. He told his managers how his flying teacher never took the yoke out of his hands – not even in critical situations – but instead gave general instructions and let him figure it out. “Let them fly the plane” thus became an expression in the company for “stop micromanaging.” “TV IS GOOD FOR YOUR KIDS!...no, it’s not.” Bet that message got your attention, didn’t it? The reason why is because it’s surprising and counterintuitive, which is often enough to catch your audience’s attention and get your message across. Like author John LeCarré once said, “’The cat sat on the mat,’ is not the beginning of a story. ‘The cat sat on the dog’s mat,’ is.” To create your own message that surprises, start by looking at your core words and the answers to your W’s from an earlier blink. Now ask yourself: Where do I dare challenge common sense and suggest that people change their minds, instead of offering blind allegiance? Where do I even dare to be politically incorrect? And most importantly: How does my product address a topic no one wants to talk about? Another surprising way of raising curiosity is the half-and-half technique. This technique was used to great effect on the popular FOX TV show, The O.C., in 2004. One episode featured a Christian family and a Jewish family that blended the holidays Christmas and Hanukkah together to celebrate a brand new feast: Chrismukkah. The episode created a buzz that lasted for months, and the show itself generated a record number of viewers. If you want to produce a similar reaction to your idea, try this: Take out a piece of paper and write one half of your core words on the left side and one half on the right. Now try and blend each word from the left column with the right, and write any combination that strikes you on a different piece of paper. Write as many as possible, keep playing – you never know what’ll come up! We’ve now seen many powerful ways of creating memorable messages. But if you want to make your message come alive, you’ll have to wrap it in a story. Why? Because when you give people a meaningful story to which they can personally relate, they switch from simply processing information to emotionally relating to your message. One way of doing this is to create a powerful history behind your idea. Think back to when you came up with your idea, product or brand. What did you feel, say or do? Where did your ideas come to you, who inspired you? Interview everyone who worked with you and create the authentic story behind your cause. For example, when SpeakerNetNews co-founder Rebecca Morgan told the story of how she came up with her new book, she quickly had everyone’s attention. She was visiting a mall when she was approached by a salesperson with samples of orange-spiced chicken. When she repeatedly refused, the salesperson became more and more persistent, to the point that Rebecca decided never to buy anything there again. But when she left the mall, she smelled the delicious flavor of chocolate-chip cookies being sold on another counter. No one had to approach her – she couldn’t resist the sweet smell and bought a whole batch of her own free will. That’s when she came up with the title for her new book: “Chocolate-Chip Cookie Marketing: The Anti-Hard-Sell Approach.” Another powerful way of sustaining your audience’s attention is by tapping into the stories that all of us know. To do this, start thinking of famous phrases out of a story or movie. (Consider: “I’ll be back” from Terminator, or “Here’s looking at you, kid” from Casablanca.) Then review your core words and see if you can create your own derivation of this kind of classic phrase. If you succeed, the memorability of your phrase will drive word-of-mouth marketing for you. The key message in this book: If you want your message to stick, you have to make it Purposeful, Original and Pithy. Know your core words and use rhythm, rhyme and stories to communicate your purpose directly to your audience. Remember to keep your message fresh, to the point and surprising. Actionable advice: Learn more about pop culture to harness the collective unconscious. The more you know about pop culture, the more you know about how people are thinking. Stay up to date on the latest trends by checking out the most popular memes, news stories and YouTube videos. Then you can combine your core words with the freshest entertainment out there.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

In every profession, from dentistry to investment banking, there comes a time when you must convince someone of something. Unfortunately, there is a gap between what we are trying to tell our audience and how they perceive it. To understand this gap and overcome it, we must look at the evolution of the human brain. Basically, the human brain has evolved in three separate stages, resulting in three distinct parts: the primitive reptilian part, the croc brain, developed first. It’s a simple device primarily focused on survival and it can generate strong emotions, like the desire to flee a predator. Next, the midbrain developed. It allows us to understand more complex situations, such as social interactions. Finally, the sophisticated neocortex evolved, facilitating reasoning and analysis to understand complex things. When you pitch, you use your neocortex to put into words the ideas you are trying to convey. Unfortunately, your audience doesn’t at first process these ideas with their neocortices. Instead, it is the audience’s primitive croc brains that receive the ideas and they ignore everything that is not new and exciting. Worse still, if your message seems abstract and unfathomable to the croc brain, it might perceive the message as a threat. This will make your audience want to flee to escape the situation. This is why you must tailor your pitch to the croc brain. Since croc brains are simple, your message should be clear, concrete and focused on the big picture. You also need to ensure the croc brain sees your message as something positive and novel, which deserves to be passed on to the higher brain structures. You must tailor your pitch to the audience’s croc brains. The one critical thing you need throughout your pitch is the attention of your target. To successfully attain this, research has shown that you must evoke two sensations in your pitch: desire and tension. Desire arises when you offer your target a reward, and tension arises when you show them they might lose something, like an opportunity, as a result of this social encounter. On a neurological level, this effectively floods your target’s brain with two neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. Dopamine is a chemical associated with anticipating rewards — desire. One such reward would be the pleasure of understanding something new, such as solving a puzzle. Thus, to increase the level of dopamine in your target’s brain, you must introduce novelty through a pleasant surprise, like an unexpected yet entertaining product demo. Norepinephrine, on the other hand, is the chemical responsible for alertness and it creates tension in the target. If your pitch convinces them that there is a lot at stake here, their brains will be flooded with norepinephrine. To create tension, you must create a bit of low level conflict with a push-pull strategy. This means first saying something to push the target away, like, “Maybe we aren’t a good match for each other.” You then counter this by pulling the target back toward you with something like, “But if we are, that would be terrific.” This push-pull dynamic creates alertness in the target, as they sense that they might lose this opportunity. Depending on the situation, you may use very powerful push-pull statements, especially if you sense your target’s attention beginning to wane. To secure your target’s attention, you must create desire and tension. Different people will see any given situation from a different perspective or point of view based on their intelligence, ethics and values. These perspectives are called frames, and they dictate how we perceive social situations such as meetings and sales pitches. Frames also determine who controls those situations. When two people meet, their individual frames crash into each other. Only one frame can survive such an encounter — the stronger one. For example, let’s assume a cop pulls you over for speeding. He has a strong moral-authority frame and you only have a weak “I’m so sorry officer”-frame. It is clear that when your frames clash, his frame will prevail. This means he will control every aspect of the encounter: from its duration to its content and tone. You will often face a similar clash of frames in a business environment; for example, a customer may be focused on the price of your product while you are focused on its quality. You will both try to get the other to focus on what you think is important. If it is your frame that survives this clash, you will have frame control in the situation meaning your ideas and statements will be accepted as facts by the customer. This is a crucial advantage in any pitch. Without frame control, you are unlikely to convince anyone of anything. To control a meeting, you must first establish frame control. In a pitch or sales meeting you will often encounter certain archetypes of frames, and it is important you choose strong with which to counter them. Typically, your target will use the power frame which exudes arrogance. You must not do anything that validates the other person’s power. Instead, use small acts of defiance and denial to bust the frame; for example, by yanking your presentation material away from the target if they do not seem to be taking it seriously. Another oft-used frame is the time frame, where your customer asserts control over time: “I only have ten more minutes.” This is meant to push you off balance, but you can always counter with: “That’s fine, I only have five.” A particularly lethal frame is the analyst frame, denoted by a fixation on details and numbers. If your opponent is in this frame, they will likely insist on drilling down into minor technical and financial details, effectively bogging down your pitch. In such situations, give a direct but high-level answer to the question asked and get right back to your pitch. Analysis comes later. Before more questions come up, counter the analyst frame with your own intrigue frame. This basically means you tell a compelling personal story and leave it unfinished as a cliffhanger: “… so there we were, in a pitch black, falling airplane with no idea what was going to happen. Anyway, back to the pitch …\" This redirects the focus of the room onto you and makes the discussion personal once again. You will often encounter the power frame, time frame and analyst frame, hence you must know how to counter them. The most important frame you should be able to use is the prize frame, as it works in a variety of situations against many opposing frames. Typically when you’re selling something or pitching an idea, your target will tend to see their money as the “prize” of the meeting, something you have to fight for. You must reframe the situation so that you are the prize and they would be lucky to do business with you. Because people tend to want things they can’t have, prizing yourself will make your target work for your acceptance instead of the other way around. BMW does this with a special-edition M3. The company demands prospective buyers sign a contract assuring they will take proper care of the car, otherwise they cannot buy one. In a pitching situation, never engage in behavior that makes it seem as if you are chasing the target, for example by agreeing to last minute schedule changes or trying to prematurely close the deal by saying things like, “So, what do you think so far?” Such behavior only reinforces the impression that the target is the prize. Instead, get your target to explicitly qualify themselves to you; for example, you could say, “I am very particular about with whom I work. Why should I do business with you?” This usually catches them off guard and they start trying to impress you. Use prizing to make the target seek your acceptance. Contrary to popular belief, we are more prone to making choices instinctively than through rational analysis. In fact, we often make a decision about something before we even fully understand it and only later come up with reasons for that decision. These gut calls are called hot cognitions, whereas the decisions arrived at through rational reasoning are known as cold cognitions. After you’ve introduced your big pitch idea, you want to trigger hot cognitions within your target. These will make him or her want what you have to offer in mere seconds, instead of analyzing your pitch for days to reach a rational, cold decision. You trigger the hot cognitions by stacking frames, meaning you introduce multiple frames in quick succession. The first frame is the intrigue frame: you tell your target a compelling story, a personal narrative where a dilemma is solved. At the crucial juncture, you stop telling the story, leaving your target on the edge of their seat, ensuring their full attention. Next, you pile on the prize frame, where you flip the tables on the target: instead of trying to impress them, make them qualify themselves to you. You could say something like, “This deal has so many investors after it, I have to choose who to take on board.” After this, you stack on the time frame by adding time pressure to the pitch: “Unfortunately, this is a limited-time offer, and the train, so to speak, is leaving the station on Monday.” This will make the target feel like they are losing an opportunity, at which point they will want it even more. By triggering all these hot cognitions in the target, you will leave them drooling for what you have to offer. Stack frames to trigger hot cognitions. Neediness, otherwise known as validation-seeking behavior, is a sign of weakness and it can be absolutely fatal to your pitch. If you act needy, the audience will sense you are weak and their primitive croc brains will classify your proposal as a threat – to their money. This can easily push you into a vicious cycle where the audience becomes more and more distant due to your neediness, which in turn makes you anxious and even needier! To negate neediness, you can use a simple three-step formula based on the movie The Tao of Steve, where the protagonist, Dex, follows a pseudo-Taoist philosophy to pick up women. First, try to eliminate your desires, at least in the eyes of the target. If they have something you desperately want, this will translate as neediness in you. To negate this, make it clear to the target that you do not need them. Second, focus on the things you do well, your strengths. Demonstrate something that showcases your excellence. Dex, for instance, was great with children and made sure the target of his affections saw this. Similarly, you must demonstrate excellence in front of your target. Third, withdraw. At the crucial moment when your target expects you to chase them for their money, withdraw instead by saying something like, “I’m not totally convinced we’re a good match for each other.” This will make them chase you, much like the women in the Tao of Steve chased Dex. Don’t be needy – make the target chase you. Status plays a vital part in any social encounter. In any meeting, a dominant member known as an alpha emerges, while others take subordinate beta-positions. It is very difficult to be persuasive from a beta-position; hence, you must grab alpha status. Though some elements of status, like your reputation or wealth, are quite stable, situational status can vary immensely; for example, while a successful surgeon has considerably higher social status than a golf teacher, the teacher is still the alpha during a golf lesson. Often your pitch targets will lay so-called beta traps to force you into the situational beta position; for example, being made to wait in the lobby is a classic beta trap. You must try to ignore these traps and avoid doing anything that enforces your opponent’s alpha status. Instead, use small acts of defiance and denial to grab the situational alpha status for yourself as soon as you can. Say a customer has made you wait in the lobby. Once in the meeting room, you could begin examining some papers on the table in front of you. When the customer peeks at them, you could yank them away and say something like, “Nope, not until I’m ready.” If done in a good-natured, half-joking manner, this enforces your alpha position. Once you have alpha status, you must then steer the discussion into a direction where you are the expert, much like the golf professional talks about golf, not heart surgery, when teaching the surgeon. To solidify your status, force your opponent to say something that reinforces your alpha position with a good-natured jest, like, “Remind me, why on earth should I work with you guys on this?” To pitch effectively, you must attain situational alpha status. Before you begin any pitch, let your target know you will keep the presentation short. This will put them at ease. When Watson and Crick presented their Nobel Prize-winning idea of the DNA helix, they only needed five minutes. If you know what you are doing, you can pitch anything in twenty. Start your pitch by introducing yourself. This does not mean rattling off your entire résumé but just outlining your greatest successes, like projects where you really did something impressive. Most people will be tempted to jump right to the “big idea” for which they’re trying to get financing. But before you get to it, you should address one crucial concern in your target’s mind. Namely, you must explain why now is the right time to invest. Rather than a long and complex analysis, simply outline the economic, social and technological forces which make your deal unmissable right now. Economic forces that benefit your pitch, for example, could be your target customers becoming wealthier and interest rates going down, the social forces could be the rising consumer concern for the environment, and the technological force could be the development of the electric car. You must present these forces in a way that shows a window of opportunity has recently opened but will not remain open forever. The three forces set the stage and paint a backstory for your big idea, which should also be kept brief and simple. Use an established “recipe” for this: “For [target customers] who are dissatisfied with [current offerings on the market]. My product is a [new idea] that provides [solution to key problem] unlike [competing product]. My product has [key product features].” That’s it. The time for details comes later. Keep your pitch short and simple. The key message in this book is: In any social encounter where you aim to be persuasive, it is vital that you seize control of the situation and ensure the target sees your pitch through the frame of mind you have chosen. At the same time, you must cater your pitch so that on a neurological level, the target’s brain works for you, not against you. The questions this book answered: Why do you need to consider neuropsychology in your pitch? You must tailor your pitch to the audience’s croc brains. To secure your target’s attention, you must create desire and tension. How can you use frame control to pitch? To control a meeting, you must first establish frame control. You will often encounter the power frame, time frame and analyst frame, hence you must know how to counter them. Use prizing to make the target seek your acceptance. Stack frames to trigger hot cognitions. How can you make your pitch as effective and persuasive as possible? Don’t be needy – make the target chase you. To pitch effectively, you must attain situational alpha status. Keep your pitch short and simple.

Maybe you want to transfer to a new position within your firm or even change industries. Perhaps you’re a manager who wants your employees to be satisfied and productive. Regardless of which of these might apply to you, you probably know that making a major shift in your career direction can take time, and – if done badly – can be very expensive. But it needn’t be. The following blinks will teach you how to pivot. There are four steps involved: plant, scan, pilot and, finally, launch. There’s also a fifth element, lead, if you’re a manager looking to apply these useful lessons for your own employees. Join Jenny Blake as she shows you just how easy and efficient changing careers can be. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a failed bondage-teaching enterprise became a helpful stepping stone; how often the average American changes jobs; and what’s so special about the cheese counter at Whole Foods. We all know the feeling: you’re stuck in a rut in your job, but you’re too scared to switch things up and get out. After all, it might well put your finances at risk. Perhaps your family and friends have expressed concern at your desire to change tracks. They might even say it’s some sort of age-related crisis. But guess what? It’s perfectly normal for you to feel that way. These days, it’s quite normal to have multiple careers. Few people stay at the same company for their entire working lives before retiring – things just don’t work that way anymore. In fact, the average American employee stays in one position for just four to five years. Adam Chaloeicheep is a case in point. Chaloeicheep was once creative director of a real estate development company in Chicago, but, burnt out, he left his job and headed off to Thailand to study meditation. Eight months later he was back. His mind was clear. His passions for fashion, technology, entrepreneurship and brand strategy would now guide him. He went back to school to broaden his skill set and then started his own company, ABC Design Lab. Fulfillment and financial success followed soon after. Yes, Chaloeicheep’s story is a little on the extreme side. But it’s indicative of a broader trend. A recent Gallup poll showed that up to 90 percent of employees are either “not engaged” or “actively disengaged” from their jobs. It’s no great surprise, then, that people are on the lookout for new opportunities. Crises that make you look elsewhere are in no way voluntary. But you can use that same outward-looking mentality to make a deliberate career shift in a new direction. It’s known as a career pivot, and to do it, you don’t even have to leave your current employer. Let’s take Amy Schonberger as an example. She felt stuck as a senior creative strategist in a public relations firm, but she wasn’t ready to ditch just yet. Rather than looking for new jobs, Schonberger started taking responsibility for social media and blogging. Her coworkers weren’t interested themselves. They felt working in social media would damage their reputations. But Schonberger knew better, and before long, she found herself dealing with the company’s biggest clients. Her status as a social media expert soon led to her appointment to a new, official role: director of digital entertainment. Pivoting isn’t something you do without planning though. Let’s look now at all the stages along the way. It makes no difference whether you want to found a company or if you want to take on a new role at your current firm – change can be overwhelming. However, you can make things easier by zooming out to get the big picture and thinking about how you want to plant your pivot. There’s no need to get tangled up in the hows and whens of your pivot just yet. First of all, establish your vision: think carefully about what your broader values are. The author once had a client, Justin, who was sick of working for his family’s real estate business. Instead of delving into the issues of what Justin should do, the author’s first step was to identify Justin's values and status. Through their discussions, they determined that the most important factors for Justin were his health, financial security, environment and relationships with like-minded people. Based on this information, they were able to discuss Justin’s career options together. Within a few months, Justin had been accepted to a business school in San Diego on a scholarship. There, he was able to meet new and inspiring friends, in a place that offered an inspiring and healthy environment. The trick is to keep the focus of your dreams tight. Don’t start thinking long-term and in generalities; instead, define a pivot vision based on your values for the next couple of years. Consider the author’s sister-in-law, Gillian. One day, while on the conveyor-belt career path that would make her a lawyer, she realized she wanted to get off. She didn’t want to spend the year after law school writing legal documents  – she wanted to become more engaged. She needed an environment in which she could be flexible and physically active, and in which she could interact with like-minded peers. Perhaps most of all, she wanted to start a business and a family with her husband. Gillian had been taking a CorePower Yoga Teacher Training course at the time. Soon after starting, yoga had become central to her happiness. Even though she passed the bar, she decided to quit her position at the law firm to teach at a yoga studio and get involved in the yoga business. She was able to utilize her unique background to her advantage, and soon had a managerial position at the studio. This work left her feeling far more fulfilled than she would ever have been as a lawyer. The lesson here is clear: if you clearly define your values and your vision, you’ll be more equipped for large-scale changes. You’ll know just what to do when those daunting decisions inevitably come up. Thinking about making a change to your career is almost sure to stoke anxiety. It would for anyone. After all, you’ll be starting from scratch and losing your current regular paycheck. To deal with this fear while you’re planting your pivot, you’ll need to evaluate your current situation; this is the second part of planting. It implies considering how your current strengths will help you move on and up. The result is that you won’t be starting over with a blank slate, as you’ll know exactly where your strengths lie. Ask yourself: Are there any specific challenges I’m attracted to? What energizes me? Sometimes, your career portfolio can provide the answer. Other times, you might have to look back a bit. Take Jason Shen. He began in content marketing, but took up a product manager position at a start-up. As he was transitioning into his new role, he found an end-of-the-year evaluation from his kindergarten years hidden among old documents at home. In it his teacher had written, “He especially enjoys computer work, games and making things.” It was confirmation that his interest in computers and building had been there from the start. And what’s more, it gave him a huge boost of confidence: he realized that he wasn’t some hanger-on to Silicon Valley culture. He now knew that his new position was sure to play to the strengths he had had his entire life. You can also decrease the stress involved in change by obtaining a better understanding of your financial situation. That way, you’ll know when you can afford to take a big risk and – just as critically – when you can’t. Let’s look at Andrew Deffley. When he turned 30, Deffley decided to transition away from being a production manager at NFL Films, where he’d been for eight years. He wanted to fulfil his lifelong dream and become an actor, but he knew he couldn’t go into it blindly. He had to take stock of his financial situation and come up with a plan. First, he would save enough so that he could take a six-month break from NFL Films. He could use that time to see if acting was the right thing for him. Then, if he still wasn’t earning enough from acting alone after six months, he would start up a side hustle of production-related work. That way, he could continue to audition for roles. These side earnings played to Deffley's strengths by using his already-acquired skills. He was able to keep himself financially secure, while simultaneously pivoting toward his dream career with confidence. It worked out well. Since starting, Deffley has landed roles in web series and TV shows including I Love Ryan? and Orange is the New Black. Once you’ve got a good idea of the foundations required for a pivot, then it's time to scan for opportunities. Some people think what’s needed at this stage is a career mentor, someone to dispense expert advice in the long term. But it can be a laborious task finding someone to take on this time-consuming role. But no worries, it’s actually better to work with a series of one-off mentors and experts. In many cases, these advisory sessions morph into longer-term mentorships. The author herself is a case in point. When she was beginning as a career coach and speaker, she didn’t look for a long-term mentor. Instead, she called up Susan Biali, an expert in coaching and speaking, and asked for a one-off conversation. During the call, Biali offered to help her on a regular basis, even suggesting they check in each month. They’ve actually kept in contact to this day. If you think of these conversations as one-off interactions, that’ll park questions relating to long-term mentorship. You won’t feel you’re pushing your mentor for more time in the future. Aside from these one-off mentors, you should also build up a mastermind group of friends and peers with similar interests, who you can ask whenever questions come to mind. Let’s consider Luke Schrotberger. He was a consultant to an Alaskan oil and gas group and he wanted to pivot within his company. Schrotberger reached out to a peer for guidance. He had himself pivoted within the company. Your mastermind group might include friends who have similar goals to you. The author and her friend Alexis Grant are just like this. While they were both writing their books, they made sure to be in daily contact to keep each other on track by sharing experiences with each other. But what do you do when you don’t have friends or colleagues who can help? Thankfully the internet is a savior here. There are loads of sites and communities you can ask. The author believes her own ten-week courses are just the ticket for keeping your momentum up. These courses worked for Lora Koenig, who found a mastermind group thanks to the author’s program. She used them as a support system as she transitioned from product management to agricultural development as a Peace Corps volunteer in rural Ethiopia. However you choose to find your support network, the general lesson is clear: the relationships you foster at the start of your pivot are sure to help you throughout the entire pivoting process. We all know those people who are a bit too passive in their outlook; they sit around waiting for a miracle to happen. If you really want to switch things up, however, you need to actively scan for new breaks. And the most successful pivoters are those who look for opportunities related to their strengths. Consider Shawn Henry. In 1999, he’d been at the FBI for ten years and wanted to transition from his job as a special agent into a supervisory role. However, despite his experience and dedication, Henry found his applications rejected when he applied for four different positions across the agency. Then, he noticed that the position of chief of computer investigations was being advertised. Although Henry had no experience in the FBI’s computer division, he reckoned that he could lead the division in the face of rising digital crime. He felt he could apply the tactics he’d learned as a special agent – such as wiretapping and undercover work – to the digital realm and to the internet. He landed the job. Eventually, Henry worked his way up to becoming executive assistant director, the third-most important position in the FBI, before founding his own cybersecurity start-up, CrowdStrike. And it was all made possible by being proactive and using his strengths to sniff out opportunities. Another way you can create your own opportunities is by doing what’s known as platform-building, which can help make your desired direction known to all. Photographer Daniel Kelleghan is a good example. After quitting his product photography job at Groupon, he was able to shoot the fashion and architecture photos he’d always wanted to. In the meantime, he used corporate gigs to supplement his income. Kelleghan was able to gain a cult following for his photos on Instagram. Thanks to Instagram featuring his work, he was able to hit 100,000 followers almost overnight, which gave him an instant breakthrough. These days, Kelleghan’s platform gives his clients, such as Audi and Warby Parker, a way to get in contact to ask if he can shoot their products. He offers companies the chance to place their products in his Instagram feed, and he especially likes contacting hotels in places he wants to visit. That way, he gets to travel and stay in nice hotels for free. The point is that Kelleghan never stopped creating opportunities. He achieved success through education, hard work and sheer will. Without that, his “lucky break” would never have been possible. You've identified your next big move, and you’ve done it by recognizing your values and finding helpful resources. Now it's time to test out your vision in the third stage of the four-step method: piloting. The idea here is to seek out ways to pilot small-scale versions of your larger vision. That way, you can determine through experimentation whether your pivot is actually something that thrills you. Based on the results, you can adjust your methods according to your strengths and goals. Let’s look at Christian Roberts and Bill Connelly, the improv comedians behind Angry Landlord, a New York comedy show. Angry Landlord began as an experimental collaboration, since the comedians wanted to channel their talents into a new format that would fit with their interests. However, when they looked out from the stage during their third show and saw just eight people in the audience, they knew they’d have to adapt. What was and wasn’t working? What were their strengths?   Then they hit upon the answer: they had to network with comedians and build their brand. As such, they adjusted their approach and started building their social media profile. Before too long, they were posting short YouTube videos and expanding their network of comedians. Thanks to these efforts, Angry Landlord has been a sellout show ever since. Sometimes you should pilot in stages, which means incrementally increasing the risk in your experiments. That way, you don’t enact new changes all at once. Bob Gower did this. He’s a business consultant for Fortune 100 companies but was once working on developing a beginners' bondage course for couples. Gower set up a series of pilots to test his idea. However, he used the pseudonym Ryan White so as to keep the hustle separate from his day job. Instead of going all-in with a huge investment in the project, Gower continued his consulting. He thought that if enough people were interested in the Facebook group and the free PDF guide to basic bondage he’d written, he’d see it as an indication that there would also be interest in an e-book. And then, if his e-book was successful, he’d work on developing an online course. However, the experiments turned out differently than he expected. Gower still liked the project, but realized there wasn’t any point expanding it into a full-time gig. It wasn’t a waste of time, though. He was able to use his real-life stories about his bondage business endeavor in his consulting work. Not only did it give him an edge, it also made him seem authentic. Maybe you, like Gower, will find that your piloting will take you down a different path from the one you first envisaged. Once you’ve evaluated your values for planting your pivot, scanned for opportunities and connections and piloted your putative move, the only thing left to do is launch. But for some people, fear of failure can keep them from actualizing their pivot in the first place. Don’t get caught in this trap. Identify specific launch criteria to determine when to set your plan in action. You’ll need to engage in some basic troubleshooting and be prepared. Using launch criteria worked for Tom Meitner. Meitner worked answering customer service emails. His wife, Amanda, did the same job but on a different shift. They never had the chance to see each other. Meitner knew he was overqualified for his job and decided to write to 300 companies and offer his services as a copywriter. Meitner reckoned that a benchmark of success would be earning $2,500 a month freelancing. If he hit that figure, he would know he could launch properly. Within three weeks he had already made $3,000. Soon enough, he found himself in a position where he could take on more interesting work, instead of just anything he could get his hands on. Not long after that, he was able to raise his rates, and was making a six figure sum each year – all while working mostly at home. Meitner’s launch criterium was a financial benchmark, but yours needn’t be. It could also be a specific date, a milestone, an indication of external approval – such as acceptance to grad school – or even a gut feeling. More often than not, the anxieties involved in launching are rooted in a fear of failure. Just remember, though, that a good pivot also involves diverging from an original concept, especially if it’s clear that things aren’t going to plan. That’s not failure – that’s adaptation. Take Christian and John. They pivoted from their jobs as commodities traders and began SpringUps, an urban farming business. Even though the start-up was proving to be profitable after a year, it was clear that the project wasn’t going to be the cash cow they’d hoped. It wasn’t enough even to secure the financial future that was so important to them both. Consequently, they sold the company and parted ways – but they were able to bounce back. Rather than going back to trading, John landed a job at a predictive analytics startup. Christian, on the other hand, took a job in sales at a technology company. Ultimately, failures are just opportunities for another pivot. And if you feel stuck then just go back to those first three steps: plant, scan and pilot. And that’s how you pivot! What’s so great about the pivot method is that its usages aren’t limited to those pivoting into new careers. In fact, managers can employ it within their own companies. Although managers rarely discuss career mobility with their employees, a recent Inc. survey found that 51 percent of CEOs identified their biggest challenge as \"attracting and retaining skilled employees.\" If you're a manager, it's up to you to begin talking to your employees about pivoting. That’s how you keep good staff. Let’s consider Courtney John-Reader, an employee at an architectural firm. John-Reader felt she’d run her course as a digital communications coordinator at the company. Although she liked her projects as well as the company’s work, she felt she wasn’t valued enough, no matter how hard she worked. In the end, she quit. Sadly, John-Reader’s feelings are common among staff. As a manager, it’s your responsibility to promote and communicate a culture of mobility and recognition. But don’t discuss with your employees what they could or should being doing. Instead, use the basics of the pivot method: lead open-ended discussions using the simple question, \"what's next?\" On top of those efforts in leading a general discussion, you should offer real opportunities for your employees. Take the business and analytics software company SAS. SAS’s motto is “Pursue Growth and Learning.” It’s therefore keen on helping its employees reach their professional and personal goals. Consequently, the company offers business tools, equipment for hire, research resources and over 16,000 books, all with that aim in mind. You can also offer career programs to your employees. The supermarket chain Whole Foods does just this. It has job-specific certification programs that its employees can take, such as the training for the American Cheese Society’s Certified Professional Exam. These programs mean Whole Foods employees can gain skills and pivot to work in specialist sections within the company’s supermarkets. Just remember: be creative! It’s your aim to foster an environment where employees neither stagnate nor quit. It’s up to you to provide opportunities for them to pivot internally based on their skills and interests. In the end, it will be the company that benefits. The key message in these blinks: When seeking a career shift, begin by identifying your values, strengths and situation. If you then take small steps toward your goal and run experiments to test your way, pivoting can become not only manageable, but a way to keep your career exciting and dynamic. In today's job climate, pivoting provides you with the mentality you need to adapt to your surroundings, while fostering connections and opportunities. Actionable advice: Define your project-based purpose. When thinking about career motivations, we’re often encouraged to think of an all-encompassing purpose for our lives. Instead of thinking in such daunting terms, define a project-based purpose based on your values and what you want to accomplish. If you’re a teacher, perhaps you have a long-term purpose of contributing to the well-being and happiness of your students. With that in mind, you might create a project-based purpose of organizing fun and creative after-school activities. This project-based purpose will allow you to see more immediate results of your goals. If you get stuck defining your project-purpose, think about what impact you want to have on your friends, your family, your community, or society at large! Got feedback?

Do you have a game-changing idea on the order of an iPad or Uber, something that will solve the problems consumers didn’t even know they had? Then these blinks are your ticket to becoming a category king. You’ll learn how to play bigger by inventing your market category and simultaneously dominating it. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why you should seek market solutions first and not problems; why practicing patience is a rule when it comes to new ideas; and why storytelling is a requirement for any company toolbox. At the beginning of the twentieth century, if you had asked people how personal transportation could be improved, they would have told you to make a faster horse. Henry Ford, however, imagined an ambitious alternative – the Ford Model T: the first affordable, mass-produced automobile. Such a game-changing innovation is called a new category.  New categories offer consumers a vision of a new way to live and solutions to problems that few others have even considered. When you need a taxi, for instance, you often scramble to hail one from the street or search high and low for a taxi stand. Then Uber came along and said, “Why can’t the taxi come to you, no matter where you are or what time of day it is?” A person who thinks like this, who comes up with game-changing solutions, is called a category king.  Companies can be category kings, too. A company, after all, is the entity that develops the services and products that become essential in our lives. Old ways soon become obsolete, and we wonder how we ever survived before the new category came along. We often think this way, because it’s only when a category king offers the perfect solution that we realize we had a problem in the first place! To become a category king, you have to not only show people the solution but also show them the problem. Uber is a perfect example of a category king. Its innovative taxi service was all the more appealing because it highlighted the many flaws of traditional taxi companies. Before Uber, customers had to track down a cab themselves, guess how much the final ride would cost, and fumble with bills and coins. With Uber, customers can order a cab through a smartphone, get an automatic price estimate, pay by credit card and even track the progress of the cab online! When the automobile was first invented, consumers didn’t take to it quickly. People thought cars were unsafe, and it was some time before this prejudice would wane. This can be true for any new category. When a company comes up with a revolutionary idea, it often has to wait for public opinion to catch up. It’s one thing for companies to identify and develop a category, but it’s another thing entirely to make potential customers realize a problem needs solving. Picture a middle-aged IT manager who works in the corporate sector and knows the traditional ins and outs of his industry. When an innovative platform such as Salesforce.com comes along – a service that helps clients more efficiently connect with customers – it may take him years to accept it. This isn’t surprising. Neuroscience research tells us that if an idea is completely ingrained in a person’s mind, it can take between six to ten years for it to be replaced with a new, better idea. So people need time to change their minds. What’s more, to help this process along, a company should clearly understand the problems and needs of potential customers. In 2002, Microsoft’s Bill Gates developed the Tablet PC to address what he saw as a technology problem. Cell phone screens were too small to use comfortably for any reasonable length of time; laptops weren’t portable enough. Gates thought he’d nailed a solution with the tablet computer. However, the Tablet PC as a product bombed. Yet just a few years later, Apple’s Steve Jobs identified the same problem and created the iPad – a tablet computer. So what was the difference between the perceived solutions? People didn’t need a personal computer in a tablet form, but an internet device on which they could surf and deliver presentations. Jobs correctly identified this need and met it with the lightweight, intuitive iPad. So how do you go about pinpointing what’s missing in today’s world to find a market ripe for revolution? More often than not, you’ll stumble upon a gap in the market by sheer luck. To make your idea a reality, however, you’re going to need market insight. Market insight means you’re intimately familiar with how the market in which you plan to operate works. You can then use that knowledge to bring your plan to fruition. Do you know how the electric guitar came to be invented, for example? Les Paul used to play his guitar and harmonica in a parking lot. One day, a person came up to him and said that he couldn’t hear the guitar over the sound of the harmonica. This was a lightbulb moment! Paul realized he needed a louder guitar. And while it was a random comment that set Paul on his path, his knowledge of the market made him confident that his problem was shared by others, and was thus worth solving. There’s another way to discover a gap in the market, and that’s through technology insight. It’s usually scientists or engineers who have technology insight, inventing a new product or process often without deep knowledge of a market’s needs. It’s only afterward that an application is found. When the founders of VMware created virtual computers that could run virtual software, for example, they had no idea which problems their invention could solve. It was only once the company did some research that VMware’s founders discovered their solution could be useful for companies that wanted to test software safely. And just like that, a new category was discovered! The need for stories doesn’t disappear once we become adults and outgrow bedtime fairy tales. A good story still has the power to influence how we feel and what we think. According to a 2010 study by Professor Paul Zak at Claremont Graduate University, stories affect people more deeply than facts alone. Stories lead to better understanding, cooperation and motivation because listening to a story raises oxytocin levels in the brain. Oxytocin is the chemical that makes us feel empathy. So how can you make use of the power of storytelling? You can present your product and the problem it’s going to solve in the form of a story. Doing so will allow you to convey your point of view (POV) effectively – how you define your company’s place in the world and how it finds solutions to problems. Your story could be about your company’s mission, where it fits into the lives of your customers and how your new category is going to solve their problems. Coverity is a software company that finds bugs in aircraft computer code. Coverity’s story is that there are more than 100 million lines of software code in a jet airliner, and to keep the code running properly – thus keeping planes in the air – they need careful testing. In this way, the work Coverity performs suddenly seems essential – a matter of life and death! It’s not enough for the CEO to have a clear idea of the company’s point of view, however. Every employee needs to have a sound understanding of it, too. After creating your POV, your entire company needs to learn and internalize it to guarantee its effectiveness. A training course for employees can help ensure your story is the guiding principle at all levels. When a fork of lightning flashes across the sky, it lights up the night with its brilliance. In the same fashion, designing a lightning strike for your product can help gain the attention of a market. Your strike could take the form of an event that attracts everyone from potential investors, stakeholders and analysts to the media and future customers. An extraordinary event can also take potential competitors by surprise. Sensity, a tech company working in the LED lighting industry, staged such an event at Lightfair International in 2003. At this annual convention attended by lighting manufacturers and customers, Sensity unveiled a groundbreaking discovery: that light fixtures can be digitized with LED lights. This revolutionary idea allows lights to collect information on motion, sound, air quality and even weather data. Sensity dubbed its system the Light Sensory Network. The company even briefed a reporter from the Wall Street Journal about the new category a few days before the fair, and the resulting newspaper article helped to build anticipation for what was a highly successful event. To be effective, then, you have to direct your lightning strike at your target market. Sensity was clever in its choice of market. It could have made its pitch to the sensor industry, but the impact would have been minimal. By choosing the lighting industry, the company was able to show how conventional lighting was not keeping up with technological innovation. Like Sensity, you should single out a specific market, as a blanket approach won’t work. A carefully planned strategy to strike a single market will pave the way for your company to be crowned a category king! The key message in this book: To play bigger, you need to create a new market category. To do this, you have to captivate your customers with a story about how your product will meet needs they didn’t even know existed. Actionable advice: Select a team, or even an outsider, to realize your project. Once you’ve come up with a new category, you have to assemble a dedicated team to execute your project. And while company founders are committed, in most cases it’s the team who is responsible for day-to-day operations and who will have the final say in naming the new category and defining the company’s POV. If you want a fresh perspective and an alternative approach, you could also hire an external consultant to lead your project. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

According to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, his coffee deli became so hugely popular because it has always had extremely high standards for their products and work environment. The story about Starbucks shows that the success of a business depends on the authenticity of its product, and that trust, brand renewal and strong principles are essential to keep a business growing. In these blinks you’ll learn how low fat milk threatened Starbucks’ very high standards; why spending more than you have might actually not be such a bad idea; and how an experiment in 1988 made coffee-flavoured ice cream possible. If you bring up Starbucks in conversation, chances are pretty much everyone will know what you’re talking about. You know Starbucks as a successful business, but have you ever wondered how it came to be? The secret to Starbucks’ success is, for founder Howard Schultz, no secret at all. Plain and simple, the success of Starbucks lies with the brand’s authenticity, achieved by selling only the highest quality coffee. Back in 1981, Starbucks was just a small retail store. It sold exclusively dark-roasted Italian style coffee, which may be ubiquitous today, but was still a novelty back then. By roasting the coffee dark, the coffee grows in strength, gains a more powerful aroma and has the distinct taste of authentic Italian coffee. Starbucks never compromised its beans, and became known for its premium-quality, dark-roasted flavor profile that its founders were so passionate about. Because of those early business decisions, Starbucks had an undeniable feeling of authenticity about it since the start. The company has held true to its authentic coffee profile, in tough times to the present day. In 1994, coffee prices shot to an all-time high on the world market, from $0.80 to $2.74 in a matter of days, after a frost that destroyed much of Brazil’s coffee plants. During this coffee crisis, a lot of shareholders promoted the purchase of cheaper beans, to keep the price of a cup of joe stable. But Starbucks was unwilling to compromise quality and continued to sell the highest quality coffee they could, instead reducing other costs to account for the higher price of beans. When the world coffee market recovered, Starbucks had an even stronger customer base because its quality remained consistently high. From what we’ve learned in the first blink, Starbucks adheres to uncompromising business practices. So what kind of person does that make its founder? You could probably describe Howard Schultz as stubborn. In fact, that quality is what led Howard to become a part of Starbucks in the first place. After tasting the great coffee at its store in 1981, Schultz knew he wanted to become head of marketing in the Starbucks retail stores. The original founder, Jerry Baldwin, was interested. But his partners thought Schultz had too many new ideas and was too eager to create change. So Baldwin declined to hire Schultz.   At first, Schultz was devastated. But as he was so determined to join Starbucks, he called back the following day to tell Baldwin he was making a huge mistake. And, after sleeping on it, Baldwin, won over by Schultz’ persistence, offered him the job. Starbucks’ initial reluctance to hire him wasn’t the only obstacle. Later on he took leave from the company due to disagreements about brand development, and opened his own coffee shop, Il Giornale. Raising money for that venture over the course of a year, he pitched to 242 accredited investors. A whopping 217 said no. In the face of rejection, he grew more stubborn. He continued to elicit investors until he was finally able to open Il Giornale. And, his coffee shop eventually became so successful that he bought Starbucks and developed it into a billion dollar company! We can take away two lessons: (1) Business will always present obstacles; (2) A stubborn attitude is key to overcoming those stumbling blocks. Still, there’s much more to success! Read on. We’ve seen that it pays to be stubborn when dealing with people at the top of the food chain. But with everyone else vital to your business, your focus should be entirely different: build a relationship of trust with your employees. The Starbucks management team has worked hard to nurture that trust. It’s reflected in the company motto: “Treat people like family and they will be loyal and give their all.” The Starbucks family receives a great benefit package and even part-time employees are offered stock options – Bean Stock – so they are partners, not just employees. Employees are also encouraged to voice their opinions at the quarterly Open Forums, a source of valuable feedback. As a result, there is a great bond of trust between management and employees. Starbucks workers are in fact so pleased by their company that they have refused to be represented by unions since 1992, making the following statement: “You trusted us, and now we trust you.” It makes sense that if your employees trust you, they’re likely to stay with you longer. But did you know this can also improve your customer bond? For example, Starbucks has a lower turnover rate than other comparable retail stores – up to 65%, compared with up to 400% per year. Low turnover means the business is saving time and money on training new hires. But, it also helps the business in a more personal way. Many regular customers can expect that their baristas will recognize them and greet them with, “Same as usual?” That familiarity gives the customers a strong connection to the Starbucks brand, a connection that keeps them coming back. We can see that for Starbucks, trust is an invaluable commodity. We’ve all got those friends that seem to be changing their values on a whim, chasing the latest fads and trends. If they’re an acquaintance, we’ll tolerate that kind of behavior, but how would you like it if your business was changing its core principles from week to week? Neither employees nor customers would put up with it for very long, which is why it’s crucial that a business stands by its values. As we know, the core value of Starbucks is authenticity. So, taking this principle seriously has sometimes meant denying customer requests. For example, when flavoured coffee beans became available, many customers asked for the ones they could find in other stores. However, Starbucks refuses to produce them to this day, because they don’t want to pollute their high quality coffee beans with flavoring chemicals. This goes to the point where a Starbucks’ employee would grind another company’s beans for you, but they would not grind flavoured coffee beans in their grinders, as some traces of chemicals could be left behind and pollute the other coffee. In this way, values are so important at Starbucks that it’s sometimes necessary to have lengthy discussions on matters that seem, at first, totally trivial. When Starbucks began to receive customer requests for low fat milk, fights broke out. Again, authenticity drives the Starbucks visions, and it was widely considered that a Caffe Latte could only be authentic using whole fat milk. But, on the other hand, another core value at Starbucks and in any sensible business is to fulfill the customers’ wishes. So Starbucks had a dilemma on their hands. Not willing to compromise either value, the company conducted extensive testings on low fat products in order to make sure that the authentic taste would not be sacrificed. The low fat Caffe Latte was introduced only once they were sure it tasted just as good as their original whole fat Caffe Latte. To those who aren’t particularly enthusiastic about coffee, this may seem like a lot of effort for such trifling issues. But you’ve got to admire the way Starbucks fiercely upheld its values as the company grew and changed. And, as we’ll find out in the next blink, there certainly were a lot of changes in store. We all know it’s wise to be cautious with our money, be sparing and only spend what we can afford. But in business, it’s a different game where it’s often necessary to take big risks. The truth is, if you want to be successful, you’ve got to take the plunge and invest. Starbucks’ impressive and rapid growth wouldn’t have been possible if it hadn’t started “investing above the curve,” which means investing in themselves even before they needed it. Today Starbucks has 21,000 stores. But, even when they only had 20, Schultz already knew he wanted to make it big. He soon realized that his investments were most needed in one area: infrastructure. With plans to grow to 300 stores in the near future and to continue roasting its own beans, Starbucks needed roasting facilities that were up to the task. Their current roasting facilities simply wouldn’t stand the test. So, it needed to build a new one. The company also needed to attract a high-performing management team, one that had already worked with huge enterprises, with an ability to handle fast growth. In addition, it needed a sophisticated computer program, custom-built to deal with the company’s thousands of sales in hundreds of places. Altogether, these changes required a large and risky investment. Many investors were concerned by losses between 1987 and 1989, and pressured the business to change strategies. But, it became apparent that the losses were a result of investment that had not yet paid off, and that the storefronts were in fact operating at profit. So once again, Schultz stuck to his guns and the investments paid off over time. By 1990, Starbucks was making a profit and had a firm foundation for further growth. Starbucks wasn’t alone in its early losses. Most companies struggle in their initial phases. But if the reason for your losses is because you are investing above the growth curve, then you can be sure that your company will profit and expand in years to come. That strategy applies to both business plans and people, as the following blink discusses. Let’s face it: we can’t do everything ourselves. Still, superiors often feel threatened by their brightest employees, rather than tapping into their skills as an asset. Schultz, on the other hand, was smart enough to give the reigns to those with expertise in their specific areas. For example, when confronted with the challenge of creating a sales computer program for hundreds of stores, Schultz hired a programmer who had worked on the McDonald’s sales program. Having worked in a company that was far bigger than Starbucks, she was well-suited. Instead of micromanaging her every step of the way, Schultz trusted her, offered her a clean slate and let her develop the Starbucks sales program. That program is still used worldwide today. This shows just how valuable it is to trust that your specialist employees know what they’re talking about; after all, it is their specialty. In 1989, a new manager, Howard Behar, joined Starbucks. He began to rapidly change the corporate culture and openly disagreed about many tactics  – not so dissimilar to Schultz in his early days at Starbucks! At first, working with Behar was uncomfortable for some Starbucks managers. But the clever ones learned to adapt and recognize his criticism for its constructive value. With his help, Starbucks made the shift from a product-oriented company to a company that was centred on people. Behar was responsible for the Open Forums that give Starbucks employees the opportunity to provide their feedback. If management had rejected Behar because they felt threatened by him, they wouldn’t have been able to benefit from his great new ideas, ideas that make Starbucks the successful company it is today. Openness to new ideas isn’t just vital within a company; sometimes new ideas come from other sources, leading to revolutionary collaborations. In the next blink, learn how Starbucks optimized collaboration! If you want to get ahead in business, the old “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mantra won’t cut it. Brand renewal, on the other hand, will boost your success; the key is to change things before they stop working. Starbucks managed to apply brand renewal to a product as old and traditional as coffee. And, the company applied renewal at a scientific level. Don Valencia, a biomedical scientist, began experimenting with coffee in 1988. His research led him to develop a coffee extract, which he then refined until it was completely indistinguishable from real, freshly-brewed coffee. He took his idea to his local Starbucks shop, where the managers were impressed, as were those higher up in the Starbuck hierarchy. Starbucks onboarded the coffee extract, and Valencia’s invention made it possible to create products such as coffee-flavored ice cream and ready-to-drink bottled beverages. These products could be sold in supermarkets, making Starbucks popular to a wider market. Another way to create brand renewal in your company is by working with another company on a joint venture. In 1994, Starbucks began working with Pepsi to distribute cold coffee drinks, making it possible to sell Starbucks in places where there weren’t any Starbucks stores. But it wasn’t an easy match. At first, the companies couldn’t have been more different: Starbucks was a small business in which people worked on several different projects at once, whereas Pepsi employees were used to focusing on one project at a time. But instead of challenging each other, both companies chose to view these differences as complementary, and with a positive outlook they began to look for win-win solutions. This way, they were able to put the bottled Frappucino on the market, which was so popular that stores were already selling out soon after its release. Having the courage to work with others to renew your product can pay off greatly, and can even propel you to an international market. But as a company expands, it must be true to its founding spirit – the principles behind its success. Starbucks strives to keep its original culture alive, as we’ll see in the next blink. It’s a classic story for big chains to sell their soul in order to stay ahead in the game, but the same isn’t true for Starbucks. Instead, the company takes the initiative to stay intimate with its employees – no easy feat when there are about 25,000! By offering Bean Stock (stock options) Starbucks generates a sense of partnership among its employees. It tends to offer higher hourly wages than the industry standard as well other benefits, such as health insurance for employees and their partners. Schultz communicates personally with each store via email and voicemail, and each region holds quarterly meetings for store managers so that management remains in touch with the base. A survey in 1996 revealed that corporate culture was exceptional: 88% of the employees were satisfied with working at Starbucks and 89% were even proud to work at Starbucks! Not only does Starbucks strive to take care of its employees; it also strives to stand by environmental principles. For example, its disposable paper cups are a predominant environmental issue. Single use disposable paper cups generate an unseemly amount of waste, not to mention that sometimes hot beverages necessitate two cups. While disposable cups continue to be a necessary part of the business, Starbucks developed cup sleeves, so that hot beverages no longer need a double cup. The sleeves are made of half the material as a cup, and protect people’s hands from the heat, just the same. The stores also sell reusable cups to encourage people to reduce waste. And they conduct Green Sweeps, in which employees pick up trash around their neighborhoods. Every big company risks losing the small business culture from which it began, but, as Starbucks has demonstrated, it’s possible to continue to strengthen the brand, authenticity, and employee- and customer-loyalty. Key message in this book: If you want success to mirror that of Starbucks, give your customers something authentic, whose values they can trust! If you want your business to grow like Starbucks, find ways to renew your brand and create a community that cares for its employees.  Actionable advice: Be stubborn! The next time you are having trouble with a task like raising money for your project, keep in mind that Schultz was turned down 217 of the 242 times he initially elicited investments for his coffee shop business. If you really want something, persistence is the key to achieving it.

But they don’t all agree on how to stay afloat in these lightning-paced times. These blinks present entertainment giant Netflix’s survival techniques, which are driven by eight central management practices. By adopting these practices, you may well give your company the edge that Netflix continues to enjoy, whether your business is just starting out or figuring out how to surge ahead of the competition. You’ll also learn why managers should listen to employees; the downside of the annual review system; and that working for Yahoo! won’t prepare you for life at Netflix. If you’re a business manager, then you know that efficiency is key to success. And you probably have a set of procedures and policies that keep things efficient – a strict workflow that ensures relevant issues are brought to your attention as quickly as possible. But what if you were to learn that rigid structuring and inflexible procedures, though supposedly making your business more efficient, were, in fact, making it less so? In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing market, it’s best to make your business lean – that is, as procedure-free and structureless as possible. The first step toward leanness is to jettison the traditional, top-down management that’s hog-tying most businesses. The goal is to be as agile as possible, and if employees must seek your approval or opinion whenever a decision needs to be made, your business will become stiff and sluggish – the opposite of what it should be. Netflix is an excellent example of corporate nimbleness. With grace and speed, they adapted to the changing needs of viewers, transitioning from a by-mail DVD-rental company to a top-notch streaming service. This nimble adaptation would have been impossible had the company been mired in outmoded management protocols. But perhaps your company relies on various fixed policies, such as rewards or bonuses, to incentivize employees, and you worry that removing this structure will damage their motivation. Well, worry not. If workers feel that they’re part of a strong team and that their contributions truly matter, they’ll be more motivated than ever. And the best way to build driven teams is to give workers the freedom to solve problems and tackle projects in their own way. Indeed, once you loosen the reins, your employees may start producing even better results, because making a real contribution to important projects is a reward in and of itself. This certainly happened at Netflix. In 2001, the company experienced major economic difficulties and was forced to lay off a third of its workers. The remaining employees, all of whom were highly talented, were forced to take on more responsibilities and work, which proved quite beneficial. Now that each person’s work made a major difference, everyone put in much more effort – and Netflix was soon on its way to recovery. Imagine you’re at the edge of a raging river. You want to get to the other side, but there’s only a wooden footbridge and, for all you know, the wood is rotten and will break the moment you put weight on it. Well, if you don’t constantly communicate with employees and management, your business will be like that bridge – a potentially flimsy structure that might plunge you straight into the rapids of bankruptcy. The only way to know what challenges your employees are currently facing, what goals your teams are pursuing or what changes the market is undergoing is to talk about it. So, to make sure everyone is on the same page, take a tip from Netflix’s CEO and cofounder, Reed Hastings: with a PowerPoint presentation, explain how the business works to each new hire. This method proved so successful at Netflix that the company now has a “new employee college,” a quarterly meeting during which each department head brings all company employees up to speed on what’s happening in their department. This gives employees the chance to ask questions and thereby obtain a better understanding of how the business works – an understanding that’s important because communication shouldn’t only be top-down. Employees should have the freedom to communicate their thoughts and critiques to management as well. Just consider how things work at Netflix’s new employee college, where employees can ask managers pretty much anything, from how new management decisions are made to exactly what’s expected of new hires. Once, during one of these Q&A sessions, an employee raised a question about the film-distribution system, which, in the employee’s view, was inconvenient. This question raised a doubt in the manager’s mind. Though he’d adopted the system recently, he soon began to rethink it and, eventually, this reconsideration led to Netflix’s trademark distribution method – the simultaneous release of all of a series’ episodes. What if, unbeknownst to you, your breath reeked of garlic? Or what if, without really realizing it, you habitually picked your nose when deep in thought? Would you want your coworkers to politely ignore such pungent or unsightly details? Or would you rather have the tough news delivered to your face so that you could mend your ways? Though potentially painful, radical honesty is extremely beneficial, because it creates an atmosphere of transparency that’s conducive to continuous learning and growth – an atmosphere that politer policies will never lead to. For instance, take Eric Colson, a Netflix team leader who used to work at Yahoo!, a company that asks coworkers to support – that is, never criticize – one another. Netflix, in contrast, encourages radical honesty, and life there was initially shocking for Colson. For instance, a coworker once informed him that the content he was creating was too muddled, a comment that riled Colson at first, but later gave him food for thought and an opportunity for improvement. His communication skills gradually improved, and he quickly began to take on greater responsibilities and more important roles at the company. Now, radical honesty doesn’t mean you should just say everything that flits through your mind; hard truths should be delivered with respect and evenhandedness. This, of course, is easier said than done, especially when emotions are running high, so be sure to practice. Work out exactly what you want to say, and then deliver your lines to your partner or say them in front of the mirror. This will help you hone your tone and body language, which will make a huge difference when you deliver your critique to your coworker. Also, don’t make your criticism personal, and be sure to offer actionable advice going forward. You’re asking for a change in behavior, not an alteration of personality. For instance, if you were to say to a coworker, “You don’t focus,” he’d probably take it as a personal attack and have no idea how to remedy the situation. It’s more actionable, and less personal, to say, “I see you work hard and greatly appreciate it, but sometimes I see you spending too much time on unimportant tasks, which prevents you from getting to the truly important ones.” It’s often thought that debate is a sign of discord, and that debate within a business is a symptom of corporate disunity. But this isn’t the case at all. As long as people’s opinions are based in fact, debate is extremely generative and should be encouraged. Constructive debate, far from causing corporate division, is the best way to enliven a company. It introduces new points of view and keeps workers from getting too fixed in their work habits. It should thus be heartily encouraged. Keep in mind, however, that all opinions should be fact-based. Otherwise, the suavest rhetorician will always win the debate, no matter how slapdash her argument. At Netflix, facts are highly prized, and they undergird all arguments and important decisions. But it wasn’t always that way. Netflix once struggled with overlong video-buffering times, and sales and marketing personnel, who had to deal with disgruntled customers, would often hound the company’s engineers, telling them to fix the problem right away. But the engineers couldn’t just fix such a technically complex issue. It was at this point that the importance of fact-based debate dawned on managers. Sales and marketing should have been asking why it wasn’t easy to reduce buffering times, because, without the facts, all they could do was complain to and irritate the engineers. But a word of warning: don’t mistake data for facts. Sure, data does sometimes reflect the facts, but not always. So, it’s important to consider other variables that data sets simply can’t communicate. For example, take Netflix’s decision to launch House of Cards. It got the green light not only because data showed that viewers liked the lead actors, but because David Fincher, one of America’s preeminent directors and producers, had signed on – a fact that the data didn’t reflect. We’ve all heard that we should enjoy the moment because the present is all we have. And while that might be sound personal advice, in the world of business, it would be foolhardy not to look toward the future. More specifically, you should always hire the team you know you’ll want to work with in the future too. Oddly enough, though managers are usually good at projecting how products and services will meet the demands of future customers and developing markets, they aren’t so adept at building teams that will evolve well. Rather, they look at their team’s current shortcomings and hire to fill the gaps. This isn’t a great approach, and here’s why: if you only ever consider current performance – which can lead to overhiring, underhiring or, worse still, hiring the wrong people – your business will never reach its full potential. This problem can be obviated, however, by asking yourself what you want your team to look like in six months. Shut your eyes and envision the optimal team. Make a list of all the things that differentiate this team from your current one. Maybe they’ve developed some exciting new product prototypes, or have managed to make your software 99-percent bug-free. Now ask yourself how they got there. Was it through increased collaborative efforts, or more solitary work? Was a new team leader onboarded? Are there more, or fewer, meetings? Are there more intradepartmental efforts? Then figure out how to improve team members’ skill sets so they can achieve these results. Do they need to improve communication or become more disciplined? Are they listening to one another? Does an ace negotiator need to join the team? By asking yourself such questions, you’ll soon have a profile of a solid team that can rise to future challenges and meet changing needs. This, in turn, will help you decide what to do, and who to hire, in the present. Once you know what you want your team to look like in general, you can get down to the details of hiring individual team members, which is what we’ll look at next. More often than not, hiring goes hand in hand with firing. So what’s the most effective way to bring people on and let people go? Well, here are some helpful pointers: Employee retention shouldn’t be used as a metric of hiring success; the only yardstick for successful hiring is how talented your team members are. Most companies believe, erroneously, that retention is a fantastic way to measure their team-building success. But here’s the thing: companies must constantly adapt to the ever-changing demands of the market, and it follows that employees who no longer fit well with a company’s new direction or approach must be let go. So, regardless of how much you like a person or the excellent job she’s done, you must continuously reevaluate whether that person is truly the perfect fit for her position. Netflix is an unwavering proponent of this philosophy, which has been central to their growth and ability to innovate. They school all hiring managers in it, and you should too. Netflix also makes sure that everyone in HR commands a deep understanding of the business, even when things get technical and complex. As you doubtless know, it’s HR’s task to find and suggest potential hires to hiring managers. And so, if HR has no clue what the business is truly about, one shouldn’t be surprised when they fail to suggest quality candidates for specific positions. Many companies forget to make HR an integral part of their overall functioning. But remember: HR is responsible for finding the people that will serve as a company’s foundation, and this central role shouldn’t be ignored. Netflix certainly understands how fundamental HR is to future success; indeed, one of their hiring recruiters once saved the day when the company was negotiating a deal with Nintendo. Netflix only had had eight months to finalize a product for the Nintendo Wii, but no current team was up to the task, meaning a new one had to be formed. With a mere eight months until the deadline, this was no small challenge. Luckily, Bethany Brodsky, a dedicated recruiter, went the extra mile for the company: she familiarized herself with all the technicalities of the task and, armed with this knowledge, was able to build the perfect team, enabling the product to launch on time. Have you ever tried to resell anything? Maybe an old smartphone or laptop or car? It’s not so hard to calculate an asking price, right? All you have to do is go online, figure out how much that particular model is worth and – presto! – you’ve got a price tag. People are a bit harder to put a price on. But here’s a tip to make the calculation of employee worth a little bit easier. First, don’t merely consider the salary itself; rather, determine how much value an employee will create later on. Let’s say you’re looking to hire a new engineer, but your top choice has been offered way more – let’s say $20,000 per year more – by your main competitor. That might seem like a massive difference, but, before you politely decline to match the competitor’s offer, consider the future. Does this engineer possess a rare set of skills and experiences that will significantly increase revenue? Or maybe your second-choice candidate, unlike your first, can’t begin immediately? Or perhaps it’s worth spending an extra $20,000 to deprive the competition of this brilliant talent? When hiring, you’ve got to take such things into account. Basing your compensation offering on a simple salary survey is a mistake because it won’t give you the full picture – just a baseline figure. It’s up to you to adjust that figure to accommodate added value down the road. Furthermore, it might seem logical, and fair, to use performance reviews to determine a person’s pay. But here’s the wrench in the works: such systems – with a good review meaning more money and a poor one leading to less – usually rely on automation. A computer, after being fed the performance-review information, calculates how much a person should be paid, a number that falls within preset pay ranges and is relative to other company results. This method of calculating remuneration is inherently unfair since it utterly fails to take into account skills that are rare or in high demand, among other factors. This morning, you gave the presentation of a lifetime – and you nailed it. The audience was utterly captivated, laughed at your jokes and shouted and applauded when you finished. Now it’s evening, and it suddenly hits you: they were laughing at you, and those shouts were taunting, that applause derisive. Well, to avoid employees having such unpleasant and delayed realizations, you need to give employees feedback constantly. Instead of doing an annual performance review, hold one-on-one meetings with employees on a semi-regular basis. Giving a single, annual review means that managers and employees only get one chance for real improvement per year. It’s much more effective to give people the opportunity to adjust whenever needed rather than informing them in December that, back in April, they did something wrong. Unless there’s clear data indicating that annual reviews are benefitting your business, you’d do well to jettison the annual review system entirely. Frequent one-on-one meetings also make it easy for you to assess employee qualifications and abilities, and decide whether anyone is failing to adapt to company changes. If someone no longer seems to be a good fit, he should be let go. Here’s a tough truth: a person needn’t be a sloppy worker or a total jerk in order to be a poor fit. Indeed, he might be a solid worker and a great guy – but that doesn’t mean he’s still right for the job. Perhaps changes in the market have caused tasks to change and, because of this, he’s no longer a top performer and doesn’t have the wherewithal to become one. If this is the case, you needn’t create a plan for improvement. It’s best to simply let the person go and find someone else who can be a high performer. The key message in this book: You can create a high-performance culture in your company by getting rid of traditional top-down management hierarchies and senseless bureaucracy. Encourage debate and communication, build teams with the future in mind, surround yourself with top talent and go beyond salary surveys to calculate compensation. By implementing these principles and instating a work culture of freedom, responsibility, transparency and honest debate, you’ll be well on your way toward happy employees and a successful business.    Got feedback?

These questions are at the heart of Powers of Two, a timely meditation on the value of creative partnerships. With the advent of the internet and the collaborations we witness online every day, the idea of the lone genius as the greatest source of creativity is finally being exposed for the myth that it really is. In an exploration of the history of successful creative collaborations, you’ll learn what the most celebrated partnerships have in common, and come closer to an understanding of what defines and inspires creative chemistry – and what causes its ultimate demise. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover why competition and conflict are essential to a productive creative relationship; why giving up our individuality in a partnership can actually increase our self-confidence; and why creativity depends on a balance of solitude and engagement with others. How do great composers and artists come up with their masterpieces? The common idea is that the most celebrated geniuses of our time work as loners, locking themselves away in their studios until their masterwork is complete. This is the myth of the lone genius.  It derives from the Enlightenment era of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a time when human nature was generally understood to be solitary and self-contained. At that time, the belief that an individual’s mind is the seat of creativity was a product of the political, economic, cultural and religious beliefs of everyday life. For instance, the notion that the world itself was created by a single, divine being led artists to consider their individuality as the fundamental driver of their creative force. This idea continued into modern times – that is, until the advent of the internet.  To the same degree that the internet has changed our social and professional lives, it has also transformed our ideas about creativity, and overturned the myth of the lone genius.  The countless musical mash-ups, film parodies, collections of art or photography we view online every day have opened our eyes to the abundance of creativity that can result when two or more people collaborate or merely take inspiration from one another. We now know that, in most cases, creativity comes not only from indulging in a long stretch of “alone time” but rather from a balance of self-reflection and social interaction.  To stimulate your creativity, you have to enter into some kind of creative exchange with another entity – whether another artist, a muse or even with your inner voice. The most important factor is that this “dialogue” is a balance of self-reflection (talking with your inner self) and interaction with others.  The Dalai Lama is an example of someone who excels at both being alone and engaging deeply with others. Every morning, he wakes up at 3:30 a.m. and meditates. Then, at sunrise, he begins receiving visitors and spends the remainder of his day captivated by the company of others.  This combination of solitude and social interaction enables him to lead a creative and engaged life.  What brings people to begin a creative relationship in the first place? People often come together because they have things in common. These similarities form a kind of familiar foundation, on which both people feel comfortable. Using this foundation, and provided there is enough personal chemistry, the pair can then build a relationship that elevates them above and beyond their capabilities as individuals. But if you are a creative type, how do you meet creative partners?  These often life-changing meetings can happen in environments that seem commonplace, such as cafes, offices, parties or even weddings – what sociologist Michael Farrell calls magnet places. For example, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker met at school, a classic magnet place.  Yet similarities alone aren’t enough to stimulate the development of a creative relationship.  All creative partnerships require at least a few fundamental differences between collaborators. While common ground is the soil from which a creative relationship can grow and blossom, differences between partners introduce an element of surprise and novelty in the creative process. Indeed, a fruitful relationship doesn’t require a perfect harmony of ideas and personalities. Your most effective collaborator may be in fact a person who challenges you to leave your comfort zone, provoking you to see your ideas from a different point of view. One of the most famous creative pairings of the last century – John Lennon and Paul McCartney – were in many ways an unlikely pair. While McCartney came from a loving family and had a solid musical education, Lennon had spent his childhood living with his aunt and experienced a life filled with torment and breakups. These differences, however, were the engine of their collaborative creative force: Lennon learned much from McCartney’s musical proficiency and McCartney from Lennon’s daring. The result was an intense period of creativity, during which they co-wrote over 180 songs. One of the most famous and influential creative partnerships of the twentieth century was between dancer Suzanne Farrell and choreographer George Balanchine. Their relationship can teach us a lot about the creative process.  The interaction of all creative pairs travels through three initial stages: presence, confidence and trust. The final stage, however, that cements the creative relationship, however, is faith. Presence is the foundation of authentic interaction. To be present with someone means to be truly aware of who they are and be willing to accept them into your “space.” Once both partners establish this presence, they can be honest about how they feel with each other – their weaknesses and strengths, joys and sorrows – and the creative process can begin in earnest. After several gruelling rehearsals with Balanchine’s dance company, Farrell and Balanchine established presence with one another. Because Farrell had opened herself up emotionally to Balanchine, he was able to create choreography perfectly suited to her talents. Confidence is the next stage. When partners are confident, they have an equal amount of respect for each other. This confidence can rest on shared (even mundane) qualities, such as reliability and punctuality.  Trust, in contrast to confidence, is more holistic: it means having the belief that the other person will defend and protect you and your ideas, no matter what. In this stage, the creative partners surrender themselves to each other, confident that they’re together on the “right path.” When it came to ballet, Farrell let Balanchine be the sole judge of her capabilities. If he thought that she could perform a complex sequence of steps, she trusted his judgment and pushed herself, even if she first had doubts.  The very last stage that takes a creative relationship to its ultimate level is faith. Trust transforms into faith when the partners know instinctively that the boundaries between them have dissolved and that each partner can trust blindly the guidance of the other. This is the moment where the creative bond becomes unbreakable, and where the magic of collaboration finds its most fertile ground.  Creative relationships can involve partners making some pretty strange choices. Take artist Marina Abramovic and her partner Ulay, who chose to live together in a Citroën van for several years.  Behind their decision was the belief that spending their lives together in such a confined space would force them to take their relationship to a higher level. This kind of process is known as the ritual, and it’s the basis of some of the most successful creative partnerships.  For pairs, the most basic ritual is the regular meeting, in which they leave their individual private spaces and create a shared environment.  In this space, the pair develops its own private language. Over time, each partner can even take on the speech patterns and body language of the other – a phenomenon that psychologists call “social contagion.”  For example, investor Warren Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger are often referred to as “Siamese twins.” They wear almost identical clothes, they walk and talk in the same manner and they each have a similar sparkle in their eyes.  At this point, you may wonder whether such close bonding requires each partner to give up their sense of self. If a person becomes so involved in a relationship, wouldn’t they lose a sense of their own individuality?  Though it may seem counterintuitive, in fact the opposite is true: the more of your individuality you surrender as part of the relationship ritual, the stronger you become as an individual.  As singer and poet Patti Smith wrote in her book Just Kids, addressing her creative relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, the more time the two spent together, the more and better they knew themselves as individuals. In other words, as you give up more of your own privacy, you gain more self-confidence. As a result, your ideas and ambitions are encouraged to grow too, and you might find yourself doing the best work of your life. All creative relationships are different. In some partnerships, only one is the “star,” or the spokesperson for the pair, while the other remains in the shadows. In other partnerships, however, like Lennon and McCartney’s, each member is equally famous and revered. The star-shadow pairing is known as an asymmetrical partnership, where one partner “absorbs” the other. So, even though both play an equally crucial role in the relationship, only one partner gets the credit. This often happens in teacher-student relationships. For example, Suzanne Farrell will be forever known as Balanchine’s dancer, even though she had a major influence on most of his choreographies.  An equal pairing is known as an overt partnership. In this variation, both partners have the same status in the production of their work and both share in the public spotlight.  But there’s another type of creative pairing, in which each partner has a separate public identity. This is known as a distinct partnership. This pairing doesn’t collaborate in the traditional way, but instead serves as an advisor to, and a muse for, the other. Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe, for example, never collaborated directly, but they did rely on each other for guidance and inspiration. Because of the strength of their distinct partnership, they individually produced great works, such as Smith’s poetic tribute to Mapplethorpe, The Coral Sea, and Mapplethorpe’s famous portrait for Smith’s album, Horses.  Within each of these relationship variations, there are different types of creative partners. There’s the dreamer type, who has enormous strength of character and great ideas, but may also start things they can’t finish.  Then there’s the doer type. Doers are productive, efficient and reliable. However, they also struggle to be original and to initiate creative projects. In many cases, creativity begins when dreamers and doers partner up. Though each type might struggle individually, together they complement each other perfectly and are able to accomplish great things. As we’ve seen, many great creative relationships bloom from an intense period of closeness and bonding. But it’s equally true that time spent apart is as important as time spent together. Indeed, highly functional couples say that the secret to a good relationship is ensuring that both partners have time and space to themselves. Of course, there’s no explicit guideline for the amount of space creative partners will need. It depends on their personalities, their goals and their lifestyles. Some people need to shut themselves off from social interaction to be creative. This isn’t to suggest that they prefer isolation; they just need time and space to recharge. This process is somewhat akin to meditation, as it involves removing yourself from outside influences to calm your mind and unleash your creativity. However, beyond a certain point, distance isn’t good for creativity. To function well, creative people tend to need a mix of both autonomy and intimacy. A good example of this is the highly innovative partnership between poets Jane Kenyon and Donald Hall. Kenyon and Hall lived together, but at the same time enjoyed what they called a “double solitude.” In effect, this meant that whenever they’d meet in the kitchen to have a cup of coffee, they wouldn’t say a word to each other, but they were aware of each other’s presence. But how exactly do autonomy and intimacy serve creativity? When we’re alone, we can access our unconscious minds. Many creative people have observed that they tend to be most creative when involved in a semi-automatic activity, like walking or swimming. These activities take a certain amount of conscious attention, but leave the unconscious part of their minds free to be used as a creative resource. Psychologist Greg Feist believes that the most effective creative method is to separate the stages of generating ideas from the process of evaluating and elaborating on those ideas. In other words, first, work in solitude, and then, present your work to your partner and develop your ideas in collaboration. Although a harmonious creative relationship may be pleasant, the fact is that a more competitive relationship tends to lead to better creative work. Certainly competition motivates us to do a great job. It’s in our nature to strive to do better than our neighbors. This is no bad thing, as rivalry can motivate us to work harder and inspire us to improve ourselves. Lennon and McCartney were in constant competition with each other. So, when John would write a hit like “Strawberry Fields Forever,” Paul responded by writing a song like “Penny Lane.” Sometimes the sense of competition can be so subtle that both partners are unaware of it. When novelist Sheila Heti was asked if she was in competition with her partner, painter and filmmaker Margaux Williamson, she responded that it was impossible since they worked in totally different fields. But Heti also said that if Williamson had a more productive week than she had, she would immediately try to do a better job in her writing. Naturally, the constant battle for power that such competition entails can bring conflict between partners. But this conflict can be healthy: often, when two people are fighting for the upper hand, they’ll also inadvertently drive the creative process forward. For example, in an attempt to be the more powerful team member, a partner can become tyrannical and make the other partner fearful. This turns that partner into a “subordinate” who will then work harder to satisfy the powerful partner. Curiously, this process can still lead to good creative work. One example of such a relationship is that between famous movie director Alfred Hitchcock and actress Tippi Hedren. While shooting The Birds, Hitchcock controlled Hedren’s every move. He dictated what clothes she could wear, her diet and which visitors she could see. The result was an incredible performance by Hedren, and a successful, popular film. And although Hedren was traumatized by her experience, she admitted that she’d learned more in the three years it took to make The Birds than she could’ve learned in 50 years working with a less-controlling director. Though it’s a cliche, the saying “opposites attract” happens to be true. And this is why the things you admire about your partner are often also what bring about the end of the relationship. Early on in a relationship, we are drawn toward a partner based on a certain quality or a certain feeling which we like and which inspires us. Yet, as time goes on, this quality may intensify, sometimes to the point of unbearableness. In one study, sociologist Diane Felmlee asked several people why they began a relationship and why they ended it. Interestingly, some 30 percent of respondents gave essentially the same answer for both questions. One person found his partner initially “sweet and sensitive,” but later “too nice.” Another thought her partner was “strong-willed” when she met him, but later “domineering.” Yet another was charmed by her partner’s “sense of humor,” and later annoyed because he made “too many jokes.” Another reason that relationships come to an end is that success gets in the way. Psychologists have found that people with money tend to isolate themselves, choosing to be selfish and free of dependents. Often, when too much emphasis is placed on money, we can lose touch with ourselves and with those around us. Wanting to avoid falling into this well-known trap, comedian Dave Chappelle chose to put a stop to his career. And Chappelle had good reason to be concerned: the first season of Chappelle’s Show was the best-selling TV series on DVD ever. After the second season, Chappelle’s creative partner, Neal Brennan, made a deal with Comedy Central to extend the show for two more seasons for an unprecedented $50 million. However, after filming just a handful of episodes for the third season, Chappelle left the set and then the country, without telling even his closest friends and family. In his defense, Chappelle later said that “success takes you where character cannot sustain you.” Most people would like to think that a relationship can end in the same way as a theater play: once the curtain falls, the stage goes dark and everything is forgotten. Unfortunately, such a clean ending is impossible. Often relationships don’t end exactly when we want them to. Moreover, even when they do end, we can’t truly let go of them. Take the example of Lennon and McCartney. Before The Beatles eventually split up in 1970, the duo had been going through a long period in which their relationship was incredibly strained. Tensions within the pop group were making it increasingly difficult for the pair to collaborate well. But rather than separating and perhaps ending the relationship on good terms, they chose to plough ahead. Eventually, the strain became too much to bear, and the partnership dissolved acrimoniously. But the animosity didn’t end there: both Lennon and McCartney simply couldn’t let go of their relationship, and continued to compete with each other in their years as successful solo artists. Tragically, for some people, the end of a relationship isn’t a new beginning; it really is the end. After Vincent van Gogh shot himself in the stomach in 1890, his brother and partner, Theo, gradually went insane. First he quit his job. Then he moved into a new apartment, spacious enough that he could display Vincent’s paintings, as in a museum. Ultimately, he became violent, was placed in an asylum and not soon afterward, died. Even those partnerships that come to a less dramatic end can leave an indelible mark on the people involved. Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine worked together until Balanchine was too sick to continue. The connection between them was so profound that, after his death in April 1983, Farrell reported that she felt orphaned. In the following years, Farrell drifted away from dance, eventually cutting off all contact with the New York City Ballet. The key message in this book: For centuries we have believed that creativity comes exclusively to artists who work in solitude and isolation. But behind every artistic creation exists a creative relationship. The myth of the lone genius is demolished by the power of two, because to create something meaningful there must be an exchange of ideas or emotions between two creative minds.

Many companies start out aiming to achieve greatness, yet few actually make it. Most fall back somewhere along the yellow brick road, sapped by lack of customers, lack of money or lack of management.  These blinks show you how your business can traverse this perilous path and reach a level known as predictable success, where you can plan your objectives and know you’ll reach them. The blinks will also show you how to stay there. As hard as it is to get to where you want to be, it’s just as tough to stay relevant and dynamic. So, if you want to reach – and hold onto – that sweet spot, read on. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to navigate the dangerous business rapids known as whitewater; how to grow as a business but still allow employees the space to innovate; and why a CEO with a full calendar is a sign of business weakness. Business is tough: for many companies, success – or failure – is often a matter of sheer luck. No matter how good your idea may be, it’s impossible to predict how it’ll fare upon execution.  Want to change that? Wouldn’t it be nice to achieve predictable success, when you consistently meet the goals you set for yourself? That might sound impossible, like a privilege solely reserved for companies that have been around for decades. But the truth is, neither age nor size nor finances determine a company’s predictable success.  Consider Little & Co. The credit-card payment processing company hit the top of the Inc. 500 just five years after it was founded, putting it in the same league as the 120-year-old SC Johnson. Finances don’t determine predictable success either. Microsoft might have billions of dollars in reserve, but it doesn’t consistently meet its goals; meanwhile, the small, self-funded graphic design firm the author works with has never fallen short of its annual targets.  So, if age and cash don’t lead to predictable success, what does? The answer is management. Managers with strong visions and unrelenting commitment to a set path will help their companies achieve predictable success. These leaders stay calm even when external or internal problems arise, working to assess the problem and determine the optimal response.  Flowing water is a great metaphor for the management style you need. When a stone falls into running water, the water is utterly indifferent to the motives of the stone. It simply responds accordingly, with minimal drama; when the stone is pushed downstream, the water quickly returns to its calm, still state.  In the following blinks, we’ll show you how companies learn to embody running water and achieve predictable success. No company can achieve predictable success right from the get-go if it doesn’t follow a process. And though each stage is filled with challenges, if a company plays it right they’ll be unstoppable.  First, a company will hit the early struggle. This initial stage requires you to address two simple problems: Of course, most companies fail to find an answer to these questions, which means they never advance past the first crucial stages.  To join the elite 20 percent of businesses that move further along the path to predictable success, follow this simple rule: do your best to have three times as much cash as you think you’ll need.  The author learned this lesson while helping Pizza Hut set up new franchises in Ireland: even though the franchises were convinced they had sufficient customer base to meet their cash-flow demands, they quickly ran out of money. So, to reiterate: figure out how much money your operations require, then triple that sum.  Next, once you’ve identified a viable market and stabilized your cash flow, you’ll be able to move into the second stage: fun.  In this period, your company will likely grow very quickly. Sales will flood in, bringing large amounts of revenue. Since this happy period follows the difficulties of the early struggle, it may seem like you’ve finally made it. But as a result, you may be tempted to overspend just to keep the good times rolling.  Don’t do it! Remember, you still have to pass through the third stage before you can finally achieve predictable success. So, in the second stage you’re having fun. Your business is doing well and you have plenty of customers. Seems great, right? Well, here’s where things get tricky.  When an organization grows too quickly, decision-making and execution become more difficult. During this third stage, whitewater, mistakes become very common. Prepare yourself: you’ll have to devote much of your time and resources to trying to solve these problems.  In whitewater you’ll be unable to meet the accelerating demand for your product or service. And when you can’t keep up, you might get sloppy (for example, mixing up orders) or be forced to cancel on customers. In either case, you’ll end up with unhappy customers and negative reviews, ultimately slowing down your growth.  But it doesn’t have to be that way. Any company can get out of the whitewater through effective management: make sure your sales and operations teams are working together closely. If your sales team knows how much their operations counterparts can handle, they can better manage customer expectations. The author once advised a woodworker named Ian. During their first consultation, Ian was in deep whitewater: an onslaught of customer orders had undermined the quality of his work. As a result, he was losing clients and seeing his profits decline. The author instructed Ian to finetune his communication and feedback system, to better align his sales and operations. And that’s how Ian managed to get out of the whitewater stage and achieve predictable success. Of course, maintaining predictable success in the long-term can be tricky. But in the next few blinks, we’ll show you exactly how it’s done. Congratulations, you’ve achieved predictable success! Time to breathe easy? Unfortunately, there are still challenges ahead.  Immediately after you’ve arrived at predictable success, you may encounter the treadmill. This phase occurs when a company becomes overly dependant on established systems, thus losing its creative streak.  At this point, many founders are tempted to leave their companies because their influence is waning and their energy diminishing.  That’s exactly what happened to Derek, the founder of a successful PR agency. Once his firm hit the treadmill stage, his work became increasingly bureaucratic and he could no longer identify with the company he started. As a result, he sold the majority stake to a national advertising conglomerate and moved on to new projects.  After the treadmill period, companies may fall into the big rut – the penultimate stage of organizational development. This occurs when businesses lose sight of their mission, shifting their focus away from the customer and wholly onto the company itself.  Organizations heavily populated by bureaucrats are particularly susceptible to the big rut. The author experienced this firsthand when he met the owners of a chocolate factory that had been around since 1908. Management was narrowly focused on upholding the tradition and staying faithful to the “way it’s always been done,” at the expense of innovation and progress. That’s a surefire way to lose ground to upstart rivals! Also, it can lead to the final stage of organizational development: the death rattle, which signifies the end. As a rule, companies that aren’t creative will eventually fall behind when new innovative competitors disrupt the market.  Consider what happened when the music industry shifted from CDs to MP3s: plenty of big players lost out when they failed to adapt to changing consumer demands.  Don’t let that happen to your business! Because once the death rattle has sounded, there’s no way back from the brink – the company must fold.  We’ve seen the challenges that face organizations before and after predictable success. In the upcoming blinks we’ll learn how to maintain the perfect balance. Every stage on the path to predictable success has its challenges. But the most difficult shift occurs when your company moves from whitewater to predictable success.  At this point, you may see your organization’s decision-making process become overly complex and bureaucratic. Management needs to work against this impulse, simplifying the company’s decision-making at every level.  For example, when hiring new staff, management should ask employees who will be working closely with the new team-member to define the parameters of her role and guide the search process. So, if you’re looking for a new head of marketing, ask people in the marketing department to describe what they would need and expect from a person in that position.  That way, you’re more likely to find someone who’s the right fit for the organization. What’s more, by allowing people at every level to make decisions, you simplify and speed up the process. No one wants to wait around for overworked managers to make the call. Another problem occurs when an organization scales too quickly: alignment and self-accountability are lost. In the whitewater stage, tried-and-tested company values like, “We believe in total quality” or “The customer always gets what the customer wants” may start to seem like pure rhetoric, to the detriment of quality and customer satisfaction.  As a result, employees in various departments will rewrite the vision to suit their needs. Customer service staffers may start to placate the customers or simply ignore them, while meanwhile the manufacturing department might try and stem the problem by cutting the manufacturing rate.  To deal with this, management has to work with employees to design a new company culture that everyone believes in. It’s important that you come up with a realistic vision, one which will empower employees. Doing so will recalibrate everyone’s self-accountability and align departments within the company, pushing the organization to predictable success. As we’ve learned, it’s difficult to maintain predictable success. Luckily, there are two steps you can take to avoid the treadmill, the big rut and the death rattle.  The first step requires you to install two systems. The first system turns your organization into a highly efficient decision-making machine. The author learned this lesson from one of his clients, who had implemented a very specific process: “data, debate, decide or defer.” They started by collecting the relevant information, openly debating what to do for as long as necessary, and then finally either making a decision or deferring the subject to a subgroup. This was an efficient and effective process.  The second system centers on your employees. It means your firm focuses on company- and people-driven visions, drawing on the skills and expertise of staff rather than forcing management-generated strategies onto them.  Now comes the second step for maintaining predictable success – and it’s a tricky one. You must institutionalize risk-taking and innovation. Management often fears that “institutionalizing” risk will lead to mistakes and misuse. But the thing is, risk-taking is crucial for any business; it’s the only way you can learn and innovate. So managers have to find ways to support it.  But here’s why it’s tricky: you need to be able to allow some risk-taking in order to make your company more flexible, but you also need to protect your organization from unnecessary risk – especially if it doesn’t align with your overall mission and vision. The key is to limit risk-taking to the core business. Don’t make any “wild bets” on extraneous products or services. Also, don’t ever engage in any unethical activities.  By following the predictable success framework and these two further steps, your organization will set itself up for positive long-term outcomes. If you’ve achieved predictable success but feel that you might be backsliding, there are a couple of things you can do to get back on track.  Most importantly, make sure you’re using your implemented systems effectively – not being used by them. After all, having a perfectly organized calendar doesn’t make for an effective CEO. A CEO who doesn’t have a single moment of free time in the next five weeks has no time to innovate, dream or create.  The author would advise this CEO to break free from his system and create regular “office hours,” allowing employees to drop in for an impromptu discussion. That would boost creativity and create a beneficial feedback loop between management and employees.  Prioritizing recruitment and training is another way to maintain predictable success and to avoid slipping into either treadmill or decline.  Motivate new employees and help cultivate the right mind-set by emphasizing “why” over “what.” Open up a dialogue and explain the company’s processes. That way, the employee understands the reasoning behind the systems, thus potentially finding ways to improve them.  You should also focus on success by encouraging innovation and creativity; if an employee fails to comply with a system, don’t linger on it if his decision works. That’s why your evaluation system should be more qualitative than quantitative: give employees actionable steps to improve their performance, not numerical scores.  Think of yourself as a coach with her team after the game: watching a clip of an effective, correct play will motivate the team; screening ten fumbled plays will only discourage them.  All in all, by following all these steps, your organization can maintain predictable success, avoiding both the treadmill and the decline. The key message in this book: Every organization can consistently meet its goals, regardless of size, age or finances. It isn’t a question of luck, but rather a matter of carefully following a step-by-step process.

Probably, the view will be dominated by black and white, with perhaps a few splotches of brown thrown in if you’re lucky. But probably none of these will really grab your attention. But now imagine that you spot, against all odds, a Purple Cow in the field! It’s safe to say you’d take notice, because a Purple Cow really is something remarkable! There’s a lesson in there for all companies: if your products are like the conventional black and white or even brown cows, you can’t hope to attract anyone’s attention. Instead, you need to create something exceptional: a Purple Cow. In these blinks, you’ll discover why your customers are your best marketers; why the Leaning Tower of Pisa attracts over 100 times the amount of visitors than the Pantheon does; and why being ridiculed can be a good thing. You may have noticed that there is a tremendous change underway in the dynamics of marketing. In the past, if you turned on the television or read a newspaper, you would probably only see a few products being advertised. This rarity made those products seem automatically trustworthy. Today, however, countless products are being advertised in countless ways, so the consumer is overwhelmed with advertisements. This has made capturing the consumer's attention almost impossible. This is due to the fact that people are simply too busy to recognize and focus on all the advertising around them. An illustrative anecdote of this is provided by the author: Once at a nice hotel, he asked a few people around him reading a newspaper to name two companies with full-page advertisements in the paper. No one could remember even two. This obliviousness stems from the fact that consumers ignore marketing unless it meets their exact needs. After all, you wouldn’t really take notice of car ads unless you needed a new car. This also means that traditional advertising in mass media is becoming less effective. Say your company buys a television ad. A mass of people will see it, yes, but only a fraction of that mass actually wants your product. And only a fraction of those people is willing to actually pay attention to your advertisement. Finally, only a fraction of this last subset is actually willing to buy your product. Imagine you’re launching a new brand of pain relief medication and want to advertise them. The trouble is, there’s already a multitude of pain relief brands available. This means you need to overcome three obstacles: First, you need to find consumers who want a pain reliever. Second, from this group, you need to find those customers who aren’t happy with the current options. Finally, you need to find the people who will actually listen to what you’re saying and buy your product. These trends make it increasingly challenging to really reach your target customers and market your products. As we saw in the previous blink, the dynamics of advertising are changing. Looking back at the history of advertising, we can discern three distinct periods: before, during and after advertising. Let’s take a closer look at each. Before Advertising: This is the oldest form of advertising, where consumers recommended the products and services that solved their problems to each other through word-of-mouth. For example, people might have talked about the best vegetable seller on the market square, driving more and more customers to her stand. During Advertising: In this era, advertising worked like magic; the more you advertised, the more your sales would increase. Companies could buy ads to increase sales and profits, which could then be spent on yet more advertising in a virtuous circle. After Advertisement: This is the era in which we find ourselves today. We have reverted back to word-of-mouth promotion. These days, however, social networks like Twitter and Facebook mean that word of great products and services can spread very quickly. In this new era, there is so much choice in products out there that it is not enough to satisfy the customer’s needs – to truly get attention, you need to be remarkable. To get your product or service to stand out in the market and be immediately noticeable, you need to make it a Purple Cow, something different and eye-catching. The marketing that goes into this is called remarkable marketing. A great example of a Purple Cow is the new Volkswagen Beetle. The original Beetle had been popular and profitable for over fifteen years, so the relaunch was a challenge. It turned out to be a great success though because its distinctive shape and attractive colors made it stand out from the other cars in the street. Also, great reviews and word-of-mouth spread its fame even further. No doubt you’ve seen a lot of remarkable products and services out there, so you know there are many different potential ways to achieve this. Most companies, though, are reluctant to explore ideas for becoming remarkable, because they are afraid of trying something new. To succeed, you must overcome this fear, because there is no place for boring products in the modern market. In a crowded marketplace, not standing out is equivalent to being invisible. Consider the Buick: It has always been a boring car, where the manufacturer has clearly opted not to take any risks with the design. Consequently, it has never sold particularly well. To illustrate the importance of standing out, whatever your field, consider the example of Andrew Weil. He attended Harvard Medical School, where the goal for most students was to become the best doctor around. But Weil chose a different path than his peers: he challenged the medical establishment by combining conventional and alternative medicine – a field often discredited by the medical establishment. The bold choice paid off, and he has helped hundreds of thousands of people through his clinics, writing and presentations. Another popular – but poor – strategy for businesses is “follow the leader”; emulating the actions of the leaders in the field. But this strategy will never make you a leader yourself. This is because the leaders likely attained their success by taking risks and creating something exceptional. If you merely imitate this, you will not be remarkable. Companies who choose this strategy inevitably fail in the long run, because their market is bound to change sooner or later, at which stage they’ll be trapped as they won’t have any experience in trying out new things. Just consider the music industry: For a long time, record companies just mimicked each other, producing near-identical products, with similar labelling, packaging, etc. But when the technological landscape changed, spawning, for example, online music stores, the record companies felt trapped because they had no experience in dealing with change. So now you know that you need a remarkable product. But once you have one, how do you tell the world about it? Basically, to find the right method, you must first know that there are five groups of people who will likely use a product. First, there are the innovators: people who are eager to try new things and to be at the cutting edge. Next, there are the early adopters. They are interested in new products because they want whatever advantage they might provide. Then, there are the early and late majorities. These people are the pragmatists who adopt proven products because everyone else is using them too. These groups constitute the majority of the customer base. Finally, there are the laggards, who are reluctant to adopt anything new and will only do so when they absolutely have to. Traditional marketing wisdom suggests that because they constitute the largest segment, you should target the early and late majorities first. But in fact, this is a mistake, as these people are reluctant to adopt new products before they are widely used. Instead, you should target the early adopters; they are likely to discover new products and, even more crucially, they can create buzz around the products. This means you should design your product so it attracts early adopters and helps them spread the word. As an example, consider digital cameras: they are more convenient and cheaper to use than traditional film cameras. So how would you market them? First, you should target your marketing at technology enthusiasts and professional photographers, because they constitute the early-adopter segment. This means they will appreciate your product’s benefits and convince others to use it as well. They could win you customers from the other segments. To understand how you can encourage people to spread the word about your product, ask yourself questions like “How effortlessly can people recommend your product to others?” and “Does your target group talk about products they like?” Ask yourself: What do you think “marketing” really entails? Traditionally it was thought that marketing is about communicating the value of products and services once they’ve been produced. But in fact, this is just advertising. Marketing comprises much more. Marketing is actually about inventing the product. Successful products have been built from day one so that every aspect of the product – design, production, pricing and sales – is influenced by marketing considerations, meaning how to make the product such that people will talk about it. For example, the CEO of the airline JetBlue asked the Head of Marketing to be involved in product design and employee training from the start. What’s more, marketing means finding a competitive advantage – an edge – that will differentiate you from competitors. To discover your edge, you must try out various ones, carefully comparing where your own and your competitors’ products differ in aspects like pricing and promotion. Because the heart of marketing lies in your actual product, you should come up with a simple and easy slogan that conveys the main message behind your product. For example, consider the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It’s a world famous tourist attraction because its main message is so easy and simple to spread: it’s a leaning tower. This is its “slogan.” Meanwhile the Pantheon in Rome, while beautiful and historically more significant, lacks such a slogan and therefore only gets one percent of the annual visitors that the Leaning Tower of Pisa gets. Another example of a great slogan, though a wordless one, is the signature blue box in which Tiffany & Co. jewelry comes in. It radiates a message of elegance and quality, and every time someone gives it as a gift, they are spreading the word about the brand. As you’ve already no doubt surmised, the majority of advertisements today are ineffective: the people who see them either aren’t interested in the product or they’re not part of the early adopter segment who are open to new products and eager to spread the word about them So you may well ask: What’s so special about the advertisements that do work? And how can you tell if yours do? The key is to target your ads effectively. This is because, while earlier marketers could choose whom they wanted to reach, these days the sheer abundance of advertising means it is the customers who have to choose to listen to you. This means your advertisement has to target people looking for a solution – your solution – to their problems, and this is achieved by putting your ad in a place where they are looking for it. For example, Google Ads works well in this respect because people type in search terms that reflect what they are looking for, and the ads are selected to offer a solution to whatever problem they express. Whichever way you advertise your product, you will still need to measure the effectiveness of your marketing. This is the only way in which you can find out what works and what doesn’t so that you can optimize your actions. For example, the clothes retailer Zara keeps a close eye on how its products are received in stores and out in the world, and adjusts its selection of clothes every three or four weeks accordingly. Remember, you can only improve that which you can measure, so in addition to thinking about the effectiveness of an action, you should always also consider how much it will cost you to measure it. Many companies find it hard to be remarkable, because they are afraid. Let’s examine some of the things they’re afraid of: First, they’re afraid of criticism – being remarkable means attracting criticism, because you will stand out of the crowd. For example, the new CTS Cadillac has been widely criticized because it is ugly, despite the fact that it has sold well and that those who bought it love it. Creating something exceptional simply attracts criticism – it’s inevitable! But criticism doesn’t mean failure. In fact, if you don’t attract any criticism, you should worry, because it means you’re playing it safe, and as mentioned earlier, this is a road to failure. Second, many companies are also afraid of being inadvertently offensive or looking ridiculous if they are too bold. Indeed, being different can cause people to make fun of you. But even if someone does ridicule your product, their ridicule itself can become famous, thus further spreading the word of your product. But being offensive or outrageous isn’t something you should knowingly strive for, as it only works on occasion. What’s worse, it can create a scandal, which will create negative word-of-mouth – not what you want. Finally, perhaps the biggest fear most big companies have concerning creating Purple Cows is that it would require them to radically transform their existing infrastructure, for example, their factories. After all, once you understand what will be the thing that makes you remarkable, you will need to do whatever it takes to achieve this, and this often means big changes. A prime example of overcoming this fear can be seen in Brad Anderson, the CEO of electronics retailer Best Buy. To differentiate his company from competitors, Anderson totally changed the way the company worked, starting with selling what customers wanted to buy rather than what the company wanted to sell. This paradigm shift resulted in big changes to the infrastructure the company had heavily invested in earlier. The key message in this book: In today’s crowded marketplace, there’s no room for “ordinary” products or services anymore; either you’re remarkable or you die. To become remarkable, you need to boldly take risks and not worry about criticism. Then, when you start spreading the word of your remarkable product or service, you need to target the people who are both willing to try new things, and eager to spread the word to others. Actionable advice: If you find that your company is lagging behind the leader in the industry, resist the urge to just emulate what they are doing. Instead, take a pen and paper and make a list on how you might close the gap between you and the leader, but only include items where you do something differently from the leader. If you’re a product designer, take a course in marketing. If you’re a marketer, take a course in product design. In both cases, also spend time on the factory floor to understand how the product gets made. Creating Purple Cows demands that you invent the product with the marketing perspective already in mind.

At the most basic level, a movement is what happens whenever a group of people unite around a single vision. Therefore, a movement could be based around a powerful political idea or an exciting business concept, and the leader of a movement could be either a passionate activist or an inspired entrepreneur. Dulski is well positioned to offer advice for the potential leaders of any movement since she was the former president of Change.org, the launching pad for many of today’s most popular campaigns for change. Dulski has firsthand experience with many of the issues that leaders might face, including how to gain a following and how to keep those followers motivated once they’re on board. Many people today are motivated to see change happen in their lifetime, and they’re looking for the kind of leader who will inspire them to mobilize and fight for what they believe in. So now’s the time to give action to your words and bring your ideas to life. In these blinks, you’ll find the story behind Nike’s first ad that featured a hijabi woman; how to cope with trolls and haters; and why a “festival of failure” is a good thing to be part of. There’s no shortage of great leaders and managers working today. But the real shining stars are the ones who go the extra mile and use their leadership skills to ignite a genuine movement. People are attracted to movements because they offer a sense of purpose, something we all look for in life. When we see others driven by an exciting purpose, it’s easy for that excitement to spread and catch on. Before you know it, large numbers of people are uniting and bringing about change. Manal Rostom is one of those shining stars who used purpose to ignite change. Rostom is an Egyptian Muslim woman, and for years she’s worn a hijab, a religious veil or headscarf that covers the neck and hair. But one day, Rostom began to feel a growing public resentment toward the garment, with many media outlets publishing anti-hijab articles. It got so bad that Rostom wasn’t even allowed to enter some public spaces in Dubai because of her hijab. Fed up with the negative perceptions, she decided to start a Facebook group called “Surviving Hijab” as a place where Muslim women could share their experiences and support one another. It turned out to be a popular idea: in just a few months, the group attracted 40,000 members, and today there are around 500,000. With such a positive response, Rostom saw an opportunity to go a step further. As an athletic woman, she often received annoying comments from people wondering how she could run while wearing the extra layers of clothing. Rostam was sure there were other women who could benefit from a change in the public perception that hijabi women can’t pursue sports. So, in 2015, she contacted the head of Nike’s Middle East division, Tom Woolf, and asked why there weren’t any Nike ads in the Middle East featuring hijabi women. After a productive meeting, it was decided that Rostom would become the first woman to wear a hijab in a Nike ad. But it didn’t end there. Later that year, Rostom was also made the coach of Dubai’s Nike women’s running club. And then, in 2017, Nike released a whole line of athletic wear called Nike Pro Hijab. In addition to being a leader, Rostom is a movement-starter, and it all began with a clear purpose: to show the world that faith isn’t something that gets in the way of a woman’s accomplishments. As it turned out, many people shared this feeling – so much so that a world-changing movement formed. When you think of world-changing people, you might picture Martin Luther King, Jr. or Nelson Mandela. But you don’t have to win a Nobel Peace Prize in order to make a big difference. In fact, even small actions can have a ripple effect that leads to significant consequences. Such was the change that came from the actions of Turkish activist Erdem Gündüz. In 2013, authorities in Istanbul removed tents located in Taksim Square that were being used by activists and victims of police violence. To protest this removal, Gündüz simply stood still in Taksim Square. He was soon known as the “Standing Man,” and after a couple of hours, others joined until hundreds were standing by his side in silent protest. Gündüz stood still for eight hours, and this relatively small action had the major consequence of triggering an international movement that transcended the borders of Turkey. People worldwide were inspired to stand in solidarity against police violence. As we can see from Gündüz standing still, or from 42-year-old Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat to a white man in 1955, one person making a small gesture can have a big impact. But you don’t have to be oppressed in order to stand up against injustice. In fact, it doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from – you can make a difference in the world. Still, many of us get stuck behind mental roadblocks, so it’s important to find a way around such barriers and not get stalled. If you come from a privileged background, you shouldn’t feel like you haven’t earned the right to speak out about the issues facing certain communities – you can still speak up on behalf of others. Don’t get hung up on where to start, either. Just take the first step and get the wheels of change in motion – that’s what’s important. Sarah Kavanaugh didn’t let self-doubt stop her from taking that step. One day, she was disturbed to discover that the popular sports drink Gatorade contained brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, an ingredient that was taken off the FDA’s “Generally Regarded as Safe” list back in 1970. Kavanaugh took her first step by going to Change.org and starting a petition to make Gatorade safer for people to enjoy. Before long, the petition had 17,000 signatures and was receiving media attention. It was enough to get the change Kavanaugh was after: Gatorade’s parent company, Pepsi, eventually removed the unsafe ingredient. If having purpose is the first ingredient to change, the second essential ingredient is a well-defined vision. While purpose should answer the question of why you want to take action, vision answers the question of what the future looks like after action has been taken and change sets in. Neil Grimmer decided to take action after he couldn’t find healthy organic baby food in his local shops. So he decided to start his own baby-food company, Plum Organics. In this case, Grimmer’s purpose was for parents to have healthy food for their babies. His vision was a future where the shelves of grocery stores were well stocked with organic baby food. A well-defined vision is like a compass; it keeps you on track throughout the process of creating your movement. This is why you should have a clear vision before you start. Once you’ve started, a good way to get people on board is to use storytelling to communicate your vision. With the aid of storytelling, you can demonstrate how your vision will impact others while getting your purpose across more persuasively than by simply stating your desired goal. Certainly, the tragic story behind the “Kari’s Law” Act was a major reason the legislation managed to get passed in 2017. It all began four years earlier, when Kari, the mother of three young children, was killed in a hotel room by her husband. Kari’s kids ranged from age two to age nine, and they were in the adjoining room while Kari was being attacked. The oldest child tried to use the hotel phone to call the police but wasn’t able to get through because he didn’t know that he needed to dial nine in order to get an outside line. As Kari’s father, Hank Hunt, explained when introducing the legislation behind Kari’s Law, had there been no need to dial nine, his daughter might still have been alive. This was his purpose, and his vision was to ban any hotels or other business from requiring clients to dial extra numbers when making phone calls. Hunt’s harrowing story deeply connected people to his vision, as anyone who heard it immediately wanted to help. It’s a big reason why Kari’s Law is now a federal law in the United States. If you want to change the world, you may think that playing it nice won’t get you very far. But you shouldn’t underestimate the power of a positive attitude, especially when trying to convince people in power to help you. When you approach them respectfully, people will be far more receptive to your ideas, as well as more willing to work with you. This positive attitude means you should avoid thinking of decision-makers, such as politicians and CEOs, as “targets” that need to be forcibly convinced to do what you want them to. For example, attacking someone on Twitter is unlikely to provoke the change you’re looking for. In fact, it’s likely to kill your chances of working with that person now or in the future. Remember, many decision-makers are elected officials and public servants, whose job it is to help. So don’t get off on the wrong foot by thinking they’re inaccessible to the public and will never listen to your story. There are a number of respectful and effective ways to get the attention of decision-makers, such as peaceful demonstrations, organized phone calls, boycotts and signing petitions. Any of these methods could very well lead to a fruitful relationship with those in charge. To make your efforts even more efficient, you should map out all the relevant influencers, including people and organizations, that could possibly help your cause. Sometimes, the obvious person isn’t available or receptive, so it helps to have options. Jennifer Tyrrell was an effective agent of change because she pursued multiple avenues after she was let go by the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) when they discovered she was gay. Looking to change this discriminatory policy, Tyrrell started a petition on Change.org, but it was soon clear that dealing with BSA executives directly wasn’t effective. So she began reaching out to people on the BSA board of directors, like the CEOs of AT&T and Ernst & Young. Unlike the conservative BSA executives, these CEOs were known to support LGBTQ rights, and after Tyrrell urged them to speak out against BSA’s policies, they did just that. For good measure, Tyrrell also reached out to other LGBTQ-friendly companies that partnered with BSA, like UPS and Intel. And sure enough, they spoke up as well. Eventually, in 2013, Tyrrell’s vision was realized when BSA voted to allow gay people into their community. Getting people on board is only the start of a successful movement – you also have to know how to keep those people motivated and engaged for the duration of the movement. To sustain people’s motivation, you need to remind them of three important things about your movement: its members’ shared purpose, their continued personal growth and their strong interpersonal connections. First of all, while purpose attracts people to your movement, it’s also a big factor for keeping them motivated. When people share a purpose, it makes them feel united and as though they’re part of something important, even if the people come from widely different backgrounds. So don’t pass up a chance to remind people of that shared purpose. After Neil Grimmer started his Plum Organics baby-food business, he would remind his team about the shared purpose at company meetings every Monday morning, making it a strong, motivating start to the workweek. Next is to make sure people are growing and continuing to learn. When people recognize that your movement is helping them grow as individuals, they’ll feel more of an incentive to continue fighting for your cause – so be sure to keep challenging them. While the author was working at Change.org, she started an initiative called the 90/10 model for decision-making. It meant that every employee is expected to make 90 percent of the necessary decisions for them to be successful in their jobs. Yes, this put a lot of responsibility in employee hands, but it also challenged them to rise to the occasion. And this ensured that they were always learning and growing on the job. Finally, it’s important to create an environment where you and your team members can forge strong connections. Genuine relationships create an atmosphere of trust, which allows people to feel safer to take risks and be open and honest. This environment benefits everyone. According to a recent study at Google, the highest performers are those who feel psychologically safe. This can apply to online-based movements as well: Facebook has found that its most successful groups are ones with active administrators who create a safe and rewarding environment. They’re welcoming to new members, they ban bad behavior and they continually add new and relevant content. By making members feel comfortable and safe, such administrators set the stage for people to make strong, genuine and lasting connections. No one likes to be on the receiving end of harsh criticism, but when you’re starting a movement, criticism is practically inevitable. No matter your purpose and vision, you’re bound to encounter someone who either opposes your idea or disagrees with your approach. These days, there are two kinds of criticism: there’s the positive and constructive feedback, and then there are the “trolls” and “haters” who offer nothing constructive and only criticize in order to drag others down. So what should you do when the inevitable happens and you’re faced with an obnoxious troll? You stay positive by keeping your supporters in mind. The author spoke to plenty of petition starters while working at Change.org, and nearly all of them relied on the positive feedback of supporters when they were forced to deal with the comments of haters and trolls. By reading and rereading the positive remarks, you can remind yourself of your legion of supporters and not lose sight of the fact that haters don’t speak for everyone. It’s also worth keeping in mind that sometimes criticism can be used to your advantage. Kara Goldin did exactly that when she was considering the next step for her unique beverage company. In 2005, Goldin founded Hint Water, which came as a response to being bored with normal water but still wanting to avoid sugary drinks. Hint Water gets its name from the hint of fruit flavor it has, even though it contains no sugar or artificial sweeteners. When Goldin was exploring the option of selling her business to one of the larger beverage corporations, she was told by a high-ranking executive that they weren’t interested in Hint Water because Americans love sweet drinks and sweet drinks only. Goldin could have been discouraged by this patronizing, closed-minded remark, but instead she saw it as an opportunity. If beverage executives were under this impression and only interested in selling sweet drinks, then she could market Hint Water as a refreshing alternative and have very little competition. After all, Goldin was an American who didn’t only love sweet drinks, and she was pretty sure there were others like her. Goldin’s courage to move forward on her own paid off handsomely. Hint Water became part of a big health and wellness movement in the United States, and its value has been estimated at $100 million. Life doesn’t move in a straight line. It’s filled with ups and downs, especially when you’re trying to start a movement. So don’t be surprised if you stumble when trying to come out of the gate with a new idea. And remember, you’re not alone – every entrepreneur and leader has taken a fall at one time or another. Once you understand that obstacles are bound to appear, you can then be ready to react as best you can. The author refers to rebounding from downfalls as Rocky Moments – as in Rocky Balboa. Every one of these moments has two parts. First comes the failure, which is when you’re down and any possible success seems distant and unlikely. But if you continue to fight, you’ll eventually come to the second part, when you turn things around and triumphantly get back on your feet. Failure doesn’t mean you’re finished. In fact, you can emerge smarter by having understood what went wrong and being equipped to overcome future challenges. Therefore, you should take a close look at the reasons for the failure and share your insight with others. By being open about mistakes with your peers, you’ll be in a position to learn from their mistakes and avoid those potential pitfalls. At Change.org, there’s a regular company-wide event called the “Festival of Failure,” where people come together to share their worst experiences and downfalls. There are also smaller versions of this concept that take place between different divisions, like software engineers who share bad code experiences and discuss what went wrong and what they learned. So, when you encounter a Rocky Moment, remember that there are others out there who not only can offer support, but can help you learn from the experience. Finally, let’s consider the case of Olga Rybkovskaya, who reached out for help during a difficult time in her movement. Rybkovskaya was using Change.org to petition the Russian Ministry of Health to change a law that prohibits families from visiting intensive-care patients in the hospital. She knew success wouldn’t be easy since it would require the drawing up of new policies and guidelines. But rather than despair at the difficulties of this challenge, Rybkovskaya took a chance and reached out to the lawyers who’d signed her petition. Amazingly, she was able to get 30 lawyers to volunteer and help create the documents she needed. Olga wasn’t alone in her movement, and neither are you. If there’s change you want to see in the world, now’s the time to take action. The key message in these blinks: Anybody can start a movement. All you need is a collaborative spirit and the right strategic approach. It starts by defining your vision and moving past any doubts about the validity of your voice or ideas. If at first you fail, don’t despair. Instead, learn from your failure and use that knowledge to keep moving forward. With determination, you can make the social change you and others desire for the future, whether it’s starting a new business or changing an unjust law. Actionable advice: Ignore irrelevant criticism! Sometimes you’ll receive criticism that is helpful but delivered in a mean and unconstructive way. Even if that’s uncool, it’s still worth considering it as feedback. However, if the criticism is irrelevant, such as a comment about your appearance, just ignore it. It’s not worth your time and energy, and it won’t help you to reach your goal. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

If you start small, you need far less time and resources than you imagine. First, test the waters: don’t quit your day job to slave 100-hour weeks, but rather gauge your enthusiasm by squeezing in a few hours each week to work on your idea. You don’t need to take on crippling amounts of debt either; just use whatever facilities and equipment you have at your disposal or can easily afford. Only use external investment as a last resort, as it will not only dilute your stake in the idea but the process of looking for funding is time-consuming and distracting. In most cases, all you need is a laptop and an idea to get started; everything else is peripheral to your success anyway. When starting your company, focus all your efforts on building the core of your business. Without this core, your business cannot function. For example, hotdogs are the core of a hotdog cart operation. The core should be something you think will be stable in time. Amazon’s core isn’t only about books; it’s about fast shipping, affordable prices and a great selection. Publishing fads come and go, but these are things people will always be willing to pay for. Once your core is ready, launch immediately. Don’t wait for every aspect of the business to be fully complete. You can work out the details later. When 37signals launched its Basecamp product, they could not even bill customers yet. But with the monthly billing cycle, they knew they had four weeks to fix the issue. Just get started and wing it. You need less than you think to start your own company – launch as soon as the core of your business is ready. The only way you can attain the sense of urgency and devotion that running a successful company requires is by doing something that matters to you. If you’re going to do something, make it something you can be proud of. Some people start their business with an exit in mind from day one. This is the equivalent of entering a relationship with the aim of breaking up – absurd. Just like a relationship, running a business should be based on commitment and passion rather than the willingness to sell out at any moment. Making a stand for something that is important to you is also a great way to attract loyal followers and fans. Consider Vinnie’s Sub Shop in Chicago: they stop selling sandwiches in the afternoon because the bread is no longer as fresh as it was in the morning. The extra income they could earn in the afternoon would not make up for the loss of pride they would suffer from selling mediocre sandwiches. Their customers love this devotion to freshness. Once you have a stand, a great way to emphasize it is to pick a fight with an existing competitor. If you run a small coffee house that you see as a haven for individualists, position yourself as the anti-Starbucks. Having an enemy will provide you with instant positioning in the customer’s mind and a great story to tell. Do not, however, let your competitors dictate your own strategy. If your immediate goal is to copy the iPhone 5 or to come up with a response to it, you are doomed to always be one step behind your competition. Focus on what you’re doing, not on what others have done. Make a stand for something you care about. If your company is successful, others will try to copy it. Your only defense is to make your product inimitable by injecting it with what is unique about you. For example, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh is so obsessed with customer service that he decided to make it the guiding ethos of his company. While competing shoe stores can sell the same sneakers as Zappos, they cannot imitate this utter devotion to good customer service. A great way to find your passion is to make a product or service that you yourself would love to use. For example, when track coach Bill Bowerman wanted lighter running shoes for his team, he poured rubber into his family’s waffle iron, inventing the famous Nike waffle sole. Usually, people expect great things from products they buy but are disappointed at the actual performance delivered. Your product should be the opposite: make it so simple and easy-to-use that people will love it even more than they expected and tell their friends about it, too. If you accomplish this, you can sell your product like a drug dealer: give people a taste for free, knowing they will happily come back for more. Once you have a product that is unique and keeps customers coming back, you can share everything you know without giving away any secrets that would create imitators. Just as great chefs can promote themselves by publishing cookbooks with their prized recipes, you too can promote your company by sharing your valuable experiences and specialized knowledge openly. Better yet, teach people with how-to guides, courses and videos! Most companies – especially big ones – are so secretive that you can gain a real competitive advantage by actively teaching people about things you’ve learned. Make your product inimitable so that you can share everything you know. Many small start-ups long for mass and greater recognition, but bigger is not always better. Consider elite schools like Harvard and Cambridge. Do you think they aim to expand their campuses all over the world, educating hundreds of thousands of people annually? Unlikely. Instead, they are comfortable being the size they are, as should you. For example, having less mass and being off the media radar allows you to experiment with your business without potential screw-ups being publicized. Just like Broadway musicals are first tested in smaller cities before reaching New York, you too should take advantage of your obscurity in the beginning to experiment with different ideas and processes. Being small also allows you to keep your entire team on the frontline of the business, interacting with customers firsthand and hearing their requirements and feedback. A complex hierarchy can muffle that feedback and slow you down. When everyone is responsible for customer satisfaction, you can respond to any problems quickly, which is essential for effective customer service. Nevertheless, being small to begin with does not mean you should forget that you’re running a business. Many start-ups live in a make-believe land where they happily spend investors’ money without worrying about profitability. Such companies are not really businesses but merely glorified hobbies of their founders. If you want to build a successful business, you should have a clear path to profitability in mind from the very start. Relish the good sides of being small, but don’t forget you are running a business. When chef Gordon Ramsay fixes ailing restaurants in his TV show, Kitchen Nightmares, he always starts the process the same way: by cutting out around two thirds of the menu items. Similarly, when you run into problems with your product, consider cutting features from it. If you want to make something great, you need to chisel away stuff that is merely good. In fact, embrace your constraints. Just like Ernest Hemingway wrote Nobel-winning fiction with very sparse language, you too can make a great product or service with very few features. If your competition offers a product with lots of features, don’t try to one-up them by offering everything they do plus more. Instead, offer less features, making your product simpler and easier to use. Add value by deciding what not to sell. Think about it: great art galleries don’t display every painting in the world but rather a select few. You too must cut out the garbage and personally vouch for whatever is left. Keeping your product or service simple is not easy, though. As you gain more and more customers, you’ll start getting more and more requests to develop the product further, both from users and from within your own team. Never overreact to these requests by immediately modifying your product and adding new features as requested. If you do, your product will rapidly become unrecognizable, and probably scare away new customers since the changes have been catered to the wishes of existing ones. Say no to even the best-sounding ideas at first. If a customer request is truly important, it will keep coming up so often that you can’t ignore it. Less is more – start saying no and keep your product lean. There’s nothing wrong with having communications that reflect the true size of your company. Be proud that your small size lets you communicate frankly, contrary to the meaningless jargon-filled press releases of big corporations. For example, don’t talk about how “transparency is a corner stone of your communications strategy,” when you could just say you’re honest. Advertising and active marketing are expensive ways to connect with customers. Instead, build an audience by sharing information that they value and willingly come back for. This way you will get their attention without paying a dime. Remember that in a small organization, marketing is everyone’s responsibility. Every email, phone call, blog post and social media update constitutes marketing and can deepen your bond with customers. In fact, why not give customers a behind-the-scenes view of your company, so they can get to know you and your employees. When you do strive for actual press coverage, go for niche rather than mass media. An article in a well-targeted small magazine or blog will create much more website traffic and sales than a story in a well-known newspaper. This also allows you to approach journalists with personalized calls or notes rather than with mass press releases. The bond you form with customers will inevitably endure some rough weather as well, and being a straightforward communicator means being frank about your shortcomings and imperfections too. No one likes companies that try to sweep problems under the rug. If there’s bad news to be told, skip the pseudo-apologies in corporate lingo such as “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.” Instead, think about what kind of apology you would like to hear as a customer. Don’t emulate big corporations in your marketing and communications – be honest, personal and nimble. If you treat your team like children, they will act accordingly, and you will need to spend half your time managing them and making decisions on their behalf. Your team will quickly turn into non-thinkers and non-doers, and end up costing you a lot of time and effort while accomplishing very little. What you need are employees who can manage themselves, and such individuals only thrive in working environments where they are given trust, responsibility and autonomy. One defining characteristic of a good environment is directness in communication. Avoid abstractions and long-winded, high-level explanations. Get real, and show your team exactly what you mean. Don’t sit in meeting rooms discussing problems but go to the problem sites themselves to get a grip on what’s wrong. Criticism should be equally honest. If your team is too large and unfamiliar with each other, you will find that the discussion does not flow freely. You need frank, honest communication within your team so that bad ideas are criticized when they should be. Finally, there are certain words you should avoid when communicating within your team. Consider a situation where you’re facing a seemingly impossible task, and someone belittlingly says to you “We can’t survive without this; it should be easy for you to do.” It doesn’t exactly leave a lot of room for discussion, does it? Abrasive, value-laden words like need, must, only and can’t imply judgment about the realities of someone’s situation and can rapidly obliterate any hope of a fruitful discussion. Also, stop using the word “ASAP” entirely when asking someone for something. It suffers from inflation and merely makes other, non-ASAP requests seem less urgent. Create an environment where people manage themselves and communicate with each other honestly. As a small company, one of the key advantages you have over your larger competitors is your ability to make quick decisions without getting bogged down in bureaucracy. Start saying, “Let’s make a decision,” instead of, “Let’s think about it.” Don’t look for a perfect solution; get to good enough quickly and keep moving. Don’t over-analyze or over-plan. Unless you have a crystal ball, estimating and planning are basically guesswork anyway. If you start assuming your plans are correct and following them blindly, you lose your ability to improvise, which is downright dangerous. Instead, just wing it. Don’t make decisions far in advance but rather on the spot. Think about things that affect you this week, not next year. Small, reversible decisions that work for the time-being are much easier to make than big, life-changing ones where you have to worry about long-term consequences. Similarly, don’t make wide-ranging estimates like, “This one-year project will cost us about $1 million.” If you want to have any semblance of accuracy, chop your estimates into more manageable bits, like weeks rather than years. The impact of being wrong will also be far smaller this way. Finally, when you’re trying to make a decision, don’t be daunted by what might go wrong. There are always possible downsides to any decision but you can always deal with them when they actually happen. (Most never will.) Don’t over-plan – stay agile with quick and flexible decisions. Many people equate productivity with working long hours, when actually the opposite is true. The best employees have busy lives outside of work so they work hard to leave at five o’clock. Workaholics who stay late can even hurt the overall productivity of an organization by making non-workaholics feel guilty and less motivated. The way to maintain high productivity at work starts by stripping away interruptions that break people’s concentration. Ensure your team has some designated time during the day or week when there are no interruptions. The worst kind of interruption, of course, is a meeting. A one-hour meeting of ten people will in fact cost at least ten hours of aggregated working time. In some rare cases this may be warranted, but often meetings lack goals, agendas and any connection to actual work. In short, they only generate talk, not action. Another enemy of productivity is perfectionism. Getting bogged down in complex problems and trying to devise perfect solutions for them can consume weeks’ worth of effort, when in fact a quick fix would often be fine. To really be productive, go for solutions where you achieve the maximum effectiveness with minimal effort. “Good enough” is often better than “perfect.” One way to encourage this non-perfectionism is to chop large projects and tasks into small chunks and to-do lists. This not only makes complex endeavors more manageable but also provides more causes to celebrate along the way as minor milestones are reached. Such quick wins help sustain momentum and motivation. Productivity doesn’t follow from long hours, but rather from focused work and quick wins. Some companies are addicted to hiring people. They find someone great and decide to hire her, even without a specific job or title in mind. This is where trouble starts. When you hire someone, it should only be to solve an acute problem that is causing your company immense pain. Keeping your team lean for as long as possible will force you to adopt time-saving practices and an efficiency ethos, whereas hiring unnecessary people, no matter how great they are, will just lead to frustration and the creation of unimportant, artificial work to keep them busy. You might worry about missing out on “once-in-a-lifetime” hires, which might be a legitimate concern if your hiring pool is small. But if you are willing to hire employees from across the globe, you’ll always be able to find more great people. Almost anyone can work online these days, so the geographical location of your employees is basically irrelevant. When you do end up hiring someone, ignore the established recruitment doctrine of analyzing resumes, grade point averages and years of experience. Instead, trust your instincts and concentrate on what they have actually learned to do thanks to their past experience. Finally, test-drive your employees. No amount of interviewing will show you how a person will actually perform on the job, but giving them a mini-project to work on will let you judge them by their actions, rather than their words. BMW even went as far as to build a fake assembly line where recruiters could watch prospective employees in action. To better facilitate this on-the-job testing, always hire people to do jobs that you yourself have done at some point or another. This will also help you to manage them later on. Hire people only when absolutely necessary, and forget about resumes – trust your instincts. The key message in this book: Starting and running a company is far easier today than ever before. To build a successful business, you must inject your own uniqueness into your product and embrace the benefits of being small. Build a great working environment by emphasizing trust, independence and focus. The questions this book answered: How can you start your own business immediately? You need less than you think to start your own company – launch as soon as the core of your business is ready. Make a stand for something you care about. Make your product inimitable so that you can share everything you know. How can you use your small size to your advantage? Relish the good sides of being small, but don’t forget you are running a business. Less is more – start saying no and keep your product lean. Don’t emulate big corporations in your marketing and communications – be honest, personal and nimble. What is the new way of building and running a business? Create an environment where people manage themselves and communicate with each other honestly. Don’t over-plan – stay agile with quick and flexible decisions. Productivity doesn’t stem from long hours, but rather from focused work and quick wins.

But even though the idea of the so-called starving artist might seem romantic, the reality of having to fight to make ends meet is a tough grind. By contrast, being able to live off and even thrive from one’s art is a dream that most aspiring creatives share, and these blinks will explore how this lofty dream can become a reality. These blinks will outline – and debunk – some of the popular myths about what makes a true artist, and will explain how any artist can prosper. From the fallacy about the natural-born genius to the misconception that artists have to relentlessly promote themselves, you’ll learn how to separate genuine, helpful advice from damaging cliches in the artistic world. You'll also discover how 30 minutes of creative writing a day turned a lawyer into a best-selling author; why even 122 rejection letters should never stop you from continuing your work; and how close Rowfl the dog was to not joining the Muppets. For ages, we’ve been holding on to popular misconceptions about what it means to be a “real” artist. In the media and in our minds, true artists are depicted as starving, naturally talented and deeply original. Unfortunately, these types of ideas can scare some people away from ever entering the arts and fulfilling their creative potential. So let’s start with two of the biggest fallacies about artists, namely that they’re born with natural talent, and that their artwork must be completely original. First off, you don’t need to be born with natural talent to become an artist; what you need to do is put in hard work and show persistence and determination. With these tools in hand, even a corporate professional can become an artist. Just consider the case of lawyer turned best-selling author, John Grisham. He began by finding just 30 to 60 minutes each day to write one page of his book. Three years later he had finished his first novel, A Time to Kill. And even though 40 different publishers would come to reject it, he persisted and got to work on his second book, The Firm. Eventually, his perseverance paid off, and both books became bestsellers. They did so well that Grisham was able to quit his day job and devote all of his time to writing. His books even launched a new literary genre, the legal thriller. While you do need to be dedicated to your craft, you don’t need to reinvent its form or be wholly original to succeed. On the contrary, what you need to know is how to steal. Like Picasso said, “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” This doesn’t mean being lazy or mimicking someone else’s work; there’s a code of conduct among artists that allows for taking something that’s been done and expanding upon it or pushing it further. A great example is The Muppets. The show’s creator, Jim Henson, took the puppetry of the puppeteer Burr Tillstrom, along with the humor and jokes of other artists, like the comedian Ernie Kovacs, and combined them to create something new and exciting. Next, let’s look into what makes an artist thrive. While the image we have of the “starving artist” is a fallacy, this doesn’t mean that being an artist is easy. There’s bound to be moments of rejection, and the best way to get through these tough times is to put your stubborn side to good use. Luckily, if you feel a calling toward the arts, you probably have a stubborn side – a part of you that refuses to give up or play by someone else’s rules. Psychologist Paul Torrance believes that most creative types are misfits and rule breakers who had trouble fitting in at school. So, while you should expect to hit difficult times along the way, you can overcome these hurdles by remaining true to your stubborn self. When F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying to launch his writing career, his apartment was littered with 122 rejection letters. Yet Fitzgerald kept at it and didn’t stop until he got his first two books published, which eventually brought him critical acclaim and financial reward. Fitzgerald would later experience a major drop in his confidence and self-image, however, particularly when critics turned on him and panned his third novel, The Great Gatsby. Eventually, alcoholism and a heart attack would lead to his death at just 44 years of age. His story is especially tragic since, three years after his death, The Great Gatsby would come to be reevaluated as a modern classic, once again demonstrating the importance of persistence. Another much-needed quality is humbleness, which is necessary for an aspiring artist to learn what they need through a fruitful apprenticeship. One of the reasons the starving artist myth has prevailed is because artists who think they know it all have ended up broke. However, while the starving artist thinks they already have all the talent it takes, the thriving artist expands their skill set by seeking an apprenticeship under a true master – as Michelangelo did when he studied under the renowned Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. For any such apprenticeship to work, you must show humbleness and a willingness to be taught; no mentor wants to teach someone who thinks there’s nothing left for them to learn. Another side to the starving artist myth is that they live isolated lives and work in solitude, only to emerge when they complete their masterpiece. It’s a romantic notion, but not an accurate one, since genius doesn’t benefit from existing in a vacuum. What is far more likely, and beneficial, is for artists to create vibrant communities and nurturing environments where they can support one another. We’ve seen this throughout the years in many contexts, such as in post-WWI Paris, when Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway and James Joyce, among many others, lived and worked in the same neighborhood. More recently, in areas like Silicon Valley, creatives in the tech field have come together to invent amazing software that one lonely programmer in a basement would probably never have come up with. To cultivate collaborators, you have to know where to look. So study your field to become familiar with the best artists and find out what they do well. We see this a lot in today’s hip-hop music scene. While some have been critical of artists like Beyoncé and Kanye West because their albums have had dozens of writers collaborating on them, this isn’t a sign of inferiority; rather, it’s a sign of visionaries who can bring together great talents to create a powerful work of art. Similarly, Michelangelo worked on projects that were bigger than he could handle himself, so he worked like an engineer and a foreman, directing people to complete individual tasks. Michelangelo also knew the value of a patron, which a thriving artist must also seek out. There isn’t one kind of patron; they could be a critic or tastemaker, or anyone who can help move the artist’s career forward. Famously, Elvis Presley was catapulted to stardom with the help of Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. A 19-year-old Elvis was able to calm his nerves in front of Phillips long enough to belt out one perfect tune, “That’s All Right Mama,” and Phillips made sure it was played on the radio that very night. Two years later, every American teenager knew Elvis’s name. Finding an audience is crucial to being a thriving artist and not a starving one. But, luckily, there is more opportunity than ever for an up-and-coming artist to get noticed. While a lot of artists despise the idea of marketing and advertising and find it all rather sleazy, these days there are ways to share your art and build a following in a more natural and organic way. One of the most common ways is through a regularly updated blog that offers a peek into your creative process. As an example, let’s look at the trajectory of Stephanie Halligan, an artist who always dreamed of being an animator. Despite these dreams, Halligan was $34,579 in debt after college, so she took a job working as a financial consultant for low-income families. This led to Halligan starting a blog called the Empowered Dollar in 2012, which was a way for her to pass on the best and most effective tips she’d learned. But she still felt an artist’s calling, so after two years of the blog growing its audience, she began to add her own cartoons to accompany her new posts. Suddenly, for the first time in years, Halligan felt alive – and this feeling grew as she began to sell prints of her cartoons to her readers. Soon, she was starting a new art blog and taking on clients, such as banks and universities, who liked her motivational cartoons. But an artist can use the internet for more than just sharing their art with people. Many artists today find ways of interacting directly with their audience online. New musicians can test out new songs and release demos, while artists can share works in progress in a variety of different ways, such as through the website Bandcamp.    This is essentially like practicing in public, and it’s the best way to not only build an audience, but to get better as an artist as well. You can practice guitar in your bedroom for years and only improve so much; once you start playing in front of an audience, you’ll start playing better than you have before. This is the simple rule of the audience. One of the worst habits an artist can get into is working for free. This often happens when someone tries to tell you that a project will be “good exposure” or a “valuable opportunity.” But much like the unpaid internship, it’s often just a way for someone to exploit your talents and take advantage of you. To be a thriving rather than a starving artist, you need to adopt a mindset in which you tell yourself that you are an artist, and that your work is worth money. Placing value on your creative work is also a way of valuing the entire artistic profession, which is something Michelangelo fought for. He insisted that artistry should be considered a noble profession and that artists should be called by their last names, which was customary for only the aristocracy at the time. More recently, the novelist Steven Pressfield has stated that you become an artist once you start saying that you’re an artist. So, you can start printing those business cards that say you’re a painter, writer or graphic artist – and make sure you charge accordingly. Another thing to be aware of if you want to thrive as an artist is ownership. Countless artists have signed deals when they were just getting started that gave up ownership of their art for a lump sum of money – and they virtually always live to regret it. Luckily, The Muppets’ creator Jim Henson didn’t make this mistake. When he was just starting out, the Purina dog food company offered him $10,000 for the rights to his Rowlf the Dog puppet. His agent thought it was a great deal, but Henson wisely turned it down. If he hadn’t, he wouldn’t have been able to use Rowlf as a beloved character when he launched his television show The Muppets years later. So, the bottom line is, if you want others to respect you, you have to take ownership and always charge money. This way, you can take part in the New Renaissance, which we’ll have a look at in the last blink. Often, someone who dabbles in a variety of vocations is seen as being less talented than someone who concentrates on just one skill. But it wasn’t this way during the Renaissance. In fact, the term “Renaissance man” described a well-rounded craftsman, someone who could work in many different trades. This is the kind of person we’re starting to see more of today – a kind of New Renaissance artist. Since there have never been more ways to share the art we create and get our hands on the tools we need to make art, we are seeing the dawn of a New Renaissance. Much like during the original Renaissance, today’s artists are those who are restless in their pursuit of more than just one craft, as this makes both life and work a richer experience. Mark Frauenfelder is one such artist. He’s a mechanical engineer by trade who cofounded the website Boing Boing, which began as a zine for creative-minded people in the late 1980s. Since then, it has become a popular website, and Frauenfelder has gone on to become an associate editor for Wired magazine and the publisher of a book on magic tricks. He is also an artist in his own right, with work displayed at exhibitions across the United States. Frauenfelder knows that people have traditionally looked down on those who don’t fit neatly into one category, but he’s found success by following his artistic inspirations, wherever they may take him. For Frauenfelder, this mentality helped ensure that he never became a starving artist. He has always seen the goal of making money as a way to become your own patron; this way, you can use the money you earn to make more art and keep the cycle going. So, get out of the starving artist’s mind-set and enter the psyche of a thriving artist by studying and stealing from the great artists. Then, find an apprenticeship to learn from a master, and if you venture out on your own, be persistent until you find your audience. And finally, always remember: never work for free. The key message in this book: The romantic image of the starving artist is a myth that needs to be debunked. With so many tools and great ways to be creative and share one’s art with the world, there is no reason to adopt the mindset of a starving artist. Rather, to be a real, thriving artist, start by studying your field carefully and learning from someone you admire. With persistence and practice, you’ll be able to make great works of art. Actionable advice: Find a valuable apprenticeship by doing your homework and following the master’s lead. If there’s an artist you truly admire, study them and learn everything you can from them before you even introduce yourself. Create something that is influenced by them and your admiration for their work, and which shows that you are eager to learn. Be humble and be teachable. Then, introduce yourself to the artist and let them know that you want to learn everything they have – and are willing – to offer. Got feedback?

Whether we’re dealing with technology, work or even politics, the ground seems constantly to be shifting beneath our feet. As a result, we face new challenges on a daily basis, and we have to continuously adapt if we want to be successful. Of course, this is easier said than done. How do you do it? The secret lies in implementing the strategies that will enable you to perpetually reinvent yourself. By doing this, you can put yourself in a position to conquer the challenges of modern life. As the proverb goes, if the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. The world isn’t going to adapt to you – so it’s time for you to start adapting to it. In these blinks, you will learn what Pope Francis and Eminem can teach us about the best ways to deal with suffering; how being broke can be a blessing in disguise; and how to wake up every morning with a sense of excitement for the day ahead. Once upon a time, the road to success was straightforward: you earned a degree, landed a stable job and saved up for a comfortable retirement. This road has become a thing of the past, and yet many people are still trying to follow it – saddling themselves with debt from student loans, credit cards and mortgages along the way. The old road is no longer viable because in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing world there simply isn’t a linear, fixed and preestablished route to success; you need to blaze your own path. One of the keys to doing so is to avoid letting your degree or job title define you. Consider a company that exemplifies reinvention: Google. Catching up with a friend who works at Google, the author asked, “What are the latest projects your company is working on?” The author expected them to be search-related. But, actually, they were totally different: building an automated car, developing a bracelet to cure cancer and connecting remote areas to Wi-Fi through stratospheric balloons. In other words, Google doesn’t let its “job” (providing a search engine) define it. Google’s cofounder Larry Page doesn’t let his degree define him, either. He majored in computer science, but his job today isn’t about tinkering with software; it’s about solving major societal problems.    Of course, breaking free of the confines of your degree or job title is easier said than done. Fortunately, just because you have to blaze your own path doesn’t mean you have to go it alone; mentors can provide guidance. Here are some steps to finding them. First, do some research on a person you respect and want to learn from. Read her bio. Check out articles she’s written or interviews she’s given. Next, contact her with ideas that might help her. For example, when the author was seeking mentorship from someone who had written an academic article, he didn’t just read the article; he sent feedback, thus providing value as a mentee. As you continue on your journey, provide your mentor with progress updates every three months. That way, she can see her influence on you in action and feel appreciated. Finally, don’t just seize opportunities to meet up with your mentor; create those opportunities. It might even be worth going so far as to fly to another country and send her a message saying you’re available to discuss an idea further! Some of history’s most creative people have also been the most prolific. Pablo Picasso created 50,000 works of art, which averages at two per day. Jimi Hendrix recorded enough music to fill nearly 70 albums, despite living only 27 years. Now, you don’t need to churn out work every minute to be creative – but high production can help you sharpen your talents. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. The writer Barbara Cortland provides an inspirational example of how much you can accomplish if you put in enough work. In 1983, she set the world record for writing the most novels in a single year: an astounding 23. Her passion was writing about romance, and she pursued it every day. Thanks to her dedication, she published 723 novels and sold 600 million copies of them. The rapper Coolio provides another example. As a child, he set his heart on becoming a famous rapper. To that end, he wrote lyrics on a daily basis, beginning at the age of 14. For the next 17 years, he continued to practice and refine his craft. Finally, in 1994, his perseverance paid off with his first big hit, “Fantastic Voyage.” The next year, his perseverance paid off even more with “Gangsta’s Paradise,” which, at the time, became the number-one song in the world. In theory, you could follow Coolio’s lead by taking any skill and practicing it until you achieve your breakthrough. But how do you decide which one to practice? How can you tell which one lies in the direction of your calling? One way is to recall your childhood and ask yourself: What did I love doing or dream of doing back then? Which activity made me lose my sense of time while doing it or imagining doing it? There lies your calling. It might not seem practicable – but even if it was childish, it can still give you a starting point from which to set out.    Chip Conley, the head of hospitality at Airbnb, for instance, was led into his career in the hospitality industry by recollecting the hours he would spend imagining he was running a restaurant as a child. And a friend of Chip’s went from being a dissatisfied lawyer to a world-renowned pastry chef by remembering the pastime of her six-year-old self: making mud pies! Imagine if every morning, you woke up feeling so motivated and excited about the day ahead that you practically bolted out of bed. Does this sound like a dream compared to your present reality? If so, it’s a sign that you need to identify the goals and activities that will fill you with a burning desire to start your day and pursue your passions. Once kindled, this desire will give you the drive to overcome the obstacles in your path – a power that’s exemplified by the story of Wayne Dyer. To say the odds were stacked against him would be an understatement; he was an orphan who spent his childhood bouncing between foster homes. Nonetheless, he was able to earn a PhD in educational counseling and become a professor. He then wrote his first book, Your Erroneous Zones, which eventually sold a whopping 35 million copies. But his journey from orphanhood to best-selling author wasn’t a smooth one. At first, his book sold only 5,000 copies, which he considered a failure. However, rather than give up, he decided to buy all of the unsold books from his publisher and go on a cross-country adventure, visiting bookstores in person to convince them to sell his book. To market his book, he also tried to appear on national television – only to be rejected by the producers of every show he approached. But once again, he refused to give up; instead, he drove from station to station and promoted his book face-to-face. Thanks to his tenacity, he was able to take his initial sales numbers and multiply them by 7,000! Empowered by a burning desire like Wayne Dyer’s, you’ll be able not only to overcome your obstacles, but also to conquer your fear of failure. To see the importance of doing so, consider the Rolling Stones. Two of its founding members, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, were childhood friends who were brought back together by the passion they shared for music, which led them to form the band. The rest is history, right? Well, not quite. At first, music critics panned their songs. Reviewers derided Mick Jagger’s voice, which they said was “fuzzy and undisciplined . . . complete chaos.” But the band didn’t give up. Instead, they welcomed every gig that came their way, performing 200 concerts per year, despite earning little money from them and attracting audiences as small as four people. It was their zeal for music that enabled them to overcome their fear of failure and to become one of the most successful bands of all time. Imagine a world without borders – one where trade flows freely between nations, innovation flourishes in its wake and people extend their generosity to everyone, overcoming their ethnic, racial and social divisions. Wouldn’t this be an ideal world to live in? Well, it may take many years for this vision of the world to be realized, but we can still live by the values that animate it in the here and now by continually striving to benefit others. One person who embodies such a spirit of generosity is Pope Francis. Here is just one example. A young woman became pregnant, and her husband pressured her to have an abortion. Wanting to keep the baby, she divorced him. Afterward, she sank into depression. Desperate, she sent a letter to the pope. A few weeks later, her phone rang – and, to her surprise, it was Pope Francis himself! He comforted her over the phone, and later he even baptized the baby himself. If you think about it, such an act of kindness is remarkable. After all, the pope leads an enormous, nearly 2,000-year-old institution. Nonetheless, he frequently takes time to call the ordinary people who write to him, just to bring some happiness into their lives. Such acts of kindness earn the pope plenty of adulation – but rather than basking in it, he actively discourages us from viewing him as some sort of moral Superman. Instead, he reminds us that he is a human being who laughs and cries just like us. Why is that truth important? Because the flip side is that we are just as capable of kindness as he is. Now, it’s clear that we should try to alleviate other people’s pain – but what should we do about our own pain? One answer is to channel it into our passions. Someone who did that to great effect was the rapper Eminem. Growing up in a poor family in a trailer park, he suffered many tribulations, which continued into his young adulthood with a slew of familial betrayals and bad jobs. However, rather than stewing in his troubles, he used them as grist for his creative mill – transforming them into material for the rap lyrics that would eventually propel him from underground rap battles in Detroit to worldwide superstardom, with 220 million record sales under his belt. Imagine you’ve sparked your burning desire and identified the talent that represents your calling. Mission accomplished, right? Well, not quite. You’ve ignited your inner fire, but now you need to keep fueling it. One way of doing so is to keep practicing. Now, habitual practice takes great willpower. That’s why determination is the key to success; without it, your talent will peter out before it’s taken you far. Consider Serena Williams. She’s extremely talented at tennis, but she didn’t acquire her talents overnight. It took her years of hard work to develop them. When she was only three years old, she started a daily training regimen with her father. By the time she turned ten, she’d achieved her first success: playing in the junior circuit. But she didn’t stop there. She kept practicing and competing – and after devoting 30 years of her life to tennis, she had the goods to show for it: 23 Grand Slam titles to date, more than any other player in the world. On the opposite end of the physicality spectrum, consider the author Charles Bukowski. When he was young, he managed to get only two stories published. Then, he stopped writing for a decade. No determination, no success. But then he returned to writing with a newfound sense of resolve. For 15 years, he wrote stories and poems every single day, and he submitted thousands of them to every publication possible, enabling him to live off his writing. With his first novel, Post Office, he finally attained success. He was 49 years old. Besides challenges, there’s another form of kindling that can feed your inner fire: being broke. While this might seem like the opposite of success, it can also help you to achieve it. Consider the story of Daymond John. When he was young, his mother taught him how to sew wool hats. After sewing 80 of them, he sold them for $10 each, bringing in a total of $800 – a significant sum for them at the time, since they were strapped for cash. His fire was sparked, and he started fueling it right away. Eventually, he started the clothing brand FUBU. Within a few years, the company achieved $350 million in sales. Ten years later, it was worth $6 billion. Dedication brought him to that achievement – but being broke gave him the drive to start down his path to success. Every business has a set of values, and those values are embodied in its goals, which could range from boosting customers’ confidence to providing them with healthy, delicious food. Like a business, your values are what guide you on your journey toward success. Also like a business, if you lose sight of them, you run the risk of losing your way. That’s what often befalls family-run businesses; they go under by the third generation. Why? Well, they begin with a set of guiding values – providing upward mobility to their employees, perhaps, or ensuring customer satisfaction. The founder tries to pass those values down to her successors, but with each new generation, they get weaker and weaker. How can this be avoided? Dick Yuengling provides one answer. His family-run brewing company, D.G. Yuengling & Son, is still going strong, despite having reached its fifth generation of ownership. What’s his secret? Well, he set up his company in a novel way: instead of simply inheriting it, each new generation must purchase it from the previous one. Having to literally invest themselves in the company, the new owners are naturally led to reevaluate its values as they figure out how they want to run it. By keeping sight of your values, you too can keep your eye on the prize: your goals. But that’s not enough. To truly make progress, you also have to ensure you‘re making decisions that help you grow. Every time you make a decision in your career or business, you should ask yourself, “Was my decision fear-based or growth-oriented?” Many decisions are made out of fear. The author himself once took a job simply because he feared going broke, even though he didn’t feel any passion for the position itself. When you make a fear-based decision, it generally points toward an underlying insecurity. For example, you might stay in a job you hate because you’re afraid you won’t find another one. It’s natural to make such fear-based decisions, but it’s also inadvisable. In the author’s experience, they always lead to regret. But it’s never too late to reverse course. After just three days into the job he took out of fear, the author simply got up and walked off into the proverbial sunset. As he left, he felt a profound sense of empowerment and freedom. That’s not to say everything was easy for him from there on out. Moving forward, he often had money troubles. But his growth-oriented decision to quit his job enabled him to begin his journey toward becoming the successful author he is today. The key message in these blinks: In today’s fast-paced world, the only constant is change. Companies go bankrupt, technologies become obsolete and governments change their policies. To succeed in such a world, we must master the art of reinventing ourselves in order to navigate our way through the ever-shifting seas of the modern world and reach the shores of success.  Actionable advice: Every day, write down ten ideas on new ways you could pursue your passions.    If you get into the daily habit of writing down ten ideas per day, you’ll generate 3,650 ideas in a single year. Whether it’s about the business you want to start, the novel you want to write or the public-speaking skills you want to develop, each of these ideas will represent one possible path you could take toward achieving your goals and living out your passions. Out of all those ideas, at least one or two of them are bound to take you closer to where you want to be! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

One thing is certain, however: you’re not the only person who’s ever been rejected. Rejection in business or in life is common. Whether you’re passed up at a dance audition, turned down for the baseball team or ignored by potential investors, it’s all too easy to let rejection drain your spirits and make you give up. These blinks will show that letting rejection rule you is a big mistake. If you look at rejection from a different perspective, you’ll discover that there’s a lot to learn from it. And it isn't just about learning how to be more successful; it’s about growing as a human being. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the author decided to go on a 100-day rejection journey; why evolution has made us so scared of rejection; and how basketball star Stephon Marbury became a legend in China. Picture this scenario. You’ve a great, six-figure job at a Fortune 500 company, a wonderful spouse and own a 3,700-square-foot house. Sounds pretty fantastic, right? This was the author’s life, yet he was still unhappy because he was too scared to realize his true calling: to become a world-class entrepreneur.    It’s not so hard to get yet another job or promotion, but not pursuing your lifelong dream is a heavy burden to bear. The author’s wife realized that he was unhappy, and advised him to take six months off to set up his dream company and work as hard as he could to make it a success. If by the end of the period the company still had no investors, he could always go back to his old career. This deadline approach is effective, as it minimizes risk and forces you to set fixed goals and time limits. After a trial period, you can either keep going, or call it off. To better your chances of success, though, you need another trick up your sleeve. You have to find your own way of handling rejection. The author’s vision was to create a personal development app that helped people achieve their goals. As a newbie entrepreneur, the author assembled a team of skilled engineers to build the gamification app of which he had dreamed. But still, he needed an investor to get his company off the ground. He and his team rehearsed their sales pitch for weeks, yet in the end, the investor unfortunately said “no.” The author found he wasn’t very good at dealing with rejection. So to deal with his fear head-on, he resolved to embark on a 100-day rejection journey, blogging and recording video to chronicle his experience. Though the author’s journey was unorthodox, the lessons he learned during his challenge are certainly applicable to anyone who wants to better understand and cope with rejection. To begin to deal with rejection, you have to first understand the psychology behind the phenomenon. For example, why is rejection still a social taboo? And why does it feel so painful? Our fear of rejection is rooted in our biology and reinforced by our instinct to stay alive. When you feel physical pain, your brain releases opioids – the body’s natural painkillers – to help you cope. In a recent experiment, researchers at the University of Michigan Medical School wanted to see if the brain would release opioids if the stimulus was instead a rejection. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that the brains of people who experienced a rejection indeed released opioids, just as they would had the subject suffered actual physical trauma. It’s probably no surprise that being rejected sits on the top-ten list of people’s greatest fears. But why is that? The distress associated with rejection actually has an evolutionary foundation. Fear has always been necessary for the survival of the species. Being ostracized by our peers or protectors would leave us to face dangerous animals or environments alone, potentially leading to injury or death. No wonder we’re terrified of rejection! Yet to truly understand rejection, it’s also necessary to distinguish it from failure. While we might see failure as unfortunate yet understandable due to factors outside our control, rejection instead feels personal, since it’s another person who is saying “no,”  and frequently doing so face-to-face.   The nature of rejection involves an unequal exchange, between the rejector and the rejected. And of course it’s the rejected person who takes the biggest hit. Unlike failure, it’s hard to blame rejection on external factors, such as the market or the economy. It’s true that fear might have saved our ancestors’ skins, but today it’s more handicap than precaution. So to understand the positive aspects of rejection, we need to reframe our concept of it. Think of all the amazing, potentially life-changing ideas and opportunities that you didn’t act on for fear of rejection. To overcome your fears, you have to see rejection not as an objective final verdict about you but as the subjective opinion of others. You must realize that different people will respond to the same request in many different ways. It’s not the whole universe evaluating your skills and abilities, but a diverse array of people with varied backgrounds, personalities and ambitions. Rejection is just one of many human interactions in which at least two parties are involved and because of this, every interaction is going to be unique and will often lead to a different outcome. As part of his rejection journey, the author decided to explore rejection in the context of applying for a job. He decided to try to find a job for one day by personally introducing himself to different companies. In his first two attempts, he was rejected by office managers who brusquely informed him that he couldn’t just drop by and apply for a job. In his third attempt, however, the author met a friendly manager who offered him a job at her technology firm on the spot. So you see, facing rejection is a matter of simply trying again, even if it takes several attempts. In fact, you should bear in mind that rejection always has a number. Though it seems odd at first, it’s possible to get a “yes” just by talking to enough people. Because people’s opinions vary, eventually you are bound to find a person who can fulfill your request. Take best-selling author J.K. Rowling, for instance. In 1995, she submitted her first Harry Potter manuscript to 12 British publishers and all 12 rejected it. Yet, when Rowling’s work was eventually picked up by publisher Bloomsbury, the book went on to sell over 100 million copies. Rejection, then, is subjective. Avoid treating other people’s opinions of you as the final word on your character and what you have to offer! Sometimes after a rejection, we want the ground to swallow us up. At the very least, it’s tempting to make a swift exit from the scene. But wait! There is value in resisting the urge to run. Now is your chance to find out the reason behind the rejection. It’s a good idea to stick around and ask why you were turned down. This makes a rejection easier to deal with, and helps you formulate a more successful strategy next time. This is similar to “retreat or rout” tactics in military warfare. A retreat is a withdrawal to regroup, and is usually temporary. A rout, on the other hand, is a disordered and confused running away, a breakdown of discipline and morale. Therefore, an orderly retreat is far more desirable. Retreating means asking questions about a rejection to help you regroup and adapt your approach, according to the answers you receive. In addition to asking questions and tweaking your approach, frequently changing the audience, environment and circumstances for your pitch to will increase your chances of getting a “yes.” This effective approach involves posing your request to different people, rather than trying to repeatedly hammer home one idea to the same person. Take the case of basketball star Stephon Marbury. Getting to the top wasn’t easy, and he had lots of trouble along the way. In 2007, Marbury sank into a deep depression when his father died and his shoe company Starbury failed. After switching teams and arguing frequently with coaches and team members, he was essentially forced out of the professional league. But Marbury found a new calling, and took his career to China. In the new, different environment of Beijing, Marbury was an instant success, so much so that he became a local legend and is now even the subject of a theater musical. Before getting out there and gathering as many “yes” responses as you possibly can, you first need to learn the fundamentals of decision making. First, being authentic and disclosing the reason behind your request will greatly increase the chance of receiving a “yes.” In 1978, Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer carried out a study that proved the effectiveness of providing a reason behind a request. In her experiment, she approached people waiting in line to use a copying machine and asked if she could skip the line to make her copies first. She wanted to see if her reasons and the way she phrased the request had an immediate effect on the person’s response. She found that it did. If Langer offered an explanation, even a trivial one, to jump the line, the percentage of people willing to let her do so rose significantly. As well as being open about the motivation behind your request, acknowledging other people’s doubts will also, surprisingly, put you in their favor. In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences, Domino’s Pizza ranked at the bottom. Domino’s knew it desperately had to change, so the company completely overhauled its menu and pizza recipes. When it came to the advertising campaign to launch its new image, however, Domino’s was bold and openly slammed the former quality of its pizzas, as based on actual customer complaints. In addition to understanding other’s doubts, be sure to pitch to the right audience. Failing to do this can yield underwhelming results. One social experiment conducted by The Washington Post and violinist Joshua Bell aimed to find out how many people would recognize the musical prowess of a world-class musician if he played incognito in a New York subway station. Guess how many people stopped to listen to Bell’s 45-minute performance? A grand total of six. Talent and brilliance don’t matter if you’re targeting the wrong audience in the wrong setting. Rejection is based on a host of factors that aren’t necessarily about you. Although hurt feelings might be inevitable, a rejection doesn’t have to be a completely negative experience. Each rejection has an upside, if you’re willing to look for it! You can use rejection to motivate and increase your ability to work on even greater goals. Take NBA basketball legend Michael Jordan. When Jordan was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009, most people expected a run-of-the-mill acceptance speech. But Jordan’s talk was everything but ordinary. Jordan itemized every personal rejection he had ever received in his career, and what it had done to motivate him. He recounted everything from not being selected for varsity by his high school coach to journalists who said he’d never see the kind of success as players like Magic Johnson. Jordan concluded that each rejection had actually fed him and his goal of becoming the top-ranking player in U.S. professional basketball. In addition to being highly motivating, rejection might just be the mark of a radically creative idea, especially when the rejection is heavily influenced by a “herd mentality” or conventional thinking. Throughout history, we have seen countless examples of rejection signifying that someone is well ahead of the curve in terms of discovery and innovation. Galileo is a remarkable example of this. In 1610, Galileo published his work Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), offering his heliocentric theory in which the sun sat in the center of our known universe. Galileo's discoveries were vehemently opposed by the Catholic Church, and Inquisition authorities banned the idea of heliocentrism, ordering Galileo to refrain from defending it. But as we know now, his ideas turned out to be not only correct but also revolutionary. People face rejection everywhere and every day, from amateur entrepreneurs being shown the door to beggars in the street addressing passers by who won’t even look at them. So what can we learn from daily rejection? Rejection and suffering can be viewed as tools to better understanding people. As part of his rejection challenge, the author spent time with beggars and panhandlers and experienced firsthand what it felt like to be rejected constantly and often cruelly. It was the most taxing part of his journey, but through it, he became more empathetic. One of the people the author spent time with, a man named Frank, related an incredible story. He had served in Vietnam until he suffered an injury, which prevented him from fighting further. Frank waited a long time for the government to upgrade his veteran disability benefits so that he could cover more than just the costs of his food and shelter. The author decided to share Frank’s ordeal in his book to help him get the money he needed to make a better living. Rejection doesn’t just foster empathy; it can also teach you how much your dream really means to you. Before comedian Louis C.K. became famous, he struggled for eight years performing stand-up comedy in an obscure Boston nightclub. One night, the director of Saturday Night Live was in town to scout for new talent. He selected every comic who auditioned, except Louis C.K. Although the rejection stung, Louis C.K. saw his failed audition as an opportunity to really think about whether he wanted to pursue a career in comedy. He eventually got his break and was hired by late-night host Conan O’Brien as a writer for the show. We define ourselves through our reactions to our experiences. Using rejection wisely, we can understand others better and can choose to continue our mission or find a new calling. Overcoming rejection encourages you to take more risks in life. But it’s not just about external outcomes. You have to look inside and value yourself before you seek approval from others. The trouble is, we’re not brought up to think like this. As children, we are taught that we have to fulfill other people’s wishes, especially the wishes of our parents. But this incessant approval-seeking bleeds into other areas of our life too, and we end up wanting everyone to accept us, in our social circles and in business. Yet constant approval-seeking leads us astray from living fulfilled lives and staying true to who we really are. Your goal should be to feel comfortable in your own skin. That is, acceptance by others is not the purpose of your rejection journey. Once you value yourself, enjoying long-term success also means being able to detach yourself from the outcome. Concentrating on factors within your control, such as your effort and behavior, will promote greater success in the long term. The benefit of focusing on controllable variables means you won’t waste your energy on fretting about the unknown future. Take John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach who won ten collegiate championships over 11 years. He never rallied his team by ranting about winning or losing. All he cared about was the effort his players put into the game. Wooden was smart, as focusing on players giving their all and not agonizing over results led the coach to groundbreaking success with his team. The key message in this book: Rejection happens every day, but how you interpret rejection is up to you. As you begin to embrace rejection and learn from it, it can help you refine your goals and become one of the strongest driving forces behind living the life you really want. Actionable advice: Switch up your audience or environment. The next time you get rejected, change your environment or pitch your request to a totally different group. A change of location or listener could well lead you to the results you want. Ask “why?” before you walk out. Dont leave the site of a rejection without asking why you were turned down. Getting to the bottom of why you were rejected will give you clarity and help you to improve your approach. Accept yourself first. Being authentic and confident should be your number one priority. Believing in yourself will see you through the tough times and help others see your strengths.

A worker behind every desk, typing away on a computer. Afternoon meetings in the conference room to discuss recent projects. Gossip at the water cooler; take-away lunch in a paper bag. Yet modern technology has completely changed the way we think of work. New ways of sharing information mean that sitting in an office from 9 to 5 is no longer necessary to get things done. More and more, company employees are working outside of a main office, and employers are also sharing in the benefits of this new type of working arrangement. But as more companies begin to offer more flexibility to their workers, both employees and managers have discovered that working remotely has its own complexities. Yet with the right attitude and a few simple ground rules, companies can benefit greatly from remote work. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: how office employees can spend just as much time browsing YouTube as working; why it’s a good idea to give employees the day off when the weather’s nice; and why a company only needs to meet with its remote employees twice a year. Recent technological developments have cut the strings of workers tied to their cubicles in an office, day in and day out. Employees can now choose remote work, or work done away from an office. Remote work is immensely popular with both employees and their employers. For employers, hiring remote workers gives them access to a larger talent pool, helping them to find the best person for a certain job. Even if you don’t live in a major metropolitan area, you can still access world-class talent if you consider hiring people who live elsewhere, allowing them to work from home. Technology has made it easier to work with someone on the other side of the world. For example, a basic (and free) Skype account allows you to videoconference with co-workers, regardless of where they are. But what about the employees you already have? Should they work remotely, too? Because people often switch jobs for personal reasons, offering your best employees the option to work remotely can help keep them on your team. Even workaholics have a life outside their job – the needs of family, friends or other interests outside work sometimes require an employee to move to a new location. Rather than simply firing workers who need to move, employers can instead offer the option to work remotely. After all, it’s better to hold on to a good, trained employee than to have to manage a new employee who needs extensive training and time to get up to speed. Media production company Jellyvision considered remote work options when a skilled employee needed to move with his spouse to another state. The company didn’t want to lose him, so they offered the employee a remote position, and since have opened up the option to all employees. Remote work isn’t just good for employers, but can also improve employees’ quality of life. Remote work offers an employee the flexibility to complete daily chores while still being productive. As workers can organize their time the way they want, they can make sure that they have time for work as well as for other things, such as housework or family  time. This sort of situation is perfect for employees who require a greater degree of flexibility in their day. For example, if you work in an office, your day is dictated by the office schedule, and cutting out for two hours to pick up your children requires permission, cancelling meetings, and whatnot. Yet if you worked remotely, you could easily stop what you’re doing and quickly take care of things. Moreover, not everyone works efficiently at the same time. Some people are energetic in the morning, while others prefer working in the late afternoon or even the evening. Unconstrained by traditional working hours, remote work allows you to work whenever you’re most productive. This is especially important for people involved in creative projects. It is almost impossible to force inspiration just because the “official” work day has begun! If you’re trying to develop a cure for cancer, you can’t guarantee that your muse will be ready to go exactly between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Finally, the flexibility of remote work means that you can start working toward your dream right away. Many people put their dreams on hold until retirement, as the daily grind – a long commute, time at the office  –  doesn’t allow enough time to pursue them. Yet with remote work, you can find more time without having to choose one or the other – your hobby or your career. For example, if your dream is to travel the world, you don’t have to wait – as long as you pack a laptop you can still work full-time and finance your next great adventure. Employers might be wary to introduce remote work as they might think that allowing employees to work outside the office would encourage them to be lazy. Think again! In fact, working in an office can be far less productive than working remotely. When you work in an office, you are surrounded by other people. Distractions are rife – a coffee break here, a little chat there, and soon enough half of your work day is already squandered. Additionally, much of your work is tied to the work of others. This can lead to you being peppered with and distracted by questions that probably could wait, but that your co-workers nonetheless harass you with, as you’re sitting right there –  and “it will only take a second!” Of course, if you work remotely from home or at a coffee shop there are bound to be interruptions and distractions as well. The difference is that you can better control such disruptions. You can ignore emails that aren’t urgent until you finish your own work; you’re protected from pestering co-workers; and you can tell your spouse that you’re unreachable until noon. In this way, remote work can allow you to better focus than you would if working in an office. In addition, remote work helps employers see through the noise of unimportant details of the work day to the true quality of an employee’s work. Many managers judge the value of an employee based on secondary factors, such as how often a worker takes breaks, how often he is late, or how nice they are to other colleagues, and so on. If an employee works remotely, an employer can evaluate that employee solely based on the actual quality of his work. Think about it: What does it matter if someone starts their work day half an hour later, if the work they submit on time is impeccable? We’ve seen the benefits that remote work can offer. But if working remotely is so great for both employees and employers, why do so many companies still resist it? One frequent argument against remote work is that having employees in many different places makes it more difficult to build a company culture. However, this perspective confuses “company culture” with “team building.” Company culture isn’t about ensuring that your workers have the same lifestyle and lunch hour; it’s about how your company’s values are reflected through your employees. Things like a positive attitude toward customer needs and long-term productivity goals are what counts in building a lasting company culture. Regular face-to-face meetings between colleagues aren’t necessary, however, to understand and implement that culture. Another reason that companies resist remote work is because they believe that innovation only happens when people collaborate face-to-face. Even if this is true, companies still struggle to implement ideas that have already been developed through such face-to-face meetings. If you can’t implement each day’s new idea, there’s no need for employees to meet every day! Furthermore, many managers think that a body in a chair in an office equals productivity. In other words, if you’re not at the office, you’re not being productive. However, a manager doesn’t have more control over an employee just because she’s sitting across the hall. If anything, a manager is simply fooling himself into thinking he has control. Consider this: Some 30 percent of the internet bandwidth at the headquarters for J.C. Penney is used to watch YouTube videos. Is that productive? Not in the least.   Many companies reject remote work offhand. These companies lazily contend that, while remote work might be fine for others, it just wouldn’t work for their organization. However, companies of all sizes from all industries have successfully introduced remote work, including some organizations you might think too traditional or too big to change – AT&T, Aetna, Intel and even the U.S. government! Simply saying no to remote work without giving it a chance is foolish. So now you’re convinced, and want to give remote work a try at your company. The following blinks deal with how to make this transition. Some companies believe that they are too invested in office work to make a successful shift to remote work. However, it doesn’t matter whether you manage employees at a start-up or at a multimillion-dollar established corporation: you can always introduce remote work into your normal work flow. “Going remote” simply means that your employees aren’t chained daily to their desks at the company office. It doesn’t mean, however, they can’t be there at all. Working remotely isn’t an all-or-nothing commitment. You might first test the waters by offering a few employees the opportunity to work remotely for a few days per week, for example. This way, you can see for yourself whether remote work is a good option for your company and can get an idea of what you’ll need to pay particular attention to, before allowing more employees to work remotely for a longer period of time. But whatever you do, don’t jump to make a decision. If you want to introduce remote work, don’t base your final judgment on one single employee who has worked at home for just one week. Instead, have an entire team work remotely for a few days a week over a couple of months to get a better sense of whether the concept works for everyone, you and your employees. Interestingly, you probably use remote work already without even thinking about it. It’s quite common for companies to outsource certain tasks to third parties, such as lawyers or accountants, advertising agencies, and so on. This is actually much riskier than allowing employees to work from home! As many companies already entrust work to professionals outside the company, it shouldn’t be so hard to imagine allowing your own employees to work outside company headquarters. Most work projects involve some sort of collaboration. Designers need to talk to web programmers, project managers reach out to clients. So how do you make sure employees are collaborating effectively while working remotely? One way or another, you’ll have to ensure that your teams can communicate with each other. These lines of communication don’t need to be open around the clock, but there must be at least some effective and consistent flow of information between remote workers and the home office. Make sure that your team members can work simultaneously – wherever they may be in the world  – at least some portion of the time, so members can discuss urgent matters together. At 37signals, the authors required a four-hour overlap between employees working on the same project. This way, each employee had a half-day to work however he or she wanted, but also had at least four hours to discuss topics of concern to the whole team. You can also make collaboration easier by making company information, aside from company secrets,  open and easily accessible online or in some shared space. One way that 37signals successfully does this is by creating a shared calendar, so that everyone knows who’s available and when. Importantly, you and your employees will have to be available for clients, who might be uneasy about dealing with remote workers. It’s understandable: building trust is just that much more difficult when a client can’t shake your hand or come visit an office to see your progress in person. You should then be upfront and clear about your remote working system from the start. Be sure to be very attentive to your clients and give them plenty of opportunities to contribute to projects wherever they may be in the world! This way, they’ll be able to see the fruits of their investment with their own eyes. Colleagues can turn into close friends or at least good acquaintances as people work together over time. But how does this work if employees never see each other in person? It’s a fact that no one can work 24/7 without having some sort of social interaction, and remote workers especially so. We all need to unwind from time to time, and it’s ideal when employees can do so with other colleagues to build and maintain a sense of team spirit. Of course, remote workers can just go for a walk if they’re feeling stressed. Nonetheless, it’s important for workers to get to know each other on a more personal level. To do this, 37signals created an online chat room for remote employees where they could spend breaks, just as an in-office team would in the coffee room or lunch room. Furthermore, remote workers and their employers need to be sensitive to how remote work can affect personal relationships. For instance, when you can’t see the other person’s smile or body language across the table, it’s easy to misinterpret just their words. From this, negative relationships can develop. Remote workers thus must be extra careful about the way they communicate with each other. Managers too must pay close attention to employees’ communications and encourage a friendly atmosphere. Finally, you have to recognize that technology simply isn’t a perfect substitute for real-life interactions. You’ll have to make sure there’s some socializing in the “real world,” too. While there are countless tools that make virtual collaboration possible, people still need to connect an online name with a face at some point. It doesn’t have to happen every day or even every month, but it does need to happen eventually to build trusting, loyal relationships. 37signals does this by inviting the entire company to meet twice a year, even when there is no particular project to discuss. By doing so, employees feel more connected, and the company as a whole is better united. Because of the flexibility inherent to remote work, the work day looks a lot different for remote workers. So remember to keep their needs in mind. For starters, remote workers run the risk of becoming lost in their work. While some people believe that these employees don’t do as much work as office employees, in fact, there is a real danger that remote workers actually do too much. Because they aren’t bound to normal office hours, remote workers might feel tempted to do a little extra here and there, and because of this, can eventually burn out. Be extra careful not to encourage this kind of behavior. After all, you can’t see burnout symptoms in front of you as you would if your employee was working in the office with you. To help avoid burnout, you might consider offering remote workers an extra day off between May and October, so that they can enjoy the weather and not be tempted to work too much. After all, you want your employees to be happy and productive; to ensure this, you don’t want them spending all day in their home office. Working out, meeting new people and other leisure activities might fall by the wayside if an employee lacks the social contacts that come with working in an office. Managers, therefore, have the responsibility to encourage remote employees to live a healthy and diverse lifestyle. For example, remote employees at 37signals receive help in paying for health club memberships as well as get extra money to buy fresh fruits and vegetables for healthier meals. Employees are also supported by the company in their pursuit of hobbies outside work, as company holiday gifts help bankroll travel, as one example. Finally, if remote workers aren’t a majority of your workforce, they can easily start feeling like  “second-class workers,” as they aren’t part of everyday office dynamics. Be sure to ask them what their needs are to make them feel included. Or, ideally, have a manager do some remote work as well to see how life feels in a remote worker’s shoes. The key message in this book: Modern technology means that employers and employees can easily benefit from remote work. However, the dynamics created by remote work are different than the normal office routine, so managers need to rethink how they manage remote workers to keep everybody happy and productive.

Silverstein, Dylan Bolden, Rune Jacobsen, Rohan Sajdeh","summary":"For most companies, the road to success is paved with hard work over the course of years and years, taking one small step at a time. But then there are some companies – rocket companies – that take off unexpectedly to achieve massive success in a way that seems to defy all logic and expectations. So what’s their secret? Well, at the heart of many of these companies’ success is their relationship with their customers; you should never underestimate the power of an engaged, loyal customer to spread the gospel of your brand.  And while this is a core aspect of many companies’ overall strategies, it is just one of the many lessons to be learned from some of the most successful companies in the world today. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Les Wexner revolutionized women’s underwear; what 2/20/80 means; and how to turn a customer into an apostle. What do successful brands have in common? They know that consumers aren’t interested in abstract concepts like performance statistics and technical specifications; customers want to see and touch products that they can relate to in an instant. To accomplish this, brands need to create products that aren’t just innovative, but also intuitive.  In fact, you can open your customers’ eyes to a new world by simply forming a new market. Just take the serial entrepreneur Les Wexner, who, in the 1980s, identified the huge gap between the luxury and budget markets for women’s undergarments.  Wexner noticed that although women wanted to be sexy, they couldn’t do so without breaking the bank. It was this realization that led him to found Victoria’s Secret, a brand that endeavored to forge a new market for glamorous women’s underwear that was neither too cheap nor over-the-top luxurious.  By forging a middle ground in the market, he enabled countless women to rediscover underwear as lingerie – and the business results were incredible.  But even if you have a stellar brand and a lucrative market, you should never be satisfied; it’s essential to continually reappraise your market and reinvent your brand. For instance, when Victoria’s Secret’s annual revenue stabilized at $2 billion, Wexner went looking for ways to rebrand the company.  His search led him to hire the authors, who conducted 100 interviews with young women to gather data on their relationships to the brand.  The results? Most of the women were only wearing Victoria’s Secret products on the weekend and would rather sacrifice glamour for comfort during the week. So, armed with this information, Wexner developed models that were both sexy and comfortable. Helped along by this change, the company’s annual revenue is now over $8 billion! Did you know that the most loyal customers to a brand can generate up to eight times more revenue than their personal purchases alone? The more loyal a customer, the more they pitch your brand to others. These are your apostle consumers and they’re worth more than anything else. So, while these dedicated consumers will return time and again to buy your products, they’ll also spread the word about your company.  This is what makes apostle consumers essential, and the authors have explained their real worth through what they call the 2/20/80 rule. Here’s how it works: Say your apostle consumers comprise two percent of all your consumers. Since they always return to your brand, they actually make up 20 percent of all revenue and, more importantly, their recommendations can produce up to 80 percent of your remaining sales.  Apostle consumers are a fundamentally important aspect of your business, which is why it’s essential to reward them every time they engage with your brand. For instance, the health food store giant Whole Foods works hard to make its apostle consumers feel special every time they enter the store.  To do so, the company spends huge amounts of money and energy to make sure that every visit to a Whole Foods is a memorable experience that leaves customers hungry for more – sometimes literally.  The store often hands out complimentary samples of expensive products like wine and shrimp. In fact, many of the stores maintain a space for their customers to meet each other and enjoy free classes on cooking and health.  One of Whole Foods’ apostle consumer said that each trip to the store taught him more about nutrition and health. He even gives the company credit for helping him improve his quality of life. So, if a friend told you Whole Foods changed his life, wouldn’t you want to pay the store a visit? When a company is faced with impending failure, management often looks back to past decisions that produced previous successes. But as a rocket company, to go backward you first have to learn what your customers want now.  It’s crucial to constantly take stock of what your core customers need. If your business starts to slow down, it might be time to rethink your brand’s demand spaces, a category that helps you determine the unique needs of your customers and the different moments or spaces in which they occur.  When the food manufacturer Frito-Lay came up against a revenue wall, they used demand spaces to determine which snacks their customers wanted, when they craved them and why. For instance, the company analyzed ways in which different customer groups consumed snacks on different occasions, whether it was by themselves, with others or at certain times.  Then, they considered how they could fill these demand spaces in the market while accounting for the strengths and weaknesses of their competitors. Finally, they evaluated each opportunity and the commercial rewards made available by every demand space.  But identifying your demand spaces is just the beginning. In fact, doing so is useless without strong and effective implementation. So, once Frito-Lay finished their first round of demand space analysis, they began bringing products to market.  For example, their analysis had identified one untapped demand space that was termed “Fun Time Together” – that is, the foods consumers eat while spending time with friends. Part of the implementation for this demand space was the release of a chips and dip combination that was marketed as a snack to be enjoyed with others.  And guess what? It worked like a charm. The product’s first year saw over $100 million in sales.  So, running with this success, the company continues to delve deeper into the desires of consumers and the untapped demand spaces they can fill. To stay on top of this program, they conduct just this kind of research and implementation every year. Have you ever considered the sensory impression that consumers get when engaging with your brand? Well, if the answer is anything remotely ugly or unappealing, it’s time to reconsider your brand’s aesthetics. After all, rocket companies know that brands need to appeal to every sense.  Just take the Italian artisanal clothing manufacturer Cucinelli. They stick to the principle of great aesthetics and it has helped them build a $1-billion international business. Every item Cucinelli produces is made from high-quality, distinctive fabrics that are recognizable without any obvious branding. As a result, one apostle consumer says that converting ten of her friends to the brand simply took a single touch of her Cucinelli cashmere sweater.  But the brand’s backstory also touches on the emotions of potential customers. Cucinelli paints its founder, Brunello, as an artisanal craftsman who supports his tiny Italian village while treating his employees like family. All of these factors combine to produce a compelling and long-lasting positive first impression of the company’s brand.  So, a beautiful brand is essential and it’s important to accept that having one is going to cost a pretty penny. As visually pioneering companies such as Disney consistently prove, there’s no such thing as spending too much on aesthetics.  For example, the attention to detail Disney invests in their different theme parks costs a fortune, with new rides often costing around $200 million. Not only that, but when designing new areas in their parks, they enlist the most talented artists and architects the industry has to offer. In the process, they may well spend upwards of $1 billion for projects that take five years or longer to complete.  But all this investment in aesthetic detail is worth it, since it plays a huge role in Disney theme parks that produce yearly profits of over $1 billion! Your employees are the first people your customers interact with, so be sure to have only the best people on your team. Remember, every new hire is meaningful because new employees are the future of your brand.  In the same way that good wine doesn’t start with bad grapes, passionate employees need to come prepared with the right attitude on day one.  Just take the online shoe store Zappos. The company’s rigorous hiring process identifies a specific type of person who embodies the company’s values in everything they do. To accomplish this, every job offer is the result of a democratic process involving every person who has interacted with the potential employee.  For instance, if a potential hire makes it to the campus interview stage of the process, even the driver who gives them a lift from the airport has a say in the hiring process. And if that driver or anyone else in the process has anything bad to say, the hire is a no-go.  But building a stellar team is just the first step. Once you’ve got one, it’s important to care for your employees. In the end, the better you are to them, the better they’ll be to your customers. In fact, a golden rule of customer service is to treat your employees like you want them to treat your customers.  For instance, the Four Seasons hotel pays every employee above the industry average and offers them and their families free stays at the company’s hotels worldwide. As a result, the employees treat their customers fantastically.  So, during the horrific Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004, the Maldives Four Seasons became famous for the way it cared for its frightened guests. Every one of the hotel’s 400 employees assisted the guests in reaching safety and reserved for the guests what little food and water remained. But what’s most incredible is that not a single employee left their post throughout the entire ordeal.  Did you know that 83 percent of Americans say they would rather give up fast food than go without internet access? It’s true, and it’s because the internet offers consumers instant gratification at the mere click of a mouse.  As a result, your brand needs to pay serious attention to its internet presence. The digital world has paved new avenues for understanding and connecting with its customers, and it’s imperative to take advantage of the rise of big data analysis.  After all, the ability to gather huge quantities of information from every virtual interaction gives you a detailed look at what customers want. Just take the online retailer Amazon, whose success is founded on its effective use of big data. The company analyzes every action their customers take and uses the information to build relationships with them. What’s particularly effective is the company’s ability to predict a customer’s next purchase. What’s more, this relationship gets stronger every time a customer returns to the site to find new recommendations based on their interests.  Loads of Amazon users are converted to apostle consumers as a result of this extremely convenient shopping experience. These loyal consumers spend an average of $2,873 per year and bring in more than twice that amount by recommending the site to others.  So, virtual relationships are important. In fact, such connections can be even more special than their “traditional” counterparts. Just look at Airbnb, a site that forges virtual relationships that often lead to users meeting and sharing real-life experiences.  The site enables this possibility through its excellent review and identity verification protocols that serve to build trusting relationships between strangers. Not only that, but the company is also extremely financially successful, with a 2014 valuation of $10 billion. And it has all been made possible by the powerful virtual relationships at the core of Airbnb’s business model.  The key message in this book: Every successful brand on earth has followed common strategies to get to where they are – and so can you. By identifying and maintaining your core customers, and by putting the finishing touches on your brand’s killer aesthetic, you’ll have all the tools in place to craft a stellar brand.  Actionable advice: Understand your customers better with Toyota’s complaint as a gift strategy. Every interaction with a customer is important and careful data should be kept on all your customer engagements. This implies that customer complaints are actually a blessing in disguise, as they let you improve your brand. So, from the frontline sales team to your CEO, every employee should actively respond to customer suggestions, even if just through a simple thank-you e-mail.  Got feedback?

But Walton never forgot his humble beginnings. Indeed, those modest origins instilled in him the values that led to his developing one of the most successful retail businesses the world has ever seen: Walmart. This is the story of his life and the insights he gained into how you create, run and develop a successful business. We’ll follow him from the origin of his first store all the way to the apotheosis of the Walmart empire, and the novel ideas he introduced to get there. In these blinks, you’ll find out how a trip to England changed Walton’s perspectives on his employees; why Walton danced in a hula skirt on Wall Street; and how Walton’s rearrangement of store cashiers became the industry standard. Sam Walton was born in 1918, to a lower-class family in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. The Waltons didn’t have much but Sam’s parents made sure he was taken care of. Sam’s father, Thomas, was an honest and hard-working man who took many different jobs in order to provide for his family. Due to his sense of pride, he refused to take on any loans or debt, which meant he was never able to start his own business. Sam Walton understood this, and he would later use a loan to help start his own store. On the other hand, Sam’s mother, Nan, was quite the entrepreneur, often coming up with ideas to help the family earn extra money. During the Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Nan started a small milk business: Sam would milk the cows, his mother would bottle it and Sam would go out and deliver the milk to neighborhood customers. These childhood experiences made Sam Walton realize at an early age that he would have to work hard to earn his keep. Inspired by his mother’s efforts to bring in money for the family, Walton got his first job when he was just eight years old. He started by selling magazine subscriptions around the neighborhood, and by 7th grade he was out on his bike delivering newspapers. He continued to earn money as he worked his way toward becoming a college graduate. Walton even hired assistants, expanding his paper route into a small business that made around $5,000 a year. All of these experiences taught the young Sam Walton an important lesson: hard work pays off. So, by the time Walton was 27 years old and preparing to start his first business venture, he already knew that in order to be successful and get ahead in the world, one had to be willing to put in the effort. In 1945, at the age of 27, Sam Walton opened his first discount store, Walton’s 5-10. The store did all right, but Walton knew he could do better. Walton paid close attention to his competition, and started experimenting with the sales tactics he observed others employing. This led to great success. Indeed, some of these ideas were so good that many of them are still considered standard practice today. For example, in the 1940s it was normal for discount stores to have multiple cashiers located at different areas. But, while visiting a store in Minnesota, Walton noticed it had only two dedicated checkout counters, each located at the front. He liked this radical idea and put it to use in his own shop, quickly saving money by reducing the number of cashiers. And after observing a competitor who used wooden shelves to display certain goods, Walton realized this could save money as well. However, Walton took it one step further: he replaced all of his wooden shelves with metal ones. While the new shelves didn’t look as nice, the cheaper cost allowed Walton to keep his prices lower than his competitors’. Even after he found success, Walton never stopped copying good business ideas whenever he saw them. When he visited a supplier in 1975, Walton noticed how the staff would get together before the day began and perform a company cheer. Walton could see how this activity visibly boosted worker morale. So, upon his return to the States, he implemented his own “Walmart cheer” at the flagship store in Bentonville, Arkansas. Walmart employees even performed the cheer for President George H. W. Bush when he visited one of their stores. Walton could proudly tell from the look on the president’s face that he had never before seen such enthusiasm from a group of staff. Sam Walton learned early on that, in order to get ahead of his competition, he needed to spend money to attract customers. After opening his first Walton’s 5-10, he even went so far as to take out a $1,800 loan for an ice cream machine for his customers to enjoy. But he didn’t stop there. Walton was always on the lookout for ways to draw customers in. When he opened his first store, he would watch as farm families drove into town on Saturdays to shop in the many different specialty stores in order to purchase all the goods they needed. These shops often closed early and held a small selection of goods. This is when the great idea dawned on him: he would keep his store open longer and offer a wider selection of goods for his customers. This philosophy continued throughout his career. When Walton opened his 18th Walmart in 1969, its low prices, long opening hours and free parking were all reasons customers continued to be drawn to it. Despite this appeal, Walton took a lot of flack over the years for practices that many people viewed as harmful to small business. But, as Walton saw it, it wasn’t his fault that local competition is put out of business when a Walmart comes to town. After all, the customers are free to choose where to shop, and if they choose Walmart, it must be because they feel their needs are better met there than at local stores. In fact, Walton believed that his customer-first philosophy has helped local businesses. For example, in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, the owner of a local paint store came into a recently opened Walmart to thank the store’s manager. It turned out that the Walmart paint department had been recommending her store to customers who couldn’t find what they needed at Walmart. To Walton, this example shows that Walmart cares for its clients so much that they’re willing to sacrifice potential business to make sure customers are satisfied. This is the customer-centric approach Walton would continue to take throughout his career. Sam Walton’s business philosophy raises the question: Why avoid competition when you can thrive on it instead? Indeed, observing the competition is what enabled Walton to come up with innovative sales strategies. Take the area of promotional strategies, for example. In the early 1970s, Walmart opened a new store in direct competition with a town’s Kmart. At this time, Kmart operated around 1,500 stores and Walmart only had 150, so Walton knew they’d need a brilliant idea in order to attract customers. So, the store manager, Phil, decided to build a huge promotional display featuring a one-dollar-off sale on Tide laundry detergent. To pull this off, however, Phil needed to order a ridiculous amount of the product: 3,500 cases, which, when displayed together, measured 12 by 100 feet! When Walton got wind of this, he thought Phil had lost his mind! Considering the potential benefit, though, Walton came around and ultimately embraced the idea. And it worked! The innovative promotion grabbed people’s attention and turned out to be a huge success. Walton admitted that without Kmart to compete with, they wouldn’t have thought to stage such a huge promotion. And these strategies are still part of their business practice to this day. This kind of competition also benefits the customers. In 1977, a Walmart in Little Rock, Arkansas, began to face fierce competition from a nearby Kmart that had just opened. The Kmart was cutting prices so drastically that Walton was forced to take action; he told the manager to make sure that everything in their store was as cheap as, if not cheaper than, the items in Kmart. At the height of this showdown, the price of toothpaste reached an extreme low of six cents! But Walton didn’t flinch, and eventually Kmart backed off and gave up trying to beat Walmart’s prices. This experience taught Walton an important lesson: upon the arrival of a big competitor, Walmart prices had to be as low as possible so that customers would remain satisfied. As we’ve seen in the previous blinks, Sam Walton always recognized the value of his customers. But this wasn’t always the case with his employees. For a long time, Walton was very tight-fisted, a result of his humble upbringing. Unfortunately, this meant that he didn’t always pay his employees as much as they deserved. In 1955, for instance, Walton received a call from Charlie Baum, a store manager, who informed him that he’d raised his clerks pay from 50 to 75 cents per hour. Even back then, these were pretty pitiful wages, but Walton admits that this didn’t get in the way of his stinginess: Walton told Charlie to revoke the raises, since his store hadn’t yet hit Walton’s goal of a six-percent profit margin. But Walton changed his ways after a visit to England in 1971. Walton reconsidered his relationship to Walmart’s non-managerial staff when he came across a sign for an English store that listed the name of the company as Lewis Company, J. M. Lewis Partnership. And underneath the sign was a list of all the “associates” that worked there. This got Walton thinking about his own company. Wouldn’t it be great if Walmart could work in “partnership” with its “associates” instead of simply managing its employees? Walton quickly set his idea into action: once he returned from the trip, he announced that employees would now be called associates. But Walton also knew that actions speak louder than words. So he started a profit-sharing plan for the new associates that included stock options or cash bonuses, allowing everyone to benefit from Walmart’s success. Sam Walton never slowed during his career. When success arrived, he would celebrate it, using the momentum to keep moving forward. But he admits that he also made some mistakes along the way. One of his biggest mistakes almost cost him his company. In 1974, Walmart was performing well, and Walton decided he might be able to enjoy an early retirement. So, Walton promoted one of his two executive vice presidents, Ron Mayer, to CEO. But this move ended up causing a lot of bad blood between him and Ferold Arend, the other vice president. As a result, the company split into two groups, one favoring Mayer, and the other one Arend. Trouble was brewing, so, in 1976, Walton met with Mayer to admit that his early retirement was a mistake and to ask for his old job back. What happened then became known as the Saturday Massacre: Mayer, and dozens of other senior managers who supported him, left the company, and Walmart’s stock prices fell so low that Walton was unsure if he’d be able to salvage the company. However, even in the face of this disaster, Walton carried on: he immediately found new managers to fill the empty positions and persuaded an old friend, David Glass, to replace Mayer. Glass proved to be immensely talented and turned the whole disaster around. Under his leadership, Walmart exceeded everyone’s expectations, and sales performance increased almost immediately. Then, eight years later, Walton celebrated an event he never dreamed would happen. In 1984, Walmart reached a financial milestone: An eight-percent pre-tax profit. Walton had even made a bet with Glass that this would never happen. When Walton lost the bet, he was made by Glass to step out onto Wall Street dressed in a Hawaiian outfit, where he performed a hula dance accompanied by ukulele players. Naturally, the press was amazed that one of the most successful CEOs would do something so silly. But Walton says it’s all part of the Walmart philosophy: knowing when to work, and knowing when to celebrate. As we’ve seen, Sam Walton had his fair share of critics. But when it comes to a lack of charitable donations, he believed the critics were misguided. Walton was a firm believer in the power of education and he donated time and money to the cause. He recognized that the future workers of America must have the best education possible in order to succeed. Only thus equipped would they have the skills necessary to keep companies competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace. As of 1992, the Walton family had awarded around 70 university scholarships per year to children of Walmart associates. But Walton’s philanthropy extended beyond the borders of the United States as well. In the early 1990s, he sponsored 180 Central American children with scholarships to American universities. He hoped that by following through on their education, they’d one day be able to return home with the knowledge to help solve the economic issues their countries were facing. Walton also hoped that with this assistance he could make sure there would be good people on hand to manage future Walmarts in Central American countries such as Honduras or Nicaragua. Walton also suggested that Walmart’s very existence is itself a form of charity. He pointed to Walmart’s customer-centric approach as being hugely beneficial for the communities it serves. He suggested that, by keeping prices extremely low, Walmart helps communities save billions of dollars every year. The numbers tell the story: between 1982 and 1992, Walmart sold approximately $130 billion worth of products. And if his store saved customers an average of ten percent on prices, which is a conservative figure, this would mean that during that 10-year period, customers saved over $13 billion. These savings could therefore help Walmart’s customers improve their living standards, especially those in rural districts who would otherwise have to depend on more expensive small town merchants. The key message in this book: Sam Walton was able to grow his small town variety store into a global retail empire. He made this happen by learning how to put the customer’s needs first, even if it meant sending them to a different store. He also knew that instead of being afraid of competition, a successful business uses it to help their business grow. And, as his business grew, Walton didn’t forget to care for his employees; he recognized them as his “associates” and treated them as such. Actionable advice: Get to know your competition as thoroughly as possible. Do what Sam Walton did and research competing businesses and take accurate notes on their practices. Walton even got his employees to rummage through competitors’ trash in order to find as many prices as possible. By being thorough, you can make sure you are providing your customers with the best services available. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Most fail within a few years; some make it a bit longer. Only a small number of them grow to become big, successful game-changers. Why? Even if you have a great product and your business is going well, scaling poses important, and often unexpected, challenges to any company that wants to grow. It’s a paradox. Getting bigger should make things easier, shouldn’t it? More brains, more cash, more momentum? Wrong. As these blinks will show, even something as simple as leaving the old, pokey one-floor office for a new two-floor one might have unexpected consequences for your business. So how do you get it right? These blinks break down everything you need to take into consideration into structured checklists and thought-provoking processes. In these blinks, you’ll learn why growth doesn’t inevitably lead to success; why owning the right words will help you scale your business; and why cash is still king. Imagine you’re an executive manager at a 500-employee company. Your CEO has just informed you that by the end of next year, the company will comprise over 1,500 employees. What would you do first? When your company is scaling up, there certainly is a lot to consider. If you don’t want to run out of cash or lose track of strategic decisions, your organizational structure and decision-making processes have to be brought to perfection. That’s why the Gazelles team – a global executive coaching company – developed a 4D framework to grow your business successfully. So what are the essential four D’s for successful scaling? First, you and your team have to be drivers of personal and economic growth. Think of it this way: your managers are coaches! One-on-one coaching is essential for employees to stay focused and motivated. Consider offering additional training to enable constant learning. Secondly, leaders also have to find the balance between the demands of your stakeholders and those of the actual processes of doing your work. Even though your company’s processes must be profitable, it’s also important to keep your reputation with your stakeholders in mind. Balance both by creating a custom-tailored strategy. To execute your strategy successfully, you’ll need to implement routines to enable sufficient discipline – the third D. Your entire company must be aware of the number one priority for each quarter or year – the first element of discipline. With a defined target in mind, you’ll be able to prioritize effectively. Another aspect of discipline is a regular meeting routine, complemented with constant data review. This way, you’ll be able to detect problems immediately and tackle them as quickly as possible. Finally, it’s essential that you know which questions are the most pressing ones and start making decisions. When scaling up, a company should start by tackling the biggest issues first, then working through other problems – in the same way you might fill out a sudoku puzzle. Start where you can and proceed carefully. So the four D’s are drivers, demands, discipline and decisions. Growth is very complex and there are loads of things to keep in mind. But don’t despair! The following blinks offer a framework for dealing with the four major problem areas that are also opportunities to grow the four D’s – People, Strategy, Execution and Cash Flows. Only two to three percent of all US companies will become high-impact firms that last for over 25 years and contribute substantially to overall economic growth. Why do so few make it to this stage? It’s all about People. The truth is that growth doesn’t always lead to success in the long-term. If the team, the strategy and the organizational and physical infrastructure don’t grow alongside each other, success simply won’t last. This is called the growth paradox. You’d think that the larger a company gets and the more soundly its routine is established, the easier things get. The reality is that the more employees you have, the more it takes to organize them effectively. Consider a company that is expanding its team while also moving from a one-floor office into a two-floor office. If planners don’t create room for communication spaces, such as a common kitchen or break room, it will be much harder for information to flow between employees. Communication is vital in any growing organization, so it’s essential that you structure your teams and sub-teams to keep information flowing. If teams are too big, communication will be hindered. Instead, try breaking them up into sub-teams of seven to ten people. So if you’re feeling stuck in your growth process, it’s likely that your team structure and size isn’t perfectly organized yet. But remember, growth doesn’t happen overnight! If you want your success to be long-term, you’ll have to view expansion as a long-term process too. Ask yourself: What do you want your organization to achieve within the next 25 years? It took Apple 25 years to grow to 9,600 employees in 2001, whereas today, 14 years later, the company employs more than 150,000 people. No executive team could ever declare that everyone was responsible for marketing without something going wrong. We need clear responsibilities, otherwise nobody can be held accountable. And a lack of accountability is a surefire way to drive a business to collapse. In order to create accountability and make it visible, the author has developed the Function Accountability Chart (FACe) and Process Accountability Chart (PACe). The FACe can be used to measure success and define who is responsible for what. To begin, you’ll need to find out about your company’s functions. Write them all down. Then, let each of your executive team members fill in who is responsible for each function (one person) and what key performance indicators (KPIs), such as profit per project, for example, can be used to measure success. After creating this chart, consider which team members are responsible for more than one function, but perhaps don’t have clear accountability. When the executive team of Perly Fullerton filled in the chart they recognized that they were six people in the room but only three on the chart. It was clear that founders needed to delegate tasks more specifically. The processes that drive the business and the people who are responsible for them should also be specified. Enter the PACe. To use a PACe, first identify the key processes of your firm, such as recruitment or product development. Give one person oversight for each process. Next, outline which KPIs – such as time, quality and cost – measure the process. Next, describe how you’d like to improve each process – perhaps by making it faster, or more cost-effective. Finally, map who is involved in each process at each of its critical steps. It’s said that a single excellent employee can replace three good ones. So invest in all of your people to grow them! Start by replacing the word “manager” with “coach.” The people analytics team at Google discovered that personal coaching was the most important factor in great management. This is because managing a team isn’t just about delegating tasks and supervising processes, it’s also about leading a team and inspiring its members to grow and improve. One way you can encourage your team members to boost their strengths and learn from their weaknesses is through training. In fact, it’s worth spending an additional two to three percent of your payroll on training. Your team will reward you with higher productivity and loyalty: The Container Store pays salespeople 50 to 100 percent more than the industry average. Within the first year, salespeople also get 263 hours of training. You should also strive to make your team’s job easier by listening to them. Regular meetings allow team members to discuss what motivates them, what doesn’t, what could make their job easier, and what resources they need. Even the smallest changes, like an additional break room or a different email provider, can make a significant difference. Finally, be sure to set clear expectations. Tell your employees what their top priority should be, but let them find out how to achieve it on their own. Encouraging team members to think for themselves is challenging, but will strengthen their problem-solving abilities in the long run. You could even modify tasks and responsibilities from time to time to give employees the challenges you think they’ll need for personal growth. You’d be hard-pressed to find a company with over 50 employees and a boss that can remember all their names. As your organization grows larger, it’s vital that you retain the sense of purpose that keeps smaller businesses so motivated. But how? It’s a matter of strategy. By establishing core values, you give your organization comprehensible guidelines for every decision. These are the norms of a company’s culture, and should be stated in a succinct, realistic sentence. For example: “Practice what we preach.” You should also make your company’s mission clear by formulating a core purpose. This can be as brief as one word, and should simply signify what you want to achieve. For Disney, the core purpose is simply “happiness.” So how can you get your organization to engage with core values and purpose with confidence? Credit card transactions company VeriFone came up with a clever solution to keep their corporate culture strong. Its founder created a pocket-sized “blue book” that contained all of the organization’s core values illustrated with real case studies. This blue book was translated into eight languages and is a fixture in every meeting as a powerful and accessible summary of the company’s vision. Your company’s vision summary should also include two other elements: your brand promises, and your Big Hairy Audacious Goal – BHAG for short. Brand promises – the things you guarantee your customers – are strongest in threes, with one key promise at the forefront. For example, BuildDirect promises best price, then best customer service and product expertise. By referring to your three brand promises during decision-making, you can ensure your actions satisfy customers’ expectations. Your BHAG should be reached within 20–25 years. To make it easier, set smaller goals every three to five years, as well as annual, monthly and weekly goals. In fact, you could even visualize your goals as a mountain climb, where you reach small plateaus before achieving that view from the top. By collating your core values, purpose, brand promises and goals, you’ll have gained a helpful tool that you can always refer to when dealing with potential customers, suppliers, or tricky situations. By making copies of your vision summary available in common areas, your team will be able to make the most of this tool too. Now that your vision summary is ready, you’ve got the bones of a clear strategy. But if you want to reach your goals even more quickly, you should understand exactly where your organization’s strengths lie. First, you’ll need to look into your customers’ minds. What do they think when they hear your company’s name? Car manufacturer Volvo has used marketing to make the word “safety” one of the first associations with the brand. Even googling “safest car” will lead directly to Volvo. 87 percent of all customers search the internet to find options for purchasing. To find out which words you should own, use the Google Adword planner to see how often some words are being searched in relation to your brand. The next place to look for your strengths is your X factor. This is a small strategic detail that differentiates you from your competitors. By recognizing it, you can turn it into a competitive advantage to multiply your revenue. Take Outback Steakhouse. They recognized that most restaurant managers are constantly on the move to new jobs, so quality isn’t stable. So they decided to create their own X factor. Outback Steakhouse created a new compensation for future managers, who first had to invest $25,000 of their own money. For three years they were trained to run a restaurant and got a competitive wage. Following this, managers could run their own restaurant and, if they met certain milestone criteria after two years, were rewarded with a $100,000 bonus. By taking the time to create a calculated strategy, Outback Steakhouse created an X factor that made planning easier and boosted their product’s quality, to give their customer experience an edge over competitors.   The One-Page Strategic Plan (OPSP) is a framework that will help your company visualize and achieve your goals. More than 40,000 companies use OPSPs to know if everything is running smoothly or not – and then to respond rapidly to new challenges. There are a number of questions you’ll need to answer when designing your own OPSP: Who is responsible for each step? What is your number one priority for the next year? Which metrics can you use to track your progress toward it? Suppose your goal is to make HR more efficient. Actions could include “Hiring an additional HR manager” or “Improving the onboarding process.” Now what’s your critical number? Maybe “Reducing hiring and onboarding process time from six to three months”? An execution checklist like the Rockefeller Habits Checklist is often extremely helpful. This list summarizes all important factors you’ll need to keep an eye on, from “The team is healthy and aligned” to “The company’s plans and performances are visible to everyone.” This way you’ll be able to recognize any missteps or potential issues a whole lot faster! And your OPSP isn’t just about goals. Rewards need to be clearly stated too. Think about it: working hard only makes sense when you know what you’re working for. So why not make your annual, monthly or weekly goals a fun challenge? You could dream up a theme to turn your goals into a game. For example, if your goal is to speed up processes, you could call the project the Fast & Furious. You could even design a scoreboard where the whole team can see their achievements and write down how they’re going to celebrate. Great firms are like great jazz bands. Even without a strict plan, they’re able to work together with confidence. But, like members of a band, your team members should know their parts and practise together too. That’s why meetings are so important. A steady meeting routine allows information to flow accurately and prevents communication barriers. To stay on top of current activities and issues, hold your team meetings daily or weekly. John D. Rockefeller met every day for lunch with his key people. Your executive managers should also participate in one day of learning every month, and a bigger strategic meeting offsite in every quarter. Even spending just five minutes every day with your team could help solve small dilemmas much faster. In Managing Up: How to Forge an Effective Relationship With Those Above You, Rosanne Badowksi says that meetings needn’t take up more than ten percent of a standard work week for senior leaders and five to seven percent for middle managers. However, the faster you’re growing, the denser your meeting rhythm should be. If you’re growing by between 20 and 100 percent a year, treat one quarter as if it were a year and organize meetings accordingly. Another way to keep tabs consistently is by gathering data. Quantitative and qualitative data will strengthen your decision-making in every scenario. Additionally, ensure everyone in your company knows her KPIs and the team’s critical number. Only then can they measure their daily performance. If data shows a gap between goals and performance, ask what the current barriers are and tackle them. Customer feedback is just as important as financial feedback. So don’t forget to speak with your clients to see if they’re facing problems with your team. The more closely you observe your data, the faster you can respond to difficulties! We’d all like to save up for something big, but this is often made tricky as we don’t know how much we need to spend each month. Financial statements are even neglected entirely by some firms, though funds are of course central to expansion. It’s essential to understand how cash flows through your company and to have some cash reserves. In Great by Choice, Jim Collins and Morton T. Hansen revealed that outstanding companies have three to ten times more cash in reserve than their more mediocre competitors. If you want to expand your cash reserves, take a look at your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC). This figure shows how long it takes until a dollar you invest comes back as turnover. Remember, the shorter, the better. Take Dell, who were going broke in the mid-1990s. It found out that its CCC was 63 days. That’s simply too long! So Tom Meredith, the new CFO, worked to reduce it. Within just ten years, the CCC had shrunk to 21 days. At this point, Dell finally grew faster and began producing cash instead of consuming. In 2013, founder Michael Dell finally had enough cash to privatize the company. To shorten your CCC, first break it down into four components – sales, delivery, billing/payment and production/inventory – and work separately on them. In each of these components, you’ll find opportunities to shorten your cycle time, reduce typical mistakes or improve the business model. For example, Benetton India found that they were spending too much on production costs, which in turn extended their CCC. To solve the problem, they improved their business model for finding cheaper suppliers by using software that allowed vendors and suppliers to bid on production contracts. Perhaps you’ve looked at your CCC and seen that you need to improve your cash flow. Not to worry – it’s just a matter of tweaking here and there. Examine your company’s sectors and you’ll find several financial levers that you can modify to boost your cash flow. It could be the price for your goods (could be increased), your inventory (you could reduce the stock) or accounts payable (slow down the payment of creditors). But how do you know which levers are worth changing? With the Power of the One you can work out which factor can reduce costs in the most efficient way. In this method, you attempt to visualize how a one percent or one day change of each of your potential levers would affect your cash flow. For example, you could calculate the effect of reducing your operating costs by one percent, or reducing stock days by one day. Then do the same for another lever, and so on. By comparing this information, you’ll find the most financially efficient lever. Finally, present your plan for change in a formalized structure of KPIs and targets, and assign tasks and responsibilities clearly.

Some might even say that she was the world’s first venture capitalist. The businessman in question? Christopher Columbus. The venture? To find a shorter route to India in order to save money and time in trading goods. And the risk of failure? Extremely high! Fast-forward to today’s world of venture-capital-backed start-ups. Failure may not result in death on the high seas, but the risk is still very high. In fact, nearly 90 percent of start-ups fail.  That’s where good venture capitalists, or VCs, come in. They provide capital in the form of money so that promising founders can bring their ideas to life. In return, the VCs receive an ownership stake in the company. In addition to providing funding, VCs advise founders on long-term decision-making, and how best to go about reaching strategic goals. For many in the start-up world, the inner workings of VCs are a bit of a mystery. Fortunately, the author, Scott Kupor, happens to work at one of the biggest names in VC. In these blinks, you’ll learn some of his insights into the life cycle of VC-backed companies. Along the way, you’ll discover what the Y Combinator is, and how it tipped the VC landscape in favor of entrepreneurs; why the author’s firm decided to invest in Airbnb; and how to prepare for your first VC pitch. Nearly half a century ago, in the early 1970s, Silicon Valley found itself host to a number of new businesses operating in the world of venture capital. For the next thirty years, a very small number of these companies held the vast majority of venture capital in Silicon Valley. This meant, of course, that a select few companies had a lot of power over which entrepreneurs received funding. But starting in the early 2000s, all this began to change. Two converging phenomena started coming together, transforming the nature of the VC-entrepreneur relationship. Firstly, rapid advances in technology meant that the amount of capital required to found a start-up began to decline. On one side, servers, networking and data center space were getting cheaper by the day; on the other, with the advent of cloud computing, start-ups no longer needed office space to store their data on-site, thus saving on rent. All of a sudden, founding a start-up was less reliant on VC backing than it had been in the past. The second development that transformed the VC-entrepreneur relationship was the founding of the Y Combinator, or YC, in 2005. The YC is a school that teaches entrepreneurs how to found companies and secure VC funding. Famous alumni include the founders of Airbnb and Dropbox. The YC helped a once-dispersed entrepreneurial community come together to share knowledge and, in doing so, also helped even the balance of power between VC firms and entrepreneurs. It was at this point that the author’s VC firm entered the scene. In 2009, investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz founded Andreessen Horowitz. Detecting a change in the Silicon Valley landscape, they realized that VCs needed to provide more than just capital to entrepreneurs. Sure, having CEOs with vision and good product-market fit was still as relevant as ever. But they might lack knowledge in other important areas like recruiting, marketing or sales. This is where VCs like Kupor enter the equation. At Andreessen Horowitz, it’s his job to advise CEOs, particularly by helping them build networks and relationships with both people and institutions. In doing so, Andreessen Horowitz has concocted a winning formula that’s churned out several huge companies, such as Pinterest, Slack and GitHub. Founders of early-stage companies often don’t even have a product to present to potential investors. Instead, a founder usually comes to pitch an idea to VC firms with, well, precisely that – just an idea. This means that VC firms have little actual data to look at when assessing whether to invest in early-stage start-ups. Instead, they have to rely more on qualitative analyses.  The first aspect of such an analysis is all about the people involved in the company. What are the backgrounds of the founders? What evidence does their pitch provide that they’ll be able to bring their idea to market effectively? And, in particular, what makes their story stand out from the potentially dozens of other founders who’ve had the same or a similar idea? One way VC firms evaluate such questions is by looking for a solid founder-market fit. This means that the founder, or founders, have unique experience that has given them particular insight into the potential product for which they are seeking backing. Take Airbnb, for instance. Its founders gained unique insight from hotels that became fully booked when big conventions came to their town. So they came up with an idea: Why not rent out a cheap place to sleep in our apartment to conference attendees? That way, the attendees would save money, and the founders would be able to pay their rent more easily. This story convinced Andreessen Horowitz, and the firm went on to back Airbnb. But while people are the cornerstone of any successful venture, the products they offer have to fill a gap in the market so that customers will purchase them. This usually depends on how revolutionary a product is. New products from small companies won’t gain momentum if they are only a tiny bit better than what’s already out there – the product has to represent a breakthrough in the market. Aside from people and product, market size is the final thing VC firms consider before backing early-stage companies. This is particularly important, as almost half of the early-stage companies that big VC firms invest in go on to fail. To make up for those failures, successful start-ups need lots of market room to expand continuously. Of course, assessing market size can be hard when potential markets haven’t been created yet. Airbnb, for instance, initially saw itself as helping only a small market – conference attendees. But Andreessen Horowitz saw beyond this; they saw an opportunity for Airbnb to expand into hotel markets and beyond. And this is exactly what happened. If you’ve ever had the chance to pitch a business idea to venture capitalists, then you know that it’s a pretty nerve-racking experience. Perhaps you’ve recently quit a steady job to pursue your entrepreneurial dreams, and your future livelihood might rely on whether the pitch goes well or not. Luckily, the author has heard thousands of pitches over the last ten years of working at Andreessen Horowitz, and he knows how to distinguish the good ones from the bad. In his experience, a good pitch can most easily be understood by contrasting it with a bad pitch, so let’s begin with the latter.  Often, founders will pitch an idea, and immediately afterward list a number of companies that might acquire them once their idea comes to market. But even though some may think that’s what VCs want to hear, it isn’t. VCs want to hear founders’ conquer-the-world strategy, even if that strategy only has a small chance of success. The question is not who might want to acquire the future company – what VCs want to know is what the world will look like once the founders have conquered it with their idea. Of course, once founders present their conquer-the-world strategy, they can expect VCs to put it to the test. During a pitch, potential investors will inevitably poke holes in founders’ strategies via a process that the author calls the idea maze. This is the part of the pitch in which entrepreneurs get quizzed on the origins of their idea, why they think it would make a good product, and what sorts of insights and market data they considered during the ideation process. At the end of the day, many founders will end up making a product different from the one they originally pitched, known in the VC industry as a pivot. So when asking their questions during the idea maze session, investors’ goal isn’t to determine whether the founder’s product will have a 100 percent likelihood of success; instead, it’s simply to test the founder’s thought processes and depth of understanding of the product and marketplace. Of course, this sort of pivot shouldn’t take place during the pitch itself! If the idea maze leads founders to change their whole pitch during a 60-minute meeting, that’s not a good sign – this rapid change of heart shows a lack of commitment to the conquer-the-world strategy that investors want to see radiating from founders. Having said that, it’s of course important that founders seem willing to listen to good advice and adapt their pitches accordingly. If you as a founder have been lucky enough to make a successful pitch to a VC firm, you’ll then begin the often arduous process of negotiating a term sheet. Essentially, a term sheet lays out all the rules, regulations and processes that both the VC firm and company have to abide by if the deal is to go through.  These stipulations can be pretty complicated and confusing – especially to founders, who tend to be much less familiar with term sheets than the VC firm with which they’re partnering. But term sheets can be simplified into two main components, which can make them much more comprehensible and thus level the playing field of knowledge between VCs and founders.    The first one gets into the nitty-gritty economic side of the agreement. This can include aspects such as the size of the investment, liquidation preferences or who gets to control various shares in the company. While the economic aspect of any term sheet negotiation is important in the short and medium term, it is the other aspect, governance, that has much greater ramifications in the long run. Governance is all about how the company’s board of directors goes about its business – and who gets to sit on the board in the first place. When negotiating a term sheet, deciding who gets a seat at the table is extremely important, as it’s the board that gets a say in how the company is run, who runs it and whether it should cease to exist – or be sold off. And, perhaps more important, the board chooses a company’s CEO. The author’s company usually presents successful founders with a term sheet that sets out a three-person board of directors. One of these positions is filled by a representative of the VC firm and another by the company’s CEO, this usually being the founder. The third and final person on the board is a designated independent, neutral outsider who has no conflict of interest with either of the other two board members.  Of course, as companies grow, so do their boards. So it’s important in your initial term sheet to make sure that the board remains balanced. For example, if your company goes through another finance round with a different VC firm, they’ll probably also want a seat on the board. In that case, you’ll want to make sure you negotiate that for every additional VC on the board, there will also be another representative from the company itself. With a fair term sheet in hand, it’s time for the CEO to turn her attention to running her now-funded company. As well as leading her team through the day-to-day activities of the company, the CEO is of course responsible for keeping her eye on long-term vision, particularly if she is also the founder. However, a CEO’s relationship with her board of directors can sometimes complicate things – it’s thus important to make sure that both sides maintain a healthy relationship. That’s especially true of the relationship between the CEO and the VC representatives on the company’s board. While most good boards give CEOs room to run their companies, this isn’t always the case. In many instances, VCs were themselves CEOs in the past, and can often face the temptation to involve themselves in the daily affairs of companies they’ve invested in. But at the end of the day, VCs are not meant to be aware of all the nitty-gritty day-to-day happenings of a company – that is the job of the CEO. So it’s of vital importance that VCs keep a safe distance, and give CEOs space to do their thing. Having said that, it’s important that the CEO maintain a steady back-and-forth channel of feedback with VCs and other board members.  After all, VCs have often sat on countless other boards, and may have a lot of useful input to offer a CEO based on mistakes that other CEOs they’ve advised have made. This is particularly the case if you’re a first-time CEO – while you might have a fantastic vision and team, it could be you’re making rookie mistakes in areas such as hiring or planning long-term growth. VCs can offer input here, but it’s important that you make sure they don’t overreach. At the end of the day, even though VC firms are providing the capital, it’s the CEO’s job to run the whole show – and that includes the board. From the outset, the CEO should tell the board what sort of feedback channels she wants to establish, such as weekly meetings at which advice is sought and company news conveyed. In the case of companies with multiple VCs, the CEO may not have time to meet with all of them individually – if that happens, it’s probably much more useful for VCs to come together and compile feedback that can then be presented to the CEO in a more compact way. Let’s assume for a moment that your company isn’t bankrupt and being shut down after a few rounds of VC funding that eventually led nowhere. If this is the case, congratulations – your company is in the 10 percent of start-ups that don’t fail. If you’re now the CEO of a profitable business that can survive independently without venture capital, it’s likely you’re being offered potential acquisition deals. In fact, 80 percent of successful VC-backed start-ups go on to be acquired by bigger companies.  But there are a number of issues CEOs and boards need to consider during any potential acquisition deal. Perhaps the largest of these is the question of which employees will remain with the company post-acquisition. It could be that many key employees have stuck with you as CEO for years, and it’s time for them to be rewarded for their hard work. This also means negotiating favorable equity deals for the members of your team whom you bring with you into your company’s post-acquisition existence. Aside from acquisition, the other option for boards is to make an initial public offering, or IPO. This entails making the company public and selling shares on the stock exchange. The pricing of shares is one of the major issues here. When Facebook made its IPO in 2012, for example, it set the initial share price at $38. Within the first day, however, that fell to $14. Luckily, by mid-2019, shares had more than quadrupled – but such overpriced initial offerings can result in negative associations dogging your now-public company in the future. So make sure to get a team of good investment bankers to advise you   on the price at which you should set your initial shares. Of course, whether a company is acquired or goes public, the question of the reward for VC firms is paramount, as far as they’re concerned. At this point in the company’s history, the life cycle of venture capital is nearing completion. The initial funding of the company is now about to pay off, and VCs are readying themselves to cash in on the initial risk they took all those years ago. However, if VCs sell their shares off too quickly, the company’s value may plummet due to a perceived massive sell-off. So it’s often a good idea for VCs to withdraw their stock in a company over a period of time rather than all at once. Finally, as CEO, your next stage of the journey is about to begin. Whether you’ve just gone through an IPO or acquisition, the initial idea that you pitched to VCs has begun a new chapter. You’re now having to answer either to a bigger company’s CEO or to public shareholders. But no matter what happens, you should be proud of the fact that you’ve joined the minority of start-ups that make it past the VC stage. The key message in these blinks: With the advent of countless new tech start-ups in the early 2000s, the relationship between venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs changed significantly. Nowadays, one of the main characteristics VCs look for in companies is a founder who has unique insight into the problem his product is trying to solve. Key to getting VCs on board with your product is mastering the art of the pitch, which involves exhibiting a willingness to adapt while still being 100 percent committed to the validity of your idea. Once you get funding from VCs, the challenge then becomes maintaining positive relationships with them; a good term sheet can help with this. And if you make it through to an IPO or acquisition, you’ll have joined the small club of founders who made it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You’ve managed to survive the first few turbulent months and have even started to grow the business a little. What should you do next? Common wisdom would suggest that you focus on revenue and maximizing sales. You borrow, you hire more staff and take all the orders you can, anything to keep the money coming in. Yet that’s not the right path. These blinks show you how sticking to this common yet flawed strategy will lead you toward ruin. Far from the money you think you want to come in, it’s the money going out that matters. Revenue means nothing if you are spending more than you earn. Profit is king, and these blinks show you how to go about securing it. In these blinks, you’ll discover why every business leader should pay themselves what they deserve; why you should never, ever go into debt; and why you should pay your staff like a winning NFL coach would. Here’s a surprising figure: 90 percent of small business owners pay themselves less than a fair market wage. And in many ways, this is a rational choice: After all, by lowering their own wage costs, business owners can make pre-tax profits look much healthier. But despite this, business owners should always pay themselves the correct market wage. There are two reasons why this should be the case. First, not paying yourself (or your employees) a market-based wage actually undermines your business. Pre-tax profits and labor expenses are key figures which affect important financial measures such as labor productivity, or the percentage of pre-tax profits to revenue. As we’ll see in later blinks, these two metrics are crucial in defining the success of your business. And artificially altering them could affect your ability to grow your company. You should also know that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has included this tactic – that is, underpaying wages – in a list of “dirty dozen” tax scams used by closely held (or “S”) corporations. Accordingly, the federal tax agency is increasingly choosing to audit firms suspected of employing this practice. Second, paying yourself a market-based wage is crucial when it comes to selling your business or making an exit. That’s because a firm’s profitability is a key factor in determining its fair market value. So when an outside party looks at your books prior to purchasing your company, artificially lowered wages could cast doubt on your company’s value in the eyes of a potential buyer. Alternately, paying yourself a market-based wage from the outset will spare your business cash flow problems (and the nasty surprise of diminished profits) if you decide to make an exit and replace yourself with an outside CEO who’s expecting to earn market wages. At some point, every business risks falling into a black hole. We aren’t talking about space travel: A black hole is when a firm’s revenue first surpasses $1 million and there’s an increased demand for staff, but not enough capital to pay for new employees. At this point, many business leaders will focus on balancing the budget, but that’s not good enough. If you want to escape the black hole, you have to aim for 10- to 15-percent pre-tax profitability. To put it another way, getting through a black hole is like a pioneer making a wagon journey from Kansas to California. Even if you stock provisions from the outset, if you deplete your resources too quickly without adding more as you go (or, if you incur losses but don’t build profits as you grow), you’ll never make it to California! That’s precisely why your goal should be to accrue healthy profits while you grow. By reinvesting profits and building your capital reserves, you’ll make it through that black hole. What’s more, the benefits of being profitable while you’re in a black hole don’t end when you get out of it. Because if you decide to sell your business, historical profitability will have a significant effect on your company’s value. Prospective buyers will want to see your last three years of pre-tax profits and business equity – a widespread measure used to gauge a company’s value. Thus, a company that has achieved 10- to 15-percent pre-tax profitability will have a substantially higher market value than another firm with smaller profits or none at all. Do you want to position your company to achieve an optimal market value? Of course! The next blink will show you how. As we discussed in the previous blink, 10- to 15-percent profitability should be your company goal. But how can you achieve it during that black hole period, when you’ll need to hire new staff to fulfill growing demand? First, you need to understand the relationship between labor expenses and profitability. You already know that labor is a significant cost in running a business. But unlike rent and supplies, labor is a cost you can control. And that’s exactly why you should introduce a salary cap to protect at least ten percent of your profits. Imagine you’re earning $1 million in revenue. In that case, you should aim for profits of at least $100,000. Simply combine all of your non-labor costs and subtract them from your $900,000 operating budget. Whatever is left is your firm’s total salary cap, and should include all labor costs (including your own market-based wage). But then to keep growing, use the salary cap as an anchor to fluctuate between 10- to 15-percent profitability. So once you have a salary cap based on ten percent profits, you can set your sights on growing profits to 15 percent by recalculating your salary cap accordingly. During this period, you should focus on enhancing productivity, rather than growing revenue. And then, once you’re at 15 percent, you can afford to hire new staff strategically (with the goal of increasing your revenue) until your profits are back near ten percent. Repeating this process again and again is the best way to safely grow your business while always remaining profitable. If you’re worried that the salary cap will limit your company’s ability to perform, consider Bill Belichick’s many victories (the New England Patriots coach has won the Super Bowl a disproportionate number of times), which observers attribute to his savvy navigation of the National Football League’s strict salary caps.   Belichick gets more for every dollar he spends by hiring younger talent and investing in their future. And you can do that too! We’ve learned that often you’ll need to focus instead on enhancing the productivity of your existing employees instead of just hiring new staff. But what does it actually take to increase and maintain labor productivity? Start by measuring productivity at your company by using the following equation: productivity equals gross profits divided by dollars spent on labor. (And to calculate gross profits: gross profits equal revenue minus the cost of goods sold.) While it may seem simple, this is really a powerful tool as it provides evidence for your intuition and allows you to quickly spot and respond to negative trends. And once you’ve calculated this metric, you can start implementing new practices to enhance productivity at your company. Start by ensuring your employees are being compensated appropriately. This is important, as paying too little leads to high turnover, which is not only costly but also disruptive to the workplace and detrimental to productivity. Overpaying is also a problem as it eats into gross profits and thus negatively affects productivity. You might be overpaying someone if their job requires fewer skills than it did in the past, due to the emergence of new technology, for example. So instead of overpaying or underpaying, strive to pay your employees a reasonable market-based wage. And once you’ve calibrated your compensation structure accordingly, you can implement an evaluation system to further improve productivity. The benefits of doing so include instituting a better way to manage employee expectations; a way to highlight areas for improvement; and especially, turns your focus toward career planning. This last point is especially beneficial for productivity, in that it encourages employees to develop their skills and stay motivated. It will also improve employee retention, which saves time and money. And to get the most out of employee evaluations, it helps to identify three to five skills that could improve productivity for each role. Additionally, it’s good practice to ask each employee to describe how their role contributes to the firm’s targeted profitability level. Labor costs aren’t the only thing involved in running a healthy business. If you want to stay solvent, understanding the four forces of cash flow is crucial. So here they are – the four forces: This is crucial, so we’ll say it again: distributions shouldn’t be paid until you’ve built up enough cash reserves to handle the first three forces. And this gets us back to our 10- to 15-percent profitability goal. This principle is also crucial for cash-flow management, as profit reinvestment will help your business reach your CCT. It’s important that you keep these forces in mind and follow them, as unquestionably, there are always highs and lows in the business cycle. You will experience periods when money is tight – just think about tax time when all that cash flows out of your bank account! The Core Capital Target (CCT) is there to cover these cyclical swings. And you can calculate the CCT simply by reviewing your firm’s history. As a rule of thumb, it’s recommended that you build up two months of operating expenses. In very rare cases – for example, if your start-up deals with long waits on account receivables – the CCT might need to exceed two months of operating expenses. As we mentioned earlier, you can invest your profits to build this buffer. This should be a major priority before you even think about taking distributions from the company.  As we’ve learned, maintaining 10- to 15-percent profitability is the best way of raising capital. But couldn’t you also borrow to raise money? If you can avoid it, do so. Debt is dangerous, so it should only be your last resort. That’s because when you borrow other people’s money, you’re way more likely to take risks with it. When you start a business with your own money, in contrast, it feels more precious so you tend to be more careful with it.   You should treat borrowed money the same way. Remember: debt is dangerous. This also applies to start-up capital from venture capitalists. These people tend to be canny investors who expect growth and a high return on investment. And all too often, after a company’s growth plateaus, investors decide to wind up their interests and sell business assets. But what should you do if you don’t have that much money to invest upfront? It’s called sweat equity. As we’ve discussed, when you’re running a business, it’s important to pay yourself a market-based wage. But temporarily paying yourself a below-market wage is way better than taking on debt. Just make sure you’re living on your savings and not your firm’s after-tax profits! Let’s say your market-based wage would be $75,000 annually. And if you don’t pay yourself a salary the first year and only pay yourself $25,000 the second year, you’ve just added $100,000 to your firm’s equity. Plus, having this kind of blood-sweat-and-tears work ethic will allow you to focus on productivity and profitability. It’s the safest path to rapid wealth creation! The secrets to your company’s success are already there, they’re just hidden in the data. And that’s why constantly monitoring key measures will help your business thrive. Don’t overwhelm yourself with too many numbers – find just a few, ones that are important to your company’s survival and positive development and growth. Crucially, pay attention to your cash balance on a daily basis. This is especially true if you’re a new business, as younger firms are at risk of falling into a cash deficit the first few months. For new companies, being vigilant about the cash balance is an existential matter. Knowing what’s happening daily will allow you to focus on getting your bills paid. And then on a weekly basis, you should mind three metrics: sales, labor productivity and the cash-flow forecast for the next two weeks. This is where you should be looking for trends. For example, if you notice a decline in labor productivity over the course of two weeks, you can work on turning things around before any serious harm is done. Creating a meaningful profit-and-loss (P&L) statement will also help you spot trends and give you time to make necessary adjustments. And that’s why you should look specifically at “rolling” profit-and-loss statements. Ordinary P&L shows revenue, costs and expenses, along with key performance measures like labor productivity or any salary caps. Separately,  a “rolling” P&L focuses on just the last 12 months, revealing many trends. For example, if you aren’t meeting your 10- to 15-percent profitability goals, you can see what your salary cap should have been to meet the target. Once you’re in the habit of regularly monitoring key metrics and looking for trends, you can also implement forecasting to dynamically manage your firm’s growth. Cash-flow forecasting might sound daunting, but it’s easy to master. Here’s how it works: When you take your profit-and-loss (P&L) statement, you’ll note several future key costs that you can predict with some certainty, like rent. And you’ll see other costs, like labor, over which you have significant control. And then, looking at your performance over the last few months, you can make solid educated guesses for things like operating expenses and projected revenue. Since we’re forecasting cash flow, your P&L history will also reveal payments that haven’t yet come through. This information will allow you to predict future cash flow and also spot any discrepancies. And that gets to the power of forecasting – going back periodically and checking the accuracy of forecasts will give you insight into potential problems, before they do too much damage. To do this effectively, you have to forecast all your key metrics (like labor, productivity and accounts receivable) with reference to your profit target. By working backwards from your profit goals and Core Capital Target (CCT) targets, you’ll be able to identify desirable productivity rates, labor costs and other factors. And once you’ve done that, you can then ask yourself: Have I reached my goals? Am I moving in a positive or negative direction? The answer to the second question is especially crucial, because it provides a warning sign if things are going south. That way, you can check your metrics, figure out the problem and fix it. Don’t forget that companies can’t be moved or turned on a dime! Understanding the relationship between the various metrics buys you time and gives you the opportunity to steer your company true before you crash and burn! The key message in this book: Maintaining profitability, avoiding debt and enhancing productivity are some of the prudent business practices that can help you increase profits and boost your company’s market valuation in the longer term. Actionable advice: Don’t focus on revenue.  Many business owners focus on revenue to the exclusion of all other metrics. And although it’s tempting to do so too, remember that focusing on the size and growth of revenue instead of more insightful metrics, such as profitability and productivity, can be misleading and potentially damaging for your company.

Is it Fortune 500 companies? Banks? Megacorporations? According to Smart People Should Build Things, the answer lies in the innovative spirit of entrepreneurship and start-ups. So it’s no surprise that the tendency of young American graduates from elite universities to prefer careers in professional services, such as law firms and consultancies, might not benefit the national economy. In these blinks you will learn why elite university graduates tend to take jobs in the professional service industry, and the steps we can take to correct this flow. Along the way you will learn about the valuable lessons that entrepreneurship can teach us, and how anyone can become an entrepreneur, even you! In addition, these blinks will show you how some people are bound by golden handcuffs, why your friends are some of your most valuable resources, how buying a defunct yogurt factory led to one company’s wild success and why you shouldn’t pass up an opportunity to attend an Economist conference – if the ticket is free. At some point toward the end of their studies, every student has to make a decision about their future career. They ask themselves questions like: Where should I start? And what should my first job look like? At elite universities like those in the Ivy League, these questions usually leave students looking in only one direction. In fact, students leaving elite universities often seek out a career in prestigious professional service companies. They find their work homes in places like management consultancies, banks or the legal profession. We see this is true when we look at the numbers: on average, 40 percent of Princeton graduates go into finance or consulting, while each year almost 13 percent continue their studies in law school. In the same vein, 29 percent of the Harvard graduating class of 2011 went into finance or consulting, while 19 percent applied to law school. What is it that draws students from elite universities to professional service companies? In short, it’s mostly the high payment prospects and a challenging work environment. What’s more, students from elite universities are well suited to the formal application processes that they must overcome in order to land a job at these firms. It’s not so different from the application processes for the elite universities where they got their education: in almost all these universities, students have to pass challenging and highly selective application processes in order to be accepted. Finally, students influence one another in their career choices. Young students often feel insecure about their future, and look to others to figure out how to orient themselves. That means they follow each other into the same careers, year after year. As one student said: “It seems like everybody around you is doing banking interviews all the time. This has an effect on you after a while.” It’s not just students who influence one another in their career choices. Major professional service firms have an interest in recruiting, and therefore also play an important role in shaping students’ choices. For starters, professional service companies compete for the best students, and thus invest heavily in recruitment. In fact, there is a virtual arms race for talent taking place at dozens of universities each year. For example, Goldman Sachs has its own room in Columbia University's career services office, and it’s estimated that the company spends an astonishing $50,000 per recruit. If we take this number and project it to the overall recruitment expenditures of professional service companies, it adds up to tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Because there is only a limited number of students, and therefore a finite amount of available talent, firms must fight hard to secure their next generation of employees with immense spending. Moreover, the opportunities at prestigious firms for personal and professional growth make them more attractive for students. They make this quite clear in their marketing: work with us for two years and you will have learned everything you could possibly need for success in any field. More concretely, they say, for example, that if you work for a while as a management consultant you will develop the key skills necessary to later find work as a lobbyist or an investment banker. But how do you develop these skills? The blue-chip firms claim that they teach you to deliver “high-quality work,” one of the core value propositions for professional service companies. For example, every model, report or presentation has to be highly sophisticated and free of errors, and these skills can easily be applied to any other role. When students feel insecure about their career path, professional service companies seem to be a great starting point: their recruits learn essential skills and then switch to their preferred field later on. When you apply for a job, you have specific ideas about the tasks, the culture, the expectations, and so on. But have you ever found that these ideas turn out to be completely divorced from the reality of your work? The same is true for professional service companies: not everyone makes a good fit. Often you’ll have to work extremely hard, travel extensively and work in intense environments that people find difficult to cope with. It’s no wonder that the attrition rate at a top consulting company can exceed 30 percent per year. As a result, people have to get used to seeing colleagues and friends come and go. This can be harmful to their well-being, and can lead to stress and unhappiness. In addition, it’s not as easy to move from a big company to a small one as we might think. Even if these workers do manage to find an attractive job offer with a smaller company, they’re still bound by golden handcuffs. Leaving their old roles usually means a decreased salary, and managing this requires significant lifestyle adjustments, seen in our vacations, cars, and even relationships. And every year that you stay in the same role, the perceived risk of changing career paths becomes higher and higher. Furthermore, small- and medium-sized companies usually look for different skill-sets than larger professional services. Most small companies want to see that you can get things done. This action-oriented approach differs highly from the analytic and theoretical approach found at professional service firms. What’s more, most small- to medium-sized companies need one finance person, not twelve, and hiring a banker or consultant only makes sense once a company has reached a certain size. Finally, start-ups often hire from within their personal networks or from other start-ups, rather than reaching out to the banking, consultancy or legal sectors, thus making it that much harder to leave once you’re in. So far, we’ve focused on professional service companies from an individual’s perspective. But how do they affect entire economies? Is it good to have lots of highly specialized consultants? Not necessarily. In fact, the evidence indicates that a healthy economy depends on other things. In fact, it is start-ups, not professional service companies, that accelerate national economic development. This was clearly demonstrated in one study by the Kauffman Foundation, which showed that new firms accounted for all net job growth in the United States from 1997 to 2005. Added to this, firms in the United States with fewer than 500 employees account for thirteen times more patents per employee than larger firms. In contrast, the economic benefits of larger firms, such as those in the financial sector, are less clear. For example, 63 percent of Goldman Sachs’ 2010 revenue came from trading. But share trading doesn’t necessarily add value to the economy: one party wins, while the other party loses, implying that a great share of their revenue came at the expense of other areas of the economy. Innovations, on the other hand, are far more beneficial to national economic development. Therefore it seems that the American economy is developing in completely the wrong direction. Just take a look at the facts: In 1982, companies that had been in business for fewer than five years comprised almost half of all US companies. By 2011, that number had     declined to just over one third. In 2008, for the first time in the country’s history, the majority of US workers were at companies with 500 or more employees. These trends have consequences for everyone: because the most productive areas of the economy have been sidelined, Bloomberg Businessweek has projected a surplus of 176,000 unemployed or underemployed law school graduates by 2020. By now you should have a good understanding of the importance of innovation and the role small companies play in our economy. The following blinks will give you some tips on how to get in on the action. So let’s say you make the decision to help drive innovation by starting your own business. What steps can you take to ensure your success? For starters, the decision to start a company should be buttressed by solid preparation. Think of starting a business as you would of having a child: you have a moment of profound inspiration, followed by months of thankless work, ruined sleep, and frustration. In order to prepare yourself for this, start by following three steps before leaving your full-time job. Once you’ve laid the groundwork through preparation, you’ll find a lot of roadblocks obstructing your path. The greatest barrier for entrepreneurs is finding the initial funds to get started. And product development isn’t much easier – even when you’ve hired someone to do this, you should expect it to take twice as long and cost twice as much as planned. Not only that, but you’ll likely need quality partners and employees, and finding them can be time-consuming and unpredictable. When confronted with these problems, you must remember that success usually comes after a long period of failure. This is true even in the tech world, where hit applications seem to come out of nowhere and skyrocket to success. For example, people think of Rovio’s Angry Birds video game as an “instant success,” yet the company was around for six years and underwent layoffs before their game became a hit. Instead of feeling disheartened by the inevitable frustrations of starting a business, remember the words of LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman: “Remarkable careers are unlikely to advance in a straightforward, linear fashion.” In other words, it’s bound to be a roller coaster. If you try to approach entrepreneurship as a lone wolf, then you’ll find it very hard to be successful. Think of the most successful entrepreneurs, such as Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at Apple – they usually started as a team. When it comes to raising money and finding potential employees, it’s a good idea to look within your network of friends. For example, the author had lots of help from his friends when he was starting Venture for America (VFA), a non-profit organization aimed at helping talented students gain start-up experience. It all started when he received a pass to an Economist conference from a friend of his who could no longer use it. There, he met two people who would be integral to VFA’s success: Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, and Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn. Tony ended up spending $1 million on VFA, and Weiner became an adviser. But successful start-ups aren’t just about finding the right people – they also need to find the right location. Every region of the world has its own focus, so you should find the one that matches yours. A good example of this is Cincinnati-based General Nano, which manufactures a carbon nanotube material that can be used to make planes more resistant to lightning strikes. Their base in Cincinnati means that the company can take advantage of the military connections in the city to find buyers for its products. However, location isn’t all about finding contracts. It’s also about affordability. It goes without saying that office space in New York City is more expensive than that in smaller cities like New Orleans. Situating yourself in a “nontraditional” – and therefore cheaper – city isn’t necessarily bad news: for example, Zappos.com is located in Las Vegas, and Under Armour is in Baltimore, and both of these companies are wildly successful. Do you have any idea who Google’s seventh hire was back in 1999? Probably not. Back then, Google wasn’t cool. However, this person probably had an incredible experience and is now loaded. Rather than starting your own firm, another attractive option could be joining a young, promising start-up. Joining a start-up before it is “cool” can make you rich. With young start-ups, it’s possible to snag a position with real responsibility, and your personal contributions can make the difference between taking off or languishing at the bottom. Moreover, if a company gains enough success to become a household name, typically only dozens or hundreds of early employees have their careers defined by this success. It’s better to be in that small pool of contributors than to join once they’ve already “made it.” For example, the yogurt producer Chobani started out by purchasing a defunct yogurt plant in New York in 2005. Since then, they’ve grown to make over $1 billion in revenue and have more than 1,000 employees. Those early decision makers, however, are the ones who get all the glory. Furthermore, if you encounter some misfortune along the way, you are very likely to bounce back. This resilience develops as a result of building a habit of creating things and getting things done. These skills are more easily acquired by working for a start-up than in the professional service industry, and they will help you to overcome the difficulties of entrepreneurship. For example, when the tech bubble burst in 2001, virtually everyone was out of a job. However, a friend of the author, whose own company had gone bust, simply started another that was later acquired by Zynga, and he was thus able to recover. So if you want to find new ways to define your career path, you should check out promising start-ups in your area and apply for a job! Now you should have a good idea of what you need to focus on for your first adventure in entrepreneurship. But you’re only one person! The final blink will look at ways to get college graduates to see the value in entrepreneurship. By now we’ve seen the traps that high-potential students fall into during their early careers, and we’ve also seen the enormous benefits of getting them interested in entrepreneurship. But the question remains: how do we convince them to get excited about entrepreneurship? First, we need to find them the right role models: builders. There are many ways to tackle this. For example, universities, media companies, and public figures should actively promote start-up entrepreneurs as role models and invite them to tell their unique and exciting stories to students. In addition, every university should have an “entrepreneurial hour,” such as the one at University of Michigan, where experienced entrepreneurs come to speak in front of hundreds of students about their own stories and careers. Next, we should enlist entrepreneurs as mentors. One way to do this would be for universities, business schools, and even law schools to produce a roster of alumni entrepreneurs who are willing to offer their advice to budding young minds, or even take on paid apprentices. This sort of program is not without precedent. For example, the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute is one such successful university’s effort to enlist experienced entrepreneurs as mentors for current students. Finally, we should improve upon and invest in entrepreneurship education. A program like this would be more action-oriented and real-world driven than current business programs. At present, the study of entrepreneurship is too abstract and often ends abruptly after graduation, when it’s time to get a “real job.” A successful entrepreneurship program would instead be action-oriented, producing real, functioning businesses and contributors. If the United States is serious about keeping its place as an economic powerhouse, it has to foster a strong entrepreneurial spirit. It must offer students easy access to entrepreneurial mentoring or a goal-oriented entrepreneurship education in order to kickstart innovation and drive the economy. The key message in this book: Top students at elite universities in the United States primarily pursue careers in professional service companies – i.e., consultancies. However, it is not these companies, but rather start-ups that are the engine for job creation and innovation. In order to foster innovation and drive the economy, we must instill in our best students a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Actionable advice: It’s never too early to start. If you want to be successful in a start-up, it’s a good idea to get in on a project before it becomes hugely popular. This way you have a better opportunity to shape the company’s trajectory with your own ideas, and are more likely to be in a position of responsibility.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

According to Senor and Singer, being from Israel can give you a considerable head start. These blinks show how Israel has become a global powerhouse in innovation and entrepreneurialism. Its culture and geopolitics make the country swirl with both creative and sustainable start-ups developing everything from electric cars to money transfer systems. So if you’re curious to learn about the social and economic building blocks that provide the foundations for successful start-ups, Israel is the country to investigate. In these blinks you’ll discover how an Israeli idea overcame the obstacles facing electric vehicles; that an anti-hierarchical ethos drives the Israeli people; and that the military creates highly successful business folks. The media invariably offers a skewed portrayal of Israel, only reporting on its ongoing political conflicts with neighboring countries, conflict with the Palestinians, or the Iranian nuclear issue. But a major facet of Israel is often disregarded, and that is its economic and innovative achievements. Many people are unaware that Israel represents one of the most densely concentrated centers of innovation and entrepreneurship in the world. In fact, Israel is the word leader when it comes to the percentage of the economy spent on research and development. As a result, Israel also has the highest density of start-ups in the world, with a total of 3,850 – one for every 1,844 Israelis. Today, it’s difficult for technology companies to overlook Israel – and most haven’t. Cisco, for example, has acquired nine Israeli start-ups and is on the hunt for more. Israeli start-ups also reel in a large amount of venture capital, which is the most crucial measure of technological potential. In 2008, venture capital invested per capita was two and a half times larger in Israel than in the United States, more than 30 times greater than in Europe, and 80 times greater than in China. Israeli companies also have a powerful presence on the American stock exchange NASDAQ, accounting for more than all European NASDAQ companies combined. Israel’s start-up scene is vibrantly creative. One example is BetterPlace, which was founded to promote electric cars. There are well-known disadvantages to electric vehicles, such as expensive batteries, a short driving range, and a lengthy recharge time. However, if car buyers don’t need to purchase the batteries outright with the car, then electric cars can be as cheap as gasoline cars. So BetterPlace used this to their advantage by leasing car batteries and creating stations where the batteries could be swapped. But why is the start-up scene flourishing so well in Israel and not elsewhere? Let’s find out! One reason for Israel’s entrepreneurial achievements can be found in its people’s mentality. Israeli people live in, and are framed by, a culture of rebelliousness, informality and assertiveness. In 2008, PayPal bought the Israeli start-up Fraud Sciences – a company offering solutions to online payment scams. Scott Thompson, president of PayPal at the time, stated that the demeanor of the Fraud Sciences employees during his first meeting made quite an impression on him. The employees were unintimidated and openly challenged Paypal’s methods for detecting fraud. Scott Thompson was experiencing what is known to Israelis as chutzpah – a Hebrew word meaning “cheek” or “audacity.” To Israelis, chutzpah is the norm. Whether at home, in school, or in the army, they learn that assertiveness is welcome and expected. Israeli people are also traditionally open to questions and foster an anti-hierarchical ideology. Questioning is built into the Jewish faith thanks to centuries of Rabbinic debates concerning the interpretation of the Bible. These open-ended interpretations and counter-interpretations produced a culture of doubt and argument that spilled over into civilian life. As a result, anti-hierarchical mind-sets are present throughout Israeli society. Take the Israeli military: the Israeli army is deliberately understaffed at senior ranks, because fewer senior officers lead to more individual initiative at lower levels. In addition, once a year, thousands of men are enlisted into the military reserve forces. This curtails social hierarchy because in the reserves, taxi drivers can give orders to millionaires, and young adults can train their older relatives. Because every Israeli has to serve in the army for a minimum of two years, their military is an integral part of society. It’s also where much of the country’s creative energy comes from, so it acts as an incubator for high-tech start-ups. In Israel, all 17-year-olds must report to military recruiting centers for screenings that include psychological testing and medical evaluation. Those who do particularly well in the screening are offered training in the military elite units – the highest of which is the Talpiot unit. Talpiot cadets complete an accelerated university degree in math or physics while they are introduced to the technological requirements of all military branches. The aim of this is to mold them into leaders who can seek out cross-disciplinary solutions to military problems. Although Talpiot training is designed to develop the military’s technological elite, the acquisition and combination of leadership experience and technical knowledge is also applied when founding new companies, making cadets the ideal people to do exactly that. But it’s not just Talpiot graduates who enjoy this kind of training: every military unit provides training in innovative and adaptive problem solving, which is helpful in business environments. Furthermore, the military is a space where young men and women work closely with people from different cultural, socioeconomic and religious backgrounds. Learning how to deal with a wide variety of people is something that the cadets can benefit from later when dealing with international business partners. As an added bonus, many business connections can be formed during the long hours of operations and training. So we can see how the Israeli military fosters an entrepreneurial culture, and it’s no surprise that the graduates have become founders of some of Israel’s most successful companies. Israel’s economic history is marked by two significant leaps. The first came during 1948 to 1970, and the second is still happening today, having started in 1990. During these leaps, Israel was transformed from a less-developed country into a trailblazing hub of innovation. The collective communities known as kibbutzim were at the core of Israel’s first great economic leap. Kibbutzim were created as agricultural settlements devoted to abolishing private property and forming an egalitarian community. They were both hyper-collective and hyper-democratic, and through them technological breakthroughs were made. For example, in the Hatzerim kibbutz in the Negev Desert, the soil was found to be too salty and troublesome to cultivate adequately. To solve this dilemma, the members of the kibbutz came up with a way to flush the soil so that they could grow crops there. They were successful, and in 1965, the kibbutz started a business to manufacture irrigation systems. This was the beginning of what became Netafim, a global drip irrigation company. During Israel’s second great leap, a new venture capital industry emerged. In 1993, the Israeli government began an initiative named Yozma that offered tax incentives for foreign venture capital investments in Israel, and promised to double any investment with government funds. This created an eagerness in the US venture community to invest in Israeli start-ups, allowing the Israeli tech scene to participate in the tech boom of the 1990s. During this time, Israel’s information-technology revenues rocketed from $1.6 billion to $12.5 billion. Eventually the Yozma program created a new venture capital industry which revamped the Israeli start-up scene. This was pivotal to Israel’s second great economic leap. Imagine being able to have anything you want for dinner, from Yemeni cuisine, to Russian specialities, to Mediterranean dishes. This is a reality in Israel, which is home to over 70 nationalities and cultures due to large influxes of immigrants. Immigration has also boosted the Israeli economy in other ways. Take, for example, the Russian Jewish immigrants. By the 1990s, large waves of Russian Jewish immigrants began to arrive after the fall of the Soviet Union. Russians with doctorates and engineering degrees flowed into Israel in huge numbers. Though finding jobs and building houses for the new arrivals was quite an undertaking for the government, the Russians had arrived at an ideal time. By the mid-1990s, the international tech boom was gaining momentum, and Israel’s technology sector was eager for engineers. The Russian engineers were the right people for Israeli tech start-ups and contributed a great deal to their success. An influx of new talent is a considerable benefit to the economy, but what about those leaving the country? Well, the movement of Israelis to and from the country also helps foster its economy. For example, after earning an engineering degree at Ben-Gurion university in Beersheba, Israel, Michael Laor attained the position of director of engineering and architecture at Cisco in California. In 1997, 11 years later, he decided to return to Israel. In order to keep hold of such a talented employee, Cisco agreed that Laor should start a research and development center for the company in Israel. By 2008, Laor’s center had 700 employees, and Cisco has spent at least $1.2 billion purchasing and investing in Israeli companies. People like Michael Laor contradict the notion of the widely discussed Israeli “brain drain.” Israel is surrounded by political adversaries on every border and is in a constant state of conflict. This may seem harmful to the Israeli economy, but these geopolitical circumstances have actually been advantageous in the long run. Israel has managed to turn its political isolation into an economy built on knowledge and innovation. Because of the political problems, Israelis weren’t able to travel to any neighboring countries until recently. Living in such isolation, it was therefore natural for Israelis to look internationally and embrace fields in technology and telecommunications, which would make borders and distances essentially irrelevant. In addition, Arab trade boycotts forced Israel to export to markets further abroad. As a result, Israeli companies spurned the production of large, readily manufactured goods with high shipping costs in favor of small technical components and software. Israel’s geopolitical confinement positioned the country perfectly for the worldwide turn toward knowledge- and innovation-based economies – a trend that is still vibrant today. Moreover, Israel turned its enduring military threat into an advantage in the high-tech economy. Initially, Israel opted to buy large weapon systems from other countries, as opposed to investing the massive resources required to produce them. After 1948, Israel formed an alliance with France, which included the French supply of military equipment and fighter aircraft. But in 1967, France withdrew its military support, leaving Israel exposed and vulnerable considering its geopolitical situation and the continual risk of war with neighboring countries. However, this sparked Israel’s drive for technological independence and, as a consequence, Israel started to develop its own military technology. The impressive technological talent that was poured into military projects was later unleashed into the economy, where military engineering graduates entered the private technology sector and helped instigate the high-tech boom. The Israeli start-up scene may seem fairly established, but it began just over a decade ago. So what if Israel’s economic success was simply a fluke resulting from random events? In order to ensure its ongoing strength, Israel’s economy will likely have to overcome several challenges. One of these challenges could well be that Israel’s economy gets too dependent on venture capital. A dwindling venture capital supply means less money for Israeli start-ups. This was already evident during the global financial crisis in 2008, which reduced the dollar amount available for venture capital investments. With insufficient financing, many Israeli start-ups were left with no choice but to shut down. Israeli companies also lean too heavily on export markets. Over half of Israel’s GDP (gross domestic product) comes from exports from Europe, North America, and Asia. When those economies fall on hard times, this means fewer customers for Israeli start-ups. Due to the Arab trade boycott, Israel has no access to the majority of regional markets and the domestic market is simply not big enough to act as a substitute. Yet probably the most worrying threat to Israel’s economic growth is its minimal participation in the economy. Israel’s low workforce participation rate (just over 50 percent) is mainly attributed to two minority communities: Haredim, or strictly orthodox Jews, and Israeli Arabs. 84 percent of men in mainstream Israeli Jewish society between ages 25 and 64 are employed, and 75 percent of women in that group. Among Arab women and Haredi men, these percentages are almost reversed: 79 percent and 73 percent, respectively, are unemployed. The primary reason behind this low participation is that these groups generally do not serve in the army. This means that they are less likely to learn and develop the entrepreneurial skills that the army offers, and they cannot cultivate the business networks that Jewish Israeli youth form while in the military. The key message in this book: Israel is home to a high density of innovation and entrepreneurship and an impressive number of creative start-ups. The reasons behind Israel’s remarkable economic success can be found in the country’s history, culture and geopolitics.  Suggested further reading: Startup Rising by Christopher M. Schroeder The Arab Spring uprisings left much of the Middle East politically unchanged, but they made a whole lot of noise. And yet there’s a second, quieter revolution taking place in the same region – and it’s all about the rise of tech and entrepreneurialism. Through stories of Middle Eastern entrepreneurs living in Beirut, Amman, Dubai, Istanbul and elsewhere, Startup Rising shows an entire region reinventing itself as a center of economic opportunity.

Although angel investors usually don’t have the money that larger investors do, angel investments, however small, can make an entrepreneur’s dreams come true.  But how do you get an angel investor on the hook? A good place to start is knowing what sort of angel investor you need. And if you want to invest in start-up ideas yourself, you should consider which strategies will serve you best as you seek out the next big thing.  There is no better place to start than by looking at the skills and experience of some of the most successful angel investors out there. In these blinks, you’ll learn why passion and drive will take you far with a momentum investor; how a start-up’s first test market is often an investor’s family and friends; and why having a quick exit strategy is good for both investor and entrepreneur.  Before we examine what makes an angel investor successful, let’s first define the category. Angel investors – the wealthy individuals who financially support start-up companies – come in three types: momentum investors, value investors and alternative investors.  Momentum investors are characterized by a reliance on instinct and vision. In other words, their selection technique doesn’t involve much in the way of specifics or hard data. Rather, if a momentum investor feels a connection with or is somehow engaged by a company, he will offer his support.  Brad Feld, a managing director at Foundry Group, is a leading momentum investor and has a particular approach when evaluating his gut feeling about an entrepreneurial project, that we’ll explore in depth in the next blink.  Value investors invest in companies that come to the table with solid financials. David Verrill, founder and managing director at Hub Angels Investment Group, is a renowned value investor who takes the time to investigate a company’s revenue sheet before taking the plunge. He prefers to review company data from the last 12 to 24 months, which helps him determine whether a business idea will eventually take off.  Finally, alternative investors want to do more than make an investment; they want to send a message. Rather than investing in stocks or bonds, alternative investors focus efforts on a specific business area, such as health care, antiques or even wine, to create a significant impact.  Catherine Mott, the founder of the BlueTree Capital Group and the BlueTree Allied Angels, is a good example of an alternative investor. Her organizations assist entrepreneurs in building solid businesses, with a focus on private equity investments, to ensure local start-ups receive the necessary financial support. Let’s now take a closer look at each angel investor category, starting with the momentum investor. Have you ever wondered why there aren’t more people like Bill Gates? The answer is simple: not all business ideas have potential. This is a problem with which every budding investor has to wrestle. So how do you decide which businesses are worth supporting? Angel investor Brad Feld, an established momentum investor, has a few pretty good ideas.  Feld believes that any potential investment target must offer three things: a passionate entrepreneur, great initial product feedback and a long-term relationship.  Any person who is passionate about his or her idea is an entrepreneur with potential in Feld’s book. After all, how can a business leader get customers excited about a product if he isn’t thrilled with it himself? As an investor, however, Feld believes it’s crucial that the product excites him, too.  But of course even the most exciting products can fail. So, before making an investment, Feld ensures that the product has been properly road-tested with the company’s target audience.  Let’s say Feld is interested in a start-up selling all-natural sweets. He’d first share the product with his family and friends, to gauge its market potential. If feedback is positive, and Feld’s family and friends feel that such a product is missing in the market, it’s likely that Feld will decide to invest.  But there’s one more test that a start-up needs to pass before Feld is on board. Feld asks himself whether he’d consider investing in the company for the long term, even if he were only to play a small role within the company itself.  Here, Feld doesn’t place too much weight on the experience or past achievements of the start-up’s entrepreneurs. What matters most is a feeling of connection between the business and the investor. Only when this connection is solid, and the business has successfully met his other two criteria, will Feld decide to invest. David Verrill is a value investor. He first worked in corporate fundraising at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and later joined other investors to found the Hub Angels Investment Group.  This group focuses on local, capital-efficient start-ups; that is, companies that use relatively low capital expenditures to produce output that is, nonetheless, great. Hub Angels doesn’t look for grand visions but instead considers whether a start-up's finances genuinely show growth potential.  Because most Hub Angels founders have a background in the life sciences, the group invests largely in areas such as diagnostic and health-information technology, yet avoids pharmaceutical companies.  Why? Well, according to Verrill’s experience, such companies – often seeking funding to the tune of $20 million to $40 million – simply weren’t profitable investments.  Hub Angels is a relatively small investor group, and might struggle if faced with competing investors in the pharma field. So Hub Angels adapted its strategy to its scale and only invests in start-ups with lower capital requirements.  Another feature that makes the Hub Angels strategy stand out among other angel investors is that the group doesn’t just invest in a company once.  Investors usually offer a single investment to a start-up and then are done. But Hub Angels discovered that by following investments attentively, the group could invest multiple times at certain moments that could boost returns.  A case in point is the company Localytics, which enables apps to analyze a user’s mobile-phone activity and generate targeted in-app advertisements. Hub Angels participated in two investment rounds for the company. Based on its initial success, Localytics has since raised $16 million from other venture capital companies.  Like other successful start-ups, Localytics will soon reach a point where it no longer requires help from Hub Angels. At this point, the angel investor’s job is done! David Bangs became an angel investor in 2007, when he joined the Northwest Energy Angels investment group. A typical alternative investor, Bangs invests in clean technology and has clear ideas about what makes a good investment as well. Bangs believes that, as a good investor, you must have a strategy that provides you and your money with a quick exit. But what if a company simply doesn’t seem to be set up for such a contingency? There are alternatives. Bangs often suggests purchasing some of the company’s shares, but only with the condition that company owners will repurchase your shares at an agreed price if you decide you want out.  So if Bangs wanted to leave an ongoing arrangement to invest in another start-up, for example, his pre-agreed condition would allow him quick access to his money – which is much faster than having to find another buyer to take on his shares.  This simple strategy is highly advantageous not only for investors but also for founders, although you might be wondering why any entrepreneur would agree to such a deal.  Many companies appreciate the opportunity to repurchase a given percentage of shares, so long as this percentage is smaller than the company’s margin. This arrangement offers the benefit of a greater ownership stake and the potential for a bigger exit, should company owners decide to sell.  To illustrate this, let’s imagine a start-up with a 40-percent margin. If the company allocated five percent of its returns to repurchase shares, it would have an effective margin of 35 percent. This, in turn, is an attractive result for shareholders!  We now know how angel investors evaluate potential investment targets and decide to direct funds to an inspiring start-up company. An angel investor’s strategies and principles allow him to make decisions effectively.  But sometimes, it’s not so easy to make the call alone. This is when you need other investors around you.  Catherine Mott, an alternative investor, is part of an angel group. Here’s why: Let’s imagine that you’re excited by an entrepreneur’s idea. You can’t wait to help him enter the market, and are thrilled to have found such a great opportunity. But how great is the idea, really? It’s likely that in your enthusiasm, you’ve overlooked a few key problems.  This is where fellow angel investors come into play. They can offer you critical opinions that might bring you back down to earth, allowing you to make a more rational, informed decision.  Catherine Mott pays particular attention to the management abilities of start-ups. She makes sure that start-up founders display due diligence; she wants to be sure they’re genuinely ready for the market.  As part of this process, Mott assesses the team leader’s skills. How well does the person suit the role? Can the person take criticism? Does the person help the team work smoothly together? If these questions can be answered in the affirmative, then the team is ready for the market.  But we’re not quite done yet. Next, Mott examines the target market, in light of the business model or product. This process takes between four and six weeks, depending on the quality of the team.  Although time-consuming, this phase is important, as it reduces the risk of failure. And the start-up gains too, as Mott is always there to ensure that the company’s financial strategy is sound and sustainable.  The key message in this book: As an angel investor, you need to perform due diligence, testing your investment target thoroughly and getting a second opinion from fellow investors to make successful, lucrative decisions. While momentum investors rely on connection and intuition, value investors stick to the numbers when deciding which start-up will win the funding round. Alternative investors invest in a cause they believe in, creating a positive impact.  Actionable advice: Even angels need a mentor.  If you want to start investing, it’s a good idea to find yourself an investment mentor. This experienced person can provide you with insider information and advice. Especially if you’re not familiar with a particular investment area, your mentor can set you straight and potentially prevent you from investing capital into an idea or project that might not pan out.

Happily, it doesn’t have to remain a mere dream. The hugely successful start-ups of Silicon Valley got where they are today through clever marketing and positioning techniques that any entrepreneur can employ. But what are these techniques? Well, in these blinks, you’ll discover a few of the growth hacks that have greatly benefited companies like Github, Yelp and many more. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how you can make money out of giving stuff away for free; how Uber took advantage of Chicago's awful weather; and why no one needs to pay for ads ever again. Chances are you’ve heard of Silicon Valley as being home to many innovative and successful start-up companies. But you might be impressed to learn just how successful these companies are.   The figures are truly astonishing: in a very short period of time these start-ups have generated billions of dollars in revenue and attracted hundreds of millions of customers.  Take Uber, for example. The transportation service officially launched in 2011 and in less than five years has achieved worldwide fame; as of 2015, the company is valued at $62 billion. What’s remarkable is how fast the growth was in comparison to the traditional economy. Start-ups achieve this kind of success by largely avoiding traditional growth techniques. For instance, Uber didn’t rely on typical marketing tools like costly paid advertisements. Instead, they targeted their clients using data analytics and relied on viral and word-of-mouth marketing to expand their customer base.    This new way of doing business became known as growth hacking. This approach to marketing is focused on quickly maximizing growth and isn’t limited to one specific sector. Growth hacking can work for mobile applications, business-to-business services or marketplaces and social networks alike. And there isn’t one simple formula for successful growth hacking, either. It involves a wide range of factors that are combined to achieve excellent performance through attracting, retaining and generating revenue through new customers. To achieve this, growth hackers lead teams of experts in multiple fields who are just as familiar with scientific thinking as they are with data, statistics and creativity. In the following blinks, we’ll look at some of the best growth hacks and how they were put to use by some of today’s most successful start-ups. You may have heard this before, but it is worth repeating: the best ideas for a successful new business come from identifying a problem and offering a solution. But how do you find the right problem to solve? The best kind of problem is one that affects a broad group of people. Square is an example of a company that found success by providing a solution to a problem many people were finding difficult to overcome. Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, started Square in 2009 after observing his friend’s inability to conduct a payment transaction when a customer wanted to use a credit card to purchase a glass faucet. Dorsey knew many small businesses were experiencing the same problem. Even though many potential customers use credit cards, not all businesses can afford the equipment necessary to allow these kinds of payments. Square solved this problem by reducing these costs and offering affordable hardware and software to make credit card payments more accessible to small business.  This shows that you don’t have to look far to find a problem needing a solution. Observe your surroundings, focus on what interests you and pay attention to the problems people run into. An unsolved problem can be just around the corner. The crowdsourced review site Yelp is an example of a solution to a local problem that became a worldwide success. Before Yelp, local small businesses had the problem of being unable to compete with the kind of marketing budgets of big chain stores and restaurants. They had to rely primarily on word-of-mouth marketing from satisfied customers. Yelp recognized this issue and created a platform based on customer recommendations. It disrupted the old model and offered equal exposure, offering any business a chance to enjoy the benefits of a good reputation.    Have you ever come across a product or service that ended up becoming an essential part of your life? Some start-ups like WhatsApp and Facebook have managed to create these kinds of must-have products that find their way into customers’ daily routines. So what’s their secret? These innovations come from keen observation and an understanding of customer needs. This kind of analysis is exactly how Uber targeted their customers in the transportation market. The company found opportunities by looking at situations when people find driving and getting around most problematic: during holidays, sporting events, bad weather or when you’re out on the town. After starting out in San Francisco, Uber had this valuable knowledge in mind when they moved to Chicago. Since the city is known for its troublesome weather, great nightlife and many loyal sports fans, it was the perfect match for the company. Nowadays, Uber is such a must-have application that some users actually question the need to own a car at all. Try starting the search for your must-have idea by looking at your own life and asking what solution you could use to improve your situation. If you find a problem this way, you have the added benefit of being able to test out your service yourself and knowing whether it will meet customer expectations. This is how the web platform GitHub was born in 2008. It started when computer programmers realized they needed a better way to manage their code. Sharing code on open-source projects was problematic and inefficient, requiring downloading, revising and uploading code back and forth. GitHub offered a solution that disrupted the entire process and allowed programmers to share code online, removing the daily struggle and creating what would become a $2 billion company in only a few years’ time.  Once you find your must-have product or service, it might be tempting to launch it on a global scale. But many start-ups have seen this approach backfire. By going too big too soon, you run the risk of spreading yourself too thin and ending up a small player stretched across several markets. To increase your visibility and gain momentum, it’s better to start big in a local niche market. Many successful Silicon Valley start-ups followed this advice by taking advantage of the local San Francisco Bay Area market to generate momentum. This is where Uber first launched its services, focusing intently on one city before rolling out to other locations at a rate of one per month. Uber knew the tech community around San Francisco would be receptive to their services; the company took advantage of this by sponsoring tech and venture events and even offering free rides to attendees! Uber used this initial customer base to collect vital information on the industry and market. With this knowledge in hand, the company could then successfully adapt its approach when it came time to expand. By focusing your efforts to satisfy the expectations of one specific audience, you can generate the kind of positive word-of-mouth exposure that will enable you to grow. This is also what Yelp did in its first year in San Francisco. By focusing on one city, they proved they could gather an abundance of reviews and create an entire entertainment guide for the area. With their reputation in San Francisco cemented, they could then move on to the next city. Have you ever been scrolling through mobile applications and decided to try out a free version before committing to a purchase? You’re certainly not alone. Many companies know the benefits of offering a non-cost service, or a freemium model, to eventually generate revenue. A freemium model gives customers a chance to use a basic free service with the option to unlock an upgraded, premium version for a certain price. The note-taking app Evernote used this business model to create millions in revenue. Evernote users can access the application for free but have to pay a subscription fee for additional features like storage space, offline access and syncing across multiple devices.  Evernote could confidently use this strategy because they observed that the more time users spent with the application, the more engaged they became with it.  The key to the freemium model is offering an upgrade with a clear increase in value to motivate customers to buy it. Otherwise, you run the biggest risk that comes with the freemium model, which is giving customers no clear reason to upgrade. The creators of GitHub faced a similar challenge when they launched their platform as a free service with unlimited public storage. With this model they ran into two problems: first, all the user content was accessible to anyone who joined, which some major companies didn’t appreciate; and second, their server bills were quickly adding up. Luckily, a solution presented itself. GitHub decided to offer private storage that more protective companies could pay to use, while keeping the public repository free of charge. While some companies have found success with the freemium model, not all free offers have to involve a basic version of a paid product or service.  Offering free content or tools to the public is another proven way to generate business. Not to be confused with a free demo version of a product, this refers to a free stand-alone offer that aims to help a potential client.  But, like the freemium model, the ultimate goal is for the free content to draw in paying customers. This is the strategy that the content marketing service HubSpot successfully employed when it started in 2006. The company offers ways to improve a customer’s commercial visibility through tools and services like social platform marketing, content management and search engine optimization. HubSpot came up with a clever way to market itself and let clients know that its services were needed. It created a stand-alone tool called Marketing Grader where people could add a URL and see the website’s performance grade. If the site performed poorly, what better way to fix it than by using Hubspot’s services! Free tools like this usually end up being good for both your business and your customers. This method also lets you provide free assistance to potential customers while you gather valuable information, which you can then put to use when they show interest in paying for your services later on.  This is exactly what HubSpot did, and it allowed them to dramatically grow their customer base while keeping their sales force to a minimum. By putting a free tool on the market, they were able to gather huge amounts of customer contacts while simultaneously enticing customers to pay for their services. Now that we’ve learned how start-ups quickly maximize their growth, let’s look at two ways to quickly maximize a company’s exposure in the marketplace. First, viral marketing can be a key to success – even though it is difficult to control. Managing virality is about creating the conditions that make it possible for your idea, product or content to quickly jump from one person to the next and go global overnight. The good part about virality: it costs next to nothing. The bad part about virality: it usually happens unintentionally and without a clear reason. One company that might have cracked the code of virality is Upworthy, a media website that specializes in viral content and the emotional, surprising videos that users like to share. A mere 20 months after Upworthy launched, it was attracting 88 million unique monthly visitors. The articles that Upworthy uploads are all tested to find the virality “special sauce.” An article might be given up to 25 different headlines to find out which one will generate the most clicks! Another way for websites to improve exposure is through social platforms. In the age of Facebook, it is clear that you can attract and grow your customer base by creating a sense of community. This is one of the secrets to how Yelp succeeded: while other review sites featured anonymous users, Yelp created a healthy network of subscribed members, each with photos and full profiles. The active users had an identity and were part of a community, which made their opinions more trustworthy than those of an anonymous stranger. GitHub also formed a similar network by creating the largest programmer community on the web. This has transformed GitHub into a social platform that even headhunters might turn to when looking for new hires! The key message in this book: Traditional marketing strategies are no longer relevant in the new economy. A successful start-up needs to find new ways to compete by using growth hacks. Top performing companies are using new and efficient methods to maximize growth, expertly target customers and put themselves on the fast track to success.  Actionable advice: Make sure the freemium model is right for you. Before implementing the freemium model, ask yourself if your product or service requires a significant time to learn how to use it. If the answer is yes, customers are actually more likely to use your service if they pay for it. Research shows that a customer who pays for something will usually take the time to learn how to use it, because they see it as an investment. On the other hand, as a free product it might get discarded without being given a proper chance. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

That might sound dramatic, but consider the iPhone when it debuted. It didn’t just move a lot of units; it fundamentally changed the way we interact with our mobile devices, integrating them into our everyday lives in many different ways. In other words, it transformed our behavior.  That’s why behavioral modification should be at the forefront of our minds when we approach the task of designing new products and services. Instead of just thinking about how we can sell stuff, we should take a step back and ask ourselves, what’s the behavior we’re trying to promote? Or to put it a little more poetically, what kind of reality are we trying to create?  From there, we can work backward in designing new products and services. That’s what Starting at the End is all about. Drawing on behavioral science, these blinks offer a systematic approach to product and service design. In these blinks, you’ll learn  how to sum up your vision of a new reality into a single, powerful statement;  how to create a map of the influences on your potential customers’ behavior; and  how to use that map to modify those influences and thereby transform the world.  The process of assessing how we can modify our potential consumers’ behavior is called the Intervention Design Process, or IDP. It begins with a special type of observation called a potential insight. When you have one of these insights, you’re perceiving a gap between the world as it is (the real world) and the world as you want it to be (the ideal world).  To make this somewhat abstract definition more concrete, let’s dig into an example. Back in 2012, when the author was helping Microsoft develop the search engine Bing, he and his team had a potential insight: it seemed like children weren’t using search engines at school anywhere near as much as one might expect.  At first glance, children, schools and search engines should have been a perfect combination. After all, children are brimming with questions, schools are supposed to foster their curiosity and search engines can help them answer nearly any question they might have. In an ideal world (at least from Bing’s perspective), they would be conducting numerous online searches per day (preferably on Bing, of course). But the team suspected a gap between the real world and the ideal world; something was driving a wedge between the two.  Now, the keyword here is “suspected.” At this point, no one at Microsoft had any empirical evidence to support the notion in question; it was just a hunch. That’s why it was a potential insight; it hadn’t yet been confirmed as an actual insight.  For all anyone at Microsoft knew at the time, their hunch could have been wrong, and the gap they were perceiving could have been a figment of their imagination. In that case, it would have been a waste of time, money and energy for the company to throw resources at solving a problem that didn’t exist. That’s true of any potential insight, so it’s crucial to test your insight.  To do that, you need to seek out quantitative or qualitative validation of your insight. For the author and his team, that meant collecting data about children’s internet usage at school – an example of quantitative validation. It also meant going to schools and watching kids’ computer usage in person – an example of qualitative validation.  It turned out their hunch was correct: on average, each student was conducting less than one search per day. The gap between the ideal world and the real world was proven to exist; their insight was validated. If the same can be said of your insight, you can now proceed to the next step of the IDP.  So far, you’ve identified the gap between the world as it is and the world as you’d like it to be. Your next step is to write up a formal description of the ideal world you want to create.  This is called a behavioral statement, and it can be broken into five components. The first is the behavior you’re trying to promote. Usually, it boils down to purchasing and using your product or service. For example, when Uber launched its ride-sharing service in 2009, the behavior the company wanted to promote was, well, taking an Uber.  The second component is the population whose behavior you want to change. Sometimes, that population can be very broad. Uber’s target population was everyone. Usually, however, your target population will be a narrower demographic, such as a particular age group.  The third component is the motivation behind the behavior you’re trying to encourage. For Uber, that was simply the desire to get from point A to point B. In the company’s ideal world, any time anyone wanted to do this, they’d take an Uber.  But when thinking about your ideal world, you have to be realistic. Even within your target population, your product or service usually won’t be usable or desirable for people in every situation. There are certain limitations, or preconditions, on when and how people can use it. These are the fourth component of your behavioral statement. Here, you’re noting the preconditions that need to be met for people to engage in the behavior you want to promote. For example, to take an Uber at the time of the company’s launch, people needed to have a smartphone equipped with a mobile internet connection and an electronic form of payment. They also needed to live in San Francisco, because the company limited its initial rollout to the high-tech city in which it was based.  In the fifth and final component of the behavioral statement, you define the data by which you will measure whether or not the behavior you want to promote is taking place. For Uber, the metric was pretty simple: the number of rides people took with their service.  Now all that’s left to do is to take those five components and fuse them into a single sentence. For Uber, that would be as follows: “When people want to get from Point A to Point B, and they have a smartphone with connectivity and an electronic form of payment and live in San Francisco, they will take an Uber (as measured by rides).”  Thanks to your behavioral statement, you now have a precise description of the ideal world you’re trying to create. The next step is to start figuring out how to make it a reality!  Here, we begin with two basic premises. First, there must be certain factors holding people back from engaging in the behavior in which we want them to engage; these are inhibiting pressures. Second, there must be certain factors encouraging people who are engaging in the behavior; these are promoting pressures.  Your task now is to identify these pressures – a process called pressure mapping. Let’s illustrate how to do this with a rather mouth-watering example: M&Ms.  Imagine you’re working for Mars, the company that makes M&Ms, and your goal is to encourage the behavior of eating the chocolate candy. What are the promoting pressures for this behavior? Well, to start with the obvious, M&Ms are tasty. They’re also visually attractive, coming in an array of vivid colors.  These colors provide an example of irrational promoting pressures. They don’t actually affect the taste or nutritional content of M&Ms; the colors are completely superficial. A completely logical, M&M-chomping android couldn’t care less about them. Nonetheless, such irrational pressures can be very powerful. Just imagine what would happen to M&M sales if you changed their colors from cheerful shades like red and green to shades that reminded people of vomit and urine!  Now let’s turn to the inhibiting pressures. Here’s a big one: availability. The harder the M&Ms are to get, the less likely people are to eat them. Imagine you had a bowl of M&Ms right next to you, right now. You’d probably be pretty tempted to grab a handful of them. Now imagine they’re 20 feet away from you in a cabinet, then 20 meters away in a vending machine and then 20 blocks away in a convenience store. Notice how the temptation gets weaker and weaker?  Now, there’s one obvious pressure we haven’t talked about so far: calories and sugar content. Those are another inhibiting pressure, right? Well, as you’ll learn in the next blink, the matter is a bit more complicated than that, and it illustrates why pressure mapping is a little trickier than it might seem at first glance.  If you’re conscious about your health, the high calories and sugar content of a pack of M&Ms are probably going to be a pretty significant inhibiting pressure, dissuading you from eating them. But if you’re feeling hungry or experiencing a blood sugar crash, they could also be a promoting pressure, tempting you to gobble them down.  Here we encounter an example of a counter-rational pressure – a pressure that can go in either direction, contrary to what a rational observer might expect. These counter-rational pressures are context-dependent. For example, M&Ms have a playful, lighthearted branding that features anthropomorphic candy characters. In the context of a kid’s party, that branding is a promoting pressure – but at a romantic dinner, it would probably make them feel pretty out of place; their branding would then become an inhibiting pressure.  The more you analyze them, the more you realize that all pressures are context-dependent. For example, take something seemingly as cut-and-dried as the cost of M&Ms. At a couple bucks per pack, they might seem pretty cheap to you – another promoting pressure. But imagine you’re a six-year-old boy who needs to save up his allowance for a week to buy one. Or imagine you’re one of the majority of people on Earth who lives on less than $2.50 per day. Now they’re expensive – an inhibiting pressure.  Well, sometimes. Expensiveness can also be a counter-rational promoting pressure. For example, the high cost of jewelry is a part of its appeal; the expense conveys quality, status and a sense of luxury. Point being: promoting and inhibiting pressures are complicated. They shift with context, and they can often be either counter-rational or outright irrational.  That’s why we shouldn’t rely on our intuitions or preconceptions when we’re trying to identify and map out those pressures. The reality of them may be different than our perceptions or assumptions – and there may be pressures we haven’t even considered. To do pressure mapping well, you need to base it on empirical research and validate it with evidence – collecting data, conducting interviews and so forth.  But here’s the good news: if you did a solid job with the insight-validation phase of the IDP, you’ll already have plenty of evidence on which to draw when you reach the pressure-mapping stage.  Let’s say you’ve finished mapping out your target behavior’s inhibiting and promoting pressures. On a whiteboard, you may have drawn a picture of the behavior in the middle, surrounded by downward arrows for each of the inhibiting pressures and upward arrows for each of the promoting pressures.  You can now see at a glance the balance of forces surrounding the behavior. The more the promoting pressures outweigh the inhibiting pressures, the more likely people will be to engage in the behavior. Conversely, the more strongly the inhibiting pressures push down against the promoting pressures, the less likely people will be to engage in the behavior.  For example, when the author was working with the Clover Health insurance company, he and his team had an insight: people in the black community were getting flu shots at a much lower rate than the general population. After validating this insight, coming up with a behavioral statement and doing some research, they mapped out a number of promoting pressures and inhibiting pressures.  One of the main promoting pressures was the idea that a flu shot is good for your health. This turned out to be fairly weak among black people in the United States; many of them responded to it by asking, “Why do I need a shot? I’m already healthy.”  Meanwhile, on the other side of the equation, there were several strong inhibiting pressures. For example, many black people were bothered by the fact that the formula for the flu shot was changed every year.  Health care providers do this for a good reason; it helps to keep the flu shot effective. But for some black people, it might seem like there’s some sort of medical experimentation going on. That taps into some very real and very painful history, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Conducted by US government researchers from 1932 to 1972, this study involved denying antibiotic treatments to black research subjects, killing many of them in the process.  Understandably, then, there was a whole lot of distrust coming from multiple directions at once. The strength of these inhibiting pressures was overpowering the weaker promoting pressures, resulting in a low rate of black people getting flu shots.  By understanding the pressures behind this phenomenon, the author and his team were now in a position to start thinking about how to change it, which brings us to the next step of the IDP.  At this point in the IDP, you’ve mapped out the inhibiting and promoting pressures that surround your target behavior. As a result, you now know the balance of power between the two sides.  To promote your target behavior, you need to alter that balance of power to make it more favorable to the reality you want to create. You can’t directly force people to engage in the behavior in which you want them to engage – but you can indirectly nudge them in one direction or another by manipulating the pressures that surround them.  There are two basic ways of doing this: decreasing the inhibiting pressures or increasing the promoting pressures. Either way, you’ll need to take some sort of action to accomplish these objectives. By taking that action, you’re making an intervention into the existing reality. So your task now becomes a matter of coming up with ideas for possible interventions.  To illustrate these ideas, let’s return to the example of the author’s work with Clover Health. Remember, many members of the black community were unconvinced of the health benefits of flu shots (a weak promoting pressure), as well as being concerned about their resemblance to medical experimentation (some strong inhibiting pressures).  The author and his team came up with 20 possible interventions. That’s a pretty typical number at this stage of the IDP. It’s also way too many ideas to test, so now the task was to narrow them down to a more feasible number, like five.  One way to do this is to combine as many interventions together as possible. For example, the author and his team reasoned that the black community’s skepticism and concerns about the flu shot all involved a feeling of distrust in one way or another. They knew that for many members of the community, their most trusted sources of guidance were the leaders of their churches. So the team had an idea for a possible intervention: reach out to those leaders and convince them to talk to their congregations about the benefits of the flu shot and to reassure them, thus intervening in multiple pressures at once.  Those are the sort of win-win, combinatory solutions you’re looking for at this stage of the IDP. Once you’ve identified a handful of them, you’ll be ready for the next step.  Now that you’ve come up with some possible interventions to promote your target behavior, you’re probably going to be feeling pretty eager to go out into the field and put your ideas into action.  But hold on – before you move forward, you need to hit the pause button and conduct an ethical check. After all, what you’re setting out to do is to influence people’s behavior. Now, that can be a good thing; just think of anti-smoking campaigns. But it can also be a very bad thing, like the ads that glamorized smoking in the first place. To conduct an ethical test, here’s the first question to ask: What is the behavior you’re trying to promote and does it match the goals and motivations of the population to whom you’re trying to promote it? If it doesn’t match their goals and motivations, then it would be unethical to move forward with your interventions. For example, if you were a tobacco company using advertising to convince people to smoke, you’d be trying to manipulate them into doing something that’s contrary to their paramount goal in life: staying alive.  Now, you could try to get around this problem by making the following argument: “Sure, no one wants to be unhealthy or dead – but lots of people want to look cool, and they think that smoking helps them accomplish that objective. So in this respect, the behavior does match their goals and motivations. We’re just giving people what they want.”  This brings us to our second ethical question: Do the benefits of the behavior outweigh the costs? Even if we grant that “looking cool” is a benefit, surely it’s outweighed by the cost of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease that comes with smoking, so promoting this behavior remains unethical.  If you wanted to, though, you could wiggle out of this ethical corner. Just write up a whole list of supposed benefits that come with smoking, and then cherry-pick or maybe even fund some studies that downplay the costs.  To counteract this possibility, we can add a third ethical question to the mix: Are you being transparent about your motivations and research methods? If you need to be sneaky to make the benefits look like they outweigh the costs, it’s a sign that you’re being unethical.  Let’s say you’ve done an honest ethical check and you’ve confirmed that your target behavior matches your target population’s goals and motivations, that the benefits of the behavior outweigh the costs and that you’ve been transparent in making this determination. All’s well and good; now you can move forward with your interventions, right? Well, not so fast. It’s not just your target behavior that you need to check; it’s also the interventions themselves. Remember the old caveat: the ends do not justify the means. Even if your target behavior is totally laudable, that doesn’t necessarily mean your interventions are ethical. For example, you could try to convince people to get a flu shot by sending them scare letters telling them they will die if they don’t get one, but that would be a pretty unethical intervention.  To conduct an ethical check of your possible interventions, you just need to ask the same questions about them as you did with your target behavior. For example, would an untruthful scare letter be in sync with people’s goals and motivations, and would the benefits outweigh the costs? No – people don’t want to be lied to or scared unnecessarily, and the emotional cost of the anxiety that might result from the letter could arguably outweigh the benefit of convincing more people to get flu shots.  Of course, if you wanted to, you could manipulate your appraisal of the scare letter to make it look like the benefits outweighed the costs. That’s why you also need to be transparent about your methods and motivations when conducting an ethical check of your possible interventions. The same rule of thumb applies here as the one you had with your target behavior: if you need to be devious to make the benefits look like they outweigh the costs, then it’s a sign you’re being unethical.  So there you have it; that’s the ethical check. Assuming both your target behavior and your possible interventions have passed it, you’re now ready for the last step of the IDP, where you’re finally going to start testing out your ideas.  When you reach the final step of the IDP, you enter it with a handful of possible interventions that you think might foster the behavior you want to promote. Now it’s time for the rubber to hit the road and see if they work.  But you don’t want to spin your wheels too fast here. In theory, you could take one of your possible interventions and roll it out right away on a nationwide or even international scale. But what if it doesn’t work? That’s a lot of wasted time, energy and money. Plus, what about the other four possible interventions you might have come up with? You probably don’t have the resources to try out all of them on a large scale. But if you don’t test them all, you’ll never know which one is the most effective.  To get around this problem, you need to start out much smaller, with a series of pilot studies, or pilots for short. With each pilot, you’re testing out your intervention with a very small sample size of your target population – and you’re doing that in an operationally dirty manner. That means you aren’t trying to implement the intervention in the most efficient way possible – a way that would scale-up well. Instead, you’re just trying to test the intervention with as little disruption to your organization as possible.  For example, in a fully operational, scaled-up version of your intervention, it might be much more efficient to use an automated computer system to take care of a task. But that could be a pain in the neck to develop, and it might be a lot of work for nothing if the intervention proves to be a nonstarter. So it would be better to do the job manually at this stage. Remember: you can always develop the fancy computer system later on if you discover the intervention is a winner and you want to scale it up.  The whole point of the pilots is to see if the interventions work, so the question now becomes, How do you show that? Well, if you’ve caught the drift of these blinks so far, you’ll already know the answer: look at the data. But there’s an important caveat to add to this answer, which we’ll look at in the next and final blink.  Assuming you’ve collected data for one of your pilot studies, you and your team now have some sense of whether or not the intervention you’re looking at is a promising one. Your sample size will have been pretty small, so you can’t be very certain of your results at this stage. But with at least some degree of certainty, you can now make a statement like, “this intervention seems to increase people’s engagement in our target behavior by 20 percent.”  In scientific parlance, the degree to which you’re certain about a statement like this is called your data’s p-value. Counterintuitively, the lower the value, the higher the certainty. If your p-value is 0.05, that means there’s a 5-percent chance your data are wrong and therefore a 95-percent chance they’re right.  In academia, scientists normally look for a p-value of less than 0.05 to feel enough trust in their data. But you’re designing products and services, not doing hallowed research in the ivory tower, so you can afford a greater degree of uncertainty. A p-value of less than 0.20 should do. Remember, that means there’s still an 80-percent chance your data are correct, and those aren’t bad odds to bet on in the real world.  Once you’ve finished piloting all your possible interventions and figured out which ones show promising results and pass under the 0.20 p-value hurdle, it’s time to conduct a more formal test for each of them. Here, you’re going to try out your intervention with a larger sample size to make sure the pilot data wasn’t just a fluke.  When you conduct the test, you’re also going to try implementing it in a way that’s much more operationally clean than your pilot. For example, remember that automated computer system you eschewed at the pilot stage? Well, now would be a good time to start developing it – because you want to test not just the effects of the intervention, but also the overall feasibility of it. Even if the results are fantastic, they might be too costly or cumbersome to achieve. You want to figure that out now before you decide you want to scale up and fully implement your intervention.  That decision is the final step of the IDP. To make it, you need to engage in some good ol’ fashioned cost-benefit analysis. Looking at the data for the possible interventions, which ones have positive results – and out of those interventions, which are most worth pursuing, once you factor in the costs? Those are the ones you want to scale and implement.  If all goes well, the rest will be history.  The key message in these blinks: The Intervention Design Process is a step-by-step approach to the design of products and services that begins with the behavior you want to promote and then works backward to make that behavior a reality. First, achieve an insight into the gap between the way you want people to behave (your ideal world) and the way they’re actually behaving (the real world). Then write up a behavioral statement formally describing that ideal world. Next, map out the promoting and inhibiting pressures that are preventing that world from coming into being. Then you can start thinking about possible interventions to modify those pressures. Once those interventions have passed an ethical check, you can start trialing them. By the end of this process, you will find one or more interventions that can be scaled up and implemented.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Schroeder","summary":"Whether it’s about a military offensive, a religious conflict, or American interests at risk, we hear about the Middle East almost every day in the news. But the media focuses on the Arab Spring’s fallout, and rarely touches on the other revolution spreading across the area. This revolution is not like the Arab Spring. It’s bloodless, present all over the world, and having real impacts on every Arab country, every day. It’s a technological, entrepreneurial revolution, and it’s only just beginning. These blinks will show you why Google, Intel, Paypal, and many other companies are flocking to the Middle East, trying to make as many partnerships and investments as they can. They’ll explain why it’s only a matter of time before the Middle East overtakes Silicon Valley as the center of the tech world. After reading these blinks you’ll have learned why the violence we see on the news doesn’t affect the economic revolution in the Middle East; about a “marriage site” inspired by internet dating sites; and why women are playing such an important role in this tech revolution. Today, innovation is happening all over the world, and economic success is appearing in even the most unlikely places. Consider the fact that Nokia was created in Finland – a country mostly known for its wood products. Similarly, M-Pesa, a company that represents almost half of all mobile payments globally, was created in Kenya. So why is so much innovation happening outside the bounds of Silicon Valley? Well, it’s partly because of the rapid rise of cheap, easy access to software and information. And today, that innovation is now also happening in the Middle East, with the emergence of a new generation of entrepreneurs. And major global private equity firms, investors and tech companies are taking notice. Google, Intel, Cisco, Yahoo!, LinkedIn and PayPal have all made significant investments in the Middle East, despite political instability. Google, for example, has recently opened an office in Cairo. So what’s behind the Middle East’s entrepreneurial rise? Well, there are three main factors. First, technology offers an irreversible level of transparency, connectivity and inexpensive access to capital and markets. The rising generation of entrepreneurs has never known a world before tech, and it’s still a young market overall, with over 100 million people under the age of 15. The second factor behind the Middle East’s rise in innovation is that today’s investors are comfortable with political risk. The impressive economic growth of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) has shown the world that political instability needn’t deter investment. And there’s one more factor supporting the Middle East’s entrepreneurial rise: Although changing market dynamics and economic growth were set in motion before the uprisings, it was the uprisings themselves that persuaded younger generations that the world was ripe for change. What once seemed impossible now seems attainable, and they feel that they can make a difference in their countries and in their economies. Although business and entrepreneurship have always existed in the Middle East, in the past, it required something called wasta. Wasta refers to cronyism; it’s all about acting favorably toward someone without taking their qualifications into account. And in a wasta economy, who you know determines your business success. For example, Mohammed al-Ajlouni, a Jordanian “fixer” for major US news organizations, once said that you needed the approval of the Egyptian prime minister’s son to do any business in Egypt. Well, today, that’s no longer really the case, as Arabs are learning to embrace the promise of entrepreneurial success without wasta. In the past, your friends wouldn’t have hesitated to criticize your new business idea and your parents would have forbidden you to quit your “safe” job to launch your own company – but that’s all changing. And according to Samih Toukan, the creator of one of the first all-Arabic internet portals, Maktoob, the Middle East has always had ideas and creativity. But up until now, it’s been missing a widespread cultural acceptance of tech entrepreneurship. And yet, Maktoob itself has played a big role in changing that. In 2008, it was sold to Yahoo! for $175 million – more than any other technological company in the Arab world. And remarkably, Toukan, the founder, didn’t rely on wasta at all while he was building his business – and yet he still became successful. His story gave other young start-ups a sense of hope: People started to believe that an entrepreneurial ecosystem could thrive in spite of wasta. Toukan also provided crucial support to other young entrepreneurs, by offering office space and providing financial, strategic and legal support. And in fact, some of Maktoob’s own employees went on to start their own wasta-free companies. As more and more of these businesses thrive, they encourage others to join them. In addition to the death of wasta, there are other key factors changing the entrepreneurial game in the Middle East. What are they? Well, read on to find out! In the Middle East, more than 83 percent of the population goes online every single day. So how does the Arab world’s appetite for the internet impact this generation? Well, the current generation of Middle Eastern entrepreneurs can be divided into three categories: Of these three groups, the problem solvers are the ones tackling the Middle East’s educational infrastructure, which badly needs help. Today, the whole region lags behind the rest of the world in secondary and higher education enrollment. And despite gains in certain areas – like gender parity – teachers are underpaid and rote memorization is the dominant pedagogical method. However, two recent developments suggest that the situation may change: Essentially, technology is allowing Arabs to learn through the internet and to advance their newfound knowledge across society. There’s no question that men dominate the tech scene, and yet, female entrepreneurs are becoming increasingly prevalent. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Middle East. If you have any doubts, just ask Hala Fadel, who runs the Middle East MIT Business Plan Competition: She sees the number of female applicants increase each year. And in 2012, 48 percent of the competing teams included women. Silicon Valley has yet to achieve similar gender parity. Why have Arab women been able to thrive in the tech space? Well, Alyse Nelson, the CEO of Vital Voices, says that since women can now create change from their Twitter account, they can reach spaces which were once closed off to them. This turned out to be the case for online activist Manal al-Sharif, who took on the restriction against female drivers in Saudi Arabia. Not only did she get behind the steering wheel, she also uploaded a video of herself driving on YouTube, where it instantly went viral. These kinds of social network campaigns give women a platform they never had before. So what’s it like for female entrepreneurs in the Middle East? Well, women thrive when they focus on gender-specific concepts. So says Rana Ayoubi, creator of the multiplatform content production house, Rubicon Group Holding. Aroubi acknowledges that since men and women are different, female entrepreneurs should choose to cater to female concerns. For example, Yasmine el Mehairy and Zeinab Samir created Supermama for young, internet-savvy mothers struggling to find Arabic-language information about how to negotiate a work/life balance. In fact, this is the key reason the internet has created so many opportunities for women: It allows women to find better ways to juggle the many facets of their lives – such as wife, mother and daughter – while starting their own business. For example, today’s technology allows female workers and entrepreneurs to adopt more flexible working hours, possibly even working from home. At the same time, the entry costs associated with launching an internet property are low. With many different cultural, technological and economic factors at play, the Arab world’s tech scene is an ecosystem like any other. And great entrepreneurial ecosystems are made up of three components: These three groups face distinct challenges in building start-up economies in the Middle East (dealing with, for example, inconsistent application of the law), but they play a crucial role in propagating fresh ideas across the region. But in the Middle East, that’s not all there is to it. There’s one more key factor which shapes the entrepreneurial landscape: Religion. And although Islam and technology have points of convergence – many Islamic financial principles, for example, coincide with libertarian ideas about private property – start-ups are changing the nature of religion in the Islamic world. To this end, some founders have implemented a “no religion, no politics” rule for their start-ups; others have changed their perspective on the role their religion can and should play in their business dealings. For example, one Salafist entrepreneur, who might otherwise have never spoken with the author, now does so – despite the fact that he believes the author is going to hell. That’s because entrepreneurship is all about networking, and someone who is unwilling to speak to others has no chance of success. Other founders take a different approach to their start-ups, seeing them as an extension of their personal values. This is the case for Kuwait-born Naif al-Mutawa, who created a TV cartoon series, The 99, featuring 99 superheroes representing the 99 core values of Islam. Since he doesn’t include overt religiosity in his stories, children from all backgrounds can watch and enjoy the series. There’s so much energy in the Middle East that nothing can prevent the region from exploding with entrepreneurial potential. That’s because the same tug-of-war that exists in most societies is more pronounced in the Middle East. This tug-of-war comes down to two narratives: Although these two narratives coexist in most societies, according to investor Arif Naqvi, the West sees only one side of this dynamic in the Arab world. That’s because the West is ignoring three key issues: And ultimately, if technology can take hold in unstable regions, it can take hold anywhere. Of course, violence and instability are realities in the Middle East, but here’s another reality: There’s a growing group of curious, change-minded, tech-savvy youths. And the fact is, even politically active people still have to live normally, see their families and hold a job. To that end, Palestinian Saed Nashef is the perfect example of how even people in war-torn places can get on the tech bandwagon. Together with Israeli-New Yorker venture capitalist Yadin Kaufmann, Nashef co-founded Sadara Ventures, a $30 million venture capital fund based in the West Bank. He says that technology is the right place to focus because it’s less susceptible to geopolitical changes, and is clearly where the next wave of economic growth will be centered. The key message in this book: The internet is changing the world, and perhaps nowhere more so than in the Middle East. Through technological advancements and the opportunities that come with it, the region is developing culturally, socially and politically. And as entrepreneurs continue to pop up in the region, the Middle East is transforming into a center of economic opportunity.

Or maybe you already had one, but failed to follow through with it. Either way, you’re hoping to build a successful business around your new idea.  But in the seemingly open universe of creativity, competition is fierce. Here, everyone fights tooth and nail to turn their innovative ideas into a reality. So, how can you avoid getting swallowed up by the hordes of start-up predators? You can start by taking advice from one of the heavyweights in the field. In these blinks, the author shares his personal story of building his own successful company, Zendesk. From tentative ideas to a thriving US-based business, the author invites you along his journey of ups and downs, offering plenty of tips on how to get your own ideas off the ground. In these blinks, you’ll discover which investors are good investors; why working on your team-building skills is so important; and why the author had to relocate from Copenhagen to the United States. When Columbus returned from his journey to the Americas, some of his peers insisted that any Spaniard could have “discovered” the new continent – all they had to do was sail westward. To prove them wrong, Columbus placed a hard-boiled egg on the table in front of them and challenged them to make it stand on its own. When they failed, he took the egg and gently tapped it against the table, creating a small, flat base that it could stand on.  Columbus’s point was that it’s easy to do something once you know how – when you don’t, you have to take a risk. Start-ups work the same way. Founding a start-up is all about using your entrepreneurial spirit to try new things. The author worked on a number of projects before developing Zendesk, a software tool that enables companies to provide better customer support to their clients.  His first venture created 3-D illusions based on 2-D patterns, using a piece of software. He ran his business alone: customers sent him orders and he sent the disks out himself. The author’s next product was a tool for producing websites, and it gave him his first taste of failure when it collapsed during the dot-com crash of 2001. When founding a start-up you also have to realize that sometimes the best ideas are not always the most interesting.  At first, few people had faith in the idea for Zendesk, as they weren’t inspired by the thought of a company focused on providing better help desks and customer support. Alex Aghassipour, who ended up becoming one of the company’s core members, initially thought Zendesk sounded incredibly boring. Like Zendesk, a lot of important start-up ideas might seem unexciting at first, but they can become very attractive if they’re executed well. Take the company Dropbox, for instance. File-sharing isn’t the most exciting service to provide, but Dropbox has made this tedious task easy, interesting and even socially engaging.  If you’re a kid on the playground looking for money, the school bully probably wouldn’t be the best person to go to. He might give you the money, but if so, he’ll ask for it back with interest. The start-up scene isn’t all that different.  Not all investors are good investors. Unfortunately, start-ups don’t usually have a lot of options when it comes to getting their initial investments; when you first start out, you’ll be exposed to a lot of investors who are only concerned with themselves. The best thing for your start-up is to turn them down and hold out for a bit longer.  The author dealt with this same problem when he founded Zendesk. The first angel investor who was interested in his project kept asking for unreasonable amounts of information and materials from the company. The author eventually realized this was a tactic to put the young team under pressure. The investor knew they needed money urgently and was trying to gain more negotiating power by delaying the investment decision and asking for more paperwork. So where should you look for investment? Sometimes your friends and family members make the best investors. When Zendesk started to run out of money, the founders asked their friends and families to invest, and word of the project spread from the founders’ colleagues to their colleague’s bosses. One person invested as much as $30,000! Asking your friends and family for money isn’t easy, however. The author’s advice is to have low expectations, refrain from giving investors any influence and be prepared to disappoint people – you might even lose some friends.  And even if you’ve collected enough funding already, don’t turn down a good investor. After the Zendesk founders had raised enough funds for their business, they were contacted by another angel investor. Instead of turning him down, they accepted his investment too, which allowed them to grow even more ambitiously. What’s more, they gained a new, experienced financial partner.  Did you play team sports in gym class as a kid? Which team member was the most fun: the person who wanted everyone to participate and have a good time, or the star player who scored all the goals but did it alone? Of course, it’s the former. Start-ups work in a similar way. People with good team-building skills often make the best entrepreneurs; however, it’s not always easy to keep the team on track.  In Zendesk’s early days, the three founding members had a hard time focusing on the project, as they were all working without pay. They had little money with which to support their families and it took a lot of commitment to stay with Zendesk instead of giving up and moving to something safer.  The author kept the team together by offering to pay one of the founders a small salary, even though the company didn’t have any money. He realized that keeping the team together was more important than breaking apart because of a lack of funds.  But it can also be hard to get a team to agree, especially when they are in fragile situations. Zendesk ran into trouble when the founders had to acquire some major funding and started selling the company shares. This meant the founding members would become a minority among stakeholders – a hard reality to face. The new board members were even able to fire the founders if they wanted to. The author lost his temper once during this stressful time, and at one point when he wasn’t able to persuade his two partners of the switch, he yelled at them during a meeting and stormed out. The next few days were awkward, but things eventually settled down. The team members came to accept that getting major funding was the only way forward.  Outsiders are often annoyed by American aphorisms like “fake it till you make it” or “winners never quit.” American optimism might seem unrealistic at first glance, but it’s actually helped foster a great start-up environment. You can’t succeed with a start-up if you don’t have the confidence to take risks! In fact, all major internet-related businesses (and the internet itself!) originated in the United States. Denmark, for instance, only had one internet provider and very expensive dial-up in the early ‘90s, but American cities like San Francisco embraced the internet early on and were enthusiastic about it right away.  San Franciscans were using the internet to communicate, advertise and order food long before most Europeans even had e-mail.  Why? Because a lot of great innovators and big investors congregate in the United States. It was thus clearly the best place for the Zendesk team to find their first investors because the American start-up scene was thriving.  The author attended a TechCrunch summer party in San Francisco after he launched Zendesk, and nearly all the guests there had heard about or were using his product! They were all working on their own start-up projects too. The author felt much more at home in that community than he did in the much more conservative start-up scene in Copenhagen.  So the Zendesk founders weren’t surprised at all when their first major deal required the company to relocate to the United States. When the team accepted the venture capital funding they had been so reluctant about, the offer came with a condition: Zendesk had to move to Boston, where the venture capital firm was based. Though Boston wasn’t their ideal destination, the author convinced the team to make the move.  Entrepreneurs’ lives often revolve around their work. They might work over 12 hours a day and when they’re not working, they’re thinking about work. Naturally, this can be challenging for their families for a number of reasons.  For one, it’s hard to take financial risks when you have a family. The author struggled with this when he accumulated a lot of credit card debt and used up his retirement money while building Zendesk. He also took out a $50,000 loan that he was personally liable for. At one point, he was two weeks away from going bankrupt if he didn’t get more funding.  The author didn’t want his partner, Mie, to be stressed about these problems, so he didn’t fully explain them to her.  The author’s work also created stress for his family when they had to move from Denmark to Boston. This was made even worse when they arrived in Boston that summer only to discover that their air conditioner had broken down. The young family had to walk around the house in their underwear for two months.  The stress for the family didn’t end with that move. In fact, not that long after, the family had to move from Boston to San Francisco! The family moved west when Zendesk got a new, $6 million investment deal with a company called Benchmark, which is based in San Francisco. It was a hectic time for the family, as they had to move on pretty short notice.  On one of their first nights in the new place, the children somehow managed to lock everyone out of the bathroom. Mie was sick at the time and the author had to spend two hours struggling to get the door open before he rushed off to work. When setting up a start-up of your own, hectic episodes like these are likely to become a fact of life. If you’ve ever had to sort through a pile of 80 CVs, all written in the same cryptic language, you know that picking the right candidate can be difficult. And sometimes interviews just make the situation worse: the interviewees get nervous and speak too little or too much.  Now imagine if you had to go through all this in a foreign country! That’s exactly what the Zendesk founders had to do after they moved to Boston, and they learned some pretty important lessons in the process. The Zendesk team found that Americans and Danes present themselves very differently in job interviews. The author and his team were used to the Nordic approach: humility is highly valued in Scandinavia and you aren’t supposed to suggest you’re better than anyone else.  So the Zendesk team was initially thrown off by their applicants’ displays of American overconfidence and bravado. They believed all the applicants were amazing because they thought their bragging was actually modesty and humility. The author and his colleagues quickly realized that they needed to adapt their recruitment process, and they came up with some great new strategies.  For example, the head of human resources, who was a former army man, would take potential employees to a nearby café. On the way over, he’d walk too quickly to see if they could keep up, and he paid careful attention to how they handled the bill. He would also use foul language throughout the interview to see if they deal with it.  Zendesk recruiters also didn’t ask the applicants about their educational backgrounds. Instead, they asked them about their travel experiences and how they confronted difficult life situations.  Launching a start-up is like jumping from a ten-meter diving board: you might land a perfect dive, or do a painful belly flop. And you’ll definitely have to take several dives before you really figure out what you’re doing.  For example, when Zendesk was starting out, the author had a few false starts while looking for funding. At one point, when the company was still based in Denmark, he flew to the United States to meet a partner in a venture capitalist firm. But his timing could hardly have been worse: the 2008 financial crisis was underway, mortgages were no longer available and big banks like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch had collapsed.  The venture capitalist firm and their partners had a big argument over whether or not to invest in the author’s project; in the end, they decided not to.  Another common rookie mistake is to overlook important details in your early years. The Zendesk team learned this when they hired Amanda Kleha, a former marketing manager at Google.  Kleha arrived on her first day without a computer, assuming the company would provide one. When she left to go home and get her own, she made a dry remark that she guessed she had joined a start-up. This made the author realize that they needed to develop a more comprehensive onboarding strategy.  The worst mistakes you can make, however, are those that affect your customers. The author learned this when Zendesk planned a price increase and their customers turned against them. Many of the customers’ comments went viral, jeopardizing the company’s reputation. He realized the team had taken Zendesk’s customer relationship for granted. They informed the customers about the price change but failed to explain the reason for it, so the customers felt they were paying for something they hadn’t agreed to. Zendesk made an official apology and withdrew the decision to raise their prices. The key message in this book: Building a start-up is all about developing new ideas and taking risks, so there’s no one formula for success. Get a strong team together, watch out for disingenuous investors, be prepared to make mistakes and adapt your strategy when things don’t go as planned. You’ll hit roadblocks you can’t prepare for, just like the author did when he built up Zendesk. But like the author, you can also grow your start-up if you stay flexible and committed to your vision.

Does this sound like a dream come true? These blinks are the online marketing equivalent of that fantasy symposium. They’ll enable you to launch an effective campaign to promote your product, your writing or even that film. The very best of their field will share their strategies with you step by step, whether you’re talking about video marketing, working with social media or creating a thriving blog. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to make it rain; how to outshine Kim Kardashian; and why size really matters when it comes to generating clicks (but not the way you might expect). Do you feel you’ve got a special connection to the weather? Know how to make it rain when you feel like it? If that sounds a bit ridiculous to you, well, that’s because it is! But substitute rain for media and it’s a whole different story. It’s time to stop playing the plain old marketer and start making waves as a media rainmaker. A media rainmaker brings in the business by moving beyond traditional marketing methods toward innovative, breakthrough strategies. Marketing and media are two different things, after all. Marketing is what we all run away from, wary that someone out there is trying to sell us their product. Media, on the other hand, draws us in. People get to know your business through media because they are genuinely interested. But how do you get customers to flock to your business of their own accord? By building a personal media brand. This approach will give you the edge over your competitors. Take Kim Kardashian, for example. Why exactly is she famous again? Most of us barely know anymore. But what we do know is that she was able to build a personal empire through her brilliant use of media. But what if you’re not famous? Well, you can still build a winning personal media brand. You must show your audience that you’re the expert on a given topic. People will turn to you as their most valuable source of information and content. For a personal media brand that’s a little different than Kim Kardashian’s, let’s look at the Digital Photography School. It’s a well-known online educational platform for any aspiring photographer looking for loads of top quality information for free. But wait – shouldn’t it be pretty unprofitable for founder Darren Rowse to give all his advice away? Not so. It’s precisely because of the great content provided by Rowse that his readers are willing to buy his e-books, which is how he generates his profits. Between Digital Photography School and his other popular site, ProBlogger Blog Tips, Darren Rowse has established himself as a go-to source for online advice and his very own personal media brand. Everyone’s saying it. And guess what? It’s true. Social media is king! Nearly everyone has an account somewhere, whether it’s on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Pinterest. Statistics show that 73 percent of all internet users also use social media. That’s a lot of prospective customers! So how can you reach out to them? By arming yourself with a social media strategy. This is an outline of why and how you’ll use social media to achieve your business objectives. This might sound simple, but it’s a crucial step. Putting content onto the internet without a social media strategy is like getting into a car without deciding on a destination. You won’t know if you’ve arrived if you had no idea where you wanted to go in the first place! So, social media strategies are important. But how do you build one? It’s not too complicated. It comes down to selecting your sites, turning them into a platform and creating a plan for content generation and content promotion.  Consider the demographic of your target audience when selecting your social media site. If your customer is likely to be a female between the ages of 30 and 45, where would she be online and looking for inspiration? Probably on Pinterest and Facebook. But if it’s a younger millennial you’re after, then Instagram and Tumblr would be your best bets. While each of the sites you select should serve their own purpose, it’s important to ensure that they are all cohesive and aligned toward the common goals set out in your social media strategy. This is something to keep in mind as you develop your content generation plan, where you decide what kind of content you’ll create, and how often. Alongside this, you’ll need to create a content promotion plan too, considering how you can get your content to more viewers. For example, would you like to pay for ads that link to your content, or try and get your content shared in other ways? Either way, you’ll need to ensure that your customers and readers find you. More on this in the next blink! These days, the internet is huge. With so many companies out there competing for the customer’s attention, how can you, a mere blogger, make your mark? Short-form microcontent is the answer. Short-form microcontent may take the form of photos, memes, GIFS or text images, which are pictures with short pieces of writing like titles or quotations superimposed on top. These can be deployed on social media networks to catch the attention of your readers and encourage them to seek out your long-form content too. You could keep it as simple as posting an image on Facebook with a link to your blog. Images play a key role in driving traffic to your site. It’s proven that articles with images get as many as 94 percent more views than those without. Why? Well, it’s often because people view these articles as attractive enough to share them with their friends and followers. Of course, you can’t just start sharing images left, right and center. As we learned in the last blink, you’ll need to know your audience in order to reach them in the right places. Google+, Facebook Business Page, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter are typical platforms used for sharing short-form microcontent. But it may be that your audience is found elsewhere, on certain forums or smaller social networks. Check out who is using what, work out what they want and adapt your microcontent to suit. We go nuts for video! YouTube is the second-most popular search engine; using video will increase your chance of featuring on page one of a Google search by 53 times and it’s predicted that video will account for 90 percent of web traffic in 2017. It’s clear that video is a brilliant tool for your company’s future. But beware – not just any video will do. Before you start planning your viral videos, build a video marketing strategy. This outlines your goals, your viewers, and how you’ll get your videos to them. With a clear and calculated strategy, you won’t need expensive cameras or stunning lighting. Take wellness coach Tania, for example. Her business is selling workshops online. Knowing that her audience cares more about quality content than professional studio production, Tania makes videos on her computer to post to YouTube and her blog. She has successfully boosted her visibility and following this way. Once you’ve got your video marketing strategy in place, how do you go about making the videos themselves? By applying the four Ps of video marketing: Purpose, Premise, Platform and Promotion. Purpose, of course, refers to your goals. Whether you want to boost visibility of your product or direct traffic toward your long-form content, ensure your purpose is specifically defined! Next, work out your premise. How are you planning to reach your viewers? How do you want them to respond to your videos, and what devices can you use to trigger that sort of response? Equally important to define is your platform. This entails the style of your video, be it natural, professional, edgy, with an on-camera or off-camera feel. Finally, you’ll need to consider where and how you’ll promote your videos. A thoughtful video marketing strategy will allow you to produce videos that attract the right viewers, stay in their minds and help you get your business out there. So, you want a brilliant blog. One where new posts are eagerly awaited, and not just by members of your immediate family. If you want a strong following and an ever-growing blog, there are a few tips that’ll help you get there. The first step is research. The internet, as you well know, is already saturated with blogs. If you want yours to stand out and be worth reading, find ways to set yourself apart from competitors. As they say, keep your friends close, and your enemies closer! Get to know your competitors. What do they write about? Do they do it well? What is their content missing? Give your customers what your competitors don’t provide and you’ll have the edge. Next, ensure you have solid foundations for your blog. This means a strong platform and content strategy. A reliable and safe platform such as Wordpress, which already has a large community built around it, provides a great foundation for your blog. Your content strategy is the backbone of your blog, and answers those key questions of what, when, and for whom you’re producing content. Finally, remember to invest time in your network. Strong bonds with influential people can help your blog win more valuable followers. If you haven’t really got a professional network to begin with, don’t fret! You can start building one anytime, by finding people who might want your help. If they appreciate your expertise, they might offer to help you in return. One great way to create ties with influential figures in your industry is by offering them an interview for your blog. Most influencers love to give interviews, which gives you a great opportunity to get to know them. The key message in this book: With a clever, calculated strategy, anyone can create a successful online marketing campaign. Microcontent and video marketing are essential tools for building a follower base that will turn you and your business into a valued resource that customers trust.

Without Airbnb, this probably would not have become such a common occurrence. For those unfamiliar with Airbnb, it’s a platform that helps people rent out spare rooms or whole apartments to tourists or other people visiting a city. Though a relatively new company, investors estimated its revenue for 2016 at $1.6 billion, and predict $2.8 billion for 2017, climbing to $8.5 billion by 2020. So how did this company come about and how did it become a dominant player in the hospitality business? These blinks will tell you the story. You will also find out how cereal helped Airbnb in a big way; why Airbnb spent six months finding their first employee; and how Airbnb has tackled concerns about safety, discrimination and legality. In October of 2007, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, both graduates of the Rhode Island School of Design, were trying to establish themselves in San Francisco. Despite their design degrees, the two young men were struggling to pay their monthly rent of $1,150, and were faced with a simple choice: make more money or go back to their hometowns. While studying, the pair had learned that any problem can be overcome through creative thinking and, after some brainstorming, resolved to focus their energy on the upcoming conference of the Industrial Designers Society of America in San Francisco. They knew there would be a shortage of hotel rooms during the event and decided to rent out some space in their apartment where people could sleep on one of their three air mattresses for $80 a night. They called the venture AirBed & Breakfast and promoted it on design blogs with ads that focused on their apartment’s features, like its “design library.” In just a few days, three customers had made bookings. From there, after receiving positive feedback, they started thinking about how to act as middlemen, using other people’s apartments to make money. Their first venues for this project were the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas and the 2008 Democratic National Convention, or DNC, in Denver, Colorado. For both events, the designers wanted to bring in an engineer who would add a user-friendly interface to the operation, as well as the skills of a groundbreaking coder. For this role, the choice was Nathan Blecharczyk, with whom Gebbia had already worked. But despite their crack squad, the trio had trouble getting people to open their homes up to strangers. They needed an in and, in the case of the DNC, decided to take out ads on small local blogs. Amazingly, this move resulted in the quirky little service attracting press attention, with great results. In fact, after the New York Times ran an article on it, some 800 people signed up as hosts, resulting in 80 successful bookings. The trio had experienced what looked like success as a result of their work around the DNC. But following the event, their website was getting no traffic. They were starting to get desperate. Since they were technically offering a bed and breakfast service, they came up with the funny idea to serve Obama O’s and Cap’n McCain cereals. They simply reboxed cheap cereal and earned nearly $30,000 selling their new products as collectors’ items. But more importantly, they got the attention of Paul Graham, a tech billionaire and founder of Y Combinator, a popular launchpad for Silicon Valley start-ups. While Graham didn’t like the idea of AirBed & Breakfast, after hearing about the cereal, he appreciated the tenacity of the team and gave them a three-month mentoring period. Graham helped the trio realize that they should spend time in New York City, where the majority of their limited user base lived. After temporarily relocating to the city, Chesky and Gebbia began working to improve the photographs used by hosts, while Blecharczyk fine tuned the technical side of things. During this period, the team started getting creative with their business model. For instance, users who made inquiries about renting entire apartments convinced Chesky and Gebbia that they would have more widespread appeal if they dropped the air mattress and breakfast requirements. As a result, AirBed & Breakfast became Airbnb. It was also during these early days that Chesky and Gebbia spent much time out in the field, organizing host meetups and showing people how they could make money by renting out their apartments. Their new ideas were panning out and they were soon bringing in $1,000 a week in revenue. This success grabbed the attention of Greg McAdoo at the investment firm Sequoia. He had previously invested in Google and Apple, and was well aware that the vacation rental business was worth a whopping $40 billion. With a $585,000 investment from Sequoia, Airbnb rapidly found itself valued at $2.4 million, propelled by the renewed confidence of McAdoo’s faith in their idea. So, a couple of guys renting three blow-up mattresses in their San Francisco apartment had turned into thousands of people renting out their living spaces all over the United States. Airbnb had blossomed as an adventurous, offbeat, affordable alternative to traditional accommodation, and was especially attractive for millennials. To maintain this success, Chesky, who stepped into the role of CEO, made it Airbnb’s mission to put a unique human exchange at the heart of everything the company did. For instance, the company required that each apartment have a kind and personal touch to it, whether it be a homemade welcome packet or a host being on site to greet their guest. Fundamentally, Chesky believed that such a human connection was key to Airbnb’s culture. That’s why the company’s core values include a passion for humanity, along with a commitment to being hardworking, helpful and playful. To keep such values intact, hiring people who embodied them, as well as the company’s overall mission, took on fundamental importance – and this was no easy task. In fact, hiring the first employee took a full six months, as Chesky believed this first hire would determine the company’s DNA. He believed that once they secured their first recruit, other like-minded people would come on board. This magic moment happened in the Summer of 2009, when Nick Grandy joined the founders’ team as the first hired engineer. Getting hosts on board with Airbnb’s values was an easier task. The people opening up their homes to paying guests were generally eager to take part in the company’s mission and happily contributed to its growth. This was another vital factor, since there would be no Airbnb without hosts opening their homes, and this would never happen without trust between hosts and travelers. At the heart of this exchange was Airbnb’s motto, Belong Anywhere. Hosts were expected to go above and beyond to share their favorite hangouts, art galleries and nightclubs. As a result, travelers explored places they would have never found had they chosen to stay in hotels. Airbnb employs around 2,500 people, most of them in San Francisco. But what’s more impressive are the company’s millions of users worldwide. At this point, there are 3 million active Airbnb offers in 191 countries, with only 20 percent of them in North America. Beyond that, since the company’s launch, 140 million guests have checked in. And finally, even after eight years of steady growth, the company is still expanding its user base, with 1.4 million new users joining per week at the end of 2016. That being said, for this whole operation to run smoothly, a seamless user interface is essential. To make this a reality, Chesky and Gebbia followed Steve Jobs’s “three clicks away from music” rule when developing Apple products, meaning in Airbnb’s case that it should take a user only three clicks to book their accommodation. The concept is ingenious, but in the process of working out the payment procedure, customer service and reviews turned out to be a major challenge. The final product was developed over a long period, but eventually became a highly respected accomplishment among website engineers. Here’s how it works: When a customer reserves a place, they pay for it up front. Airbnb charges a service fee of 6 to 12 percent to customers and 3 percent to hosts. That part is simple enough, but the tricky part is that the rest of the money has to be put on hold, and not actually transferred until the customer is satisfied with the accommodation. Designing a mechanism for the money to be held for 24 hours and then passed onto the host was no easy feat, but Blecharczyk eventually devised a solution; he tailored PayPal into a uniquely sophisticated tool that was capable of operating seamlessly, 24 hours a day, across global markets and currencies. The majority of people operate with positive intentions, but there will always be those who don’t. So, while Airbnb takes safety very seriously, accidents do happen. For instance, in June of 2011, the San Francisco apartment of an Airbnb host named EJ was trashed by renters. On her blog, she wrote that her spirit itself had been stolen, but she loved Airbnb and, even after the accident, still believed that 97 percent of users were honest. The problem was that Airbnb’s customer service didn’t immediately respond to her email, forcing EJ to wait until the next day. However, when Airbnb did get in touch, it was to offer emotional and financial support. In the end, EJ was absolutely thrilled with the way the company handled the situation. Then, in August of the same year, Chesky publicly apologized on behalf of the company, taking full responsibility for the slow response. He raised the Host Guarantee insurance offered by Airbnb from $5,000 to $50,000 and launched a 24-hour customer service hotline. But for the company, one accident was one too many. To deal with this serious issue, they devised a sophisticated system of safety precautions. The first, and likely most effective, is the user review system introduced by the company’s founders. Airbnb also runs background checks on all its US users and, since 2013, users have been able to choose whether to host or stay with other verified ID users – those whose virtual presence has been matched to their real-life self. A third safety measure utilized by the company is its triage system, through which Airbnb assesses the level of danger and safety of all reported concerns to prioritize them. And finally, the company maintains a Trust and Safety team of 250 people who work to identify any suspicious behavior and eliminate potential risks before they materialize. The team includes data scientists who use behavioral models to determine the probability that a person will commit a crime, alongside crisis managers and victim-advocacy professionals who are trained to intervene in and deescalate conflicts. In 2011, Michael Luca, an assistant professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, began studying shared market platforms like Airbnb, Amazon and eBay. All of these sites use personal profiles and user photographs to build trust, a fact that Luca thought might result in discrimination. As it turns out, he was right – and in the case of Airbnb, that discrimination is racially motivated. Luca uncovered this in a 2014 study, showing that nonblack hosts could charge up to 12 percent more than black hosts for the same accommodation. Airbnb was quick to dismiss the results, saying that the study used old data from just one city. But in 2016, Luca’s team came out with another study, confirming rampant discrimination against guests based simply on the fact that they had common African-American names. This time around, the study garnered a lot more attention, as it was released concurrently with an NPR program telling the story of an African-American businesswoman named Quirtina Crittenden, who was repeatedly rejected by Airbnb hosts until she changed her profile picture to a landscape and her name to Tina. The Twitter hashtag she coined, #AirbnbWhileBlack, was a vehicle for others to share similar experiences, and the discrimination she encountered turned out to be a widespread phenomenon. Airbnb had to act fast and make sure that everyone felt like they belonged, but they first had to accept that the racial discrimination so present in the real world doesn’t disappear when people go online. Chesky made a public apology and admitted that the “three white guys” who founded the company failed to consider how profiles could result in discrimination. From there, Airbnb began making changes. First, they issued an Open Door policy that offers an equivalent accommodation to any user who experiences discrimination. The company also assists users who experienced past discrimination when making new bookings. Now, photographs are being taken out of the spotlight, while greater focus is being placed on user reviews. And finally, a plan is in the works to train hosts to recognize and avoid unconscious bias, in the process earning a badge on their profiles that indicates completion of such training. In many places, it’s illegal to rent out apartments on a short-term basis and, as Airbnb scaled, it came up against a number of legal issues. For instance, certain Airbnb listings violated local rental laws or building regulations. Luckily, the company was able to sign agreements with some municipalities to bring these rentals up to snuff. Such new frameworks for short-term rentals, including the right to tax them, were proposed in cities from Chicago to Paris. But the company soon faced another issue: certain cities oppose its very existence because of the disruptions they see Airbnb creating. A few of these anti-Airbnb cities are San Francisco, Berlin and Barcelona, but the toughest opposition is in New York, which is also Airbnb’s largest US market, worth $450 million annually. There, the company gets grief from elected officials, affordable housing activists and even representatives from the hotel industry. These major actors have been joined in their criticism by local residents, some of whom complain that the peace and safety of their neighborhoods is being compromised by drunk and disorderly weekend guests. As a result, in 2010, New York changed its Multiple Dwelling law, making it illegal to rent out apartments in buildings with over three units for more than 30 days without a permanent occupant present. Then, in 2013, Eric Schneiderman, Attorney General of New York State, went to battle with landlords who were using their buildings as hotels, requesting records of all of Airbnb’s transactions. Airbnb appealed the process to protect user privacy, but in the end turned over the details of 500,000 anonymized bookings. The report compiled from this data found that 94 percent of hosts had one or two apartments listed, with the remaining 6 percent being commercial hosts. That said, Airbnb has never supported corporations and is devoted to helping people pay their mortgages while adding traffic to non-touristy areas. Because of this, in the fall of 2015, Airbnb issued a Community Compact pledge, ensuring that its activities don’t negatively impact housing affordability in New York, while also adopting a One Host, One Home policy in the city. When Airbnb started out, it had a hard time overcoming the general suspicion people had about sleeping in a stranger’s home. But now, those days are long gone; the number of Airbnb users is rising every year and the company is set to become one of the biggest players in the hospitality industry. Even so, the market research firm Cowen found in a survey that, while Airbnb is pretty big, only half of those polled knew about the company. More significantly, just 10 percent of those surveyed had used Airbnb. In other words, there’s tremendous potential for the company to bring in new hosts and guests by building its brand. This is further supported by the fact that 80 percent of people who knew about Airbnb were interested in trying it and 66 percent were ready to use the service within the next year. Beyond that, foreign markets are rapidly expanding for the company. For instance, Airbnb use by Chinese travelers increased by 700 percent in 2015. In 2016, the company added 45,000 listings and 1.4 million travelers a week, while its total guest arrivals hit 160 million in February 2017. More importantly, despite the rapid growth of its primary product, Airbnb is continuing to explore new products to stay relevant. As part of this process, Chesky studied successful technology companies like Google, Amazon and Apple. In the end, he reached two conclusions: First, Airbnb needs to find a way to offer new products, like Amazon has succeeded in doing. And second, the CEO needs to be personally involved in defining such ventures. Ergo, since 2014, Chesky has been working on new products for his company with promising results. For instance, in 2016, Airbnb Open introduced Experiences, offering uniquely tailored activities curated by local experts. A good example is Willy, Elite Runner, a guide that brings travelers on a multiday trip to a high-altitude runners’ training facility in Kenya. While the tour guide idea isn’t exactly new, neither was sleeping on an air mattress! And with such a vast user base, many Airbnb customers are eager to try something different. The key message in this book: Before becoming the wildly successful apartment rental service it is today, Airbnb started as a creative solution by young college graduates who couldn’t afford their rent. Their innovative idea, born of necessity, eventually grew to become the most popular accommodation platform in history.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

A high-impact service delivered across a wide variety of specialist domains. But all consultants have a common interest: To leverage their skills, knowledge and experience to get the best for their clients. This is something that countless people, from management consultants to software developers and even travel agents do almost every day. And there’s a common set of principles that can help you to do that. After all, if you want to make it big, you’ll have to satisfy your customers, learn to fight your corner, take the views and expertise of others on board and structure interactions with clients as efficiently as possible. With more than 25 years of professional experience directing consulting engagements across the globe, Samir Parikh has distilled these principles into The Consultant’s Handbook. Packed with practical advice and engaging, real-world examples, it provides the ultimate crash course in delivering high-performance results in a competitive marketplace. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how to make a good first impression and establish your credibility with clients; when to argue your case and when to defer to your client’s own expertise; and how to structure a killer project proposal. Consultancy is a term that’s become grossly inflated in recent years. Today, it’s hard to get a handle on what it really means. So let’s start with a definition. Consultancy means using two ingredients – your expertise and experience – to help your clients realize their goals. These pillars can support a basic consulting proposition. You can see how this works by imagining an architect who’s been commissioned to design a house. The architect uses two things to fulfill his client’s brief: his architectural knowledge and his experience building similar houses. Whether you lean more heavily on expertise or experience varies from situation to situation. If the architect is fresh out of school, he won’t have much hands-on practice behind him and will emphasize the things he learned during his studies. On the other hand, someone with 20 years in the industry is likely to lean on a wealth of experience from past projects. But there’s also another aspect to consultancy – harnessing the collective efforts of your organization to act in your client’s best interests. This is especially true of bigger consultancy firms. An essential part of their brief is deploying their networks and resources as efficiently as possible to address a client’s needs. They achieve this by cultivating a knowledge-sharing culture. Databases and networking help pool information about previous cases and make it available to those who need it. Finally, there’s the question of how interests align. The consulting company’s interest may be to sell the client additional services, but this may not be what the client needs. As a consultant, it always best to act in your client’s best interests. Focusing on short-term gains will end up annoying clients and undermining their trust in you. That means jeopardizing future collaborations. Most importantly, acting in their interests preserves your consultancy firm’s credibility. That’s not as gratifying as instant profits, but it’s integral to your company’s long-term success. Say you’re the manager of a company that’s deciding which consultancy firm to hire. How would you feel if the consultants you’d invited for a preliminary meeting turned up not knowing any of the basic information about your company? Not great, right? That’s why any consulting assignment should always start with thorough preparation. Of course, getting to grips with the nitty-gritty takes time. How deep you dive into the details depends on various constraints and the nature of your first meeting. So if you’re short on time, aim to research your client’s company, their key issues and some possible solutions – call it basic preparation. That’s usually a matter of no more than two hours. Here are the things you’ll want to take into account. First off, the company’s locations and the industry and market in which it’s active. Next up: basic financial information like revenue and profits, its business units, competitors and product palette. Finally, you’ll want to read relevant press releases and learn the names of key executives. Commit that to your memory and you’ll be well-placed to follow the conversation and understand your client’s needs in your first meeting. This makes a good impression. Knowing the basics means your client will take you seriously. Turn up underprepared, by contrast, and they’ll start wondering if they’ve made a mistake. If you’re working on a bigger project, you’ll need to delve a bit deeper and conduct a more detailed preparation, meaning basic preparation plus some extras. These include strategy, aims, notable trends in the industry, company history, sales channels, more advanced financial data and customer feedback. Lastly, there’s engagement-specific preparation. That’s a way of preparing for a meeting on a specific topic. Sometimes your client will invite you to a meeting addressing one particular issue. That could be team performance or efficiency in a certain area. In those cases, your prep work will need to go beyond familiarizing yourself with the company in general – you’ll also need to be ready to deal with the issue at hand. That doesn’t just mean research, however. A great way of preparing yourself is to think of useful questions that you’ll need to ask as well as anticipating what your client might ask you. Preparation also plays an important role in the topic we’ll be addressing in the next blink: establishing credibility. Whatever field you’re offering your consulting services in, there’s one essential thing you simply cannot do without: trust. That’s why it’s so important to position yourself as a credible source of professional advice from the get-go. So how do you that? Well, start with a well-crafted personal introduction. This doesn’t mean selling yourself and your colleagues by claiming how fantastic you are. What you should be doing is providing an objective overview of your experience and what you can bring to the project. That means making distinct claims and backing them up with evidence. Lay out how many projects you’ve completed and how long you’ve been consulting. Telling it like it is makes your introduction much more tangible. It can even pay to formulate the exact words that you’re going to use beforehand so that you’re well prepared. Make sure your introduction is also relevant and concise and you’ll be onto a winner. Your client will know you’re not wasting their time and will get a good picture of how your experience and expertise fit their needs. But it’s not just yourself you’ll be introducing – it’s also your organization. You won’t be working on your client’s project alone, so it’s a good idea to introduce your team and explain how its skills are suited to the work at hand. Include references to qualified people who will support the work behind the scenes, if needed. Or simply ask your client if they have any questions about the credentials of your organization after your brief summary. Answer these questions well and you are bound to build credibility. Consultancy involves a lot of back and forth. Addressing your client’s needs and issues requires plenty of interaction. That usually comes in the form of meetings. So it’s important to make sure you’re getting the most out of meetings. The way to do that is to have a clear structure that helps you ensure the key issues are being addressed. If you don’t have that, it’s easy to end up in endless, rambling meetings in which key points end up being left out. And don’t rely on your clients to bring a well-structured approach to the discussion. It’s up to you. The first step to boosting the efficiency of your meetings is to agree on your objectives before you start. Why are you meeting and what do you want to achieve? Agree on that with your team before your client arrives and you’re bound to have a much more productive session. That brings us to team organization. You want to avoid that awkward situation when several people try to answer the client’s question at once. Delegating responsibilities before the meeting lets you head off potential communication problems. Agree on the points that you plan to emphasize as well as any discussions that you would prefer to avoid. You’ll also want someone taking notes during the meeting to make sure everyone’s on the same page once you’re done. Finally, there’s the matter of the meeting’s structure. Begin with introductions before agreeing on the context. Next comes the body – the point at which you’ll address issues and work out solutions. Conclude with a summary and a clear list of next steps. That said, be ready for the unexpected. Your client might suddenly toss a new idea or question into the mix. If you want to deal with them without losing your balance, you’ll need to be flexible. Remember, your job is to act in your client’s best interests. To do that, you need to understand what it is that they want. And that’s something that can change. So be prepared to add new issues to the agenda when a client brings them up. Say you’re in a meeting and agreeing on the context. You specify that your aim is to present your potential solutions, but the client suddenly says he’s especially interested in product development. That’s something you should make sure you address even if it wasn’t on your agenda originally. The first step to winning an assignment is successfully positioning yourself as a credible source of authority. But you shouldn’t overlook the written proposal you’ll be submitting for your consulting services either. So what should that proposal look like? Well, the key is to keep things straightforward. The proposal should tell the client what you’re planning on doing and how you’re going to go about that. Start with an executive summary. That’s basically a couple of paragraphs in which you present the condensed version of your proposal. It’s worth paying careful attention to this as it’s often the only part a client reads! Next up is the introduction. This is your chance to outline the overall structure of the proposal. Then there’s the main body. Here you’ll want to describe the problem at hand and talk about how you’re going to tackle it, the time frame, price and the expected benefits for the client. Cite your relevant credentials and references here to add meat to the bones of your proposal. Good proposals come in different shapes and sizes, but they have one thing in common: they’re realistic and precise. That’s because overly optimistic commitments and failing to define clear terms can negatively affect your project later on. When you focus on your client’s actual needs rather than trying to offer them the world, they’re much less likely to end up feeling disappointed. Take it from a Dutch consulting firm which learned that the hard way. It was commissioned by a company in the banking sector to work on a project which the latter estimated required 20 consultants. What did the consultancy do? They prepared a highly ambitious proposal for a project to be delivered by 60 people! The client wasn’t impressed. The company wanted someone to help them with a specific task, not to turn the whole operation on its head. “We asked for an apple,” they said, “you gave us a pumpkin.” Precisely defining your terms will also save you a lot of hassle in the long run. Say you’ve been hired to deliver a risk management solution. Your definition might not match your client’s. If you don’t define what you mean by risk management, there’s every chance that your client will expect you to do more work due to their broader definition. Standing your ground when you know you’re in the right is an important and admirable trait. But you also need to know when to give way and acknowledge that your clients may know things that you don’t. As you’ve already learned, your job as a consultant is to act in your client’s best interest. That includes speaking up when you think they’re making a mistake. When that happens, you’ll need to do a couple of things. First off, be confident in your own expertise and argue your case. The best way of doing that is to offer constructive criticism. That’s all about logical reasoning. In brief, there are two kinds of arguments that you can build: deductive or inductive arguments. Deductive arguments are about arriving at a conclusion by whittling away other possibilities in an analytical manner. Say your client needs a car and has three specific requirements. A deductive argument would work like this. There are five cars on the market that fulfill the first of these requirements; three of those are also within budget, but only one of them can be delivered within your desired time frame – that’s your solution. The answer was found analytically through a process of elimination. An inductive argument follows a more persuasive logic and starts with the solution. Here you’ll present your answer to a problem and explain the reasoning supporting that conclusion. Both types of arguments can be effective depending on the situation. Sometimes, you might find it useful to use both. You can use deductive arguments, for example, to show why your solution is the perfect answer to your client’s needs and then use inductive arguments to support your case. But remember, no matter how well you can argue your case, there’ll be times when you’ll need to accept that your client might just know better than you do. Your client might have a good reason to be skeptical about your proposal. After all, they know their trade and company better than anyone else. They are also in the best position to judge whether the approach that you are proposing will be embraced by the people in their organization. That means your best bet is to combine confidence with humility. It’s worth taking a step back and asking yourself why your client has rejected a particular solution before moving on to another idea. Few things influence the way people understand the world today more than the internet. That also goes for your clients. Their satisfaction doesn’t just shape your current relationships but also the way your future clients will view you. After all, reviews of your service are only ever a few clicks away. So what’s the best way of managing client satisfaction? Well, you should start applying the “50:50” rule. That means devoting half your attention to results and the other half to your client’s experience. Let’s break that down a bit, starting with results. Your first aim is to achieve results by successfully applying your skills and expertise to a problem. That’s about adopting a roadmap that guides you through the assignment and a set of tools that help you deliver the result. Taken together, that’s your methodology. Good methodology isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution – it’s about tailoring your approach to a distinctive issue. Over time, you’ll build up invaluable experience and stock your toolkit with ever more precise gadgets that’ll help you get the job done. To effectively address your client’s problem you’ll need to agree on a time frame and a budget and stick to them. Your expertise and ability to use resources efficiently are key to achieving your goal. But results are only part of the story. It’s just as important to manage the client experience. Think of the last time you flew somewhere. What would you consider if you were asked to rate your experience – there’s more to it than whether the flight arrived on time, right? Cabin service, the quality of the food, comfort and the efficiency of the luggage delivery are all important too. The same applies to your services. That’s especially true in ultra-competitive industries in which a number of companies can successfully deliver the same results. Provide your clients with a satisfying all-round experience and you’ll set yourself apart from the crowd. Take an example from Western Europe. A consultancy firm was on track with its project. Everything was going well, and the company was convinced it was going to hit its targets. The client wasn’t so sure, however, and a worried executive called the firm several times a day to ask how things were going. The calls persisted even after she’d been reassured that everything was fine. Recognizing her worries, the consultancy firm decided to send her a status report at the end of each day. That was something the client appreciated, and soon enough, the calls stopped. That’s a good example of providing great customer service. Take the time to make sure your clients are happy, and they are bound to stay loyal to your firm. Consulting teams aren’t always welcome in the offices of the companies that have hired them. It’s easy to see why. Consultants often recommend significant changes which, if implemented, can result in layoffs. Then there’s a more primal factor – people don’t like outsiders telling them what to do. That means that anticipating potential resistance and uncooperativeness is an essential part of your work as a consultant. Dealing with resistance is a tricky balancing act. Your aim shouldn’t be merely overcoming it but also acknowledging its sources. So when you come up against opposition to your plans, ask yourself why people are resisting. Take a London-based company which hired a consultancy firm to improve its accounting system. The system had been designed and implemented years before by the in-house IT department. When the consultants arrived, they were faced with a dilemma. The staff working in the IT department were highly critical of the project, continuously raising concerns and objections. Dealing with these was not only time consuming but was blocking the progress of the work. What, the consultants asked themselves, could be done to improve the ongoing relationship? They realized that the IT department took great pride in the system it had designed. Its members were anxious about what would replace it as well as the fact that it was being implemented by outsiders. The consultants arranged a meeting with the department’s head and acknowledged the value of the existing system while highlighting the reasons a new one was needed. They then reassured him that his team would be the owners of the new system and would play an important driving role in the success of the project. It was a savvy approach – soon enough the IT department was on board, and the project was able to move forward. Flexibility is another valuable technique that’ll help you head off potential problems. It’s all about meeting your clients on their own terms. If they’re extremely professional, repay them with the same level of professionalism. If they’re down to earth and friendly, you should be too! The key message in these blinks: Whether you’re working in a consultancy or simply trying to polish up your ability to advise clients, there are a couple of basics well worth committing to memory. First off, remember that your aim is to always act in your client’s best interest. To do that you’ll need to be well-prepared, flexible and tuned into their needs. Add your expertise and experience into the mix and you’ve got a winning formula that’s guaranteed to leave your clients satisfied and looking forward to the next project with you.  Actionable advice: Use the “logic tree” approach to solve problems.  Next time you find yourself confronted with a thorny problem, draw up a logic tree. That’s essentially a graph in which you try to trace an issue back to its source. Say your client’s company isn’t profitable. That’s the problem. What’s causing it? Well, it might be low revenues or high costs (or both!). Those are your branches. Now ask why revenues might be low and costs high – those are the next branches of your “tree.” Keep going and you’ll eventually find the root cause. Got feedback?

Because of this, you’ll find no shortage of publications, courses and websites from self-proclaimed “experts” who say they know the secrets to creativity. As a business leader, how do you know which advice to trust? One way to ensure you follow the correct path is to look at what the most successful leaders have done, and then do likewise. These blinks, based on a series of interviews by author Amy Wilkinson with today’s most successful innovators, give you some tried-and-true tips to push your company to its creative heights. In these blinks, you’ll discover whether you’re a sunbird, an architect or an interrogator; why Alfred Hitchcock shot the shower scene from Psycho 78 times; and how YouTube transitioned from a dating site to a video hosting site. One of the keys to becoming a great entrepreneur is to spot an opening in the marketplace. To do so, consider these three different approaches. The first approach is called the sunbird approach. Here, an entrepreneur takes a solution that has proven effective in one place and transplants it to another, often with a twist. (Just like a sunbird, a kind of hummingbird that cross-pollinates by grabbing objects in one place and dropping them somewhere else.) During a trip to Italy, Howard Schultz (today’s CEO of Starbucks) noticed how locals spent tons of time socializing in cafes, enjoying coffee and pastries and listening to opera music. At the time across the Atlantic, Americans had to go to a diner or restaurant if they wanted a cup of joe.   Schultz saw an opportunity to transplant the Italian cafe model in America, adapting it to suit the preferences of Americans. He replaced opera music with jazz and added tables and comfortable seats, so customers wouldn’t have to stand at a bar, as the Italians do, to enjoy their coffee. This model, as we now know, was a tremendous success. In just one year, Starbucks captured 30 percent of America’s premium single-serve coffee market. A second approach is the architect approach. Architects design entirely new products to address unsolved problems, an approach epitomized by Spanx founder Sara Blakely. Blakely wore pantyhose to smooth her figure, and although she liked the way stockings made her look, she hated how they were uncomfortable and often fit poorly. Blakely realized there was an opportunity to invent comfortable, figure-enhancing pantyhose. And even though she had no market experience, she went on to make Spanx a huge success. The last approach is the integrator approach. Such entrepreneurs assemble existing elements, often disparate or even opposite ones, in inventive ways to create brand new products. Luxury SUVs are a great example of an integrated idea. These cars combine a high-end, high-comfort style in an all-wheel, off-road sports vehicle. This combination of two seemingly contradictory ideas has actually been a huge success, appealing to two very different market segments. Some people dream of starting their own company, but few actually live those dreams. Too many dreamers wait for that perfect moment to launch their idea, but end up waiting forever. Don’t be an idle dreamer. Focus on where you want to go and then get to it, dealing with problems as they come your way. In doing so, you can build momentum and turn your idea into a success. Turkish immigrant Hamadi Ulakaya bought a closed-down yogurt factory from Kraft in 2005, against the advice of his family who thought he was crazy for buying an expensive factory without an established business behind him. Yet Ulakaya had a dream: to make a high-protein but low-fat, Greek-style yogurt. On the go, he learned the basics of the yogurt business and just two years later, was delivering his first small orders. By 2008, his factory was producing 15,000 cases of yogurt per week. And by 2011, that number had jumped to 1.2 million. When Ulakaya started his business, Greek-style yogurt was only 0.2 percent of the $78 billion yogurt market. By 2013, Greek-style yogurt accounted for almost half. And Ulakaya’s company had over time emerged as the market leader! To be successful, it doesn’t help to dwell on what you’ve already accomplished. Instead, you should look at what’s ahead. In 2006, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg declined Yahoo’s $1 billion acquisition offer. An average 20-something probably would have jumped at the chance to earn so much, especially from a one-off college experiment! But Zuckerberg knew that if he kept at it, he could achieve so much more with Facebook. And clearly, focusing on the future was the correct choice. Things never go as smoothly as you want them to. In business, there are always unexpected shocks and changes. Flexibility is crucial in keeping your company afloat. To tackle uncertainty, incorporate the OODA loop into your processes. OODA stands for observe, orient, decide and act. And it’s a loop, because even though there are four separate actions, the sequence itself is continuous. Once you finish the final step, you start all over again. Here’s how the OODA loop breaks down. First, you observe. Look at what’s happening around you. How are customers using your product? Second, you orient. Analyze the information you’ve gathered and formulate ideas about how to improve. Then, you decide. Form a hypothesis about how to improve your product or service. And finally, you act. Move quickly to implement your hypothesis. This brings you back to the first step: you return to observing, this time around to see how customers are using your new, improved product. Online video streaming company YouTube used this process early on. Did you know that at first, the company was actually a dating site that allowed users to rate each other’s photos and videos? But when company leaders observed user behavior, they noticed that people were far more interested in uploading any video, not just dating-related clips. With this insight, the company oriented themselves, brainstorming ideas about how to improve. Next, company executives decided to simply make YouTube open to all types of videos, with the thought that at the very least, the move would improve traffic numbers. Users quickly started posting all sorts of videos, from cats to lectures and more. To further its reach, YouTube acted quickly to make embeddable code available for MySpace users, which was then the dominant online social network. Yet YouTube quickly outgrew even MySpace and in 2006, the founders sold YouTube to Google for $1.65 billion. Behind every success there’s a list of failures. Consider that director Alfred Hitchcock shot the shower scene in his movie Psycho some 78  times to get that harrowing moment just right. This story epitomizes a crucial principle. If you want to be successful, whether in the creative arts or in business, you need to embrace failure. To do that, you need to stop thinking of failure as a negative thing. Because every failure brings you one step closer to finding out what you need to do to succeed. Adopting this sort of mind-set can be liberating, as it leaves you free to experiment endlessly – until you reach perfection. That’s exactly why the Hitchcock scene is so iconic. The legendary director spent ages experimenting, so he could get that nail-biting suspense perfect. Embracing failure is easier said than done, of course, because it requires being brutally honest with yourself and owning up to your failures. Spanx founder Sara Blakely was taught to do this from an early age. Every evening, her father would ask, “What have you failed at today?” Blakely failed at sports, singing and at taking the LSAT for law school. And as a door-to-door salesperson, she failed to make sales all the time. But she always owned up to her mistakes, which is what allowed her to improve. Being honest about your failures won’t bring you any closer to success if you don’t keep striving after each setback. And to do that, you have to believe in your vision. Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings suffered a major public backlash when the company decided to raise prices to cover the costs of its new streaming service. As a result, some 800,000 people canceled their Netflix subscriptions! Yet Hastings knew his decision was the right one. He apologized and tweaked his strategy, but kept going. And today, Netflix has bounced back as an even bigger success. The idea of a pioneering scientist or gifted artist coming up with an invention or inspiration completely independently is a thing of the past. There are no “lone geniuses.” Today, we see the development of genius as a result of a collaborative process. Consider that from 2004 to 2013, seven out of ten Nobel Prizes in chemistry were awarded to teams of two or three scientists. But teams aren’t just good for geniuses, they’re good for all of us. Having a diverse range of skills means that a team has more resources from which to draw when encountering problems. The famous Bletchley Park code-breaking group, assembled to crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II, was made up of a number of specialists. Allied forces collected British, American, Polish, Australian and other experts with diverse skills to work together. Language experts, military strategists, mathematicians, engineers, cryptographers, historians, philosophers, classicists – even crossword puzzle experts – eventually deciphered Nazi Germany’s encrypted war codes. Teams also give creatives the chance to bounce ideas off each other, offer advice and critique each other’s work. This all leads to a better and more complete final product. What’s more, once you’ve established an environment of mutual help, you’ll find that generosity is contagious. When people start helping each other, they’ll keep helping each other! Professional social network LinkedIn is based on this principle of interconnectivity and mutual trust. Co-founder Reid Hoffman believes that when you’re focused on a small task that benefits others, people will be eager to help you in return. It works like a chain, in that help and assistance move through the whole network, lifting everyone up. The key message in this book: Successful entrepreneurs identify gaps in a marketplace and create new solutions to fill those gaps. The process requires being radically forward-looking and eagerly embracing failure. It’s also crucial to network wisely and practice generosity. Actionable advice: Seek out people who aren’t like you.  When building a team, it’s important to find the right balance to fully capitalize upon the potential of networking minds. To that end, find people with skills and a personality dissimilar to your own. It might feel uncomfortable from the start, but discomfort serves to disrupt cohesion and drives creators to move beyond routine, superficial thinking.

The likes of Twitter and Facebook have transformed the way we communicate and collaborate with others, by allowing us to reach more people faster and more efficiently than ever before. One consequence of this is that we find ourselves overwhelmed with new information. Consider that each day millions of people log in to Facebook, posting new status updates, comments and photographs for others to see. Meanwhile, every single minute, twenty hours of video are uploaded to YouTube, while every second, hundreds of tweets are sent out to a global audience. What’s more, this hectic pace is only likely to speed up in the future. What does this deluge of information mean? Simply, if you want to harness the power of social media to create a social impact – say to campaign for your favorite presidential candidate – you need to craft your messages carefully, or else you’ll be just another drop in the ocean. It’s not that people don’t care about what you’re saying, it’s just that attracting people’s attention is extremely difficult today! So what’s the right social media strategy? These blinks will show how you can leverage the social media to your advantage to create social change. In nature, the dragonfly is the only insect that can deftly and quickly maneuver in any direction in mid-air. It achieves this feat by using all of its four wings beautifully in concert. Similarly, if you want to enact social change through social media, there are four “wings” that can produce astounding results, but only if used in concert as meticulously as the dragonfly’s wings. To illustrate the point, let’s examine how these four wings are used by Samasource, a Kenyan charity organization that finds digital work for unemployed women and youths in impoverished countries. First, there is the so-called Focus wing: you must identify a simple concrete goal that you want to motivate others to achieve. For example, Samasource’s focus is simply to provide women, youths and refugees with dignified work so they can earn a living. Second, there’s the Grab Attention wing: if you want to reach people, you first need to get their attention. In its communications, Samasource emphasizes that unemployment can lead to social ills, such as gangs and terrorism – definite attention-grabbers! Third, there’s the Engage wing: if you want your audience to take action on behalf of your cause, you need to make them care about it by creating a personal connection to them. Samasource does this by sharing personal stories about the people it helps, but also about the donors who provide work for them. Finally, there’s the Take Action wing: you must enable and empower others to actually take action to further your cause. Here, Samasource offers three levels of action, the choice of which depends on the donor’s resources. The most desirable action would be for the donor to outsource work to Samasource. After that comes donating money. And, finally, the most basic supporting action is to promote the organization. This range of options helps and encourages all kinds of supporters to take part. The first wing of the dragonfly approach to social media requires you to focus intently on the one single outcome you wish to achieve. So, how can you find yours? Simple: the goal you focus on must adhere to the so-called HATCH rule. First of all, your goal must be humanistic: it must be based on understanding your target group. Start by getting in touch with the people you want to affect and find out what drives them and how they are connected to your cause. An example of this approach can be seen in the way companies like Procter & Gamble develop their products: increasingly, they are working to understand the needs of end users and using them as a jumping-off point for development. Second, your goal must be actionable. So while you want a visionary long-term goal to strive for, you also need to break it down into smaller, actionable and easy-to-understand goals. Thirdly and fourthly, your goal has to be testable and clear, meaning that you can set unambiguous milestones and measure your progress. This motivates your audience as they can celebrate the small wins and feel the momentum picking up. Finally, your goal must be such that your audience is happy to work for it. In other words, it should not be meaningful just for you, but for them too, so you need to explain to them why they should support your cause. Today, we’re inundated with a never-ending stream of information: emails, text messages, tweets, Facebook status updates and banner ads on your favorite websites. With all these messages vying for our attention, it is little wonder that it’s very hard to actually get anyone to listen and to take action. So, what’s the solution? You have to get creative. First of all, you need to be personal: if you’re inviting people to an event on Facebook, for example, you’ll surely evoke more interest if you add a personal message to each recipient instead of just sending a generic invite. Similarly, if you customize the message about your cause so it feels personal to your audience, they will be more likely to pay attention. Second, your communication should be somehow unexpected and surprising. This is because people tend to spend most of their time in a kind of autopilot mode, without really actively paying attention to any of the vast amount of messages that cross their screen. To shock them out of this trance, you need to surprise them. As marketing guru Seth Godin said, you need to create “a purple cow” that will stand out and grab people’s attention. Third, you should always “show rather than tell.” Instead of long-winded explanations, synthesize your ideas into simple imagery, like photos and videos. Studies have shown that people are far better at remembering what they see than what they hear. For example, consider one Japanese charity that fights obesity and hunger. It was successful largely because it simply had a compelling logo – two lunch tables: one full, the other empty – and a creative name: “Table For Two.” Finally, if you really want your campaign to be remembered, include an emotional connection by stimulating the other senses too, like hearing or taste. For example, choosing the right background music for a video can evoke powerful emotions. Ever since humans developed the capacity for language, we have used it to tell stories. Historically, telling stories has helped communicate information from person to person and from generation to generation, and even though we don’t typically sit around bonfires every night exchanging stories anymore, they are still a very powerful means of communicating. Why is this? Because stories inspire and touch people in a way that cold hard facts just can’t. As an example, consider KIVA, the non-profit organization that facilitates microlending to low-income entrepreneurs. It does not ask you to donate to some vague charity goal, but rather tells you the individual stories of each entrepreneur, thereby building a personal connection with them. The success of this approach can be seen in the fact that KIVA has already helped hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. So, how else can you engage your audience? First of all, craft your messages so they address the needs and feelings of your audience members. This, of course, requires that you understand them. Second, you can’t expect your audience to get passionate about your cause unless you yourself are authentically passionate about it. As the poet Robert Frost said: “No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader.” You need to understand what you genuinely care about, for it is the only thing that you can get the audience to care about too. Third, you must find the right media for your messages: for some personal requests, an email or text message may be best, whereas other messages are better broadcast on, for example, Twitter, where they can spawn more discussion. The last wing of the dragonfly is where the magic truly happens: people take action thanks to your message. Effecting this leap is far from easy, but you can make it happen by keeping in mind a few simple rules: First, always make it easy for your audience to take action. An open-ended request that they should “save the world” will never be as successful as a campaign explaining to participants exactly how to buy and install energy-saving light bulbs. Second, you need to show your audience that you value their contribution and are making efficient use of their time. People are more prone to participate if you can show them that they are in a unique position to have a disproportionate impact on your cause, so you should ensure that the call to action you make matches the interest and skills of your audience. Third, you should also try to make your campaign fun. Consider including game-elements and humor to attract more people. For example, you could use a referral competition to entice people to get their friends to join the campaign as well. Finally, make your program transparent and open, sharing information and allowing others to contribute ideas as well. This way you’ll not only get more ideas, but your entire audience can follow your program’s progress and be inspired by the milestones you hit. We have now learned all about the four wings of the dragonfly. Next, let’s look at a case study to examine how they made one little girl’s social media impact soar. In 1996, Alexandra Scott was born in Manchester, Connecticut. Sadly, before she had even turned one, she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer. At the age of four, Alex started her own lemonade stand to raise money to find a cure for her disease. The very first summer, she and her brother raised an astonishing $2000. In the years that followed, Alex and her family opened the lemonade stand each summer, and as word spread around the globe, she inspired others to open similar stands and donate their earnings. Alex passed away at the age of eight, but she died knowing that she had helped raise over one million dollars for pediatric cancer research. Today, Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) continues to encourage children to raise money for cancer research by setting up their own lemonade stands, and has so far raised over 80 million dollars. Part of ALSF’s success lies in its ability to use the four wings of the dragonfly in concert: \nFocus: In all of their messages, ALSF focuses on Alex and Alex’s cause:     eradicating childhood cancer. \nGrab attention: ALSF uses an old American tradition, lemonade stands, in a wholly     unexpected context – raising money for cancer research. \nEngage: ALSF connects to people emotionally by telling the moving story of little Alex who was so selfless. \nTake action: ALSF provides individuals, schools and companies with a simple and fun way to contribute: by setting up a lemonade stand. The key message in this book: It’s not necessary to be rich or highly influential to bring about meaningful social change. Today’s social media technologies enable virtually anyone to share stories in ways that can mobilize people all over the world to take action. Actionable advice: When you present, tell a story and use visuals. Next time you’re preparing a written document to explain some idea or plan, consider whether you could instead make a brief video where you present the same information in story form. The images and narrative will make your presentation more engaging and more memorable.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Gerber","summary":"Did you ever realize that the vast majority of small businesses fail without ever becoming successful? Did you ever wonder what’s so special about businesses that survive past the five-year mark and then run smoothly ever after? In these blinks, you’ll find an easy-to-follow guide to making sure your business is a success and not just a sad statistic. You’ll also find out: why 80 percent of small businesses fail in the first five years, why founder Ray Kroc’s strategy for McDonald’s is one you should follow, and why your business will be better off without you. Did you know that one million small businesses are founded in America each year, but 40 percent of them fail in the first year and 80 percent in the first five years? That’s 800,000 failed businesses, and most of these failures are due to the E-Myth. The E-Myth, or entrepreneurial myth, is a fundamental misunderstanding in American business. It’s the notion that skillful technical work and a good idea form a sufficient basis for business success. People often start their own business merely because they excel at work in a certain field, such as a machinist, barber or computer programmer. Then one day the entrepreneurial seizure strikes. They realize they don’t want to do technical work for someone else. They want to work for themselves as per their own ideas for their own business. Let’s say you work as a barista. You’ve mastered coffee roasting, brewing and latte art and you have lots of ideas of how to run a cafe. Suddenly, you realize you’d rather open your own cafe. Such a realization is the reason behind the one million new businesses each year. But if you start a business from the basis that you have technical expertise and new ideas, you’ve already started on the wrong foot. Your business will probably fail. You’ve made the fatal assumption, the mistaken belief that knowing how to do technical work means you know how to run a business. In fact, technical work and the work required to run a business are two completely different things. Here’s an example. A barista opens her own cafe, and soon realizes that her coffee skills are not enough to make her business successful. She has to know how to hire more employees, organize tasks and grow her business. This is why so many small businesses fail! Have you ever thought about the stages of a business like those of a person? Interestingly enough, businesses go through infant, adolescent and mature stages, just like we do. The difference is that most businesses won’t survive adolescence. In the first stage, infancy, the owner and the business are one and the same. At first, infancy is romantic. The business owner finally gets to do all the work herself! For example, the barista opens her own cafe and is now roasting and brewing her own coffee – great! But success at this stage means more customers and more production. Eventually, the work becomes too much to handle. At the barista’s cafe, customers notice the space isn’t as orderly anymore, because the owner doesn’t have time to clean every day. Suddenly, by starting her own business, the owner too finds herself buried under technical tasks. She’s become the boss she wanted to avoid! When she hires someone to help her, the business enters its adolescence phase. Adolescence also starts out great, as the owner doesn’t have to do everything herself anymore. But most adolescent business owners enjoy freedom too much and manage by abdication instead of managing by delegation. They leave their tasks to others and assume they’re taken care of, instead of ensuring everything is done properly. Back at the cafe, customers start to complain about the lackluster lattes the new employees make. During this part of the adolescent stage, the owner must be pulled past her comfort zone, where she controlled everything in the business herself. The business will fail unless it can grow beyond the owner’s ability to do and control everything herself. What can the former barista, now business owner, do? She could get small again, fire her employees and return to her comfort zone, where she’s instead overwhelmed with work. Alternatively, she could go for broke and let the growth of her business accelerate until it got out of control, hiring more employees and accepting an inevitable decline in quality. Or finally, as you will see in the following blinks, she can accept that her business has to grow and plan for this opportunity from day one. Even if you’re prepared to get out of your comfort zone and relinquish some control to grow your business, where do you start? You have to start from the very beginning, back before you even opened your business. That’s because businesses that make it past adolescence and into maturity are founded on a broader perspective than most, and have planned their structures accordingly. Successful businesses consider the future, focusing on building a business that works without being dependent on the owner always being there. That way, when it’s time to grow past adolescence, they’ll be able to handle the growth. To launch a business that will make it to maturity, you need entrepreneurial perspective. This means that you plan from the very beginning how your business will look, feel and work toward its goals. Instead of asking “What work is necessary in the business?” ask “How will the business work as a whole?” For example, the barista knows the technical work her cafe requires. She’ll roast Guatemalan beans and serve lattes. But what will set her business apart from competitors? How will she attract customers? What sort of customer does she want? The answers to these questions demand entrepreneurial perspective. Then, to implement your entrepreneurial perspective, you’ll need an entrepreneurial model. The entrepreneurial model is a plan for your business that satisfies potential customers’ needs in an innovative way. Your entrepreneurial model will include your business’s market opportunities, a clear idea of your ideal customer and exactly how your product is to be delivered. To save her business, the barista might have to close the cafe for a few days to ponder her entrepreneurial perspective and entrepreneurial model. She could decide, then, that her target customers are eco-conscious students and she’ll satisfy their needs by being the first cafe to offer locally sourced milk and reading cubicles. Do you think of yourself as just one single, predictable personality? Then your business is probably going to struggle. The truth is that we’re made up of a number of battling personalities. Specifically, we’re each some part entrepreneur, manager and technician. One moment we’re entrepreneurs creating a new product, and the next we're a technician, frustrated with the new idea we just came up with a moment ago! Of our battling personalities, the entrepreneur is the innovator, looking around and seeing a world of opportunity. She’s a high-energy dreamer and visionary. She sees all the angles, all the possibilities toward success and is intently focused on the future. Sometimes that energy and constant opportunity-chasing creates havoc and chaos. She tries to pull people along and gets frustrated when things slow down or lag behind. Without the entrepreneur, there’d be no innovation. The manager in you is pragmatic and craves order. More than opportunities, she sees problems to fix. As the entrepreneur innovates and creates new things, the manager arranges things into rows, organized and orderly. Without the manager, the business could never function. Lastly, there’s the technician, the doer and the tinkerer. The technician in you loves controlling the work flow and getting things done. She’s frustrated by the entrepreneur’s flakiness and need to constantly change ideas, and irked by the manager’s meddling in her work flow. But she’s happy when the entrepreneur and the manager create more work for her to do. Without the technician, nothing in the business would ever get done. Although the three personalities inside us seem to be totally at odds with each other, we must utilize the strengths of each to run a successful business. That’s why the average small business owner is approximately 10 percent entrepreneur, 20 percent manager and 70 percent technician. So now you know the daunting odds stacked against you if you decide to start a company. But how can you avoid becoming one of the 800,000 failed businesses? Well, there’s a revolution going on in small business, and within lies the secret of success. Did you realize that we’re in the middle of a historic revolution that will change business forever? It’s called the turn-key revolution, because more and more, businesses are being built so that an owner could in principle give the key to their business to anyone, and that person would be able to run the business successfully. Businesses in the turn-key revolution create a model that works perfectly, provides a predictable product to the customer with every purchase and can be replicated without the owner’s presence. In other words, they’re franchises. For your business to be a turn-key business, you need to have a business format franchise: the model you give to the franchisee, the person who will run your franchise. It contains your business’s processes, organizations and systems. The success rate for franchises is amazing. Whereas 80 percent of small businesses fail in the first five years, 75 percent of business format franchises succeed. The turn-key revolution is so successful because it focuses on building businesses that anyone would want to buy. For example, if someone wanted to buy your business, their first question would probably be, “Does it work?” If your business’s systems are designed to work in the simplest and most efficient way, anyone can run the business, and thus it is appealing to buy. In the turn-key revolution, you’re not just selling the products you make to customers. You’re working to sell the whole business, including its processes and systems, to franchisees. Ray Kroc started the turn-key revolution in 1952 when he became obsessed with creating a hamburger stand that would produce a precisely replicable hamburger to each customer. He reengineered the way hamburger stands worked, making everything so exact that, for example, every hamburger was flipped at precisely the same time. Kroc defined processes that anybody could follow because he saw the eventual franchisee, the person who would run the stand, as his real customer. Kroc then sold the system of McDonald’s businesses as a franchise, thousands of times over. So how do you go about making a franchise? The first thing you have to do is build a franchise prototype, the original model of your business that will be replicated. Your franchise prototype has to give people value and be so simple that it can operated by anyone. The value your prototype gives customers is whatever they perceive it to be. Sound confusing? What it means is that the value can be anywhere: in your reasonable prices, in your amazing customer service, in a gift your customers receive in the mail, and so on. For example, the barista’s cafe value could be her impeccable lattes that come with free cookies. Next, the way the value is delivered has to be designed in a way that is systems-dependent, not expert-dependent. This means that you should design your systems to be so simple and efficient that your business will no longer rely on you or on technical experts. For example, if the barista designs a flawless training program that ensures every barista in her cafe makes perfect lattes, she or other latte experts will not have to do it themselves. In addition, the franchise prototype should document everything in an operations manual. Why? If you don’t document how your business works, how will someone be able to run it without you? Therefore, you must write down every single process as part of your company’s how-to guide. The barista’s cafe, then, should have manuals not just on how to make a latte, but on how to train people to make lattes. Lastly, the franchise prototype also should provide predictable service, 100 percent of the time. If people don’t know what kind of product or service they’re going to receive, they probably won’t become regular customers. For example, people who come to the barista’s cafe shouldn’t get a delicious latte one day and a rancid one the next or they’ll never come back again. And of course, a franchisee won’t want to run a business with unpredictable results. Why did you want to start a business in the first place? Hopefully it’s at least partially because you wanted something more than a 9-to-5 job in your life. So as you set up your franchise prototype, your top priority is to ensure that your business will give you what you want! The most important step in building your business is knowing your primary aim, or what kind of life you want to live. After all, how can you know what kind of business to build if you don’t know what it’ll help you achieve? To know your primary aim, ask yourself questions such as, “What do I care about most?” “How do I want to live?” “How much money do I want?” and “How much do I want to travel?” After you know your primary aim, you have to make a strategic objective. That’s a list of objectives that your business will have to fulfill to help you reach your primary aim. The strategic objective is also a tool for measuring progress, implementing plans and franchising your business. It’s a list of standards that anyone should be able to understand. It should include financial projections, including how much money you expect to make in gross revenue and profit. It should also define why your business is an opportunity worth pursuing, meaning that it involves a big enough market opportunity to fulfill your financial goals and satisfy your primary aim. And it should define what kind of business you’re in, including a description of your ideal customer. Let’s say the barista’s primary aim is to make $500,000 a year and travel for one month every year. That means that her strategic objective should explain how her three cafes will each make her $167,000 a year, as well as a plan on how she can close the cafes and wind down operations for one month each year. If you’re like most people, you hate drafting organizational charts. Boring, right? But without a clear way for everyone to know their responsibilities, how will your business succeed? You need an organizational strategy to lay out exactly who in your company will do what work. Even if you’re still a one-person business, you have to plan your organizational strategy to know how your business will grow. So start out by considering how many employees you’ll need, and what work each one will do. Then, for each and every position, write out a position contract explaining who the employee reports to, what work has to be done and by what standards the employee’s work will be judged. For example, the barista knows that her cafes will need three baristas and one baker in each, a manager to oversee them, a marketing manager, an accountant and a general manager to oversee everyone. At the beginning, the barista will fulfill all those jobs. She’ll make coffee, bake cookies, design ads for local newspapers and keep the books. But as the business grows, she’ll need to know exactly how many people and for which positions she has to hire for her business to run successfully. Plus, the barista will learn the best approaches as she works in each position. She should document them in a specific manual for each position that can be passed down to future employees. Another advantage of a clear organizational strategy is establishing accountability. Each employee will be responsible for the work his position requires, which will be clearly laid out in each position’s manual and position contract. Each employee also must sign his position contract, which shows he agrees to accept responsibility in accomplishing his assigned work. At the end, when each position is filled, with employees fulfilling the standards for their positions, your business will be on its way toward satisfying its strategic objective and your primary aim. Do you think the secret to a successful management strategy is finding as many incredibly talented people as possible? Then you’re wrong! The secret to a great management strategy is implementing a management system that approaches your management of people as a marketing tool. Why a marketing tool? Well, the way you treat your employees and the way you push them to do satisfactory work will end up having the biggest impact on the product your customer receives. For example, one way the barista could manage her baker would be by telling him that he must stay in the kitchen and bake a certain amount of cookies and cakes every day. Or, alternatively, she could put him on display in the shop, front and center, and even let him choose his own ingredients. The latter option would probably result in the baker being more enthusiastic about his job and customers consequently enjoying better cookies. But the most important part of your management system is a people strategy, where you ensure your people understand the idea behind the work they’re doing. If your employees understand the meaning of the work they’re doing, they’re more likely to want to work to help the business reach its goals. A third important component is that employees should always be tested against the standards you set for each position. Let’s say that one of the barista’s business objectives is to prioritize creativity. When the barista hires a baker, she makes sure to connect the objective of creativity with his work. She tells him that personal creativity is a cornerstone of her cafes, so he has to push his own creative limits by designing each week’s cake schedule. He will be held up against the standard of creativity: no two weeks’ cake schedules should be the same. The result? The baker will be pushed to reach his baking potential, while your customers will have more choice of cakes! What about marketing? What’s the best way to approach your marketing strategy? It’s simple. Focusing on the customer is so vital that you should forget about everything else and only think about the customer. First, consider your customer demographics. How old are your customers? Where do they live? Then think about why your customer makes purchases. These are your psychographics. Why should your demographic group buy from you and not from somebody else? For example, while the barista might not have enough money to compile a huge customer research report, she could ask each of her customers to fill out a small survey, rewarded with a free cookie at the cafe. To know her customer better, she could ask demographic questions such as age and address, and psychographic questions, such as which leisure-time activities a customer enjoys. With this information, the barista can present her products according to her customers’ profiles, and they’ll be more likely to buy. Once you understand your customers as best as you can, make your marketing as appealing as possible to them. For example, research done by technology company IBM found that a particular shade of blue implied dependability to its customers. It then ensured that all its products were packaged or highlighted somehow by what is now known as “IBM Blue.” For your franchise prototype to be predictable to a potential franchisee, you have to consistently market to your customers as scientifically as possible. Scientifically, in this case, means according to data and tests that you run. That means that once your research shows your customers have become younger, or that your marketing approach by advertising in newspapers isn’t as effective anymore, you must change it. For example, you can consider buying online ads to reach younger customers. What will your business look like after plotting out your entire franchise prototype? It will be a complex, yet easy to run, interdependent series of all the systems and processes that make up the business, from marketing to management to organizational structure, all the way back to your primary aim. That’s because you’ll have a systems strategy in which everything interacts with each other, and through those interactions, everything will develop and change. Generally, your systems strategy will be divided into a few categories: You’ll have hard systems, the inanimate objects that make up your business, such as computers and colors. You’ll have soft systems, the ideas and the living things in your business, like yourself! And you’ll have information systems, which will tell you all the data on your business so you know what’s working, what’s not and when it’s time to change. For example, in the barista’s cafe, hard systems will include her espresso machine; soft systems will include employee attitudes; and information systems will include data on what exactly customers purchase. To succeed, all these systems have to work together. You can’t work on any one part of the business without considering all the other parts. At the barista’s cafe, she might want to exchange the espresso machine for a newer model, a change to the hard system. To make that decision, she’ll have to consider how the other systems will be affected. The soft system could be compromised if employees absolutely adore the current machine and don’t want to learn how to operate a new one. Then the information system will have to monitor customer behavior to ensure the new machine isn’t making subpar lattes and hurting sales. If the systems can’t run smoothly together, the business doesn’t have a chance! If you want to ensure your business is successful, you can never rest on your laurels. You have to constantly be working on your prototype, tweaking its systems and confirming that it’s running as best as it can. That continual tweaking, testing and energy is called the business development process. The first step in the business development process is innovation. Innovation is simply doing new things. The key to successful business innovation, though, isn’t innovating your product so much as it is innovating your business. Ask yourself the question, “What’s the best way to do this?” Remember, Ray Kroc didn’t innovate hamburgers – he innovated how hamburgers were made and sold. The second step in the business development process is quantification. Quantification is simply measuring everything. Every single thing. How can you know what’s working or what’s not without measuring your innovation’s impact? For example, how will the barista know that her management system of fostering creativity in the baker is working unless she tracks how many pieces of cake she sells? The final step of the business development process is orchestration. Orchestration is putting innovation into practice. It’s taking your idea of how your business should work and having it play out between employees and customers, then watching what happens. It’s a constant process, based on your efforts of innovation and quantification. That means, if wearing a blue suit increases your sales, keep wearing a blue suit! But if quantification finds that losing the suit and wearing shirtsleeves helps performance, then switch to shirtsleeves. The key point is that innovation, quantification, and orchestration aren't necessarily chronological. They don't happen one after the other, but rather all together, all the time. The business development process never ends, because your business will constantly be creating new innovations, orchestrating them into real life and measuring the results. It’s a process that will drive your small business to success. The key message in this book: Most small businesses fail, but if from day one you build your business as a franchise prototype so that anybody can take the reins, your chances of success increase dramatically. The key is to go to work on your business, not in your business. Actionable advice: Define your primary aim. Before starting your business, ask yourself, “What kind of life do I want to live?” How much money do you want, and how much do you want to work? These are key questions for which you need the answers before you start, as you should set up your business in a way to help you attain your goals.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Although the worst part of the crisis might have passed, the economy is still shaky.  Luckily, there are measures you can take to protect yourself and secure an income if the going gets tough. With a little creativity, you can raise your chances of finding a second job or turn your skills into a thriving side-gig. There’s nothing wrong with a little moonlighting – it may even change your life for the better. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to turn your skills into money; how to surf your way to a new job; and how (and why) you can still pick your friends. It seems like all we ever hear about is how volatile the global economy is. Since the 2007 financial crisis, many individuals have taken extra steps to protect themselves. Once thought of as a last resort, working two jobs is becoming a norm today. A 2012 study conducted by the University of Michigan revealed that as many as 50 percent of participants described themselves as financially worse off compared to their situation five years ago. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 5 percent of the working population in the United States already has at least two jobs. What’s the relationship between these two pieces of information? Well, it’s easy enough to assume that people get a second job because of financial struggles, be it a growing debt, increasing rent prices or mounting medical bills. But while this is logical, it’s not the whole story.  Take Joe Cain, for instance. A former cop, Cain built the website sidegig.com, a platform where police officers and firefighters could offer additional services, such as home repair work or legal consultation. He didn’t take on his website project out of financial desperation. Rather, Cain was determined to gain new skills and opportunities. Cain was able to become a certified tax specialist by taking classes while still working on the police force. He had success offering his accounting services to other people, and decided to continue focusing on tax consultation. Not only did this job pay better, it also afforded Cain more time with his two children. But not wanting to stop there, Cain also invested time into sidegig.com to secure yet another stream of income.  Cain’s story shows how motivations for finding additional streams of income can be manifold. A need to earn more money often goes alongside a desire for changes in your professional and personal life.  If you remember how tough it was starting your current job, finding a new one might seem pretty daunting! That’s because we often have no clue where to start. So at this stage, it’s best to keep things simple and ask yourself what you’re good at.  Take the time to reflect on yourself as an employee by listing the skills you’ve gained in your current job and how they might be useful in other professions. For example, if you’ve learned great management skills at your hospitality job, you might enjoy taking on coaching as a second job, where you assist clients in organization and planning.  With this list nearby, it’s time to hit the web. The internet is full of creative, resourceful individuals selling goods and services independently with the aid of online platforms. Take Etsy.com, which allows crafters to buy and sell their handmade items. If you can see yourself designing your own jewelry, Etsy should be your first stop.  Elance.com is another site where you can put your graphic design, marketing or copywriting skills up for offer. If you’ve got an eye for detail or a way with words, this platform might suit you best. No matter which route you take, there’s one thing you have to keep in mind: time management! Because time is money. And if you’re already working full-time, you have don’t have much of it to spend generating additional income. So you’ve got to make the time. But how? Early mornings are a great window of time to get stuff done before your workday begins. If you have downtime, such as waiting for a bus, prepare yourself so that you can use it productively. Smartphones make this very easy: you can, e.g., read through job ads the next time you’ve got some waiting to do.  We can also find time for our second job by cutting back on unnecessary things. By reducing time you spend on Facebook or watching TV, you’ll free up whole hours in your week. If you’re feeling inspired about potential second jobs and motivated to start using your week more productively, it’s time to progress to the next step.  A great network of friends is something we should all aspire to have. Their support often comes in handy when facing challenges, such as relationship and family troubles. It’s also great for starting new business endeavors.  As you start to find your footing in your second job, you’ll need a network to show you the ropes, and connect you with customers and other businesses. So if you don’t have any friends in your new field, it’s time to make some! The internet is a great place to find like-minded people doing the work you’d like to do to. Start by seeking out individuals blogging on topics that interest you. If you’re planning on developing a side job as a writer, you could seek out people blogging about creative writing. Then, start actively engaging with their content: share your thoughts in the comments section and respond to their Facebook and Twitter posts.  After doing this for a while, get in touch with the author. Don’t just think about what their friendship could offer you; consider how your skills could benefit him or her, too, and you’ll be off to a great start. At the same time, think about how you can make it possible for other people to find you. Having an online presence, such as a blog or an online shop, is a great way to put yourself out there for others to find.  With a network established, it’s time to win the attention of your target audience. Making guest appearances on different blogs is one great way to reach out to new potential clients. If you want to start selling your handcrafted jewelry on Etsy, you could contact bloggers writing about design and art, sure, but you could also get in touch with bloggers writing about the materials you use or even about entrepreneurship in general! Don’t be afraid to ask. Whether it’s a disappointed customer, a disastrous workshop or a declined application, failure can make you question your ability to maintain additional streams of income. Failure is a perfectly normal part of life – it happens to the best of us! If you find yourself at a dead end, don’t despair. What matters most is how you bounce back.  There are three steps to making the most out of failure. First, learn from your mistakes. The internet is your friend here. Seek out stories of failure similar to yours and see how other people have grown from them. This will console you and remind you that you’re not the only one who’s gotten lost along the way!  Next, put your plan B into action. If your current project doesn’t seem to be working out, what else could you do? Get your creative juices going and start brainstorming alternative endeavors. This will reassure you that your project isn’t the be-all and end-all. If you came up with one great idea, you can definitely think of another.  Finally, keep your failure in perspective. We tend to overestimate the impact of our negative experiences. But, in reality, we often forget about traumatic experiences before we know it.  Do you believe that “what goes around, comes around”? While ideas of karma may seem a little superstitious, any successful businessperson can tell you that they do apply.  In previous blinks, we found out that having a network of supportive friends can be great for getting your second job up and running. If you want to maintain these friendships, you’ll need to be a good friend. Sounds obvious enough, but it’s easy to forget in the early stages of your business when you have a lot to lose. That’s why you should be willing to make sacrifices and help others out when they ask. It’s worth it, because they’ll be more likely to get your back in the future.  Say you’re crowdfunding for a new project. You can’t hope to promote the project alone: you need people to share it with their friends. The people who are going to help you out here will without a doubt be those you’ve shown kindness to in the past.  Aside from karma, there’s one last thing to keep in mind: there’s no pressure. Most of us aren’t planning to leave our full-time jobs to dedicate our lives to our second source of income. You don’t have to turn your second job into your dream career. Thinking this way will just turn your second jobs into sources of stress. Placing too much emphasis on earning money will also suck the fun out of your second job. Financial security is important, of course. But so is making a difference in the lives of others, and doing something that you find fulfilling.  Businesswoman Febe Hernandez started a jewelry brand to create a second source of income. Her products were a hit, so she decided to hire young people from the Bronx to help her expand. Though she could have scaled up her business more effectively with skilled workers, giving this opportunity to young people in need was motivating and fulfilling for Hernandez.  By being kind to others and to yourself, you’ll find it far easier to maintain your additional sources of income, and they’ll become sources of meaning and happiness in your life, too.  The key message in this book: If you’re seeking greater financial security or just eager for new opportunities, having a second job could be the right move for you. While you maintain your full-time job, you can use online resources and networks to grow your own side business. With some clever time management and a good attitude, you’ll be on your way to a more fulfilling work life.  Actionable advice:  Make your day work for you. Next time you feel frustrated at yourself for not completing the work you had planned to do in the afternoon, remember that energy levels fluctuate over the day. If you’ve noticed that you’re quite tired at certain times, but have boundless energy earlier or later in the day, then adjust your daily schedule to take advantage of this changing rhythm.

A sentiment that still holds strong. But does it hold water? Given that more people than ever before have a college degree and the whole world is just a few keyboard clicks away, it might be time to reconsider this sentiment. Something has indeed changed. In our globalized modern world, a job is no longer the safest route to financial security. From outsourcing to unemployed college graduates, it looks like we are in a recession, but we could also be witnessing the limits of a decaying system and the beginning of a new one: a paradigm shift and the end of jobs as we know it. In these blinks, you’ll find out how the English King Henry VIII made capital more important than land; why great entrepreneurs think like poker players; and how population growth in the U.S. has increased unemployment. There are many variables that determine how society progresses. One variable particularly worth examining is the limit of the systems we live and work in. Software entrepreneur Eli Goldratt came up with this theory of constraints in the 1980s.  According to Goldratt, every system that has a goal also has a limit: a part of the system that restricts growth. So if your factory has two assembly lines that produce 100 units of a product and one that produces only 50, that third line would be the limit. In order to progress, then, we need to work on this limit. For example, if you have a great product but nobody’s heard of it, you won’t boost sales by improving your product. Here, the limit you need to improve on would be your marketing strategy. According to systems thinker Ron Davidson, the last three major changes in the Western economy occurred when the limits changed. Back in fourteenth-century England, the agricultural economy was based on land, and since the Catholic Church owned the lion’s share of it, they controlled the economy. Therefore, the limit was land until the sixteenth century, when Henry VIII appointed himself head of the Anglican Church and revoked Rome’s control over it.  Then, at the dawn of the industrial age in the 1700s, bankers became more powerful than kings, shifting the limit from land to capital, and forcing land-owner and Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III to ask bankers for a loan to finance his wars. Later, in the 1900s, we shifted from a capital economy into a knowledge economy. Knowledge, proliferated by technology, became the new limit, making companies like IBM extremely powerful. This was evident in 1975, when IBM successfully issued a billion dollars in bonds, despite their bankers at Morgan Stanley refusing to cooperate. Since the early 2000s, though, we’ve seen a weakening of the knowledge economy as a burgeoning entrepreneurial economy gains momentum. Read on to find out why. Jobs are becoming increasingly hard to come by and, believe it or not, those in their fifties today are partly responsible for it.  After WWII, the economic boom pushed the knowledge economy to its limit, and it began morphing into a new system. People born in the U.S. in the first two decades after WWII – the baby boomers – enjoyed a period of economic prosperity and an abundance of career options. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, jobs grew 1.7 times faster than the population between the years 1948 and 2000. This growth meant that baby boomers simply had to get a college education and the right credentials, and they’d walk straight into a job. The next generations followed suit, believing it would remain this way. But there was never any guarantee that the economy would stay the same. And it hasn’t. In fact, since 2000, the population has grown 2.4 times faster than have positions on the job market. This explains the plethora of well-educated, jobless graduates. In the U.S., over half the recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in a position that doesn’t require a degree. From this we see that knowledge in the form of credentials is no longer the limit. We’ve reached the peak of 9-to-5 jobs and we are now witnessing the beginning of entrepreneurship. Interestingly, the only jobs on the rise since the 1980s are non-routine cognitive jobs: creative, unpredictable work rather than work involving completing the same task every day. Our economy is expanding based on creativity and innovation. In other words, creativity is the new limit and the new power players are entrepreneurs who set up businesses and pursue innovative ideas. The apartment rental website AirBnB is a great example: they started out by posting apartments on Craigslist, an external site that lists apartments, as a creative way to market their own business. Aside from the dearth of jobs in the U.S., there’s another reason finding work has become so difficult: the possibility of outsourcing. Modern communication technology and increased global education has released us from our office cubicles and the number of people with university degrees has dramatically increased, making degrees less valuable. In fact, the number of college graduates in the world increased from 90 million in 2000 to 130 million in 2010. But what does this mean? Well, when we add technology like the video calls of Skype into the mix, this means that qualified talent can be hired and work from anywhere in the world. This also means companies can employ workers from countries with lower wage expectations. An English-speaking web designer in the Philippines, for example, can be employed for an annual salary ranging from $700 to $1,400. A shocking contrast to the expected salary of around $82,000 for a web designer in the U.S. Machines are increasingly replacing humans in industry, especially factory workers whose jobs are now carried out by hardware and software. But these machines have moved beyond factory tasks and can be used in knowledge-based jobs. Take Eventbrite, a company that sells tickets online which are booked and paid for entirely by software. So what can you do? Don’t wait around to be replaced by software – own it. Modern technology has made running a business financially viable for more and more people, and an entrepreneur can run a small company using an international talent pool at a relatively low cost. Such startups are often called micro-multinationals. Jesse Lawler, for example, runs Evil Genius Technologies, a Vietnam-based software company which employs workers from England, India, the Philippines, and other countries. Lawler has sales and customer service people in the U.S., while his programmers live in Vietnam. This way he cuts down drastically on his expenses: living costs alone would make it impossible for Lawler to hire more than two developers in the U.S. For an entrepreneur, modern technology presents an abundance of opportunities. The benefits of having a steady job have been drilled into our heads since we were children, but what if we were misinformed? A steady job today means exposing yourself to an insidious risk that is out of your control. In our current economy, your steady income can disappear at the drop of a hat, leaving you clueless as to how to recover. Your regular paycheck gives you a false sense of security, and you may easily be replaced by an equally talented employee in India who is willing to work for less. It’s a harsh reality but, if you’ve followed orders your entire career, you won’t have the skill set to create options for yourself. Think of this as the Turkey Problem: you’re like a turkey, relying on being fed everyday until one day you’re sent to the ax! Entrepreneurs don’t have this problem, as they deal directly with visible risks. They may not make an immediate profit, but they acquire skills and create systems and can change them if they don’t produce the desired results.  In other words, they enjoy unlimited control and unlimited variables, and the possibility for growth is vast. Most of the entrepreneurs the author talked with would actually be disappointed with a growth rate of 20 percent per annum. Much like poker players, entrepreneurs understand the concept of expected value. This is the average value in a series of repetitions of a random variable. Say you’re playing a hand in a poker game and it’ll cost you $1,000 to view the final card. You know there’s a 20 percent chance you’ll win $20,000 for the whole hand. So you’re coughing up $1,000 for an expected value of $4,000, which is 20 percent of $20,000. If you place this bet enough times, you’re guaranteed to come out on top. It’s no surprise, then, that many poker players end up being entrepreneurs. Starting a business is for highly intelligent business types with piles of cash, right? Actually, thanks to modern technology, anyone has the possibility to do anything from designing furniture to publishing a novel. Apple mogul Steve Jobs even said that entrepreneurs aren’t necessarily smarter than the average person. One thing that has changed the game of business is, of course, the internet. One way it has done so is by dramatically reducing production costs. The tools needed to create a product are more affordable and more widely available than ever before. Take Software as a Service, i.e., businesses like Adobe Creative Cloud that sell software on a subscription basis. Whereas in the past you needed to invest in pricey equipment and sign long-term contracts, now quality services can be accessed on a monthly basis. So, instead of spending hundreds of dollars on accounting software, you can now pay $9 a month for an accounting program like Xero. The internet has also lowered distribution costs. Along with accessing manufacturers in lower-cost countries, you can also reach and distribute to customers directly. The author, for example, used to work for a business that made and sold portable bars. By manufacturing in China and distributing directly to consumers, they were able to cut their costs by about 25 percent and improve the product’s quality. The internet is also constantly creating new markets, largely because location is now irrelevant. For instance, in the past you would use a law firm because it was near your office. Now, you can use a website like UpCounsel to find a vetted lawyer who specializes in your needs, regardless of your location. If you’re an entrepreneur, you can also more easily serve niche markets on the net. Firegang Dental Marketing, for example, offers digital marketing services exclusively in the niche of dentists who want to reach new customers. Prehistoric hunter-gatherers didn’t work like we do today: they worked to survive. But this changed at the beginning of the agricultural revolution. After that, work became an obligation. When we started creating farming communities, we worked to collect foods we could store or trade. Tilling the land was arduous, constant work to amass wealth rather than to survive. After the industrial revolution, factory workers viewed work and wages as a means to improve their quality of life. So they bore the obligation of routine factory tasks as they believed it would lead to a better life.  This idea probably seems very familiar to you. That’s because we still hold onto it today. However, today it’s possible to find more meaningful work. But how do we really weigh meaning versus money? Economist Dan Ariely conducted a psychological study in India to find out how powerful money was as an incentive. In Ariely’s study, a group of workers were assigned a complex task that was impossible to solve by using a formula, much like entrepreneurial work. One of the tasks, for example, was to unscramble an anagram. The first subgroup was offered a day’s wages for the task, the second two weeks’ wages, and the third five months’ wages. Surprisingly, the higher the reward, the weaker the performance. This is because meaningful work motivates us more than monetary incentives. We also saw this in 2006, when Mark Zuckerberg was offered $1 billion by Yahoo to buy out Facebook. Zuckerberg didn’t even consider selling. Why? His work meant too much to him. As of 2015, Facebook is worth $230 billion. In the end, Zuckerberg got to continue doing the work he loved and made a staggering profit to boot. This is all the more proof that starting a business that fulfills us is far more viable than we have traditionally been taught. Being an entrepreneur isn’t always a walk in the park, but it’s not as treacherous as you may think. Rob Walling, leader of three software companies, used his experience to create a useful entrepreneurial method known as the Stair Step Method. The first step involves creating and launching a single product, selling it for a one-time fee, and using just one marketing channel. By keeping things simple this way, you’ll learn some business basics without the pressure of a highly competitive environment, how to build and market a product, how to network, and how to hire and manage a small number of employees.  The next step is to launch enough one-time products to be able to quit your job, as Walling did before becoming a computer programming consultant. In 2005, he launched a few products and acquired some invoicing software still in its development stage, but he was only bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. At this point, your focus should be on generating enough income to buy back the time you put into your day job. This will also allow you to gather business experience, a network of entrepreneurs and a stable workforce. Walling was able to teach himself marketing just by building on the SEO that the previous owners of the software used. He then used the capital he gained from consulting and the SEO skills he learned to purchase and run an e-commerce website selling bath towels. After you’ve launched some products and gained some experience, it’s time to expand your business. You could launch bigger products or create a membership site, for example. After buying the towel website, Walling increased the company’s profit from zero to $2,500 per month. One key thing to remember is that no college course can make you an entrepreneur. While education used to be the ticket to financial stability, now practical experience is the way to acquire the skills you need to get meaning and income from your work. The key message in this book: The promise of a stable 9-to-5 job at the end of college has been unsustainable since the turn of the century. Our society is transitioning into an entrepreneurial economy and now, more than ever, is the time to take advantage of technology to create meaningful work that embraces risk and creativity, and offers more wealth and freedom than the broken tradition of the 9-to-5 grind. Actionable advice: Make decisions like a billionaire. When investing, diversifying is the key, right? Wrong! If you want to see real gains, look at the strategy of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger of the $300 billion Berkshire Hathaway holding company. Instead of diversifying, day trading or trying to beat the market year by year, these billionaires focus on 40-year time frames. The result? They’ve raked in $50 billion over 50 years by sticking with only four to five investments.

When trying to start a business from scratch, there might be times when you will win big, and others when you will be close to bankruptcy. When these bad times hit, many people give up – but not those with the right mind-set. They ride the entrepreneurial roller coaster right to the end, until they have made their company a success. So what is the right mind-set? Read on and you will find out! In these blinks, you’ll learn why every entrepreneur needs something to fight for; why Barack Obama doesn’t care that half of the American public dislikes him; and why every CEO should aim to be the dumbest person in the company. Plenty of people go into business for the money. But the truth is, people who become entrepreneurs just to get rich rarely end up with the fortunes they seek. Want a better motivator than money? Try following your passion, and here’s why: 95 percent of your job will be repetitive and boring, and only 5 percent will be fun and engaging. So you had better love that 5 percent. Take Bono, for example, the lead singer of the Irish band U2. His life may seem amazing, but he’s actually only performing and doing what he loves about 5 percent of the time. He spends the other 95 percent taking care of business: rehearsing, traveling and reviewing contracts. But the 5 percent he loves gets him through the 95 percent he doesn’t. Passion is the key to getting through the hard parts, but how do you find what you’re passionate about? Actually, your passion is already inside you – you just need to stir it up. You can start by thinking about things you want to change or fight against. Some of the world’s most revolutionary ideas originated with people confronting what made them angry. Just think where we’d be if India’s Mahatma Gandhi, South Africa’s Nelson Mandela or US civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. didn’t say “enough” and stand up to injustice. Try using your enemies to ignite your inner passion! But remember, your passion resides within your strengths, and you can’t get anything done without the right knowledge. Take the example of business magnate Warren Buffet. In the 1990s, when the worldwide trend was to invest in internet-based companies, Buffet refrained. When the dot-com bubble burst, he was applauded and was asked why he stayed away from these companies. He explained that he only invests in his areas of expertise; he simply didn’t know enough about the internet. Follow Buffet’s example and find your passion by knowing your strengths and sticking to them. Passion is important because people aren’t born successful. Rather, success takes hard work, determination and a commitment to improving. Your passion will get you through the difficult times you’ll experience on the road to success. Have you ever been fired up by a stellar idea, only to have people throw cold water on your passion instead of offering their encouragement and support? It’s a common response from insecure people to great ideas, especially when you distinguish yourself from everyone else. Your colleagues will respond by trying to shoot down your ideas and drag you down to their level. The best way to handle these reactions is to just ignore them and stay focused on your own project. When following your passion it’s important not to worry about everyone liking you. There will always be people putting you down; the more success you experience, the more they’ll dislike you. Just consider Barack Obama. The second time he was elected president of the United States, he won with only 51 percent of the popular vote. So even though 49 percent of voters voted against him, he’s still one of the most powerful people in the world. It’s unfortunate that the more successful you are, the more disapproval you’ll receive. But you can overcome it by redefining what disapproval means to you, and taking it as a sign that you’re doing well! People won’t just respond to your success with anger, however; they’ll respond with ridicule as well. As such, it’s also important not to worry about being laughed at. Just remember who’ll be laughing when you’re a success. We wouldn’t believe it now, but when a young Arnold Schwarzenegger declared he would be the world’s biggest movie star, he was laughed at. As Schwarzenegger’s success with The Terminator launched him to become the highest-paid actor of his day, he laughed back plenty. When Schwarzenegger entered the California gubernatorial race, people said he was crazy. But he rose to the challenge again and, following his dream, won the election. It just goes to show that you can accomplish anything you choose as long as you disregard the approval of others and step beyond their mockery to follow your dreams. As a first-time entrepreneur, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by your innumerable duties. You’re faced with a mountain of tasks – from picking the best vendors to ensuring quality to staying on top of finances – and every job can seem urgent. Faced with this situation, it’s essential to prioritize; if you have to concentrate on one thing only, that thing should be sales. Sales should be your number one priority, because the popularity of a product is based 10 percent on its quality and 90 percent on how it’s marketed and sold. Just think of the best-selling products in any industry – rarely are they the ones of the best quality. For instance, the most frequented restaurant in the world is not a five-star Michelin-rated one. It’s McDonald’s. It’s clear that the quality of its food isn’t what took McDonald’s to the top. Rather, it’s the company’s constant attention to marketing and sales. But maybe you’re uncomfortable using the word “sell.” Not a problem. Try replacing it with the word “help” and consider how your product aids people and addresses their needs. Knowing how your product helps customers is key, because a salesman’s most important quality is empathy. Just consider the great Miami real estate agent John Lennon, who once sold more than $3 billion of real estate within six identical buildings. What was Lennon’s key to success? Even though all his units were the same, he never sold the same thing twice.  What this means is that Lennon personalizes his sales pitch for every prospective buyer. If the client is a vintage car collector, Lennon talks up how amazing and safe the building’s garage is, thereby showing his client how the property addresses his needs. However you do it, you’ll need to start selling to be in business. The success of your company depends on sales, so get out there and start making them! What’s the biggest cost of doing business? The average company spends 65 to 80 percent of its operating budget on salaries and wages. With numbers like that, it’s no secret that hiring the wrong people can cost you a fortune. But saving money isn’t the only reason to prioritize finding the right people for the job. People make a company what it is, and to build a high-performing business, you need high-performing employees. Even among companies that sell a generic product, there are average brands and excellent ones. Airlines are a great example. Say you buy a transatlantic flight with United Airlines. You’re sitting in a plane that’s nearly identical to the one you’d be sitting in if you had instead purchased a ticket with British Airways or Air Canada. The difference, however, is the people working on the ground and in the air to make your flight the best. Employees can make or break a company, so when building your business, make sure to select the right people for the right jobs. But wait a second – as leader of the company, you should be the smartest person around, right? Actually, your team should always be better than you. Take the advice of the CEO of a multibillion-dollar telecommunications company: make it your goal to be the dumbest person in the room. Why? Because becoming successful doesn’t require you to have extraordinary intelligence or ability, as long as you have the discipline to hire people who do. If you’re thinking of better marketing ideas than your marketing director, or better financial solutions than your CFO, you know it’s time to make a change. Building a business with a sound future depends on the ability of the team you recruit, as well as your ability to recruit them. Make your business a success by hiring the best of the best. Say you’re the founder of a successful business. One of your employees, in an office across the country, snaps at a customer. You should discipline the employee and his manager for their mistakes, right? Wrong! As head of the company, you’re responsible for everything, even the mistakes of your employees. It’s essential to take responsibility for your company because you’re setting an example for everyone else. Your employees take cues from you, and you can’t expect them to be any more disciplined, dedicated and focused than you are. For instance, if the CEO of a company wears a suit every day, his employees will adopt his habit and wear suits too. Likewise, if the CEO is late to meetings, employees won’t bother being on time either. As the boss, you define the standards, so make sure the example you set is the correct one. However, being responsible for the actions of an entire company can be difficult; sometimes you’ll need to make decisions that aren’t popular. To do what’s right for your business, you’ll need to be comfortable making decisions that your employees don’t like. Take Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks. In 2008, the company hit hard times and Schultz decided to close 600 locations, resulting in thousands of layoffs. He says that day was one of the most trying in his life. After all, he had worked with some of those people for over 15 years! As leader of a company, you’ll face emotionally challenging decisions. Success means doing what’s right for the business, even if it’s unpopular. Imagine if Schultz hadn’t made the cutbacks he did. The company would have gone under and everyone would have lost their jobs! Even though it may seem like your employees aren’t always listening to you, they are always watching you. Make sure the example they see is a good one. Have you ever wondered how hyper-successful people do it? After all, everyone gets the same 24 hours each day and starts with about the same opportunities. Yet there are entrepreneurs working harder and longer than even US business magnate Donald Trump without any great success. Why? Being busy and working long, hard hours doesn’t necessarily equal success. The missing pieces are clarity and focus. To boost your productivity, you’ll need to clarify your priorities. Start by concentrating your time, energy and resources on the things most important to you and avoiding the distraction of trivial matters. After all, stopping ourselves from doing what we shouldn’t is as essential to productivity as doing the things we should. Take Warren Buffet again as an example. When posed the question, “What’s the single greatest key to your success?” his response was simple. He said that the key to success is the ability to say “no.” For every hundred amazing opportunities he’s presented, he has to say “no” to 99 and carefully pick the one and only “yes.” Priorities are clearly essential, but how many is too many? A good rule of thumb is that if you have more than three priorities, you have no priorities. Luckily, naming your priorities is simple using Buffet’s technique: Start by writing down all your priorities, narrow the list to three and throw the rest away. Everyone’s priorities are different. Although there are no right priorities, using this technique allows you to decide which ones are right for you. On the road to success, your resources are precious and it’s vital to only spend them on the things that really matter. So to make the most of your time, avoid getting distracted by things that could be important. Instead, name your priorities and focus on the things you know are important. Just delegate the rest to other people with the proper expertise! As an entrepreneur, two things you’ll experience every day are fear of the unknown and uncertainty. To run a successful business, you’ll need to face these fears head-on. Too many promising entrepreneurs have let fear prevent them from living up to their potential. Avoid their fate by learning how to overcome your fears. Start by understanding your fear. For instance, the things we’re afraid of usually aren’t that bad. It’s the anticipation of our fear that really hurts, because it’s what makes us blow our fears out of proportion. This anticipation is a vestige of our native instincts to be on the defensive against predators. The problem is, even though no such literal threats exist today, our brains still tell us they do. Instead of fearing an encounter with a hungry lion, we fear giving presentations or making unpleasant phone calls. Luckily, overcoming these fears is easy once you understand them. Just remember, when facing a customer or speaking to a large group, there’s no mortal threat. The only danger is letting your fear get the best of you. But sometimes conquering your fear is easier said than done. Give yourself an advantage by focusing on the task at hand and not the outcome it will produce. Think of US basketball legend Michael Jordan. When the score is tied and he’s taking the game’s deciding shot, he’s focused on that shot and nothing else. He’s not thinking about the effect it will have on his career or the impact on the game. He’s focused on doing the thing he’s done a million times before: shooting a basket. You can do the same. By focusing on one task and putting everything else out of your mind, you can conquer your fear and excel at your work. Overcoming fear is key to making it as an entrepreneur because it enables you to take bigger risks – and bigger risks mean bigger returns! Say you followed your dream and opened a business. You made the rules and did things your way. But as time passed, you drifted from your path; you saw other people’s success and, doubting your own methods, started copying theirs. Before you knew it, your business was struggling and your passion was gone. Put simply, you can’t live somebody else’s dream. Consider Olympic gold medalist and Grand Slam-winning tennis player, Andre Agassi. Despite being one of the best tennis players of all time and ranking number one in the world, Agassi wasn’t happy. When he got to the top, he realized he never wanted to be there. As his unhappiness continued, his ranking steadily fell to 141, and he tested positive for drugs. The problem was that he wasn’t the best because he wanted to be, but because other people wanted him to be the best. He was living their dreams, not his. He turned his life and game around by finding a new motivation – founding a school for disadvantaged children. And soon he climbed his way back up to first place again. The trick? Agassi was doing it for himself and nobody else. You too can start living your own dreams today, beginning by trusting your own judgment. Take Jeff Bezos, who years ago was a successful New Yorker with a high-paying Wall Street job. One day Bezos had the idea to open an online bookstore. He took the idea to his boss, who shot it down, deeming it too risky. But Bezos followed his own judgment. He quit his job and started the bookstore, which became a company you may have heard of: Amazon. When faced with a difficult call, like whether to open your own business, ask yourself if you will regret not taking the plunge 30 years down the road. By following your dreams and trusting your judgment, you put your future in your own hands and can become, today, the person you always thought you could have been. The key message in this book: Most people opening their own business know it will be challenging. Between creating the best product, maximizing efficiency and serving customers, being an entrepreneur is a full-time job. What most people don’t know is that the real challenges lie beneath your main business responsibilities: becoming a successful entrepreneur also means conquering your fears, defining your priorities and following your dreams. Actionable advice: Define your number one priority and stick to it. At the start of every day, take a moment to consider the tasks you expect to accomplish. From these, choose one top priority for the day and put everything else aside. By concentrating on your goal and not starting anything else until you’ve attained it, you will accomplish more and feel better.

A venture capitalist is by nature willing to risk it all, with the hopes of being part of the next Facebook or Twitter. In these blinks, you’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at the life of a venture capitalist to understand better how your start-up can secure the funding it needs to succeed. The goal is clear: you need to master the venture capital game if you want to win big. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how to build a great management team to attract investors; why success means having a great exit strategy; and why you should seek an “angel” before knocking on a VC’s door. If you’ve worked in or even founded a start-up, you probably know the importance of venture capital in realizing your business goals. But what exactly is venture capital, and how does it work? Venture capital is a form of private sector finance dedicated to helping new companies establish themselves and grow. “VC” firms usually seek out investment opportunities in growing markets such as information technology (IT) or biotechnology. In exchange for a cash infusion, the start-up gives the VC firm a significant share of company equity. The market for venture capital has boomed in recent years, as ever more start-up companies are founded and require investment to grow. Today it’s never been easier to launch a new company. In the 1990s, things were different. Start-up costs were stiff, with fledgling companies having to put together tens of thousands of dollars to cover the costs of servers and software licenses. As technological innovation has skyrocketed, the cost of starting a new company has fallen considerably. Cloud computing has slashed the cost of storage, as just one example. Today it can cost less than $5,000 to launch a beta version of a website or mobile app! VC firms know that while there’s plenty at stake, there is also serious potential in start-up ideas. While a traditional bank won’t typically grant a loan to a start-up without a marketable product, VC firms are willing to put up the needed cash early, betting on a serious future payoff. The term “venture,” in fact, refers to the risks that VC firms knowingly take when they invest in a new company. Some 60 percent of start-ups backed by venture capitalists, however, go bankrupt before the start-up can pay back the investment. In fact, just one out of ten venture capital investments turn out to be successful – but that one start-up just might be the next Facebook or Twitter! With the start-up boom, VC deals are being made all over the world. Yet how exactly does a VC firm function? A venture capital firm is usually structured as a limited partnership. Most investment capital comes from limited partners (LPs) while the fund’s general partners (GPs) invest that capital in various projects on a limited partner’s behalf. General partners also invest money in projects. Typically, if a general partner raises a total of $100 million from limited partners for a particular project, the general partner would probably throw in an additional $1 million to $5 million as a sign of the VC firm’s confidence in the project. VC firms ultimately have one goal, and that is to make a profitable exit when a funded start-up is either sold or goes public. A venture capital group will aim to pay back its investors a decent margin on their initial investments. Of course, the VC firm would like to earn some money itself if possible, usually around 20 percent of the final sale or public valuation. A venture capital firm pays for its expenses by retaining a management fee on the whole amount of its original investment, to the tune of about two percent annually.  So who do you talk to when you want to reach out to a venture capital firm? At the top of the hierarchy are general partners, managing directors and then partners. These are the people who make the big decisions and determine investment strategies. When you’re ready to pitch your great idea, these are the individuals you want to talk to. Every start-up needs cash to get off the ground. One way to secure needed investment capital, especially when you’re first starting out, is to find an angel investor. Angel investors are individuals who personally invest in companies to help them grow. The first “angels” appeared in Los Angeles in the 1920s. At that time, wealthy individuals financed the first Hollywood films. The term “angel” later spread to other business fields, and wealthy donors willing to part with cash to benefit young companies were dubbed business angels. Business angels have been growing in significance and power ever since. In 2011, for example, the total investment made by angel investors surpassed that made by venture capital firms. Start-ups can gain a lot from angel investors. Angel investments provide needed financial support without demanding much in return. This stands in stark contrast to venture capitalists, who usually demand enough shares in a start-up to allow them to influence company decision-making. Crucially, an investment from an angel can also provide lucrative networking opportunities, putting a start-up in a better position to secure further funding from a venture capital group. Let’s say your biotech start-up is working on a cure for cancer. Your costs are high, and you’re looking for $1 billion in investment. But no single entity could provide such a sum. An angel investor, however, could provide a small investment to finance your first lab trials; and if those trials prove successful, your next step might be to pitch a VC firm. Don’t ask for too much when seeking funding from angel investors, however. It’s unrealistic to expect $10 million from an angel. Angel investors usually invest from $500,000 to $1 million in a single project, just enough capital to push a start-up through its first year. The golden rule of real estate is location, location, location. For venture capitalists, however, it’s management, management, management. A start-up’s success depends on having a flexible yet skilled management team. It doesn’t matter if the start-up has a great business plan. Realistically, the management team will have to revise that plan, changing directions to respond to market needs and pressures. They will always need to be ready to face unexpected challenges. That’s why VC firms rarely invest in ideas alone. It’s a much safer bet to invest in a great team. Most successful companies are founded on strong, balanced teams. In fact, when you look at Silicon Valley success stories, a pattern emerges: a successful company often springs from the combination of a visionary leader with a global perspective, a technician with the skills to turn the vision into reality, and a salesperson who can tailor a product to market expectations. Computer graphic card pioneer 3Dfx was one such company. In the 1990s, the company’s founding trio included a visionary expert on polygonal mathematics, a professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology specializing in 3D mathematics, and a senior sales vice president with years of experience. This is the sort of team a venture capitalist wants. If a company is missing a key position, it’s an indication that the management team might not be well-balanced. What’s more, venture capitalists also question a start-up that can’t attract at least one founder with a solid technical background. In sum, if the management team doesn’t impress, a VC firm might feel the start-up isn’t yet ready for investment. Sometimes entrepreneurs can lose perspective and go on a spending spree after they raise needed capital. Let’s review common pitfalls so you can avoid making this mistake. Don’t pour too much money into marketing early on. Start-ups should grow by creating a compelling product that fills a market niche. If you’ve done your job well, you shouldn’t have to spend a lot of time or effort explaining your product – your product should speak for itself. For example, Facebook, Uber and Paypal have never spent a lot on advertising. Instead, these companies focused resources on building value into their products. True innovation is found when your start-up can identify a need that the market doesn’t even realize yet. Steve Jobs of Apple is the classic example of this sort of thinking: he felt that most people didn’t know what they wanted until it was shown to them. Market research will only get you so far; your idea needs to address not what people think they want today but anticipate what they’ll need tomorrow. An innovative concept alone won’t guarantee success, however. You also need a plan for getting your concept to the right customers. Venture capitalists want to know how a start-up intends to build a community around a product or service. Skype, for example, was particularly successful in this. When it was first developed, Skype was one of 200 start-ups offering a similar sort of telephony service. Yet the company set itself apart by placing a banner on Kazaa, a popular file-sharing service at the time. The banner said, “Don’t pay for your music, why pay for telecom?” This playful jab at “free” services appealed to the Kazaa community, and Skype’s user base quickly grew. Remember that your product has to have some viral potential; you can’t “make” it viral after it’s already on the market. YouTube, for example, allows anyone to upload a video and then embed it on another website. Thus YouTube-branded videos pop up everywhere online, a great viral concept. A venture capitalist’s core strategy is to invest in a start-up with the goal of turning a profit once that company is either sold or goes public. As an entrepreneur, you have to show potential investors that you’re aware of their goals by presenting a good exit strategy. The challenge for a start-up is to develop a sustainable business with steady revenue and loyal customers so that eventually, it can be sold. Not an easy task, and even Google struggled with it. Excite, one of the first internet portals, in the early 1990s had the chance to buy Google for $1 million. Excite turned down the offer, as Google had no revenue, and nobody knew how to monetize search engines at the time. You need to be aware of the ways potential buyers will view your start-up. The biggest deals are made when a buyer sees a target company as a strategic asset. Google acquiring YouTube was a strategic move, for example, as it sought to expand further into internet services. As you put together an exit strategy, remember that the best deals probably won’t come from number-crunching financiers. Emotional buyers, or those who have an urgent need to incorporate your company into their business, are the buyers you want. An emotional buyer might be an established company losing market share, for instance. If your start-up offers a chance for the company to stave off decline, they’ll buy no matter the price. And if you’re already on your way out of the market, an additional round of venture capital funding could help you better negotiate a sale. Twitter, for example, was interested in purchasing Instagram when negotiations began to stall. In response, Instagram raised additional funds, which boosted the company’s overall market valuation. This inspired Twitter to finally make an offer. Twitter might be sorry Instagram didn't take their offer, but Instagram was later sold to Facebook for twice that amount! Sometimes investors are reluctant to buy a company until competitors show interest in doing the same. Your competition could help you seal better exit deals, so use this strategy to your advantage. Venture capitalists are busy people. To secure needed financing, don’t waste the precious time they grant you. Have all your materials ready before you meet to make a good impression. Know that the days of lengthy, multiple-page business plans are long gone. Investors now want to see snappy, concise plans with clear goals. Entrepreneurs need to show that they can launch their ideas in the market and analyze results quickly – as well as be prepared to make big changes if needed. Today’s VCs deal with a ton of communication, whether email or otherwise, so they prefer bullet points that address big issues in few words. You should be clear about your start-up’s financial requirements, the talents of your management team, your current stage of development and future goals. Your business plan’s executive summary – just one or two pages, tops – should cover these key topics. Once you’re in the door, you can offer other supporting documents, such as the so-called investor slide deck. This is a set of ten slides that address your start-up’s most important issues, such as your competition or company value proposition. You also need to have a financial model to illustrate the viability of your project. Your model should offer three to five years’ worth of financial data, covering issues such as forecasted revenue, major costs and net results. All this should be clearly organized on a spreadsheet. A good model will accurately describe the factors that will determine your company’s profitability. Don’t skimp on the details! If you’re opening a restaurant, for example, you need to consider how many customers you’ll serve, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, potential raises in the cost of rent, and so on. One important detail that can play a huge role in your quest for financing is your pitch, or the brief summary of your project. You’ll need to prepare a few different versions of your pitch to use on different audiences. Use a quick, 30-second version at networking events, but have ready an in depth, two-minute version for people who want to know more. Prepare a 20-minute version for potential investors who want to know everything. Don’t skimp on your 30-second pitch, as it’s the most effective way to grab people’s attention. The founder of Half.com, an online marketplace for secondhand books, had a killer micro-pitch. At a networking conference, Half.com’s founder asked his audience which of them had read the latest bestseller. Nearly everyone raised their hands. Then, he asked how many people intended to read the book again – and nobody raised their hands. He then pointed out that everyone in the audience was a potential Half.com seller. Don’t confuse potential investors by mincing words. They want to know what makes you uniquely you, so don’t rely on generalities to describe your idea. Avoid things like, “We’re a mix between Facebook and Pinterest.” That doesn’t explain who you are or what your idea is. Avoid buzzwords, such as “disruptive lean start-up.” Which start-up isn’t? Such buzzwords offer little insight into your actual concept. Finally, learn how to tell a good story. Your investors want to be persuaded, so hone your speaking skills and bring your idea to life. Don’t be defensive when answering questions, either. It’s normal for investors to ask for more details about an idea or plan. If you bristle at questions, you might come off as nervous or unprofessional. The key message in this book: Venture capitalists have become increasingly influential in the start-up scene, as nearly every major technology company launched in recent years was funded by a VC firm. Aspiring entrepreneurs need to know what VC firms are looking for and how to best present themselves to them. So hire a great management team, learn how to pitch and show that you understand a VC’s goals regarding exit strategies. Securing funding is a crucial part of bringing your start-up dream to life.

From its early beginnings as a pet project realized in a Harvard dorm room to its status as one of the most popular websites in the world, Facebook has achieved both technological and business success. Facebook has also spurred radical societal change. From how we consume media to how we communicate with each other and the world, Facebook’s influence is vast – and these blinks will show you how the social media site got so powerful, and what it means for you. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: how Facebook helped bring police brutality to light in South Africa; how U.S. President Obama used Facebook to help win the 2008 election; and how a new form of journalism is being created when you “like” and “share.” Facebook didn’t invent social networks; in fact, the concept has been around since 1985. Early social networks took the form of electronic bulletin boards. If you were a member, you could “chat” with other members online about common interests. One of the earliest online communities is the The Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link, or the WELL, which is still active today.These early communities evolved rapidly as technology developed. Members could create personal profiles, establish private groups or even chat in real time in “chat rooms,” somewhat akin to today’s instant messaging. America Online (AOL) and Geocities were the first to offer such services. Classmates.com was another site that helped you find and contact that good-looking guy from your graduating class: a feature still integral to modern social networks. Strictly speaking, however, such virtual communities weren’t really social networks, according to the sociological definition of the term. In a true social network, a user can construct a profile, create a friend list, and use others’ profiles and friend lists to make new connections.  By this definition, the first real social network was start-up Sixdegrees.com. Its purpose was to map the relationships between people via member profiles that also listed friends and interests. The site’s draw was that you could “ find” someone in seconds through the site’s search engine. Yet we all know the most satisfying part of finding a “friend” online is seeing what they really look like! It wasn’t until 2002 when Friendster was launched, a social network that allowed a user to include a profile photo. With this feature, the site was an instant success. The following year, scores of new social networks popped up, including LinkedIn, Myspace, Spoke and Tribe. So by the time Facebook arrived, the market was flooded with competition. Yet from day one it clicked and its success has been meteoric since. What was its secret? Let’s go back to Facebook’s beginnings, starting in a college dorm room. Mark Zuckerberg was a tinkerer. As he was always messing around with coding projects, his Harvard classmates didn’t pay much attention to yet another project called Thefacebook in early 2004. Zuckerberg named his project after college “face books,” booklets that listed students’ names, class years and profile photos. Initially, Thefacebook was accessible only to Harvard students, although Zuckerberg secretly suspected that the site could be hugely popular. He launched Thefacebook on February 4, 2004. Just four days later, 650 students had joined; three weeks later, the number had grown to 6,000. Soon, the site’s popularity spread beyond Harvard, and by the end of May that same year, some 100,000 users from 34 schools had joined. Impressed? So was a financier who offered Zuckerberg $10 million for the site in June 2004. Zuckerberg, however, refused to sell. In September 2005, Thefacebook was renamed Facebook, following the advice of Napster founder Sean Parker. By October 2005, Facebook’s popularity had spread to schools around the world, and one year later, the network was opened to non-student users.    Over the following three years, the number of Facebook users skyrocketed to 145 million. By the end of 2008, nearly a third of worldwide internet users were on Facebook. Today Facebook is the second most-visited website after Google. As of June 2010, some 500 million people had profiles on Facebook, and an average of 25 million new users sign up each month. All this success – sparked not by a seasoned professional but by a young college student! Facebook’s meteoric success may seem unbelievable. Yet the site’s quick growth and popularity had a lot to do with being in the right place at the right time. Importantly, broadband usage rose dramatically around the time when Facebook and Myspace were launched. With faster loading times, social networking online has a lot more appeal. Higher connection speeds also were crucial for uploading and sharing photos, an important feature of the later Facebook. While launching Facebook amid a broadband boom may have been a lucky stroke, Zuckerberg also proved himself to be a savvy opportunist, timing the release when many Ivy League universities were seeking to put campus networks online. The campus setting was also crucial to Facebook’s success. As one of the leading universities in America, if not the world, Harvard had best and brightest minds, people with whom Zuckerberg could share ideas and eventually build a company. Facebook’s co-founders included Chris Hughes, who became the de facto spokesperson for the social networking site, and went on to spearhead online organizing for President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Not that students necessarily needed much convincing to join Facebook. Socializing is practically its own subject in a university setting, and a young audience keen to meet peers in any way possible was exactly the demographic that would make a social networking site immensely popular. As such, Facebook was a bit of a honey pot dropped into a swarm of bees, giving it a serious edge on other competing social networking sites at the time.   Though Facebook started as a social website for college students, today its popularity has spread around the globe. Yet how did it evolve? The site’s first significant milestone came in the fall of 2005. Early Facebook members liked that they could post a photo as part of their online profile, but as there was only room for one uploaded photo, users would frequently change their profile picture, even several times a day. Facebook in response developed a photo-hosting service so multiple photos could be uploaded and tagged with key information or other Facebook members’ names. With search, you could find all the photos of a particular friend, regardless of the profile on which they were displayed. Users quickly took to the new service and uploaded an uncountable number of images. The feature soon became one of Facebook’s most popular applications and what’s more, one of the most popular photo apps on the internet. Keeping tabs on how members used the service helped the company continue to evolve. In 2006, for example, the site introduced the news feed, a scrolling list of updates and information that keeps members informed of the status updates and activities of Facebook friends. In 2007, the company rolled out a less visible but nonetheless significant change with the launch of the Facebook Platform, a software environment for third-party developers to develop services or applications that interact with core Facebook features. One of these services is Marketplace, which allows you not only to post advertisements but also to purchase games and virtual gifts. Facebook Connect is another app that allows members to log onto third-party websites using their Facebook login and password. In 2009, Facebook introduced the like button, the virtual “thumbs-up” that has come to be synonymous with the social networking site. Members could now “like” photos, links and comments on Facebook. Though Zuckerberg is famous for his online networking site, he was in fact also skilled in creating offline networks.  Zuckerberg recruited some of his closest friends as supporters and early collaborators. While his college roommates were initially skeptical of the project, Zuckerberg eventually won them over. Eduardo Saverin would become Facebook chief financial officer, while Dustin Moskovitz would be vice president. Andrew McCollum crafted Facebook’s iconic logo and wrote the code for its search engine, and Chris Hughes was Facebook’s first spokesperson. Schoolmates and math whiz friends from Zuckerberg’s prep school days at the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy were also recruited to join the company. Notable among these was Adam D’Angelo, the company’s first chief technology officer. Another former classmate went on to become the chair of the Dartmouth Student Assembly, a valuable connection for Zuckerberg as Facebook expanded to other Ivy League universities. Zuckerberg also sought out the assistance of prominent, well-connected mentors. Sean Parker, the founder of peer-to-peer music sharing software Napster, helped Zuckerberg in learning how to deal with financiers, and even became actively involved in Facebook himself. Cofounder of Netscape and entrepreneur Marc Andreessen was another helpful mentor to Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg used his new contacts to make others. One year after the launch of Facebook, Zuckerberg approached Bill Gates for business advice. Steve Jobs was another vital mentor and friend to Zuckerberg during Facebook’s early years, and the two were often seen taking walks in Palo Alto together. From virtual networks to real-life networks, it’s clear that Zuckerberg knew the value of both. Yet many of us still don’t fully understand the power of Facebook itself. The next blinks will show you what exactly the Facebook effect is, and how it works. Considering that Facebook connects more than 500 million active members in just a few clicks, it’s not a stretch to say the service has changed how communities communicate and political issues are addressed on a global scale. We call this change the Facebook effect. One significant Facebook effect is political activism. In countries where organizing a protest march might land you in jail, building a Facebook group to address a wrong is almost as effective, and certainly safer. Such a virtual community is also better positioned to stay updated on abuses, injustice and corruption, news of which can spread quickly through Facebook. Moreover, Facebook makes political activism cheaper. You don’t need to spend cash on flyers for a demonstration; instead, you can invite people and inform everyone about the issues online. In Stellenbosch, South Africa, activists formed a Facebook group in 2008 to protest a series of brutal drug raids. In just two days, the group collected 3,000 members. Witnesses posted photo and video evidence of the raids online, while other members used the group to organise a protest march and start a petition. The Facebook group also mobilised victims of the raid to file complaints. The result? The police raid was critically investigated by the country’s Independent Complaints Directorate. Facebook has played a large role in political elections, too. In his 2008 campaign for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, Barack Obama used Facebook more skillfully than did his rival, Hillary Clinton. Obama’s comprehensive, personal Facebook page garnered millions of fans. He shared information about the bands he likes and impressed young voters with his hip shorthand.Interestingly, Chris Hughes, Facebook’s first spokesperson, at the age of 25 went on to take a senior role in the campaign’s online strategy team. The team created other Facebook pages to specifically address crucial demographics, such as “Veterans for Obama,” “African Americans for Obama” and “Women for Obama.” When we want to contact friends, we’ll often turn to Facebook without a second thought. However, the instinctive way we now use social media reflects a radical change in communications that Facebook has inspired. Facebook has already begun to supplant communication channels that were previously the norm. For many young people, writing an email seems an archaic exercise.   Immediacy and convenience are some of the key attractions of Facebook. We can share a status update with all our friends without the tedium of compiling a mailing list; if friends are online, we can chat with them in real-time. And if we’re curious to know the latest news, we can simply check a friend’s profile. Curiously, despite its 500 million users, interacting on Facebook is akin to living in a small town. Facebook’s ability to create a sense of familiarity among strangers overcomes geographical distance; members can easily keep in touch, no matter where they are in the world. And also like in a small town, we’re constantly surrounded by people who know us and care (or are at least curious) about us, and even the minor events in our lives. This mentality is reflected in the diverse and often unexpected range of topics that Facebook members share online. For example, imagine you’d just bumped into an acquaintance you don’t know well – would the first thing you share be a picture of your lunch? Probably not, but on Facebook, this is common and accepted behavior. When we use Facebook, we’re able to turn groups of former strangers into a tightly knit community. Moreover, as a platform that combines several online methods of getting in touch with people, Facebook is slowly but surely eroding other methods of communication. Do you want to be a journalist? With Facebook, you can report, write and publish as if you were one. And if your story’s interesting, your post just might go viral, reaching thousands of people. Facebook users have come to exercise more influence over media content and how it is received. Traditionally, a newspaper editor would choose which stories were the most important; today, every time you “like” or share an article, it gets pushed to more and more readers. Citizen journalism has also become a more serious pursuit, with people posting information about breaking news from the source. Sometimes, “real” journalists learn about the news from Facebook! For example, in 2010 CNN newscasters first learned about the Haiti earthquake via Facebook posts. Facebook too is posing a financial threat to traditional media, by eating up a significant share of brand advertising previously reserved for print and television. As a result, media ad revenue continues to fall, while the number of advertisers on Facebook tripled between 2008 and 2009. Some of the largest U.S. brands advertise through Facebook, including PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Sears. So as they say, if you can’t beat them, join them. Media companies are now beginning to work with Facebook, rather than compete against it.   For example, the Huffington Post as well as other news outlets have integrated Facebook into their own websites, enabling members to share and discuss news pieces. CNN teamed up with Facebook for a live messaging event during President Obama’s inauguration, in which millions of users could watch the ceremony live and simultaneously chat or update their Facebook status. What does your best friend know about you? What about your boss? What we share with others and what others share about us has changed considerably with the advent of Facebook.  For many, Facebook has made separating the professional and the personal a challenge. Usually we adjust how we present ourselves depending on the situation. A bank clerk, for example, may present herself as staid and respectable at work, only to slip into a biker jacket and play in a punk band with friends after hours. The two personas in “real life” seldom mix. Yet on Facebook you can only have one identity, and your profile is visible to friends and acquaintances from every corner of your life. So if you post something personal, chances are that events and details from one “part” of your life will spill over to others. Our bank clerk’s drummer may post pictures of a crazy gig on Facebook, images the clerk might not want her boss to see. But the photos might nonetheless reach her boss, even if he’s not among the clerk’s Facebook friends. Crucially, we can’t control what others post about us on Facebook. Our friends may say embarrassing things or post embarrassing pictures, in which we’re tagged and also can’t remove. Thus, our sense of what is private has changed radically with Facebook. Yet Zuckerberg, as well as others, have said that increased transparency in all situations will minimise what we have previously considered private. While we might hide information that we think could discredit us, once enough people disclose the same or similar information – hard drug use, health issues or whatever – then this information becomes less discrediting and more normal. And perhaps then, what was private will become public and sharing any information is no longer a concern. Or, the converse could become true. We might try even harder to control information we deem private, to the extent where we refuse to disclose personal matters in any setting, online or off. The key message in this book: Through timing, effective networking and nimble business positioning, the social networking site Facebook has become an astonishing success story. The site connects friends and strangers from across the globe, facilitating activism and changing the face of media. Facebook too has changed how we talk to each other and radically altered what we see as private or public. Actionable advice: Take care of what you share!  The next time you think about share something private on Facebook, be sure that the information will reach only the people with whom you really want to share it. Once it’s out, you can’t take it back! In addition, ensure that you understand Facebook’s privacy policy before you post anything to the site.

Drucker","summary":"They say that one sign of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results, and this is exactly why a lot of organizations struggle – they go about their business as usual while wondering why they don’t see any growth or positive changes. What struggling organizations need to do is ask the tough questions. Author Peter F. Drucker has narrowed things down to the five most important questions. By asking yourself these five questions, and answering honestly, you’ll soon have a much better understanding of what’s working, what’s not and what needs to be done to get on the right track. While Drucker’s expertise focuses on non-profit organizations, these questions will help any executive, manager or small business owner get a better sense of what’s really important. In these blinks, you’ll discover how an ER mission statement revitalized its effectiveness; how a school has far more customers than you may think; and what a museum can teach you about having flexible action plans. If you’re the leader or manager of any sort of organization, there are five questions that you should ask yourself if you want your organization to be the best that it can. The first question is “What is our mission?” It’s the number one question because it identifies the objectives and goals that you and your organization are aiming to fulfill. The answer to the question is no less than the primary reason for your organization’s existence, and therefore it will be the guiding force and the common bond that holds your organization together. Given how important your mission statement is, you should take care to make sure it accurately reflects the commitment, ability and hope of the organization. However, the statement should still be both accurate and concise enough to fit on a t-shirt. While consulting at a hospital, Drucker was tasked with helping administrators come up with a new mission statement for the emergency room (ER). Their first attempt was “Our mission is health care.” However, it became apparent that the ER wasn’t caring for health as much as it was caring for illness. They also wanted to recognize the fact that in eight out of ten cases the job of the ER staff was to tell patients their problems could be solved by a good night’s sleep. With these considerations in mind, the mission statement became “To give assurance to the afflicted.” Immediately, the hospital found that this mission helped ER staff re-evaluate their priorities, and the patients began to be seen much quicker. A strong mission statement can also help your organization adapt to a changing world, while not losing sight of its core objectives. In every organization, there can come a time when your principles need to be fixed. To do this, you need to separate the flexible elements from those that are non-negotiable. Take a modern church, for instance. If a church is to endure, it needs to recognize that people, and how they worship, change over time. Yet for the most part, the mission or ideology of a religion is non-negotiable. Likewise, the mission of the international scientific community isn’t going to change much, even when old theories are replaced by new ones. No matter what, the core mission remains the same – the advancement of human knowledge. Last but not least, a strong mission can help you decide whether an opportunity is right for you. The Girl Scouts of the USA’s mission is “To help a girl reach her highest potential.” When it was offered a lucrative deal to canvas for a charity organization, the management declined as the opportunity would not help the girls to reach their potential. Knowing your typical customer is key to any business’s success. As an executive at Ford Motors once said, “If we’re not customer driven, our cars won’t be either.” Therefore, the second question for a successful organization is “Who is our customer?” In answering this question, you should be careful to distinguish between your primary customers and supporting customers; so that you’re focusing on the primary while making sure the supporting aren’t neglected. A primary customer is one whose life is directly changed by your product or service. The author once consulted for a mid-sized non-profit with the mission “To increase people’s economic and social independence.” They defined their primary customer as someone “with multiple barriers to employment.” This was a good definition, since it could apply to a range of people with different circumstances, yet was still very clear. A supporting customer is someone who you want to satisfy, but isn’t the focus of your mission. In the case of the non-profit organization, their supporting customers could be local businesses as well as the family members and those caring for their primary customers. All of these customers can significantly help the organization to achieve its mission. Another reason to know your customers is to be aware of how your business is affected when they change. By knowing your customer, you’re able to recognize when you’re reaching a whole different group of people. This is what happened to a pastor that the author knew: The pastor launched a program at his church aimed at helping newlyweds. Imagine his surprise when the only people who showed up were cohabiting, unmarried couples unsure about marriage. By knowing your target audience, you’ll be sure to recognize when others are being unexpectedly attracted to your product. Also keep in mind that the world is continually shifting – if a completely different audience is taking over, you’ll have to know when it’s time to evolve alongside your customer base while staying true to the mission that’s helped you succeed. The next question is one that gets ignored more than all others, yet it’s essential for every organization: “What does our customer value?” By asking this question, you can avoid the pitfall of assuming what your customer wants, and instead get valuable feedback directly. When you have a deep understanding of your primary customer’s values, you’ll be in a position to maximize your ability to satisfy your customers’ needs. For example, when a homeless shelter discovered the values of their primary customers, it led to profound changes in the values they placed on food and bedding. The organization conducted a series of face-to-face customer interviews which revealed that, while food and clean beds were appreciated, they ranked almost zero compared to satisfying the customers’ primary need: not to be homeless. As a result, the staff put more time and resources into working alongside their customers to help them achieve their goal. This included extending how long they allowed people to stay at the shelter. By making the period longer, it helped to create a safer, more home-like environment. This question also changed the way the Sinai-Grace Hospital operated. When Patricia Maryland was hired as the hospital’s new president, she learned that it was known in the community as the “dirty hospital,” and patients were unhappy with how long they had to wait for service. With this customer feedback, Maryland knew what needed to be changed, and she led a massive reorganization of how the hospital was run. This included dividing the ER into separate areas for urgent care and patients with chest pain – reducing the wait time by 75 percent. Maryland also oversaw a complete refurbishment of the hospital to erase its “dirty” public perception. Through these customer-driven changes, the hospital was finally able to turn into a successful money-making institution. When asking this question about customer value, it’s important not to forget about the opinions of your supporting customers. For the principal of a school, this means taking care of the primary customer – the student – while not ignoring the many secondary customers, including teachers, the school board, community partners and parents. Each requires attention to make sure the teachers don’t go on strike, or the school board doesn’t fire the principal. In fact, only by satisfying the supporting customers’ needs can the principal make sure the school is well-run and that the students receive a high-quality education. With the mission defined and customers understood, it’s time to ask the next question. The role of good leadership is to know what needs to be fixed to achieve the organization’s mission. This means keeping a keen eye on performance and how it measures up against criteria. For this to happen, you need to ask the fourth question: “What are our results?” In focusing your attention on results, it’s important to recognize that long-term success often comes from short-term accomplishments. When thinking of the results you hope to achieve, make sure to think both long and short-term. The staff of a small, family-run mental health center defined its mission as “To enable the recovery of people with serious and persistent mental illness.” Not only did they judge their results against the ultimate goal of recovery, but they judged all the small steps it took for a patient to get there. This meant checking in on how many group sessions the patients were attending, whether there was a reduction of hospitalization and if there was an improvement in how well participants understood their conditions. All this helped the institution understand which programs were working and which needed refinement, so that more patients could return to a stable family life and a steady job. When looking at results, you should pay attention to both the qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative results are about subjective, non-numerical information that can help you understand your customers’ experiences. For the education director at a major museum, one great qualitative result was being told by a man that the museum had changed his life by opening up his teenage mind to a new world of possibilities. This inspired a new initiative at the museum to bring in more at-risk teenagers. Quantitative results, on the other hand, focus on statistics and numerical data. For many businesses, profit and earnings speak the strongest. But for a non-profit organization, the important numbers might also include the percentage of welfare recipients who gain employment after completing the company’s job training program, or whether child abuse rates fell after introducing 24-hour crisis care. These measures provide a clear understanding of the effectiveness of your organization and the difference it’s making. Appraising your performance will also help you with the last question. The final question every organization needs to ask is “What is our plan?” Any good plan should take into account all the important things, including your mission, vision, goals, objectives, action steps, budget and results. Planning should also include the uncertainty of the current business climate, define the specific place you want to take your organization and how you intend to get there. An effective plan should lay out your overarching goals in a way that translates into concrete steps – in turn leading to specific objectives. So, what kind of goals should you set for yourself? A smart set of goals should correspond to your desired future, and describe the long-range direction you need to take to get there. However, an effective plan shouldn’t have more than five goals; otherwise your attention and efforts will be spread too thin. Let’s look at a museum: A smart set of goals would align with their mission of bringing art and people together. Four goals for the museum might be: to seek and acquire exceptional works of art, to preserve collections and inspire partnerships, to grow the museum’s audience and strengthen bonds with members both new and old and to achieve long-term financial security. Once you have goals, they need to be turned into objectives – preferably ones that contain measurable action steps allowing you to clearly chart your progress. For instance, the museum’s goal of growing their audience can turn into the objective of increasing memberships by ten percent. Now you can create action steps leading to achieve this, such as offering discounted membership gift packs during the upcoming holidays. Plans, goals and action steps shouldn’t be written in stone. In fact, you should keep tabs on the effectiveness of your plan through regular performance appraisals, and if things aren’t going well, you should adjust your plan accordingly. Perhaps circumstances have changed, or new information has come to light about the marketplace or your target customers. Or maybe you’ve just found a better process, like focusing on sales through your website. Let’s say the museum starts a new exhibition, and it quickly becomes apparent that this is attracting high numbers of first-time visitors. This is an unexpected opportunity to turn these new visitors into subscribing members. Even though it wasn’t part of the original plan, your organization should be flexible enough to divert resources into this new strategy. Now that you know the five questions, it’s time to start putting them to work for you and your organization. The key message in these blinks: To truly bring success to your organization, you need to ask yourself the following five questions: What is our mission? Who is our customer? What does the customer value? What are our results? What is our plan? Actionable advice: Look to other successful organizations. Next time you hear about a successful organization, think about what makes them successful. What is their mission? Do they have a deep understanding of what their customers value?

Using his experience of political strategy, his media savvy and his deep knowledge of how political and regulatory decision-making works, Tusk has helped start-ups like Uber, FanDuel and Lemonade fight back against an establishment that wanted to eliminate them. In these blinks, we’ll discover how Tusk learned the craft of political campaigning and strategy, from securing press coverage for Chuck Schumer to ruining Anthony Weiner’s prospects for the New York mayoralty. We’ll find out how as an advisor to, and investor in, major start-ups, he has battled against corrupt decision-making, entrenched corporate interests and regulatory laziness. In these blinks, you’ll learn: what a funeral for dead trees taught Tusk about the power of the media; how Uber demonstrated that people power could override establishment interests; and why if things had been just a little different, we could have had President Bloomberg instead of President Trump. All politicians crave two things: Constant attention and constant validation. Outside of elections, the best way to achieve those is to get good publicity. Tusk learned this in the 1980s working for Henry Stern, a New York City council member and the city’s parks commissioner. Tusk’s job was to get as much publicity for Stern as possible, partly because it kept the politician happy, and partly because the more time the Parks Department spent in the public eye, the easier it would be for Stern to secure his budget and policies. Parks aren’t inherently that interesting, so Tusk was forced to be creative. When Stern wanted to push for new measures to make it a crime to fell trees without permission, Tusk staged a funeral for \"murdered” trees. When a new bathroom was constructed in one of the city’s parks, the media were invited not to a ribbon-cutting ceremony, but the ceremonial cutting of a toilet roll. The press lapped it up, the coverage was great, and Stern was happy. Tusk’s creativity came in handy in his next job, as communications director to Chuck Schumer, Democratic senator for New York. Schumer understood that most voters don’t really know what politicians do all day. But they do like to see that their politicians are busy. As a result, the whole Schumer operation revolved around getting constant media coverage. This could be difficult, because as a junior senator, Schumer didn’t have all that much to do. So Tusk and his team would invent things, like writing a tough letter to the Ford Motor Company in protest at the rising cost of windshield wiper liquid. On one occasion, Tusk worked up and released to the media a proposal for the modernization of the old-fashioned, unreliable voting machines used in elections. This idea proved unexpectedly prescient when, weeks later, the 2000 presidential election descended into chaos due, in part, to disputed votes made on old-fashioned punch-card machines. It seemed clear that America needed a new system. An avalanche of press coverage for Schumer – now regarded as the expert on the subject – ensued. Tusk learned how to give his political bosses what they craved. And that was an important lesson for his future career: if you can mold the media narrative, you can get what you want from politicians. When Tusk became campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg’s bid for a third mayoral term in 2009, the outlook wasn’t great. During eight years in office, Bloomberg had put up taxes, raised water rates and cost New Yorkers a lot of money. The mayor was in for a fight, whoever his opponent turned out to be. But what Tusk wanted to avoid was going up against state congressman Anthony Weiner. At the time, Weiner was a leading Democratic contender. He was charismatic, a great fundraiser, and – importantly in multiethnic New York – a Jewish guy with an Italian name. So Tusk built an entire campaign solely to knock Weiner out of contention for the Democratic nomination. How? By making Weiner feel like the risk of standing was so great that he would simply quit. This entailed fighting dirty to make Weiner nervous about the scrutiny he’d face if he did run. The only legislation Weiner had passed was a bill giving more visas to models. Tusk’s research team found that Weiner had received donations from some of the models in question. This was not just pay-to-play – donating in return for favors – it was also illegal, as only US citizens can make donations. After a briefing from Tusk’s team, the New York Post ran a damaging story about “Weiner’s ‘Naughty’ Hottie$.” Tusk also wanted to intimidate Weiner with a show of strength when canvassing voters house by house. Normally, starting this activity early is pointless, as voters largely ignore elections until near voting day. But this time, the aim wasn’t to win votes. It was to intimidate Weiner. Bloomberg volunteers went doorknocking in Weiner and his family’s neighborhoods. When Weiner’s dad opened his front door to the Bloomberg campaign, it sent a message. Tusk did the same with digital, bulk-buying online adverts, but only for users in Weiner’s zip code. Every time Weiner went online he’d see \"Bloomberg for mayor” ads. The highly personal, targeted strategy worked. Eventually, with his polling numbers looking weak, and his sense of personal jeopardy growing, Weiner chose not to run. Bloomberg went on to win a third term. This was Tusk’s last campaign in politics. He got a bonus, $234,000 after taxes, from a grateful Bloomberg, and used it to set up a political strategy consultancy. Things started a little slow, but then Tusk took a call from a contact. A transportation start-up was having problems. Could Tusk help? Today, Uber is part of everyday life for millions of people. But not long ago, the rise of the ride-hailing company was under threat from all sides. The unions hated Uber because they couldn’t organize its drivers, who were all small businessmen. The taxi industry hated Uber because lifelong taxi users were abandoning them overnight after experiencing a single Uber ride. Regulators disliked Uber because it was new and different. And politicians hated Uber because their donors from the taxi industry were harassing them about it. In response to these challenges, Uber hired Tusk. Washington DC was an early example of the fight they faced. At the request of the city’s taxi commissioner and taxi industry, a local politician introduced legislation that would, in practice, ban Uber. Tusk had seen time and again in his earlier career that politicians can be manipulated if you can shift the public narrative. Politicians don’t necessarily consider issues by looking for the best public policy solution. They think \"Is this going to anger my donors? How is this going to make me look good or bad in the media?\" Therefore, Tusk aimed to demonstrate that popular opinion on this issue was so strong that it outweighed the interests of taxi-industry donors. Tusk’s team crafted a press release accusing DC politicians of keeping transportation prices artificially high to protect the influential taxi industry. This started to shape the media narrative. Then, through its app, Uber encouraged drivers and customers to contact their DC city council member directly to express their anger at the ban, providing the contact details to do so. Usually, a city councilor gets just a couple dozen calls or emails about even a contentious issue. So they were not prepared for what happened next – almost 40,000 tweets and 50,000 emails from Uber users and drivers to city politicians in just a couple of days. When you can show a politician that your ability to generate negative media and hurt his poll ratings far outweighs the benefits of keeping his donors happy, then you can get him to do pretty much anything you want. After Tusk’s campaign, not only was the legislation abandoned, but new legislation explicitly authorizing Uber passed unanimously later that year. But Tusk and Uber would still face a hard fight with higher stakes. Nowhere was more important to Uber than New York, because what happens in the nation’s cultural and financial capital sets a precedent that other cities and states often follow. Unfortunately for Uber, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed legislation to limit Uber’s growth at 1 percent a year. In effect, de Blasio’s bill would kill Uber in the Big Apple and send a huge negative signal to the world, likely damaging Uber’s growth elsewhere. Tusk came up with a strategy to surprise de Blasio. Firstly, they hit him from the left. De Blasio’s whole brand was about being on the side of New York’s vulnerable – people on lower incomes, immigrants and people of color. But these were precisely the people who benefitted from Uber, whether as drivers or users. So Tusk ran ads that featured passengers from the Bronx and from Queens. They related how yellow taxis ignored them because of the color of their skin, and how with Uber they could finally reliably catch a ride. De Blasio was suddenly on the wrong side of his own supporters. Secondly, they pushed the idea that de Blasio’s agenda was pure corruption. Taxi drivers were the mayor’s second largest donors, and Tusk would later discover that the industry had written the legislation that de Blasio published. The taxi industry in New York had deep pockets, but Uber was rapidly eating up their market. Tusk’s team generated media stories about the dubious links between the mayor and industry, and suddenly, de Blasio looked to be the very thing he’d always railed against – a man in the pocket of moneyed interests. Thirdly, Tusk again unleashed the full power of Uber’s users. Uber added a \"de Blasio” button on the app. Users who tapped on it received an explanation of the problem, along with a request to email and tweet their council members. In just one week, 250,000 people did just that. After a couple of weeks of pressure from the media, drivers and users, city council members started to drop support for de Blasio. Supporting de Blasio and the taxi industry was no longer more important than stopping the public beating they were getting from real voters. A little later, the mayor’s office abandoned the bill. Uber’s future was safe. Handy is a platform that connects customers with handymen and cleaners. The workers are independent contractors, just like Uber drivers. But the start-up planned to do something new – to give its independent contractors benefits like a pension or healthcare. Handy’s idea was to set up a benefits fund that other sharing economy platforms like Uber or Lyft could also pay into if they wished. Potentially millions more American workers could get benefits while maintaining the flexibility of being an independent contractor. All Handy needed were clarifications to labor laws so that contractors paying benefits wouldn’t be reclassified as full-time employees. So who stood in the way of this improvement to working conditions? Surprisingly, unions and Democratic politicians. Unions hate independent contractors. They can’t organize them, represent them or, crucially, charge them membership dues. And the United States’ existing, vague labor laws gave unions influence. Vague laws meant unions could put pressure on politicians – usually in receipt of union donations – to apply state laws in a way that prohibited the rise of independent contractors and the sharing economy. Tusk and Handy took the fight to New York but immediately ran up against a brick wall in the form of SEIU 32BJ, the union for security guards and janitors. SEIU 32BJ doesn’t represent any housekeepers, but nonetheless regarded anything related to cleaning as their jurisdiction and wouldn’t give ground. The union’s president, Hector Figueroa, had good political reasons not to. After all, he would soon be up for re-election. His opponents would pounce on any sign of weakness, like modifying New York’s labor laws in a way that could make life easier for non-unionized independent contractors. When Tusk’s team talked to the office of the state governor, Democrat Andrew Cuomo, the problem was clear. Cuomo’s labor-issues representative clearly understood Handy’s proposal. But the same question kept coming up \"What’s 32BJ’s view on this?\" The governor wouldn’t do anything that the union opposed. Tusk didn’t win this fight in New York. But he and Handy continue to battle at state and federal levels to secure new laws. Sometimes, creative campaigns can overcome self-interested politics. Other times, that creativity needs to be matched with persistence. The ancient Greek philosopher Pericles said that just because you take no interest in politics, it doesn’t mean politics isn’t going to take any interest in you. The daily fantasy sports industry should have heeded those words when it was thrown off course by a political risk it didn’t see coming. Daily fantasy sports games are now big business. The games allow fans to create fantasy team lineups for major sports like the NFL and win money depending on their selected players’ performance in real-world games each day. In 2014 and 2015, the new market grew incredibly fast. The two companies which account for almost all the market, FanDuel and DraftKings, received hundreds of millions in investments, and their customer base rocketed. The two businesses were so relentlessly focused on competing with one another that they didn’t give much consideration to the opponents they shared. These included the casinos, who have long established and tight relationships with state governments, and the politicians and advocacy groups from both left and right who hate gaming. Tusk even met with FanDuel in 2015, but while the business liked Tusk’s ideas, it was so focused on its competition that it felt political strategy wasn’t a priority. So FanDuel were poorly prepared when, in October 2015, the New York Times published a damning accusation claiming that a midlevel DraftKings employee had used confidential information to enhance his teams in a FanDuel competition, winning $350,000. The accusations would never be proven, but the damage had been done. The attorney general for New York State announced an investigation into the industry, and other states followed, urged on by local casinos and anti-gaming advocates. Suddenly, the legality of daily fantasy sports was in doubt in 39 states. The situation rapidly turned into a lobbying match between casinos and daily fantasy sports. Tusk, now working with FanDuel to fight back, knew well that in a battle between long-time political donors – the casinos – and start-ups with no political relationships, the casinos would win. Unless, just like with Uber, they could fight back with a wave of customer advocacy so big that politicians wouldn’t be able to ignore it. Using the FanDuel app, 150,000 customers contacted their state legislators. By the end of the 2017 legislative session, they’d passed legislation securing daily fantasy sports in 15 states. It was a good outcome but, had the start-ups been better prepared, they wouldn’t have needed to defend themselves. If you’ve ever had to deal with all the bureaucracy and costs of traditional insurance companies, you’ll probably agree that the industry needs a little disruption. So Lemonade, a fully digital insurance company that promised easy sign-up, low prices and a typical payout time of three seconds, seemed like a pretty good bet to disrupt the industry. Lemonade’s model was different from normal insurers. It was based around customers paying into a pool from which Lemonade drew its costs and profit, and from which any claims were paid out. Any money left over in the pool at the end of the year would be paid back to customers instead of Lemonade keeping it as profit, as a traditional insurer would. There was just one problem – the New York Department of Financial Services, or DFS, was refusing to grant Lemonade an insurance license. Lemonade seemed to be too different to tick all the boxes needed to grant a license because DFS’s inflexible processes were based around traditional insurance models. It was clear to Tusk that simply talking to the regulators wouldn’t work, so he decided on a political strategy. Tusk and Lemonade would persuade the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, to overrule the regulator by showing the high political cost if Lemonade wasn’t approved. As a start-up, being able to take on the regulator and politicians depends on having a couple of things: a narrative into which the media can buy, good inside lobbying, money to spend on advertising, the ability to hurt the politicians by leaving town and the moral high ground. Luckily, Lemonade had them all. Tusk’s team started spreading the story that New York was so under the influence of its entrenched business interests that innovative Lemonade would be forced to relocate to London. This was supported by a more aggressive line. A researcher collected lists of political donations from the insurance industry to Cuomo, enabling Lemonade to pitch stories about pay-to-play decision-making. Tusk’s team prepared a letter from a group of venture capitalists saying that if New York couldn’t license an innovator like Lemonade, what was the point of investing in the city’s tech sector? Tusk saw some signs that the DFS’s senior team were getting nervous about the pressure, but with no decision forthcoming, Tusk’s lobbyists told the governor's office to make up its mind. Either the newspaper headlines the next day would say that New York just approved an innovative, customer-friendly insurance business, or they could say that one of the hottest start-ups in the United States just left town because the governor preferred bureaucracy to jobs. A few days later, Lemonade was approved. Michael Bloomberg looked, on paper, like a great candidate for the 2016 presidential election. He was an independent at a time when distrust for both parties was high and he could self-finance his entire campaign, meaning he wouldn’t be beholden to any special interests. In early 2016, Bloomberg started seriously considering a run for the presidency, and Tusk agreed to take a leave of absence from his business to run the campaign if it went ahead. The strategy for victory was complicated. Bloomberg could never win a majority in the electoral college – the usual route to the White House. But if he could win enough states to prevent anyone else getting a majority, then the House of Representatives would have to elect the president. Then he might be able to secure the critical votes. Tusk had to get imaginative about how Bloomberg would get his vote out. After all, Bloomberg had no party infrastructure on which to rely. So he made a proposal to Uber. If the Bloomberg campaign would pay for a ride for every United States voter to and from the polling station, would Uber put a Bloomberg button on its app? Customers taking a free ride wouldn’t have to vote for the guy, of course, but there was a good chance they would. Tusk’s second idea was to differentiate Bloomberg from Clinton and Trump. He wanted to build the campaign around the idea that one person can’t solve America’s problems alone. But if you believe America is broken, went Tusk’s thesis, Bloomberg will give you a team of the brightest and best to fix it. The idea was to recruit the most talented people to fill the government. On Tusk’s wish list were Bill Gates for education secretary, Elon Musk for energy secretary and Warren Buffett for the Treasury. In the end, Tusk’s innovative campaign ideas didn’t matter because Bloomberg decided not to run. At the time, the polling indicated that he was most likely to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances if he ran, increasing the chances of Trump getting into office. That, for Bloomberg, was the issue settled. He wasn’t prepared to risk letting Trump take the presidency. For Tusk, the decision was hard to swallow. It meant missing a once-in-a-lifetime chance to run an innovative presidential bid on an unlimited budget. And when Trump's victory later came to pass, Tusk regretted the lost opportunity of a Bloomberg presidency, which could have – in Tusk’s view – offered a safer, better America. Traditional businesses have a competitive advantage when it comes to politics. They know plenty of politicians, have lobbyists in all the right places and make tactically savvy donations. They’ll use all of these advantages to stop the start-ups trying to disrupt their markets. So if you work for or have founded a start-up, it’s time to even things up. Here’s how to get a little savvier about how to fight back. Firstly, if you aren’t clear whether your product or service complies with all regulations, then work out whether to ask for permission before launching or just get on with it and beg for forgiveness later. Uber took the latter approach, deciding that its best interests lay in rolling out the service without asking regulators for explicit permission. It quickly built a loyal customer base and then fought its regulatory battles – begging for forgiveness for any infringements it had committed and working through its problems from a position of strength. As Uber showed, this can be a powerful approach to take. But it isn’t always right. A key question to ask is \"from whom would you be begging?\" There’s a big difference between dealing with an irritated regulator and finding yourself up in front of a judge and jury with the prospect of a jail sentence. Try and avoid the latter. Whatever approach it takes, every start-up that threatens the status quo will face a political fight at some point, so consider what tools you have to fight with. Firstly, what are your politically valuable assets? Can you either give or take away? Like jobs, for instance, or your HQ. Can you threaten a move out of the state? Secondly, who are your allies? Fighting alone is hard, so try to build a coalition that will convince your decision-makers, whether that means consumer-rights advocates or VC investors. Or get creative – perhaps a local politician has recently gotten tough with a different start-up and wants to prove he isn’t completely anti-innovation. If so, recruit him to your cause. Ultimately, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to fighting political battles. But investing in understanding the politicians who could impact your business, and how to shape the narrative in a way that will keep them on your side, could prove to be one of the best investments you’ll ever make. The key message in these blinks: When you disrupt someone, in industry or in politics, they don’t thank you for it. They punch you in the face. So start-ups facing political and regulatory risks need to learn to punch back. They can do that by understanding how to shift the public and media narrative in favor of their interests by exploiting signs of corruption in political decision-making and by mobilizing their customers. If you are a start-up founder, getting savvy about politics could be one of the best investments you ever make.  Actionable advice: Incorporate political analysis into your expansion strategy.  If you are plotting market expansion, include an analysis of the political and regulatory outlook. Consider what laws may permit or limit your activity, and whether the political climate is pro-innovation or a little conservative. When weighing up potential new markets, consider how powerful your opponents are in each. That way you can be best prepared for any political battles ahead of you. Got feedback?

If so, what exactly makes them different? With insight based on more than 10 years of research and some 10,000 interviews with business founders in technology and life sciences, these blinks outline just what it is that sets today’s entrepreneurs apart from the pack. While founders may have particular characteristics that make them tick, they too face a daily set of unique dilemmas, conflicts and decisions that threaten their business’s success. In these blinks, you’ll learn how you can deal with challenges just like the pros so when you’re ready to launch your start-up, you’ll handle the worst without breaking a sweat. After reading these blinks, you’ll know what Evan Williams learned about hiring family before founding Twitter; how female entrepreneurs are different than male entrepreneurs; and what Pandora Radio did to ensure it had enough cash to start. Different things motivate different people. For some it’s prestige, while for others, it’s financial gain or autonomy. So what’s the difference between someone who wants a career and someone who wants to be an entrepreneur? While employees or career-oriented people find it challenging to give up a steady job and start a business, entrepreneurs find it hard to conform to desk life, and thrive on the risk and challenge of doing their own thing. A difference of motivation is really what separates these two worlds. For career people, security, prestige, financial gain and affiliation are the top four motivations. For male entrepreneurs, financial gain and control – in the form of power, influence, autonomy and managing people – are what moves them. Such motivations are expressed in interesting ways. The male founder of Blogger, Evan Williams, knew that his main motivations were power and autonomy. So much so that he turned down a buy-out offer worth millions of dollars, just so he could retain control of his company. Similarly, the female founder of Sittercity, Genevieve Thiers, was working at IBM in her 20s when she realized she felt stifled, like a cog in a machine. Realizing that autonomy and influence were what she craved, she quit her job to start her own company. Interestingly, the top motivations for female entrepreneurs are mostly the same as they are for male entrepreneurs: autonomy, power, influence, managing people and altruism. Note, though, the addition of altruism and the fact that financial gain has left the list. For female career people, in contrast, the top four motivations are recognition, affiliation, security and lifestyle. The first step toward becoming a successful entrepreneur is looking at yourself and defining your motivations. Have you figured out whether you have an entrepreneurial character? If so, read on. So you think you’re an entrepreneur? Does this mean you should drop everything and start your own business? Hold up for just a moment. Here’s one question to consider. Do you know how the product you want to make is manufactured? If you don’t, then maybe you need more human capital before you start. Human capital refers to the skills, knowledge and expertise in your business and in your intended industry. Barry Nalls, the founder of telecom service provider Masergy, was an employee at GTE, a large telecommunications company, for over 25 years, giving him plenty of relevant experience! The skills that Nalls gained at GTE guided him through several other small companies before he started Masergy on the strong foundation of his acquired knowledge. Understanding your product’s industry will help you avoid potentially fatal problems. It’s no surprise that founders who launch start-ups without applicable human capital have higher failure rates than founders who have previous experience in their start-up industry. When baseball star Curt Schilling launched his massively multiplayer online gaming (MMOG) start-up 38 Studios, he relied on skills gained from his sports career, such as a strong work ethic and the ability to lead. But he lacked experience in one key area: managing people. Schilling didn’t understand why employees needed or even wanted to take weekends off. Coming from a completely different industry, he needed to learn instead how people were motivated in the business world. So to save his start-up from failure, he had to learn fast. Human capital is vital, but it won’t be enough unless you’ve got another kind of capital up your sleeve: social capital. Your social capital is the social and professional network you bring to your company as a founder. It should allow you to access established resources, as well as discover new ones. The more connections you have before starting your business, the less time needed to build your business! Before starting Masergy, Barry Nalls had established professional connections with potential employees, customers, advisors and investors. That’s how he was able to make Masergy viable six months from launching the company. You have to find a balance, however. While it’s true that the more time you spend as an employee, the more social capital you can build, be careful not to find yourself handcuffed to a career while your dreams of becoming a start-up founder slip away. Potential founders that linger too long at companies spend too much time working on specific things and become too specialized in their knowledge. This makes them less likely to be successful founders, as founders need diverse skills to be truly effective. Nalls avoided getting stuck in a certain field while at GTE by making sure he spent less than two years in any one position before moving on to the next. Do you have enough cash to start and run your company? Similar to social and human capital, you will need financial capital to succeed. Barry Nalls founded Masergy on his own, as in addition to his experience and professional connections, he also had enough cash to start the business and cover living expenses until he made a profit. But many of us aren’t as fortunate as Nalls. So what should you do? Two heads, the old saying goes, are better than one. If you’re struggling to make ends meet while going solo, consider finding a co-founder. Before you do, take stock of your capital: social, human and financial. Do you have enough of each? In which area are you lacking? Identifying these holes will help you decide what your potential co-founder should bring to the table. Pandora Radio founder Tim Westergren came up with his idea for the business in 1999. Tim had knowledge about the music industry, had the appropriate connections and had sufficient funds to start. The trouble was, he had never worked in a business before. What’s more, his idea for an advanced music database would require highly technical skills that he didn’t have. He decided to wait until he could identify appropriate co-founders to help him realize his idea – a decision that was crucial to Pandora’s eventual success. Even if you have all the right capital, you may still want a co-founder, as the tasks of your new business might be too much or too many to handle alone. Or perhaps you’d rather focus on raising money and not human resources, for example.   Whatever your reason, when you bring on a co-founder, it’s essential that you balance your company’s roles – the reasons for which you’ll discover in the next blink. There’s no question that the coveted title of chief executive officer is one every entrepreneur wants. Who gets to be a CEO when there’s more than one start-up founder, however, is less clear-cut. The title of CEO usually goes to either the “most committed” co-founder or the person who came up with the idea for the company in the first place. So if you’re the person who has quit your day job to work full-time on your start-up, or the person who has invested the most seed capital, or the brainchild behind the original idea – then you’re usually CEO, regardless of your actual strategic or leadership abilities. But does this actually work? A better strategy for the long-term health of your company is to delegate roles according to your co-founders’s actual skills. Take Apple, for example. The technology company’s success was in part based on the early interplay between Steve Jobs’s sales skills and Steve Wozniak’s technical skills. In this situation, Jobs was the natural CEO while Wozniak headed up research and development. Of course, if you and your co-founders share similar skills, roles may overlap. At electronic ticketing start-up Smartix, the skills of its three founders overlapped, thus giving each the flexibility to delegate and better manage daily tasks. Preferable to this situation, however, is when you and your co-founders bring different skills to the table and thus can assume clearly separated roles. Why is this ideal? A proper division of labor lets you create greater accountability within your organization. At Pandora Radio, for example, one co-founder assumed responsibility for technical issues, another for administration and business development, and a third managed contacts with the music industry. This division of labor helped the founders to develop their own distinct roles and responsibilities. Each success or failure could be traced to its source, and no one could be blamed for someone else’s mistake. And most importantly, all tasks were completed when they needed to be. If you have two co-founders in your start-up, how should you distribute company equity? You may think that a 50/50 split is the best, if not fairest, option. But rarely is this so straightforward. The experiences of entrepreneur Evan Williams offer an interesting lesson in equity distribution. When building podcast publishing start-up Odeo, Williams decided to offer co-founder Noah Glass a 70-percent share in the company. Williams’s reasoning was that while Glass was working full-time on the project, he was working just part-time. Yet as the company grew and Williams started working full-time for Odeo himself, tension between the two co-founders over who should be CEO started to affect their working relationship. The dilemma was resolved, however, when Glass decided to leave the start-up. The moral of all this? Distributing equity early in the life of a start-up is not easy, as you just can’t predict what your co-founders will do down the road. The founders of technology start-up UpDown distributed company equity among themselves before they really knew each other’s abilities well. After a few months, it was clear that the division had underestimated the contributions of one founder and overestimated those of another. Attempts to redistribute, however, caused a lot of tension within the team. To avoid conflict, remember that it’s often better to postpone splitting equity until co-founders know each others’ skills and abilities, and most importantly, their actual commitment to the start-up. Who wouldn’t want to make it big with their best buddy? Working with people you know well can be easy from the outset, but potentially heartbreaking too. Founders often find that by hiring friends or relatives, they can build a more dedicated, driven organization. For example, Pandora Radio’s founders chose to hire people they already knew with the idea that friends and family would be willing to make more sacrifices and be more productive. Curiously, investors seem to agree with this strategy as well. Research has shown that companies that hire employees from their own personal networks received valuations that were 37 percent higher than companies that didn’t. Yet hiring friends has its disadvantages, too. It might be tough to talk about salary raises with a cousin or best friend; performance reviews too can become sensitive issues. Additionally, making tough decisions about team members is even tougher when a friendship is at stake. Pandora Radio founders had to juggle the well-being of the company with the feelings of friends and family when it came to company layoffs. The key thing to remember is that your hiring decisions should be based on your objectives for your start-up. Though Blogger’s Evan Williams hired from his own network to create a loyal, passion-driven environment, when he decided to hire for Odeo, he changed his tack. With Odeo, Williams was focused on gaining the maximum value for his start-up as quickly as possible, and so decided to hire employees based on their professional experience. Just as not everyone has what it takes to be an entrepreneur, not everyone is fit to be a start-up employee. Which sort of person then will make the cut? Surprisingly, it’s the generalists, not the specialists, who are worth your while. Start-ups in the early stages require a fluid strategy to cope with the ups and downs of a new business, thus employee roles should be fluid enough to manage these rises and falls. In fact, your very first employees may move quickly through radically different positions at the start. With that in mind, think how a specialist may struggle with this constant shifting. Imagine asking a life-long accountant to start handling Facebook posts, for instance! Your ideal start-up employee should also come with experience working in small companies as opposed to large corporations. Frank Addante of StrongMail learned this lesson the hard way. He hired a qualified vice president of sales who had previously worked for IBM and Oracle. Though the candidate looked great on paper, he was near useless for the first three months. The reason? He wasn’t comfortable with the responsibility of building a system from scratch. Being able to start small and work from the ground up requires a whole host of skills that a person often doesn’t gain from working in established systems. This also applies to managing people. Masergy’s Barry Nalls experienced this firsthand when he hired a sales manager who had a background working with larger corporations. Though the manager was capable when leading large teams, he was simply unable to work on his own. Teamwork is crucial in start-ups, as everybody has to contribute! You might find that you just need people who can work independently, and can do without managers at the start. Spend or save? This seemingly simple decision becomes a crucial one as start-up founders begin to grow their ventures. Should you look for outside support for your start-up, or tighten your belt and try and make as much as you can from what little money you have? The decision between bootstrapping – starting a company with little money – and raising capital depends ultimately on a founder’s overall goals and market competition. Some founders, however, choose to go it alone, based simply on gut feeling. When Jim Triandiflou and Mike Meisenheimer founded Ockham Technologies, they attracted investors who offered them some $2 million to get their project off the ground. The founders, however, turned the money down, seeding their start-up instead with $150,000 from their own pockets. Why did they do this? “We just felt that we should go sell something [first],” Jim said at the time. Evan Williams felt the same when he founded Blogger, having friends and family fund his start-up in exchange for equity. However, when he began working on Odeo, Williams’s approach changed. Realizing that the market was highly competitive and that other start-ups were edging in, Williams knew he needed to raise money quickly to enter the market first. So he courted top-tier venture capitalists to raise $5 million in return for 30 percent of the company. Venture capitalists, or VCs, raise capital from institutions and invest in high-potential start-ups. They often seek to protect their investments by improving a company’s organization and discipline. However, VCs are also known to introduce irksome bureaucracy and reporting into the mix, putting additional pressure on founders. Masergy’s Barry Nalls calculated the time he spends preparing for board meetings, and discovered that it totalled as much as a quarter of his time each month! The key message in this book: Entrepreneurship requires a particular blend of motivation and skill that is quickly put to the test in the early stages of a start-up. With a considered approach to capital needs, company organization and decision making, a savvy founder can overcome any dilemma that he or she faces.  Actionable advice: Get inside your co-founder’s head before starting your business.  If your start-up is run by two founders who are both motivated by control and want to be called CEO, it’s a recipe for disaster! To avoid this, make sure your management team is stable and each founder is aware of and understands the skills, abilities and motivations of the rest of the team before starting your business.

Typically, there will be anywhere between a dozen and a hundred projects, tasks and focus areas that are all “absolutely vital” and all in some degree of incompletion. In this storm, it would be useful to have a compass that clearly indicates priorities. These blinks are that compass. With them, you’ll know how to prioritize in the beginning, and what approaches simply can’t work. This will help you avoid the mistakes other startups have made, that have bankrupted them. In these blinks, you’ll learn: who your ideal first customers are, to identify what kind of market you’re operating in, and why it’s crucial to launch your product as early as possible instead of tinkering with your product till its perfect. Many business people labor under a fundamental flaw in thinking: they believe that startups are just tiny versions of big companies, and therefore to succeed they just need to use the same methods as the larger businesses. Not so. First, unlike large businesses, startups can’t usually introduce a new product to the mainstream market. Established companies have a pre-existing customer base and know their competitors well, so to come up with new products they use a product development process: first design a product and then find suitable customers. Startups on the other hand don’t understand their market environment, and need to first get to know their potential customers before developing a new product. They use a customer development process: first build a customer base and then create a suitable product. For example, Webvan, an innovative start-up that founded the first online grocery business in 1996, shows this customer development approach is crucial. Instead of researching its customers and their needs, the company focused on the product development process, and failed miserably. Second, unlike big companies that know their market and know how to sell to it profitably, the founders of startups have no idea whether or not their business idea will actually fly. It’s up to them to prove that their vision is viable. In this sense, entrepreneurs are like classical heroes, who are called upon to undertake a quest, and must journey into the unknown along uncertain paths, facing obstacles and difficulties. But thanks to their powerful initial calling, they persist and become heroes when they reach their goal. Similarly, entrepreneurs must also find a path to making their vision into a reality. They learn as they go, discovering who their best potential customers are and how they should conduct business. As stated in the previous blink, when a startup sets out to fulfill its visions, it may not yet know what path it will follow. This is why it needs to make some decisions right from the get go to help keep it on the right path. The first thing a startup must define is a set of fundamental and long-lasting core values to guide it on its journey. For example, a pharmaceutical company may decide one of its core values is “First and foremost, we make drugs that help people.” This value means that whenever it needs to decide about profits versus helping people, it’ll know what to do. Whatever core values a company chooses, it is important that they are authentic and the company stands behind them. And besides the core values, a startup also has to have a written mission statement. Why? You’ve probably also noticed in your personal life that if you want to achieve something, it’s easier if you write down a plan first. The same is true of a startup. To achieve its aims and objectives, it needs to write them down in a mission statement. Almost every startup goes through a period of turmoil in its early stages, and it is during this time that the mission statement will be especially vital in showing the way forward. Note that unlike the core values, the mission statement can change over time as the company’s business situation develops through, for example, launching new products and entering new markets. So how do you define these key parts of your company? The mission statement should answer questions like: why does our company’s staff come to work? What are our goals for growth and profit? How do we know when we’re doing good work? With authentic core values and a good mission statement, a startup has a much better chance of staying on the path to success. Each startup is different, and so it follows that the right strategy for each startup is, too. Mostly, the right strategy depends on the environment, or market type. The crucial question is whether the startup faces an existing or new market. An existing market is one where it’s clear who the customers and competitors are. The upside is that you won’t have to spend time gathering information on potential customers, but the downside is that you’ll be facing established competitors, whom you’ll have to outperform to successfully enter the market. One company that faced an existing market was the microprocessor startup Transmeta, which wanted to challenge Intel’s dominance with a new, Intel-compatible chip that had far superior energy efficiency. Transmeta saved time and money because it already knew its potential customers – anyone with an Intel-processor – and whom they were competing against –  Intel. But in the end, the established giant developed its own low-power chip that put Transmeta out of business.   The second type of market is the new market, which the startup creates by finding users. Though this is not easy, the upside is that there are no competitors yet. One startup that failed to create a new market was PhotosToYou, the first company to print high-quality photos from digital cameras in the late 1990s. It focused most of its resources on branding instead of researching who its potential customers were, and consequently struggled to reach prospective customers. Finally, startups also have a third option: resegmenting an existing market by offering a cheaper version of an existing product or a niche product. Resegmenting can open up a whole new customer base of people who could not afford the product before or who didn’t find a product that was right for their needs. For example, the fast food company In-N-Out Burger managed to capture some of the fast food market despite fierce competition from McDonald’s and other established players because it focused simply on offering higher quality hamburgers for the same price. Sooner or later, every startup will make a mistake. While it’s impossible to avoid any and all mistakes, it is better to catch them early. Startups can reduce mistakes and their impact by collecting lots of feedback from their users as soon as possible – even before there’s an actual product to sell! The goal is to find out if there’s market for your product: people who will actually buy it. If not, you’ll just have saved yourself a costly mistake, and by reviewing the feedback you’ll be able to change your product to better suit customer needs. Once this is done, you start the process again: collecting feedback and using it to optimize your product. At this stage, the goal is not to sell anything, but rather to collect as much information as possible. Let’s say your new product is a sheet of plastic that protects cell phone screens from cracks and scratches. You would probably want to ask how inconvenient people find broken screens and how much money they spend on replacing them, as well as what they feel the ideal solution would be. Just as startups can hardly afford mistakes, they also can’t afford to be slow and unresponsive, since they operate in an environment that is ever-changing. Stiff hierarchies and organizational structures that hinder fluidity are out of the question: if feedback indicates that a product should be changed or a new opportunity pursued, the startup can’t wait for someone up the chain of command to make a decision – competitors won’t. Every team member needs to have the authority to make urgent decisions. Now you know some of the keys to a startup’s success. But even if all these are adhered to, a startup may still fail. What is the final key to startup success? In the first blink, you learned that startups cannot follow the product development process used by big companies. Doing so can lead to a disaster. Startups who try this approach believe they can just build and launch a great product, after which customers simply appear. It rarely works. In fact, product development is just an internal product process, and to create products that people buy, it needs to be synchronized with findings from the customer development process, which focuses on external influences for the product’s success – customers. Consider the online-furniture retailer Furniture.com. It focused primarily on building an expensive website, a recognized brand and a large-scale shipping system before researching market demand. Unfortunately, it turned out customers weren’t ready for online furniture shopping yet, so all the effort had been for nothing. Rather than making this mistake, your startup should focus on the customer development process: build your customer base and ensure your products suit their needs. How exactly your startup carries out the customer development process depends on your core values and mission statement, but primarily on which market type you operate in and the feedback your customers provide on your product. The designer product retailer Design Within Reach honed in on this principle, adjusting every catalog it published according to customer feedback received from the previous catalog. The retailer’s attention to customer feedback resulted in increasing numbers of customers and a larger average order size. Have you ever had a problem so pressing that you’d be willing to pay anything for a solution, even if it wasn’t perfect? The ideal first customers of startups are in this position. In the beginning, startups have to sell their product to a small set of enthusiastic early adopters who have a pressing problem. For example, let’s say your product is a piece of software that helps banks cash checks, but it hasn’t been perfected yet. An ideal first adopter for this product would be a bank that loses something like half a million dollars every year because they have to do their check cashing manually. This problem means they’ll be happy to pay you that same half a million for your software. What’s more, by installing the software and seeing it in action, you’ll get information for developing it further. But many startups make the mistake of not looking for early adopters and, instead, spend a lot of time and money building a perfectly engineered product for the mainstream market. These startups fall into various traps – of then not having enough money to alter their product in response to customer feedback, or of offering a “perfect” product that is outdated by the time it hits the market. FastOffice fell into this trap in 1994. They offered a new home office device with email, fax and phone functionalities all in one. They raised $8 million in funding and focused on engineering the product just right. Still, sales were very disappointing, and unfortunately it was too late to tailor the product according to customer feedback, since most of the money had already been spent on engineering. Don’t make this mistake. Get the product out of the door as soon as possible to get real customer feedback and then tailor the product accordingly. No startup can remain a startup forever. To grow, it has to continuously build a customer base. This goal is achieved by targeting different customers over time: First comes the customer creation phase, during which startups have to decide whether to continue targeting customers similar to the early adopters, to enter a specific niche market, or to approach a broader range of customers. The answer depends on whether they find themselves in a new, existing or resegmentable market. By studying its customers, a startup might find out, for example that the early adopters are all under 35 years old and from big cities. Depending on the market type, the startup may then decide to either continue to pursue them or to shift focus. The main point is that startups can’t target mainstream customers before they understand how and why these customers would buy the product, and have refined their product accordingly. Once the product is refined, the startup finds itself in the company building phase, in which its sales grow. No matter how you decide to go after mainstream customers, you’ll have to adapt your strategy: you can’t simply repeat what you did for early adopters. Basically, you have two options: First, you can use your early adopters as cheerleaders. They’re enthusiastic about the product anyway since it solved a problem for them, and they can promote it to mainstream customers through word-of-mouth or by reviewing it in public. You can also use industry experts, bloggers and other thought leaders to spread the word. The second option is to utilize positioning: defining and describing your product so that your target customers recognize it, know its characteristics and what appeals to them. For example, Starbucks positioned its product with the slogan: “Starbucks is the No. 1 place for coffee.” These days, companies bombard consumers with advertisements and messages every waking hour. For a startup, it is crucial to send the right messages, because they can strongly influence the consumers’ perception of the company. A company’s messages range from how it names its products to the advertisements it uses. For example, Santa Clara County in California in 1981 had a rampant fruit fly problem, that led them to spray a pest-control chemical, called Malathion. Had it been called something like Bugs Away or Summer Dew, it may have gone unnoticed, or even appreciated. But it turned out residents were furious, since the product name sounds dangerous and harmful. Besides crafting the right message, it’s also important that a startup knows how to convey that message. As mentioned before, “unpaid messengers” like early adopters, industry experts and other thought leaders are effective. Nevertheless, paid media like advertisements in magazines, on billboards or websites should also be a part of the marketing communications strategy. To find out which media your prospective customers use, ask your early adopters what sources they used to inform themselves before making their purchase. You can also look at market research on what kinds of media potential mainstream customers, experts and opinion leaders use. Then target the sources of media that get the most attention from your customers. For example, if you find your target customers read only prestigious newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, don’t kid yourself into thinking you’ll reach them with ads in obscure trade magazines just because advertising there is cheaper. The key message in this book: Startups aren’t miniature versions of big companies. While big companies just implement their strategy, startups still have to figure out what their market and strategy are. To succeed, startups need to listen to their customers and have a flexible strategy. Actionable advice: Define the soul of your company: the core values and the mission statement. No matter what industry your startup is in, one thing’s for sure: you’ll have to handle plenty of uncertain situations, in which you don’t know the answers. Your core values and mission statement will guide you and keep you on the right path. So how do you define these key parts of your company? Your core values should somehow embody your morals, as well as include how you intend to differentiate your company from others, for example, in the the way you treat your customers. Your mission statement, on the other hand, should clarify your goals, the tasks to fulfill them and why your employees come to work every day.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

These are labels we often shy away from. Instead, being “normal” is preferred, blending in with the pack so as to not stand out. Why is this?  What if being a freak isn’t seen as a negative, but a positive; something to embrace and even champion? What if we’re all freaks on the inside? And importantly, how can being a freak actually help you succeed in business? Being a freak isn’t about trying on wacky clothes or hair colors, but about choosing your own path in your thoughts and in your life – truly living “outside the box.” Steve Jobs went through a period where he only ate apples, a quirk that led him toward the seed of one of the most successful computer companies in history. Tony Hawk did nothing but skateboard as a teen, his obsession leading him to international business success. Do you want to find your inner freak? These blinks will help you. Once you do, you’ll be well on your way to creating something freakishly good! In these blinks you’ll discover how street graffiti became the foundation of a successful fashion brand; how happy people in Okinawa “chose” their families; and why Thomas Edison invented 1,000 dim bulbs, and one light bulb. Have you ever felt out of place at school or work? If so, don’t sweat it. Being a freak can be a good thing! What’s a freak, exactly? Freaks are people who think differently than others. They don’t just want to conform and survive. They want to live.  Being a freak isn’t about looking a certain way. In business, freaks are people who leave a career to pursue a dream, even if that dream seems like a long shot. Freaks want to build their success upon their individuality – so of course they don’t play by the rules! Fortunately for freaks, the business world has seen enormous changes in recent years. It’s now possible for freaks to dominate. Previously if you wanted to make it in the business world, you had to stay in line and do as you were told. But as the internet and globalization have changed the way we do business, it’s much easier now for people to embrace their inner freakishness. Today, you can build a business the way you want to.  Marie Forleo did this when she left a job on the New York Stock Exchange to work in magazines. Not too long afterward, however, she read an article about life coaches and was inspired, and immediately started a training course to become one. She’s now a life coach and earns a seven-figure salary!  Societal attitudes about alternate career paths such as Forleo’s have changed, and they’re still changing today. It’s now more and more acceptable to start a career in a field you’ve never worked in previously.  R. J. Diaz, for example, was a construction worker before he decided to make his own line of bags and other goods. His friends were initially skeptical; yet in a short time his business took off. You don’t want to end up being one of those people who has great ideas but never turns them into reality. Let’s look at some strategies for acting on your inspirations.  The first thing you need to do is outline your definition of success. Once you have a clear understanding of what you want, you can start working toward it. Ask yourself: What do you want out of life? Maybe you want to work from home and spend more time with your family. Maybe you want to get promoted; maybe you want to travel the world. Set clear goals. Goals tell you where you’re going! It’s important for freaks to stay goal-oriented. Freaks often have great ideas but struggle with making a living, as they don’t understand how business works. You can’t sell your ideas if you don’t have a basic understanding of finance, marketing, or even sales!  Mark Ecko, the designer of Ecko Unltd, promoted his ideas cleverly when he was first starting out. He airbrushed clothing with graffiti, and painted people’s nails. He stayed devoted to his art and often tailored his work to the interests of his customers’ communities, which helped him build a loyal customer base. But achieving your goals isn’t just about understanding business concepts, it’s also about self-discipline. You might be motivated to go to the gym occasionally, but motivation alone won’t push you to work out three times a week, every week. That’s where self-discipline comes in.  Self-discipline is what guides you to achieve your goals. You can’t write a book if you’re sitting in front of the television! You need to learn the self-discipline to sit at your desk and write. Have you ever made a five-year plan? Or even a one-year plan? Many people think about it, but end up procrastinating. Here are some strategies to get you to start planning your life today.  Start out by making a weekly schedule. You want to feel like you’ve achieved something when you look back at the week, right? This means you need a clear plan for what you want to achieve! So organize your time. Each night, write out what you want to do the next day and start right when you wake up. Written plans motivate you to do more, so you can feel accomplished and then relax once the day’s work is done! Once you adjust to your daily routine, you can start upgrading. Develop a system for achieving bigger and bigger goals.  If you want to be fluent in Spanish within two years, for example, set that as your highest goal. Then work toward your big goal by completing smaller goals, such as learning vocabulary or grammar rules. Developing a system for achieving your goals is also the key to building a functional business. A business will fail if it doesn’t have an organized structure. So develop tools for keeping your business together, like publishing a newsletter.  Distributing a regular newsletter to employees is a good way to keep everyone on the same page. Newsletters allow you to spread information quickly and make sure everyone is working toward the company’s goals.  Even the biggest freaks need plans and organizational systems to succeed. A great idea isn’t enough on its own – you need a good strategy to bring it to life. Business skills are important, but it’s not possible for one person to have mastered them all. You can’t know everything about how a business works, so start with the most important concepts.   There are certain skills you simply must have when starting a business. A lot of business freaks falter here. You won’t succeed if you can’t grasp the reality and importance of earning a profit. You also need some basic finance and legal knowledge, even if you’re uncomfortable with the idea of doing math or negotiating contracts.  It’s normal to be a bit overwhelmed at first, but don’t give up! Design a system: aim to learn one important skill per month, and you’ll eventually have everything you need.  Remember that you don’t need to know it all, however. If a concept isn’t critical to your business, consider skipping it and seeking help from someone who understands it better.  The author uses this advice himself when counselling people on how to start their own websites. He explains that you don’t need to know everything about CSS programming, for example, as you can always hire a professional web designer, or even use WordPress templates instead.  When you outsource something you don’t know well, like web design, you then have more time to focus on your website’s content and other aspects of your business. It would be a waste of time to spend several months developing programming skills!  Remember too that it’s not the end of the world if you don’t understand every aspect of your business. Don’t ever stop learning, though. Even though you’ll never know everything, you should always work to acquire new knowledge.  Problems are a natural part of life. You’ll face problems as you build your business, just like you do in your personal life. If you can overcome personal problems, you can overcome business problems too! What matters most is how you deal with these problems. Instead of just giving up, change your mind-set by learning to enjoy challenges because of the opportunities they present.  Every new challenge is a chance to improve. Obstacles can make you a better person, so learn to love them! If you’re running low on money, for example, look for alternative ways to gain credit. If the bank doesn’t believe in you, find people who do. Seek out investors who share your vision. Naturally, you won’t always succeed, but that’s okay. Most people are afraid of failure, but every successful product in the market came about through a series of failures. As long as you don’t make the same mistakes over and over, it’s possible to fail in a constructive way.  That’s what Thomas Edison meant when he said he never failed when trying to invent the lightbulb. He just discovered hundreds of ways to make light bulbs that didn’t work! Don’t be afraid of quitting, either. We tend to think of quitting as a sign of weakness, but sometimes it’s the best thing you can do. Don’t stick to an idea if it isn’t working out. Move on to another freakish idea instead! The author wanted to become a fiction writer when he was a child. He pursued his dream into his early adulthood, but his career simply never took off. So he let go of this particular dream to cultivate his goal of becoming a nonfiction writer instead! So you’ve got a great idea for a product or service. How do you build a business around it?  The key is finding the right community of people. Communities are particularly important for freaks; even if you don’t fit into mainstream society, there are still people out there who work and think like you. Freaks often feel isolated, but really, a freak is never alone. Even if your passion is collecting Star Wars figurines or building Dr. Who replicas out of rice grains, you can always find someone who shares a similar interest.  Finding fellow freaks is an important part of developing your business. Think of them as a tribe in which everyone works together and helps each other.  Once you’ve found your tribe, build a community. It’ll take a lot of effort, but it’s worth it! Networking and connecting with other freaks is a crucial part of making a business flourish. People in Okinawa, Japan, understand this well. Okinawa is widely considered to have one of the happiest populations in the world, largely because of the region’s concept of monchu, which means “the family you choose.”  Once you’ve found your “family,” you remain committed to helping them find success, and they help you in return.  If you write a book that the people in your monchu enjoy, for example, they’ll tell their friends and family about it. Give your monchu something meaningful, and they help you in return. This sort of networking partnership is very positive when you start building your business.  So you’re ready to find your tribe, but how? Read on to find out. If you have a strong idea, chances are that other people have the same or similar ideas, too. Your competitors will certainly try to hone in on the same market niche.  How can you set yourself apart from the rest? In a word, media.  Use the media to tell your story. Good media is like a campfire that your tribe can gather around to share ideas and experiences. You can reach out to people interested in your work through social media, blogs or videos. Effective media has three key components: content, community and a marketplace. Interesting content brings a community together, then the community establishes its marketplace.  The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a mixed martial arts league, is a good example of a business reaching out to its tribe effectively. The UFC hosts a reality show and several live fighting events; it serves a community of aspiring fighters and fans who come together in the UFC marketplace, buying UFC products.  Different media outlets serve different goals. You need to find your own channel that’s best suited to your future customers.  So think about which methods would be best for getting your message out. Should you start a blog, or buy keywords on Google? Should you print T-shirts or hand out flyers? Think about the time and money you want to invest in promoting yourself.  If you decide to create a blog or newsletter, for example, you’ll have to decide how to write your story. One possible method is called the mirror approach, where you tell a personal story to which people can relate.  If you’re selling fitness equipment, for example, talk about your personal experience with it and not just about the equipment itself. This helps you build a relationship with your customers and fellow freaks. It also makes you more approachable. The key message in this book: If you’re a freak, you can conquer the business world by setting clear goals, sticking to them and finding the right people to help you along the way. So don’t be afraid to be different, and be sure to embrace failure as a learning opportunity! Take action now instead of waiting for the right moment. Be brave and face the world head on!  Actionable advice: Be an employeepreneur.  An “employeepreneur” is someone who always tries to help their company move forward, even if they’re just a regular employee. So think like a boss: stay on the lookout for innovative solutions to problems and take on the projects that other people shy away from. That’s the kind of mind-set that leads you to achieving more! Suggested further reading: Misfit Economy by Alexa Clay and Kyra Maya Phillips Misfit Economy (2015) sings the praises of people who break society’s rules. You’ll learn the strategies of such freethinkers – often working on the periphery of the mainstream economy – who succeed amid tough circumstances. Instead of shunning such “misfits,” you’ll instead be inspired to adopt such strategies in your own life and career. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

So how can good, decent leaders change this hostile public narrative and recover the reputations of leaders everywhere? The answer has to do with heroism. Heroic leadership is a powerful antidote to the sort of greed, selfishness and short-termism that has become rife among our most powerful executives. Discover how any leader can go from zero to hero and radically change the perception of their employees and the wider community. By examining real-life success stories and inspirational lessons from the author’s own career, we’ll learn how leaders can transform their relationships with their staff, and learn why, when it comes to people and profits, leaders don’t need to choose between one or the other. Read on to discover: Why great leaders never go it alone; What you can learn from Captain “Sully” Sullenberger’s incredible flight landing; and What happened when Starbucks failed to live up to its own heroic ideals. In the era of #metoo, when so many of our corporate leaders are being caught up in odious scandals, it can be easy to adopt a cynical approach toward them all. Are they really interested in the well-being of the ordinary people who work for them, or are they just out for themselves, exploiting those lower down the food chain along the way? In this climate of extreme distrust, we need executives who can refute these terrible examples of toxic leadership and prove that the good guys are still winning. In other words, we are in desperate need of heroic leaders. The author’s journey toward heroic leadership started in 2009, when he was invited to attend the annual conference of Hero Partners, a nationwide club for leaders in charge of fast-growing businesses who are also committed to responsible, sustainable and compassionate entrepreneurialism. The author, himself a Chief Marketing Officer at the time, was so impressed with Hero Partners and its values that if he went all in and bought the company in 2016. So what are the heroic values that the author and his club of forward-thinking entrepreneurs believe all leaders should live by? Well, commitment and courage are essential. Specifically, leaders need the commitment and courage to constantly find ways to give something back and to serve others, including their employees, their communities, or the environment. Simple, right? Perhaps, but most businesses these days are doing a poor job in this regard. Instead, they’re wholly focused on three totally different things: their clients, their shareholders and their bottom line. And the hard-working employees? They’re overlooked, not listened to, and have to make do with scraps from the boardroom table. So what’s the solution? As we’ll find out, leaders can go from zero to hero by recalibrating their focus, ensuring that their workers, and even the wider community, start to feel that the company’s goals are aligned with their own. These employee goals are likely to include having a decent life for themselves while doing the best they can at work. Ask yourself, are you, as a leader, committed to this goal, too? If not, it’s time to re-read your company’s mission statement, where these goals are likely enshrined, and get to work on embodying them. What do you, as a leader, value more: profit or people? This deceptively simple question is usually the author’s first question to business leaders he meets. And in fact, the most heroic answer is neither one nor the other. The hero’s answer is both. Both people and profits are of equal importance to a company, and there is no need to compromise the health of one to maximize the well-being of the other. Now that we’ve cleared up this common misunderstanding, let’s take a closer look at what sort of values you’ll need to implement in order to make significant profits while improving relations with employees. Firstly, boosting your profits means adopting the values of operational excellence. Implementing operational excellence as a leader involves increasing your business revenues over time, ensuring your products are superior to the competition’s, creating as much value as you can for your clients and customers, and consistently recruiting and retaining talented employees. If you can get all of these things right and stick like glue to these business principles, profits are sure to follow. Now let’s take a look at the other side of the coin. What are the values you need to implement to ensure you’re also looking after the people who are involved with your business? These can be people directly involved, such as your employees, or indirectly, as in the wider community. In other words, how can you start being a hero to those around you? The first step is to understand that the best leaders don’t try to go it alone. Instead, they’re open to collaborating with everyone around them who has something valuable to contribute, no matter who they are or where they come from. For instance, heroic leaders will take the time to truly listen to the people around them and won’t hesitate to admit when they’re wrong, or when someone they manage knows more than they do. Heroic leaders seek out many different perspectives on the challenges their company faces, and they try to bring diversity to the decision-making process. In practice, this means including people of different genders, ethnicities and even generations. For instance, if you’re a baby boomer leader, seek out the opinions of millennials, and if you’re a millennial start-up whiz kid, don’t be afraid to seek the advice of someone a little older than you. It’s important for leaders to have values, but it’s even more important that they live them too. After all, what good is it telling others, and yourself, that you value something, if you’re not actually putting that value into practice in your everyday work life? The author witnessed this disconnect between espousing values and living them in his own company. When one of his digital media employees said in a meeting that she had achieved a 60 percent open rate on a batch of email newsletters she’d sent to the company’s clients, the author was shocked. After all, these clients were paying to receive these emails and thus should have been considering them interesting enough to open and read. The author eventually realized that the biggest issue was that the employee wasn’t concerned by this mediocre outcome. Why? Because they weren’t living the company’s values. Specifically, the company’s core mission to relentlessly deliver results. Here was an employee whose job was to tell their clients about what great values the company had, but they were forgetting to implement these same values in their own work. This got the author thinking, have we all become so wrapped up in telling people our own story and values that we’ve forgotten to live by them? Incredibly, this simple disconnect has threatened to destroy some of the world’s best-loved brands in recent years. Just consider what happened to Starbucks. In May 2018, Starbucks closed 8,000 stores for an afternoon to give all of their staff a training session on racial bias. Why? Because just one month earlier, two African American men were arrested in a Starbucks in Philadelphia, after the manager called the police to report that the men were refusing to leave the premises, even though they were just waiting for a third friend to arrive before making a purchase.   Not only were the manager’s actions racist, but they also went against the company’s explicit values: that Starbucks is a communal space where both paying and non-paying customers can sit, relax and pass the time. While the company had spent years selling this warm and welcoming story about their brand, they had failed to test whether their employees were actually living it. At least one manager wasn’t, and to this day, the phrase ‘getting Starbucked’ is often used as an ironic label to describe the victimization of African Americans. So when you’re telling outsiders about your company’s lofty values, be sure that you’re living up to them too. As a heroic leader, it’s important to build a heroic culture in your workplace – but exactly what does this sort of culture look like in practice? You might assume that an excellent working culture looks like lots of enthusiastic employees, all working long, productive hours while having a great time in each other’s company. However, signs of a heroic culture might be a lot more subtle than that. Consider the following example of great corporate culture that the author witnessed recently, but which a less attuned observer might have missed. The author was invited to tour the campus of High Point University, a college in North Carolina. Up until 2005, this college was struggling to attract students, secure funding and find resources. However, this all changed when new President Nido Qubein took over. Within a few short years, he nearly quadrupled the student body, from 1450 students to over 4000, increased annual funding from $38 million to nearly $290 million and took the number of buildings owned by the university from 22 to 112. But this impressive turnaround wasn’t the example of heroic culture that the author remembers from his visit. It was when one of the Vice Presidents stooped to pick up a candy bar wrapper that someone had left lying around. When he saw this senior executive wordlessly stuff the wrapper in his pocket, the author not only knew, but felt the heroic culture of excellence all around him. It was not part of the Vice President’s job description to pick up litter, nor was there any expectation that he should do so. But still, he did it. Why? Because he truly cared about the campus and keeping it pristine, as well as giving his guests the best possible impression of the place. The lesson to take away from this small deed is that a workplace culture doesn’t need to be loud or showy to be heroic. In fact, it’s the everyday examples of individual employees taking personal responsibility and accountability that all add up to make a heroic working environment. These tiny positive behaviors set the mood of a working environment, and, when carried out by those in leadership positions, they inspire everyone else to strive for excellence in every little thing that they do. January 15th, 2009. Flight 1549 had only been in the air for two minutes when flames started shooting out from one of its engines. What happened next shocked and amazed the world. Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger landed the burning plane in the Hudson river in New York. After the crash landing, one of the passengers Dave Sanderson quickly found himself waist-deep in cold water. After a terrifying few minutes, he managed to get out of the plane and swim to a boat. He was taken to the hospital, treated for hypothermia and kept in overnight. Amazingly, the very next day, Sanderson went into his workplace straight from the hospital to let his colleagues know he was fine. His boss’s first words to him when he arrived? “Are you going to Michigan next week?” Sanderson was shocked. How could his boss be so unconcerned about what he’d just been through? Unfortunately, the answer is simple. His boss was part of an unheroic and wholly uncaring workplace culture. As this shocking incident demonstrates, Sanderson’s boss, and the company at large, didn’t see him as a person with whom they had an important relationship. Instead, they simply saw him as a tool through which they achieved financial success. This was why they instantly asked about Michigan because they knew Sanderson was on the brink of making a deal there. Two words – relationships and transactions – make all the difference between a heroic working culture and a toxic one. Heroic cultures are focused on the relationships they have with their employees and clients, and unheroic ones are solely concerned with transactions. Just consider how differently US Airways, the flight operator, treated Sanderson. They went out of their way to care for him and the other passengers during the aftermath of the crash, even assigning him to a personal liaison assistant to help him get back on track. The result? Sanderson is a fan of the airline for life and a loyal customer despite his ordeal. But his employer, the one that didn’t give a damn? Sanderson, a top-performing employee, no longer works for them, and he has nothing good to say about them. This just goes to show that a heroic working culture can bring you lasting loyalty, but an unheroic one can lead to an exodus of valuable employees. Heroic leaders exist in all walks of life, but the impact some of them can have is remarkable. When Rob Ryan founded Ascend Communications in 1989, he couldn’t have predicted that in just ten short years, he would sell his company to the tune of $20 billion. But when he did, Ryan’s life went on just as before. He ate lunch in the same place, and he drove the same car. In fact, the only big difference was to the lives of the people around him. How? He made them all millionaires. When he sold his company, Ryan ensured that everyone who had helped him achieve his staggering success was duly rewarded. Instead of keeping that $20 billion to himself, he set aside 10 percent of the money for his employees. And he didn’t only reward the executives who worked for him; he made millionaires of secretaries and janitors as well. The author often tells the story of Ryan’s generosity when he’s persuading others of the values of heroic leadership. Another example that he shares with his listeners is that of Hamdi Ulukaya, an entrepreneur who founded the successful yogurt company Chobani in 2005. Like Ryan, Ulukaya understood the value of giving back to his employees. When he founded his business, he told his workers straight off the bat that his plan was to share up to 10 percent of the firm’s sale price with them if it was ever sold or became a public company. Nowadays, Chobani is worth $1.5 billion and 2000 of the employees who work there are poised to become millionaires if the company is ever sold. Ulukaya never framed his generosity as a gift. Instead, he told his employees that he was making a pact with them and that they would all stick together, with everyone taking the responsibility to create a business with real value and longevity. In other words, Ulukaya, like Ryan, wanted to empower the people around him. This is the true value of heroic leadership: it’s not about handouts or being nice for the sake of being nice. Instead, being a heroic leader means gathering those around you and giving enough back to them so that they too can reach their full potential and get their share of the fruits of their labor. The key message in these blinks: Heroic leaders aren’t solely focused on profits and transactions. Instead, they also understand that it’s people who make these things possible, and they are what truly makes an organization thrive. By sharing their good fortunes, being open to the perspectives of others and living their organizational values instead of just preaching them, leaders can start giving back to their workers and build strong relationships that help everyone excel.  Actionable advice: Heroic generosity is all relative. Unsurprisingly, the stories about generous billionaire entrepreneurs get the most media attention. But even if you and your company are miles outside the Fortune 500, you can still participate in heroic generosity. Remember, it’s all relative. If you’re a business owner with multi-million dollar profits and you give your ten employees a $50 bonus every year, you’re probably not winning any prizes for heroism. But if you’re a struggling entrepreneur, without the funds for financial rewards, your team will likely appreciate the occasional free coffee or a one-to-one session with you where you take the time to appreciate their achievements. Why? Because you’re giving as much as you can and being generous with your time. In other words, you’re being heroic. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

He understood that children grow up so fast that if you miss even the shortest moment, you actually miss a lot. This became especially clear to Jeff one night when he was trying to get his infant son to go back to sleep. It was the middle of the night, and Jeff was eager to just get it over so he could also get some sleep. On this particular night, however, his son simply refused to fall asleep again, laying waste to Jeff’s hopes of getting a good night’s rest. Finally, Jeff gave up; it looked like he wasn’t going to get any sleep at all, so he decided he’d better just get used to it. He took his son downstairs to the living room, and they sat there playing in the middle of the night. All of a sudden, his son started smiling and speaking, using new words he had never used before. Astounded and overjoyed by this powerful, happy moment, Jeff realized that he could have missed it very easily. If he had stuck to his expectations of getting back to sleep quickly, he would have never brought his son downstairs. The fact that he let go of his expectations and the desire to control his own sleep allowed him to share this moment with his son. This is a potent reminder of why we should always strive to be present in what is happening right at this moment, instead of trying to force it to go as we expected it to. Another important life experience for Jeff occurred with his rock band, when they spent almost a year touring North America and Taiwan. Jeff had high expectations for the tour, dreaming of adventure and rock stardom. Often, however, the reality of the tour was less glamorous and more gruelling: some nights would involve 12-hour van rides to play for just 30 minutes in front of a crowd of as few as 20 people. Late one night, the band rolled into a small town in Montana, starving after the long drive. They expected at least a few restaurants to be open, but frustratingly it turned out that this was not the case in this small rural town. They were staying overnight at a local pastor’s house, and he, seeing their hunger, took them to his church and showed them a pantry full of donated food. The band protested of course, but the pastor insisted on making a meal out of the food for them, because at that moment they were exactly the “needy” the food was meant for. They ended up having a very simple but delicious meal together at the pastor’s house. Their frustration and hunger had turned into a great evening where they enjoyed each other’s company. It was then that Jeff realized that by focusing on his expectations for the tour, expecting the life of a rock star, he was missing the fact that the band was growing very close to one another. They were forming a close community, almost like family. The year was not so much about the experience of touring in a band, but more about the people Jeff was with and how they changed him. The same is true for most experiences in life. Another life-changing experience for Jeff was when, as a college student, he spent an exchange semester in Seville, Spain. Setting off for the journey, Jeff expected and desired an adventure. He wanted his exchange year to provide good stories to tell, and therefore went out almost every night, immersing himself in Seville’s nightlife and flamenco clubs.  Jeff stayed with his “host mother” Loli – a local woman who took him and another exchange student, Daniel, into her home. While Jeff went out to make the most of his new surroundings and Spanish culture, Daniel stayed in with Loli most nights, preferring to watch TV. Jeff felt this was boring in contrast to his own expectations of adventure: Daniel was missing out on great stories. Then one night, exhausted by the hectic pace, Jeff decided to make an exception and stay in and watch TV with Daniel and Loli. In the midst of an incomprehensible Spanish TV show, Loli burst out laughing at something one of the characters said. Jeff and Daniel, though they couldn’t understand what was so funny, were so amused that they also started to laugh. The laughter was infectious, and soon all three were laughing so hard tears were streaming down their faces. They ended up laughing together for hours. This one night in front of the TV made Jeff realize that he had been too focused on what he wanted to do and experience in Seville to realize that he actually had a community of people around him: Loli and Daniel. And it is this community that has the most profound influence on what kind of person you become. Subsequently Jeff slowed down his wild pace of life in Seville and began to enjoy time spent with Loli and Daniel at breakfast, Bible study and, of course, evenings in front of the TV. After his exchange semester, Jeff was making his way back home to spend the holidays with his parents. However, after the excitement of Seville, he was not looking forward to his return to “boring” Illinois and the humdrum of his parents’ house. In fact, he was going more out of obligation than free will. Jeff did not have a car in college, so he wound up going home by train – a long ride, but at least it had an allure of adventure to it. However, unlike his grande experiences travelling by rail in Europe, he found the train home was tattered and the scenery extremely boring: one gray town and empty cornfield after the other. This is why he was surprised when a fellow passenger, a florist, pointed out of the window and exclaimed, “It’s beautiful!” Jeff naturally wondered what the florist was talking about: an empty cornfield is not especially beautiful. Later the florist said something that stuck in Jeff’s mind: “There’s nothing like going home.” Chatting with the florist, Jeff surmised that he was in fact a widower heading home to see his daughter and visit his wife’s grave. Jeff’s mindset had been that going home was just an unavoidable obligation, made worse by the dull scenery, but the florist was in fact subtly encouraging him to appreciate the people around him while he had the chance. The people who create a place called “home” for you may not always be around.  The florist also showed Jeff how to appreciate the ordinary yet beautiful things that are all around us in everyday life, like the cold, barren beauty of cornfields in the winter. For a few years after they had gotten married, Jeff and his wife attended a small church in Franklin, Tennessee. There they met two couples who taught them about the importance of gratitude for the small things in life. Firstly, Jim and Lois were an elderly couple who were prominent members of the church. Even though she was friendly and energetic, Lois’ health was failing, and it was clear she might not have much time left. Lois loved to fish, so one day, on the spur of the moment, her husband Jim took her fishing to Virginia Beach, 700 miles away. On the road, he stopped at a gas station to fill up his big RV. A fellow customer at another pump saw the RV and exclaimed, “Wow! I bet it costs a fortune to fill up that thing, especially in this economy!” Jim kept pumping gas, shrugged and told the man that he did not know how much time he had left with his wife, and therefore he was going to enjoy every last remaining moment – no matter what it cost. The church held a special service around Thanksgiving where people were encouraged to explain what they were thankful about. Lois got up from her wheelchair to speak to the parishioners about how grateful she was that she had been able to live another year and spend that time with her husband and family. The second couple, Madelyn and Al, were also church members and living through difficult times, as Al’s health was deteriorating. At the very same Thanksgiving service, Madelyn got up to speak. She explained that although it had been a difficult year for Al, she was grateful for every hug, tear and moment they had together. Both Al and Lois passed away, but their legacy stuck with Jeff: life is a gift, and one must relish even the smallest things, for who knows how many days any of us have left. From early on, Jeff was never a big fan of the idea of marriage. He felt that the actual act of having a wedding and getting married was a bit of a pointless ceremony; what mattered was what came afterwards. This is why when it came to his own wedding ceremony, he did not really have high expectations. He figured it would be just another day. When he mentioned this to a friend, however, Jeff was surprised to hear that the friend felt his own wedding day had been “the best day of his life.” This stirred the idea in Jeff that perhaps the wedding, and by extension the marriage, could actually be something more significant than he thought. When his actual wedding day arrived, Jeff stood at the altar with his best man at his side, waiting for his fiancée to walk down the aisle. To his surprise, when she emerged, instead of hearing the classical wedding tune they’d chosen, he watched as his best man left his side, grabbed a guitar and started singing a song Jeff had written for his wife. This took Jeff totally by surprise. Watching his wife-to-be walk to him with his own words of promise and commitment to her being played in the background, Jeff started crying. He found the moment so beautiful and powerful that he could not stop. Looking back, despite those low expectations, it really was the best day of his life. This experience taught him the importance of celebrating those truly big events in life. Sometimes the things you have to wait for for a long time really are the best. Just as it is important to be grateful for the small things and the big moments in life, it is in fact also important to try to be grateful in disappointing times. Why?  Because often when you look back on them later on, you find those sad or negative events actually had some positive influence on your life after all. Perhaps they taught you an important lesson or otherwise molded your identity in a big way somehow? Jeff discovered this lesson after his grandfather Charles, a true renaissance man of the arts, had passed. Jeff, then just 16 years old, was there at Charles’ deathbed. Though Charles was never a religious man, a priest was called to give him his last rights. When the priest spoke to Charles about accepting God into his life, Charles surprised Jeff by robustly agreeing, “Yes, I do,” as tears rolled down his cheeks. Jeff intuitively understood that his grandfather was not just agreeing out of fear or physical discomfort, but instead something profound and significant was happening: Charles was having a sincere religious conversion, almost at the last possible minute. Years later, this event touched the lives of many more people: Jeff’s band was playing a concert at an old people’s home in Taiwan, when Jeff was asked to give the seniors an impromptu sermon. Short on stories he thought would be relevant to the crowd, Jeff spoke of his grandfather’s passing, and how it demonstrated that it’s never too late to make life-changing choices. So even a sad and tragic experience like his grandfather dying, in retrospect, had some good in it. The experience allowed Jeff to inspire and comfort those elderly people in Taiwan. This phenomenon gives us hope: even when dealing with the most disappointing or negative events imaginable, we can hope that a silver lining will emerge sometime, perhaps years down the line. The key message in this book: Most people spend their lives waiting for the next big thing to happen, but in fact, life really happens in those mundane and ordinary moments between big events. We should learn to slow down, let go of our illusion of control, savor those in-between moments and appreciate the people around us. They have a bigger influence on our lives and identities than most of us realize. What are the questions the book answers? Why is it important to let go of your expectations and stop trying to control the things life throws at you? Let go of your expectations and be present in the life-changing moments around you.

There are new products, new designs, new ways of marketing – and the list continues. So what do you do? Well, you keep innovating, which, surely, is what you’re trying to do. Indeed, for decades, people have spent millions and millions of dollars on research and development, all in an attempt to keep up with potential newcomers and incumbents. But that process is somewhat cumbersome, and it’s certainly lengthy and expensive. So how about getting a few tips and tricks on how to innovate with both more speed and less expenditure? In these blinks, you’ll discover how a small team came up with the trackball mouse; why innovators keep the company’s core values in mind; and that discarding your planner mentality is the way to go. True progress is made when people introduce new and novel ideas. Remember what life was like before the telephone was invented? Okay, probably not – but it forever changed the way people communicate. This kind of world-changing innovation continues to take place; it’s just happening in a different way. It used to be well-funded research and development (R&D) departments that created innovative ideas and products. These days, however, innovation is coming from businesses that expand upon successful small-scale experiments. This shift is taking place because the traditional R&D model – a lengthy research phase followed by a team of experts developing an idea from scratch – has proved too complex and costly. This old model can lead to innovation, but it takes massive amounts of analysis and financial assistance. Just consider how much planning and money went into making a basic prototype for a hybrid car or HD television. And for every revolutionary product, there are many more ideas that never see the light of day. In fact, an R&D team might spend millions doing market research only to abandon the idea after it tests poorly with consumers. For these reasons, innovation is now the result of businesses conducting scalable experiments that are inexpensive, simple and less time consuming. Businesses are moving away from the costly analysis of R&D teams to conduct small-scale experiments that test a business hypothesis, or innovative idea, using a variation of the scientific method. Take the innovative ideas behind Windows or the Mac, for example: You might think it was one genius idea that launched these products, but, in reality, each was the result of inexpensive experiments, step-by-step tinkering and imaginative prototypes. This is exactly the kind of innovation that is catching on today: starting out with small-scale, cheap experiments, and then scaling up the development process if the results turn out to be successful. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at this modern method and find out how businesses are conducting these experiments. So what exactly does the modern method for innovation look like? Well, it’s not unlike the method used in chemistry class, where students split up into teams, conduct experiments to solve a problem and present the results to the class. Generally speaking, this kind of method is represented in the 5x5 model. This model works by assembling cross-functional teams of five people, such as a designer, a developer, a marketer, a sales representative and an engineer. Each team is then given five days to develop five ideas that can be tested over the course of five weeks, with each team competing against one another. By using this model, businesses can cut down on time and costs compared to the old analysis-driven R&D model. For instance, imagine you’re a video game company developing a new product. While you’ve made it easy for players to test a sample of the game on your website, many are neglecting to sign up for the newsletter, leaving you wondering how many potential buyers you have. You could tackle this problem by using web surveys – but this isn’t time- or cost-efficient, and it requires a lot of analysis. So you implement the 5x5 method, conducting fast and cheap experiments that you can scale up if the results are good. First, divide your employees into teams of five and let them each develop five ideas. In this case, let’s say the best idea is to change the timing of the newsletter request. You go with this idea and get the five teams to experiment with it. Here’s a possible experiment: ask 50 percent of the users to register before playing and the other 50 percent to register after they’ve played the game for more than two minutes. The results might show that those asked to register immediately were put off and refused, while the majority of the other half did register and formed a reliable group of potential buyers. Whatever the results may be, the 5x5 method is the efficient way to solve your problem. Now that you’re familiar with the 5x5 model, it should be smooth sailing from here on out, right? Well, not so fast. Whenever you introduce change, you should expect some resistance from those who prefer more traditional ways of doing things. And instating the 5x5 model is no exception. A different way of approaching innovation will require a cultural shift within your company. With traditional models, your company might be used to a top-down managerial approach toward planning and delivering proposals that requires a lot of analytical work. Therefore, your top managers might see experiments coming from small teams working from the bottom-up as a backward and ineffective path to innovation. Many of these managers will have a negative view of experimentation, as they equate it with a lack of direction, so they’ll resist the idea of scaling down. That’s why a different mentality is required to implement the 5x5 model and conduct experiments to test business hypotheses. For example, creating and testing new ideas can be difficult when you’re surrounded by people who have a planner mentality. These people won’t seek out new ideas because they put value on what past experience has taught them and tend to believe that they already have the answers to every problem. But remember: it’s experimentation, not experience, that drives innovation. So, instead of a planner mentality, a searcher mentality is needed. Unlike planners, searchers will admit to not having all the answers; they can see the need to run experiments in order to acquire more information. Searchers are also action-oriented. They tend to focus on actionable ideas that can help them quickly turn a good hypothesis into a working prototype. All this makes searchers the perfect type of person to help foster the 5x5 method and bring about innovation in your company. But, as we’ll see in the next blink, having the wrong mentality isn’t the only obstacle to innovation. Life is filled with periods of resistance. At times, life can feel like one big uphill struggle. But by persevering, you can work past resistance, and life once again becomes more manageable and productive. This same kind of resistance is what gets in the way of innovation and the 5x5 model. Luckily, there are simple ways to get around it. First of all, take your plan directly to the executives and let them see the impact 5x5 experiments will potentially have on the company. To avoid resistance, get the executives on your side by showing them how your business hypothesis is connected to the core values and main strengths of the company. Let’s say you’re meeting with the executives of a huge telecom company whose core value is user experience. If you present them with a business hypothesis about enhancing the customer’s user experience, you’re likely to get support – certainly more support than if you were to suggest using the 5x5 method to improve the company’s discount packages. But making the executives feel involved is only part of the solution; if you can make everyone feel involved, there will be no resistance at all. To make this happen, formulate a business hypothesis that assigns a role to every department of the company. When you present this plan, you can show how it mobilizes everyone from sales, marketing and IT to HR and customer service. You’ll soon learn that, if an idea is big enough, it will naturally involve the whole company, and this fact will help legitimize the 5x5 model as a way of testing the hypothesis and creating innovation. This is the kind of big, innovative idea the beauty company Avon had when it suggested turning its customers into salespeople. Getting customers to sell their product was such an enormous strategic shift that it naturally involved every department, from HR to Marketing, to come together and turn the hypothesis into a reality. On any given weekend, you might be feeling lazy enough to binge watch a series on Netflix. And there’s a good chance it might be a series that was recommended to you by Netflix based on a similar series you had enjoyed before. Well, as it turns out, the future of innovation will be just like that: binge experimenting based on binge hypotheses. Not too long from now, business experiments will be suggested to 5x5 teams by intelligent recommendation engines. Just like Netflix, companies like Amazon and Spotify also help customers by recommending items and products that match their user profile or previous shopping, watching or listening decisions. This same idea can be applied to business experiments and the hypotheses that get them going. But rather than getting recommendations for new songs or movies, 5x5 teams will get recommendations for what hypothesis to test next. For example, the engine might say, “Account managers who tested this hypothesis also tested…” or, “Marketing designers who tested this hypothesis also tested…” Even better, all of this will happen automatically through artificial intelligence (AI). And this engine won’t just use information collected from human behavior, like current recommendation systems; it will be fully automated artificial intelligence. It might sound far out, but people are actually using this technology right now. The sciences are already employing AI to design experiments that are later published in major scientific journals. Just take Adam from the United Kingdom. Adam is a fully automated robot that generates scientific hypotheses and experiments regarding the genome of baker’s yeast. This is the same technology that will one day be applied to business experiments. Humans will still be the main factor in these experiments, but the teams will have AI to support them and help them come up with the next hypothesis that will lead to world-changing innovation. The key message in this book: Business experiments are a cheap, quick and simple way to generate smarter, better, safer and more scalable innovation that will benefit companies and their customers’ future.  Actionable advice: Don’t forget to act. As the great economist Joseph Schumpeter said, “Innovation is less an act of intellect than an act of will.” Think about a business hypothesis but don’t stop at the idea of the hypothesis.

But how much can these incredible stories teach us? Are the glittering press releases giving us the truth about their rise to the top, or are we only getting the sanitized version that they want us to hear? Understanding how the most successful companies got to where they are today is crucial, given that 90 percent of all start-ups crash and burn before making any impact on the marketplace. When entering into an exciting and uncertain start-up journey of our own, how do we make sure it ends up being one of the successes? While many guides focus on either kicking off or concluding your venture, we’ll discover that the real determinant of accomplishment is whether you can weather the highs and lows after you’ve already gotten your project started and your initial funding secured. In other words, the key to start-up success is found in the messy middle. Read on to learn why preparing for long-term accomplishment feels counterproductive; why you should be focused on fixing what works, not what’s broken; and why you should never think of your project as finished. Beginning a new venture is akin to setting out on an arduous journey. Whether your chosen field is entrepreneurial or artistic, you’ll probably share similar fears and hopes with the other people trying to strike out and plunge into something new. But regardless of what it is you’re attempting to create, you’ll undoubtedly encounter the messy middle. The messy middle of any worthwhile venture is incredibly volatile – a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, during which your enthusiasm and your venture itself will expand and contract seemingly without warning. Once you and your new project are out of the initial honeymoon phase – when you’re blissfully unaware of how much you don’t know – you’ll likely feel lost. Why? Because the middle of a project is all about finding a direction, making progress, and then stumbling and losing your way again. Your task is to weather the lows, enjoy the highs, and keep pushing to ensure each low isn’t as low as the low before, and each high is higher. When you’re in the thick of it, this mid-section might look like its made of only downhills and uphills, but after a while, you’ll hopefully see an upward-slanted median toward successful completion. This is what the journey to accomplishment looks like. If you’re not convinced, just consider the author’s path. After founding in 2006 an online platform called Behance for connecting professionals working in creative industries, Scott Belsky experienced his own messy middle, which lasted for several years. During this time, there were periods when his whole project seemed on the verge of falling to pieces. No one beyond his employees cared for or understood his idea, and if anyone did show an interest in the project, all they expressed were doubts. During this difficult stage of his business, Belsky was so crippled with worry and self-doubt that he could only maintain an appetite by taking anti-nausea pills. Many entrepreneurs feel uncomfortable talking about this ugly period in their lives, but this is the reality of the messy middle. If you’ve ever tried your hand at something entrepreneurial or creative, you’ll know that any prosperous venture requires vast amounts of time and commitment. And whether your project involves writing a novel or launching a start-up, you’ll likely face hurdles. Unfortunately, these hardships are often compounded by the fact that, during your journey to success, you’ll likely receive little to no external rewards. Instead of reaping profits, you’ll be spending money. Instead of adoring customers, you’ll be struggling to inform people that your business even exists. So how can you stay motivated when no one is rewarding you for your hard work, and the big pay-off still seems far away? This question is an important one because humans tend to have a preference for short-term rewards over long-term. Throughout our lives, we are taught to pursue short-term rewards. As children, we get high grades as a reward for learning. These grades also earn us rewards in the form of approval from our teachers, classmates and parents. This short-term reward system doesn’t stop in our adult lives either. As soon as we find ourselves in a traditional job, we’re rewarded with a regular salary – a short-term reward that gratifies us each month. In contrast, entrepreneurial and creative ventures don’t offer much in the way of short-term rewards. To satisfy our need for them, we need to get creative. Your project may not be rewarding you with profits or customers yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t manufacture your short-term goals, and reward yourself for achieving them. When Belsky founded his start-up, he was not rewarded with profits or external recognition until he was several years into the project. He, therefore, set about manufacturing his own short-term goal and reward system. For example, after realizing that Google’s search engine was failing to recognize “behance” as a legitimate search word, Belsky set a team goal: that Google would recognize the name of his company without auto-correcting it to “enhance.” When the team achieved this milestone, he made sure they all celebrated it, even if it was only with cheap Champagne. Thus, he was able to give himself and his employees a sense of a reward, even in the absence of traditional markers of success, such as profits and customers. During your entrepreneurial journey, you’ll inevitably experience both the triumphs and failures and these will have an impact on your project. But what’s less obvious is that these extremes will also have a significant effect on you as a person. This is where self-awareness becomes indispensable. Why? Because understanding how the highs and lows of an entrepreneurial journey may adversely influence you will help you to remain clear-sighted, even in extreme times. Self-awareness begins with the understanding that when you’re in a valley or a peak, you’re likely to become a worse version of yourself. When a project is going well, our ego often takes over. This has negative implications for our decision-making abilities and thus for our ventures. Why? Because we will be more likely to believe that our opinion is the only one that matters and become less receptive to good advice or subtle signals that something may be wrong. In other words, we become overconfident. Conversely, when things get tough, our insecurities might get the best of us. This is because, when we become stressed, we often feel vulnerable. To cope with these feelings of vulnerability, we may try to boost our confidence by unfairly blaming those around us for the problems. After all, it’s less threatening to point the finger at someone else than ourselves. Therefore, whether we find ourselves at a trough or peak, we must always fight to stay self-aware. To achieve success, you’ll also need enough awareness to act on other people’s feedback and criticisms when developing your project. In the author’s experience, the start-up founders with the most potential for accomplishment are also those who are the least defensive when it comes to listening to difficult truths about the strengths and weaknesses of their venture. Founders able to keep their minds open to feedback and integrate good suggestions into their operations will usually outperform those who are hostile to constructive criticism. Furthermore, the best founders are proactive in seeking constructive criticism and feedback. They aren’t just open to feedback – they go looking for it. If you know you have a tendency to become defensive when people give you feedback, have the self-awareness to change your ways. Try to become more receptive to the insights of others and don’t go on the offensive every time someone tries to give you some advice. The human brain is excellent at identifying cause and effect and understanding the short-term consequences of actions. But we often struggle to project chain reactions. Our failure to take into account the long-term means we neglect to lay the foundations for future accomplishments and opportunities. Playing the long game in business requires you to disregard the usual principles of productivity occasionally. You’ll spend significant time exploring ideas and avenues which offer little hope of any short-term business transactions, but which help you to build the strong working relationships that might yield fruitful collaborations several years in the future. Bill Gurley, the investor behind prosperous start-ups like Uber, is renowned for his in-depth exploration of potential new business interests, even though his schedule is also packed with short-term profit-making activities. Whether he’s building relationships with people in industries as diverse as the healthcare sector or in the transportation industry, Gurley typically pursues different ideas and interests for months or even years. This huge, long-term time investment doesn’t bother him, even when the interest never presents an opportunity for his investment. Why? Because he never feels like he’s in a race against the clock to complete a transaction. Instead, he has a genuine curiosity about his chosen field of work, appreciates that he’s in it for the long haul, and so accepts that most relationships take time to pay off – if they ever do. To play the long game, you’ll have to be willing to invest time, energy and money in those whose current ideas or projects are perhaps not viable, but who you believe have great potential to add value to your business in the future. Unfortunately, history is littered with business leaders who didn’t have the foresight to play the long game. The internet-streaming giant Netflix approached video rental chain Blockbuster back in 2000, when Netflix was a promising but not yet successful venture. They offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for the bargain price of $50 million. Unfortunately, Blockbuster executives weren’t interested in considering the long-term potential of this acquisition. They didn’t stop to think that, with the advent of the internet, the video rental industry might eventually move out of bricks-and-mortar stores, first, moving to a mail-order subscription service and then going online. Nowadays, Netflix is worth $150 billion, and Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010. This just goes to show that, while the majority of people say they value activities that plan for the long-term, few of us possess the patience to adopt these long-term focused behaviors. It might not feel like it sometimes, but the messy middle is not only about getting through the inevitable lows and setbacks that hit you mid-project. Muddling through the messy middle also means using the high points of your journey to accelerate your progress toward the finish line. To leverage these highs, you must recognize and build on the aspects of your venture which are working well. In other words, you’ll need to optimize. When you try something that works – whether it’s a new habit that boosts your productivity, or an inspired alteration to a product that customers love – you should rigorously evaluate the improvement. Ask yourself: why was it successful, how can we replicate this accomplishment, and how can I spread this improvement through my team? Optimization is born from the belief that something can always be done better. It’s less concerned with repairing something that’s broken, more focused on improving something that already works. Google and other contemporary internet companies have pioneered the optimization of web-based products through A/B testing. In A/B testing, web pages or any aspect of online experience are improved by comparing the performance of the original product (version A) to that of the changed version (B). An e-commerce website may change the color of their purchase button for a certain proportion of customers viewing their site. If this altered version gets more shoppers to buy something, then this color change will be applied throughout the website. If not, the test will be abandoned, and the existing version without the change will continue to be used. But whatever the outcome, the philosophy is the same: even if something seems to be working, it's always worth trying to improve it. Importantly, A/B testing is not only useful for online buttons. You can employ it to optimize every aspect of your everyday life – try A/B testing your working habits or the way in which your team organizes itself. Your team could change how they conduct meetings or the time of week at which they meet. Or someone on your staff could try to use a new application or tool for a month to see if their productivity improved. If this works, make the alteration permanent. If you’ve learned from your mistakes and optimized the things you’ve done right, then at some point during your venture, you will make it out of the messy middle and head toward the finishing line. This point of completion will mean something different for every person – it could be getting your novel published or selling your start-up to a bigger company. But as you emerge from the middle of your project, try not to lose the mind-set that helped you get through it. Interestingly, the only downside to successfully progressing any new venture toward its completion point is that you’ll move past the period of development when you were willing to take bold action. And ironically, it was probably these audacious actions that accelerated your progress. The opening stages tend to be when your company or venture is at its most flexible. Because you have not yet had any accomplishments, you feel no sense of entitlement. Instead, you’re open to making errors and risk-taking. Your product is only just finding its feet, and so can handle big alterations. This is when you’ll likely find yourself waking up every morning with new insights and fresh ideas for little tweaks which make a big impact. But as you continue into the later phases of the venture, try to maintain the mentality of openness, brashness and humility that got you this far. One company that’s been highly adept at maintaining this mind-set is Facebook. If you took a walk around Facebook’s headquarters, you’d be confronted with posters and laptop stickers proclaiming that “this journey is 1 percent finished.” Why? Because this is a company that prides itself on always behaving as if they were still in the messy middle of the project. Sustaining this mind-set has kept their workers and executives questioning existing assumptions and constantly thinking of ways to do things bigger and better. Just consider how much the company has changed since its 2004 beginnings. What began as a university directory reached huge success as a social network by 2008. But they didn’t stop there – instead, they morphed into a platform allowing their users to access other applications and websites, and Facebook is now also a respected medium where online communities and groups work together. Facebook is continually evolving, and its progress will only stall if employees start feeling and behaving like they’re about to hit the finish line. Even though the middle of a project is fraught with uncertainty and setbacks, it's also an intense period of creativity and optimization that determines your future accomplishments. So embrace the messiness and remember to take a little of it with you, wherever your journey leads you next. The key message in these blinks: Most of us have been taught to believe that a prosperous entrepreneurial journey starts with an idea, is followed by a lot of hard work, and is completed with a gradual and incremental rise to success. But this is false. In reality, the middle part of any venture is always the most difficult. To get through it, you’ll have to cope with dramatic highs and lows and a lack of external recognition. You’ll also have to find your sense of reward and engage in plenty of optimization if you’re to finish with success. It’s not easy, but if you learn how to navigate through this messy middle, you stand a great chance of being successful.  Actionable advice: If you can’t end with success, end with grace.  No project turns out exactly as we thought it would, and still fewer produce the sort of results we hoped for at the outset. But if you find yourself disappointed in the closing stages of a venture, try and resist the urge to swiftly shut things down and hop to the next project. Why? Because this final phase is key to maintaining your reputation with people like your investors and your shareholders. You may want to slip away quietly from view and avoid having difficult conversations with those who might hold you accountable for the failure, but keeping your reputation intact for future ventures will mean doing the opposite. So own the outcome of the project, whatever it was, explain yourself to stakeholders, and finish gracefully. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

So you ask them, right? WRONG! Friends and family might conceal what they really think about your idea because they want to be encouraging, and investors might tell you they really like your idea just to get you to stop talking. So how do ensure that your business idea is really good when everyone around you is lying? Enter the Mom Test, a set of rules that will tell you whether people really think your idea is good or whether they’re like your mom, who is always supportive and likes everything you do. So before you go squander your kids’ college funds on your new business, make sure you read these blinks carefully. In these blinks, you’ll learn why asking the right questions is so important; why investors who “love” your idea are a bad sign; and why talking over coffee beats any meeting. An important part of being a skilled entrepreneur is asking the right questions. Good questions are the key to developing and advancing your idea. So stop talking about your idea and start asking about it. Ask your potential customers about the problems they have and the kind of solutions they’re looking for. See if you’re on the right track to offering them something they need. Imagine your target customer base has a problem with Excel, for example. If they can find a cheap, effective way around that problem, don’t waste time and money producing an alternative application for them. They won’t need it. Asking good questions also helps you collect the right kind of data. “Good” data is data that tells you what your customers are looking for and what they’re willing to pay for it. Let’s say your idea is for a paid app that offers daily recipes to stay-at-home moms. It wouldn’t be effective to merely ask some moms if they’d be interested in such an app. Instead, ask if they ever have trouble finding new recipes and how they go about looking for them. If your target customers can easily find recipes online, they probably won’t pay for your app. That’s the kind of feedback you need. “Bad” data, on the other hand, misleads you. When coworkers or friends give you insincere compliments or tell you white lies because they don’t want to be rude, that’s bad data. They might also make vague statements about possibly investing in you in the future – don’t take these empty promises at face value. Sometimes when you pitch your business idea to potential investors or sponsors they’re just not interested in it. And if they’re not going to invest in you, you’re ultimately wasting both your time and theirs. So make sure you’re on the right track by learning to recognize the signs of a good or a bad meeting. There are a few tell-tale signs of a conversation gone bad. Compliments, for example, seem positive on the surface but usually indicate disinterest. When a people compliment your idea, they’re probably just being polite by avoiding outright rejecting you. Compliments allow them to divert the conversation away from the topic of investment so they can get back to doing whatever they’re really interested in. Compliments are often a polite way to get rid of you. When an investor is truly interested, on the other hand, he’ll show it by asking specific questions about the terms of the investment and the progress he can expect. he’ll want to learn more about the concrete details. A lot of young entrepreneurs make the mistake of taking compliments seriously. They’ll feel hopeful if a venture capitalist gushes over their idea or business plan. The good news is there’s a strategy for avoiding this: focus your talks on commitment instead. An investor who’s truly interested in you will be keen to commit. So be upfront: be clear about your expectations for first payments or deadlines for prototypes. If they don’t want to commit, they’ll tell you and you’ll know not to waste further time with them. And if they do commit, that’s great! It means your project is a go! Start-ups rarely suffer from a shortage of options or ideas. In fact, they usually have too many. If you pursue every possibility out there, you’ll drown in a sea of projects and have nothing to show for it in the end. And how do you avoid this? By focusing on a small group of target customers. Imagine you’re developing a fitness app, for example. You might think it would be wise to target young men and women with jobs to work around who want to stay healthy and fit. That’s not good enough, however. Your target group should be much smaller than that. If you survey too wide a variety of people, their answers won’t provide you with meaningful data. That’s why you have to go after a more specific group, like employed men age 18 to 25 training for a marathon next year. Such men would need a highly specialized training and diet plan to get them ready for the marathon. They’d probably be overwhelmed by online information about diets and not know who to trust. That’s where you could come in with a specific app to help them. And once you’ve identified your target group, get to know them. Talk to them! Learn all you can about what exactly they need. You can’t just select a target group and try to imagine what they want. You have to get out there, find those aspiring marathon runners and ask them how their training is going. Don’t forget: they may not need your app after all. Maybe they can train just fine without an app or they prefer personal trainers instead. On the other hand, they could need just the kind of service you want to provide. They might even be willing to pay for it. That’s the kind of data you need! If you’ve ever been to an awkward meeting that dragged on for hours, you’ll know those kinds of meetings aren’t productive. You don’t want your talks with customers to end up the same way, so here are some strategies for keeping meetings effective. First off, be casual. Allow your conversation partner to feel relaxed so he’ll open up about his feelings. Customers and investors alike dread that meetings will be a waste of time, so don’t bore them with too many formalities. Keep the formalities to a minimum and stay personable instead. Ask them how their day is going, then ask about their problems relevant to your product and their ideas for solving them. People are much more likely to be open with you if they feel you’re genuinely interested in them. They’ll feel better about sharing their honest opinions. Sometimes you don’t even need a formal “meeting” to get valuable information from your prospective customers. Just go to the places where they’re likely to be and strike up normal conversations. Imagine you’re in the business of scheduling public speakers, for example. Why not go to a conference for public speakers and ask some of them to get coffee with you? You’ll make contacts easily and it’s much more casual than scheduling a meeting for a few months later. Casual, comfortable settings make a huge difference when you’re looking for useful data. No one is going to open up about their opinions if they’re nervous. So don’t put anyone on the spot; talk to them normally instead. They’ll appreciate it and give you what you’re looking for in return. The key message in this book: When you’ve got a brilliant business idea, bring it to life by asking the right questions. Don’t let compliments lead you astray – look for commitment instead. Choose a small, highly specific group of target customers and talk to them directly to find what they need. Stay casual so they’ll be relaxed enough to open up to you. When you communicate sincerely, you’ll be able to give them something truly meaningful. Actionable advice: Pick out your three most important questions. Preparation is the key to having a productive conversation with a potential customer or sponsor. So write out the three most important questions you have for them in advance. This ensures you’ll get the information you need.

In fact – we say to ourselves – we’re probably better off not thinking too much about innovating because that groundbreaking idea is more likely to strike when we least expect it. But it’s exactly this kind of misguided thought that leads to frustration and wasted time. Furthermore, we usually give credit to only one person for an invention. But the notion of a single genius single-handedly coming up with an invention is a myth. Many believe that Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, but you’ll soon find out that the honor should actually be bestowed upon two lesser-known inventors. These blinks will redefine the way you look at creative processes and help you avoid the pitfalls of innovation, steering you toward the true path to becoming a successful innovator. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you shouldn’t fall for the story of Isaac Newton and the apple; that groundbreaking inventions are rarely the work of a single individual; and how people sometimes fail to see the worth of a great idea at first glance. Whether visiting an artist’s studio, an inventor’s workshop or a researcher’s lab, people often ask innovators the same question: “Where do your ideas come from?” A well-known origin story of a great idea is that of Isaac Newton and how he devised a theory of gravity after an apple fell on his head. The implication of this story is that great ideas strike those lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. Unfortunately, this tale is a myth. Epiphanies don’t exist. Great ideas don’t miraculously come to people in a moment of inspiration; they evolve over a lifetime of hard work and personal sacrifice. The word epiphany contains deeply religious connotations. Originally, it meant that all moments of inspiration came from God. Today, the word is less associated with religion, but the core implication nonetheless remains: when people exclaim that they’ve just had an epiphany, they’re subtly suggesting that they’re not quite sure where the idea came from, and thus couldn’t possibly take full credit for it. The belief that great ideas exist in a realm beyond our control and come to us in mysterious ways could be a psychological tactic to alleviate guilt and frustration when we’re staring down at a blank sheet of paper, unable to commit any creative idea to it. But such a belief is a distortion of what the creative process actually entails. Instead of a divine moment of inspiration, most creatives accumulate many small insights over time. Indeed, if you look closely at any great idea, you will see that it’s composed of an infinite number of previous, smaller ideas. For example, it was only after almost four decades of multiple innovations in the realms of networking, electronics and software that Tim Berners-Lee was able to build upon the concept of the internet to create the World Wide Web. Unlike Newton’s apple, great ideas don’t just fall from trees. To come up with an innovative thought, we need to give it time, which we’ll look at how to do right now. Today’s world is all about convenience. Everything nowadays is being sold to us pre-packaged – from meals to holidays, clothes to entertainment. The problem with this convenient consumer culture is that we also expect our new ideas to come conveniently gift-wrapped, which is another myth of innovation. The belief that good ideas arrive fully formed often stops us from developing them, which forecloses the possibility of those ideas becoming great. When pitching a new idea to, say, a team at work, one of the things innovators often hear is “We’ve already tried that” or “We don’t work like that here.” This is unfortunate as these criticisms nip the possibility of growth in the bud and ignore the fact that new ideas don’t come conveniently ready-made. New ideas need to be nurtured and developed over time in an encouraging environment. The reason why people engage in this sort of idea-destroying behavior is simple: they expect perfection right from the beginning. But even the great automobile innovator Henry Ford didn’t get it right the first time around. Rather, his earlier models were mostly awkward, smelly and inefficient. Thankfully, Ford realized that the future rarely arrives as a finished product and continued developing his cars. He also realized that innovation is a sloppy process. When it comes to creating a great idea, there’s no exact formula to follow – the secret is simply to have many ideas. The world’s greatest creative thinkers are known for compulsively coming up with the next new thing. The composer Beethoven obsessively recorded every idea that popped into his head, and even interrupted conversations and walked out in the middle of meals to do so. And novelist Ernest Hemingway wrote and then rewrote dozens of his stories, constantly changing the characters, plots and themes. Great ideas don’t come quick and easy; they require a lot of hard work. We need to constantly generate new ideas and then tend to them, as well as allow them time to bloom. If you were to ask a young child who invented pancakes, they’d most likely answer, “My mom!” Well, the bad habit of assuming that the person we associate with an invention is also its creator doesn’t stop at childhood. How many of us think that Thomas Edison invented the electric light bulb? And how many know that it was in fact invented by the lesser-known Humphry Davy and Joseph Swan? Unfortunately, the myth of the lone innovator has robbed these two men of their laurels. People like Edison get the credit for great inventions because we want our products, our ideas and our heroes to come conveniently pre-packaged, as previously mentioned. Therefore, it’s easier to spread the myth that something great was achieved by a single person, even though the truth is that it usually involves more than one mind. Case in point: everyone knows that the first person on the moon was Neil Armstrong. But did you know that NASA’s project to put a person on the moon involved more than 500,000 people? Armstrong became a household name because he was the most visible individual from the project, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that his contribution was the most significant. The myth of the lone inventor is also propagated by our laws. Patent law accredits just one person – or a very small group of people – for an invention, spreading the misconception that only one person can have ownership of a great idea. However, the opposite is more often the case. Many innovations are invented simultaneously. For example, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered calculus independently of one another, at more or less the same time. Despite evidence from cases such as Armstrong’s and the origin of calculus, the myth that great ideas are the work of the isolated inventor still prevails. Creator of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, had his invention dismissed as nothing more than a useless toy by the world’s leading communication company at the time, and George Lucas’s original Star Wars script was rejected by all the major Hollywood studios except one. This brings us to another innovation myth – that people like new ideas. From the examples above, we can see that people aren’t so receptive to new ideas, even if the ideas are brilliant. People tend to reject new things because they are inherently afraid of change. Studies show that the most stressful things you can experience in life are: marriage, moving house, divorce, losing a job and losing someone you love. The common thread running through these events is that they all involve big changes. Conversely, if asked to think about something relaxing, you’ll probably picture yourself engaging in an activity devoid of change or surprise, like spending time on the beach with some friends. The problem with appraising new ideas is that they conflict with our desire to enjoy these relaxing, familiar activities, and instead require that we place faith in the unknown, which is exactly what those other highly stressful life events require. So to overcome this fear of change, innovators need to first offer their new idea as a taste test. Samples, giveaways and demonstrations all lower risks and thereby reduce the fear of change, which makes them effective strategies for easing people into a new idea. For example, tea bags were first given away as free samples to ease people into the new concept of brewing tea without buying a big tin. The easier it is to sample, the quicker the innovation will catch on. That’s why clothing stores allow you to try on clothes before purchasing and car companies allow test drives. Start small and you’ll find that your big ideas will be easier to digest. Can you imagine Stephen Hawking working for a typical boss who demands that he submit daily status reports? Or what about Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton having to get their time cards stamped? How about Mozart, Marie Curie and Leonardo da Vinci taking notes at a company conference? If you’re struggling to picture the great innovators of the past succeeding within the confines of today’s workplace, how can we expect the modern employee to accomplish any innovative work? The modern workplace is a challenging environment for innovation because it’s overseen by managers whose training and experience go against the forces required for innovation. Even though we know that no human has the ability to predict the future, we seem to forget this when presenting a new idea to our boss. We tend to assume that our managers possess some kind of a superior standpoint on our great ideas, perhaps because they have more experience in and knowledge of the industry. However, it is exactly this knowledge and experience that causes the manager to work against innovation. When you possess a high level of confidence and experience, you are more resistant to innovation because you have the most to lose. Just imagine being a manager with a wealth of knowledge about a particular industry; now imagine a single innovation making that industry entirely obsolete! So if your manager doesn’t like your idea, don’t despair – there is a long line of prolific figures throughout history who have made judgmental errors when it comes to groundbreaking innovations. Take nineteenth-century physicist Lord Kelvin, for example. He claimed that any machine heavier than air would never be able to fly. Or did you know that managers working with propeller-aircraft were the last people to start using jet engines, and that telegraph company managers were the last to use the telephone? Managers have failed to see the value of many great inventions in the past, so take a leaf out of Hawking’s or Einstein’s book and keep on innovating. Fairy tales and stories of heroes usually follow a familiar trajectory: the good guy wins, the bad guy loses and those who follow the right path are rewarded. These stories demonstrate our deeply held beliefs about meritocracy – that the best individual or idea will or should win. However, the belief that “goodness” wins is yet another myth of innovation. In a business context, the myth that a great idea will always triumph is perhaps best captured in the well-known saying, “If you build it, they will come.” Unfortunately, this phrase has led many entrepreneurs to falsely believe that a good idea will sell itself. In reality, the quality of an idea is just one part of a complex system that determines which ideas will prevail and which will fail. For instance, when your favorite restaurant goes bust, you’re caught by surprise and can’t understand why, because in your opinion they made the best desserts. By concentrating on this one small aspect – one that affects you personally – you fail to grasp the bigger picture that there are more factors involved. Equally important in determining whether a good idea will succeed is whether the innovation is culturally accepted. For example, even though firearms were most likely invented in China sometime around 1200, they developed much more slowly there than in Europe. Why is that? Well, some Asian cultures believed that it was more honorable to fight with a sword than with a gun and so they were disregarded, despite their undeniable superiority. Therefore, being the “best” technology reflects only one aspect of innovation – we must also remember to take into consideration the idea’s cultural context. The key message in this book: Good ideas, far from being the product of a single moment of inspiration, are in fact the accumulation of many smaller insights, usually generated by a number of different individuals. Be aware that sometimes a good idea may be overlooked by your supervisor, but don’t let that stop you from constantly and consistently generating new ones, as they may – given enough time – go on to develop into great ones. Good ideas are only one factor of great innovation; they also need to align with society’s cultural values in order to succeed. Actionable advice: Ensure potential customers are receptive to your ideas. Innovation begins when people start using your idea. Don’t forget the importance of marketing in transforming your concept into reality. Many innovations such as the steam engine existed many hundreds of years before the right innovator came along and positioned them in a way that made them attractive and accessible to the public. So, once you’ve perfected the technology, remember to focus on getting the marketing and communication right, too! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

They believe an obstacle means they need to completely change their path, or give up entirely. But people have tackled obstacles since the dawn of time, and some of the greatest humans who ever lived have come up with ways of dealing with the struggle of everyday life. These individuals learned that obstacles will occur in every pursuit we engage in and in every stage of our lives, be it a disagreeable boss who blocks our hopes for promotion, or a precarious economic climate that prevents us from finding work. So instead of avoiding them, we have to tackle them straight on, use them to our advantage, and transform them into conditions for our success. This book shows us the way. In these blinks you’ll learn how one famous figure fought for his inheritance by practicing public speaking with pebbles in his mouth! And you’ll find out what Thomas Edison did when his million-dollar laboratory burned down – destroying all his latest prototypes. Finally, you’ll learn how NASA prepares its astronauts to tackle life-threatening obstacles. When faced with an obstacle, most of us get angry, fearful and frustrated. We think it will derail our plans and hinder our progress. But obstacles can actually become advantages, and far from limiting us, they can lead us to success. How? To turn an obstacle into an advantage, we have to focus on three things. First, we should focus on our perception of the obstacle. If we can see an obstacle in the right light, we can reveal the hidden possibilities we can use to our advantage. This was the key to the oil baron John D. Rockefeller’s success. During a financial crisis in 1857, Rockefeller, only 18 years old, watched how those who panicked behaved, and observed what they did wrong. By analyzing their failures, Rockefeller was able to see the obstacle – the Panic – in another way. He was then able to perceive the advantages the crisis offered, take action and start on his way to becoming one of the world’s richest men. But perception alone is not enough. When you are faced with an obstacle, you also need to respond with the correct action. The correct action is born from the combination of creativity and flexibility. For example, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Amelia Earhart wanted to become a great pilot, but an obstacle stood in her way – back in those days, women just didn’t become pilots. So she took a mundane job to survive, but kept looking for creative ways to accomplish her dream. One day she received a call saying that someone would fund the first female transatlantic flight, but she could only be an unpaid passenger. Though this was far from what she wanted to accomplish, she accepted – and this jumping off point led to a career as a great aviator. After identifying the best way to perceive an obstacle and the best action to overcome it, we use our will to persevere until the obstacle has been overcome. Over the next few blinks we'll look at each of these in more detail – starting with perception. When you encounter an obstacle, how do you respond? Do you think the world might be against you, and that nothing ever goes your way? Instead, you should be thinking about taking a step back, looking at the situation objectively and thinking, “What can I do to turn this obstacle into an advantage?” If we look at them in this way, even the biggest obstacles can be turned to our advantage. For example, in the 1960s the then celebrated boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter was falsely accused of a triple homicide, and sentenced to jail for life. But as he entered prison, he resolved to not let his circumstances overwhelm him, and instead tried to see how he could make the best of it. First, he vowed to not live with the injustice, but keep fighting to overcome it through the court of law. Then he turned his limited physical freedom to his advantage by using his time inside to study history, philosophy and law. Carter’s case was eventually overturned and he was released after 19 years. Carter left jail as he had entered it, a free man. But in addition, he had also used the time to improve his education and himself. So how can we achieve this objective perspective? By learning to detach yourself from your own personal – and highly subjective – view of the situation. You can do this by imagining that you are advising a friend about overcoming the obstacle. What would you say to them? How would you let them approach it? Or you can take after the Stoics, a group of philosophers from Ancient Greece. They would imagine how a sage – a person of perfect wisdom – would react to the obstacle. In that way, they would explore hidden sources of wisdom that they didn’t consciously know they had. Our first reactions to an obstacle are usually anger, frustration, anxiety and confusion. Though natural, such emotional outbursts actually make it harder for us to deal with obstacles because not only do they prevent us from judging the situation objectively, they actually make us see it differently. So if we want to turn our obstacles into success, we have to learn to control our emotions. How? The key to controlling our emotions is to steady our nerves. A famous role model for steely nerves is the Civil War general, Ulysses S. Grant. He was once being photographed by famous photographer Matthew Brady when he nearly lost his life. As there wasn’t enough light for the photo, Brady asked an assistant to open the studio’s skylight. But the assistant accidently broke the window, and large shards of glass fell right next to where Grant was sitting. If he had panicked and jumped from his chair, he might have been seriously hurt – but Grant didn’t flinch, and sat calmly in his chair as the shards shattered around him. By controlling his nerves, Grant prevented his emotions from getting him hurt. So how can we gain control over our emotions? By preparing ourselves for what can go wrong in any situation. This allows us to remain calm no matter how much external events may change. NASA has realized how important this is. A panicking astronaut is the single largest factor that contributes to potentially life-threatening mistakes in outer space. That’s why NASA prepares its astronauts to respond to any possible obstacle until their reaction becomes automatic. This allows them to deal with stress when anything goes wrong with the initial plan. Emotional responses to obstacles blur our judgment, thus making it impossible to turn obstacles to our advantage. When we are met with an obstacle, we often only see it in one way: insurmountable. But if we can change our perspective, then we can reveal the advantages an obstacle hides beneath the surface. How? By taking the larger context into consideration. Looking at the situation in isolation often makes the obstacle seem impenetrable; but if we place it in context, we can often see that it’s truly unimportant. For example, when setting out to battle during the Ancient Greek Peloponnesian War, the general Pericles and his men were suddenly cast into darkness by a solar eclipse. Many soldiers saw this as a bad omen, and became afraid of the impending battle. But Pericles was undaunted, and used this situation to his advantage to motivate his men. He took a dark shroud and placed it over the face of one of his soldiers, and asked him if he was afraid. The soldier replied that he wasn’t. Pericles then asked why they should allow another cause for darkness to deter them in battle and make them fearful. This allowed the soldiers to see the eclipse in a new light, and become emboldened for the fight. Perspective can also be used to transform obstacles into advantages. George Clooney learned this early on in his career. When he first came to Hollywood, he struggled to land a role. He became angry at directors, producers and casting agents, blaming them for not recognizing his talent. But then he changed his perspective. He realized that it was not his obstacle, but the film producers’ – they were the ones who desperately needed to find the right actor. So Clooney decided to mentally approach the audition as the actor they were looking for. He believed that if he made himself stand out as the solution to their obstacle, he would get the job. And by changing his personal perspective, Clooney was able to transform the initial obstacle into the first stepping stone towards success. In the following blinks, we’ll find out what’s the best course of action when confronted with the many obstacles of life. We’ve seen the importance of changing perspective, but on its own, it’s not enough – we also have to take action. However, in the face of the many obstacles that separate us from the good life, we need more than a single act – we need the strict discipline to act, and keep acting until the obstacle is overcome. One person who proved that discipline wins out was Demosthenes – the greatest orator of ancient Athens. On top of being cheated out of his inheritance by his guardians, Demosthenes was a sickly and frail person with a speech impediment. But when faced with all these obstacles he didn’t give up. Instead, he came up with a plan of action and stuck to it with incredible discipline. He locked himself in his study and taught himself law so he could take his former guardians to court. And to improve his speech, he would repeatedly recite oratory with his mouth full of pebbles! Through his persistence, Demosthenes became not only the most famous orator in Athens, but also won his trial against his ex-guardians. Just like Demosthenes, the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison knew that effective action depends on our persistence. In 1878, Edison went through 6,000 different types of material in order to discover the correct filament (a piece of bamboo) for the incandescent light bulb. Though there were other inventors also attempting to discover the incandescent bulb at the time, no other inventor went through so many different experiments to make sure they got it. It’s this persistence and tenacity that is universally recognized as the key to Edison’s great success. Imagine you’re part of a long-term project, and however persistently you act, it seems that the obstacles just keep on coming. What should you do? Instead of thinking about the goal, you should focus on each moment and the overall process. Why? Because this allows us to deal with the tasks at hand as effectively as we can, which will increase our chances of long-term success. Let’s look at two highly successful companies that were both formed in incredibly difficult economic times. The Walt Disney Company was formed eleven months prior to the market crash of 1929. And the IT company, Hewlett-Packard, was formed during the Great Depression in 1935. Both these companies succeeded because they didn’t let the problems in the wider economy derail their thinking about day-to-day activities. Instead of concentrating on the overwhelming goal of becoming successful in times of economic crisis, they kept focused on the moment at hand, not the obstacles surrounding them. And step by step, they grew into the famous companies we know today. Another way of looking at this is to see each moment as part of the larger process that leads toward the goal. Professional sport coaches use this paradigm to transform what might look like the impossible effort to climb a mountain into the single, regular steps necessary to reach to the top. For example, Nick Saban, head coach of the University of Alabama American football team, teaches his players to follow the process. Saban tells his players not to focus on the goal of winning the championship, but rather on performing well in each game, and each play in the games. Breaking down the road to the goal in this way allows his players to invest their energy in the task at hand without worrying about all the “obstacles” such as defeats or possible injuries. Correct action depends upon focusing on the entire process and living within each moment of that process. Sometimes you will be faced with an obstacle so huge you’ll think you can’t overcome it. But often the largest obstacles hide the largest weaknesses. For example, Gandhi’s civil disobedience – the non-violent movement known as satyagraha – and in particular, the Salt March, show how great power can be turned against itself. Gandhi knew he couldn’t challenge Britain’s military rule in a direct conflict, so he decided to use non-violence and symbolic acts to show how unjust it was. His Salt March led hundreds of thousands of Indians to the ocean to collect salt in direct opposition to the British law that prohibited unregulated salt collection. And because it was a non-violent endeavor, it contested the British rule without lifting an arm in combat. The great strength of the empire was its monopoly of violence, and by challenging it non-violently, he was able to show how weak it actually was. Another way to exploit an obstacle’s weakness is to use its strengths against it. Alexander the Great did this when he tamed his horse, the wild Bucephalus. Until Alexander gentled him, Bucephalus would not allow anyone to ride him, and would fight off anyone who tried with furious anger. So Alexander made Bucephalus run in a straight line until the horse was exhausted, and gave up trying to resist. When Alexander then mounted him, the stallion let Alexander steer and control him. Alexander had used his strength in riding (his endurance) to tame Bucephalus by exploiting the horse’s obvious weakness (its constant anger used up its energy). So by using its strengths against itself, even the strongest obstacle can be overcome. In the following blinks, we’ll learn how to keep persevering despite constant obstacles. Perception – the ability to see a situation objectively – and action (the practical skill of transforming the obstacle into our advantage) are, by themselves, not always enough. What really makes the difference is the last ingredient: our will. Unless we believe in ourselves and apply this internal power to all our actions, we will be unable to turn obstacles into advantages. The will is what channels our perception and action into recognizing and changing what we can, and not worrying about things we cannot. This philosophy was developed by the Stoics in Ancient Athens and Rome, such as Epictetus, Seneca and Emperor Marcus Aurelius. They focused their will by always asking themselves what was in their control and what was not. They believed that we could not change external factors. These include natural events, other people’s actions, the inevitability of death, etc. They also believed, however, that we could change internal factors. These include our emotions, judgments, attitudes, responses and decisions. Armed with this knowledge, we can then apply our will to change what we are able to change – i.e., our internal obstacles – while still facing and accepting the external obstacles we will inevitably encounter. This principle is embodied in Thomas Edison’s reaction to a terrible blow to his career. In the early 1900s, when Edison was 67 years old, his research and production campus caught fire. When Edison arrived on the scene, the whole building – including all his prototypes, papers and research – had gone up in flames. But Edison was unfazed, and saw this event as an opportunity to start over. He realized that he could not undo the fact of the fire, but could change his perspective, and approach a seemingly insurmountable obstacle as a way of starting over – getting “rid of a lot of rubbish,” he called it. And at the end of the year, Edison had turned a million dollar loss into a $10 million profit. By learning to accept what we cannot change, and disciplining our will to change what we can, we can master our obstacles – and ourselves. This disciplined will allows us to persevere in the face of the most difficult obstacles, as shown in one of the founding texts of Western literature, the Odyssey, by the Ancient Greek poet Homer. In the Odyssey, we find Odysseus departing Troy after ten years of fighting. Little does he know that he will spend another ten years facing many trials and tribulations as he attempts to reach home. Along the way, he is held prisoner, faces temptation, loses all of his men, encounters dangerous whirlpools, and even fights off a cyclops and a six-headed monster! What allowed him to overcome all the obstacles sent by the gods? His will to get home. Another way our will can push us to the limits of human possibility is its power to ignore our personal situation in favor of more important goals. This is perfectly illustrated by James Stockdale, a US pilot taken prisoner during the Vietnam War. Prisoners of war knew that they would be tortured and quite possibly killed. But instead of giving up or simply fearing for his life, Stockdale decided to be a leader for his fellow prisoners. Knowing that some of the tortured might be driven insane, Stockdale formed a support system in the camp to make sure all the soldiers knew they were in it together and should not feel ashamed for having given information. By using his will to concentrate on the greater goal of survival, Stockdale was able to help himself and others endure years of imprisonment and torture – and come out on the other side alive. The key message in this book: By perceiving obstacles objectively, acting against their weaknesses and persevering in your will, you will transform the obstacles you meet into the fire that fuels your success.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

But there’s also something mysterious about great content, especially for those new to the game. So what’s the secret to creating captivating material? Well, luckily, producing engaging and ultimately profitable content is something you can learn how to do. Remember the old saying about how giving a man a fish feeds him for a day, but teaching him to fish will feed him for the rest of his life? That’s the approach these blinks take. Instead of tasty, easily digestible morsels, you’ll get into the details that’ll let you really master the trade. Follow through on what you pick up along the way, and you’ll head straight to the top of the blog pile. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should start your online adventure by defining your target audience; the importance of maintaining a consistent brand identity; and how to put three winning content creation strategies into practice today. Who wouldn’t want to earn their living as a blogger? But to make money, you’ll need an audience. That means thinking about how to reach your audience. The best place to start is by defining your blog’s value proposition and purpose. The value proposition is all about who your blog aims to help, while the purpose is defined by the question of why it exists at all. Say your goal is to help women by aiding them in planning meals – that’s your value proposition and purpose respectively. Let’s narrow down the definition even more. Maybe it’s not all women you’re producing content for, but a particular subset. Perhaps your audience is stay-at-home moms who want to learn how to cook healthy, vegan meals on a budget? Once you’ve identified who you want to reach, it’s time to ask yourself another question: What kind of change do you want to bring about in your audience’s lives? A helpful way of thinking about this is to use the Driver of Change, or DOC, model. It’s essentially a way of reflecting on your prospective readers’ situations before and after engaging with your content. What, ideally, will change for them after following your ideas and advice? There are three factors you’ll want to take into account here: what your readers are going through, how they feel and what they think. Take the author’s books and articles. Before she’d published her work, her readers were struggling to come up with ideas for their blogs. They felt lost and convinced their blogs wouldn’t be successful. But after reading her work and implementing the author’s ideas, they knew how to focus their time and efforts and were able to feel positive and optimistic about their content. Next, you’ll want to define the categories that’ll help you change the way your readers think and feel about the subject you’ve decided to blog about. Individual categories are known as buckets, and you can have up to seven of them. So, if your blog’s purpose is to help people in their 30s avoid debt, you might think about including blog buckets like “investments,” “saving,” “budgets” and “intentional living.” It doesn’t matter whether it’s a boy, girl or potential employer, it pays to know what someone’s into if you want to impress them, and that goes for the readers of your blog as well. So what do you need to know about them? Think about your friends. What you know about them is also what you’ll need to find out about your readers. What makes them tick? What puts a smile on their face? What are their dreams? Knowing this means you can cut to the chase, addressing them directly without worrying about whether they’ll like your content or not. So how do get to know your readers? One way is to start “spying” on them. Don’t worry; it’s not as iffy as it sounds! It can be as simple as looking at a blog similar to yours and seeing what their readers are saying in the comments section. That’ll tell you a lot about their desires, aims and fears, and it’s precisely what the author did. After cruising blogs in her niche area, she realized her audience of freelancers and bloggers all had one thing in common: they were worried about not finding their own audience and craved recognition for their unique voices. Writing a blog post filled with open-ended questions that motivate readers to join the discussion is also a great way of finding out what makes them tick. To do this, avoid posing questions that are answerable with a simple “yes” or a “no.” Don’t ask, “Are you worried that a vegan diet isn’t rich enough in nutrients?” Instead, try something like, “What concerns you about going vegan?” Now that you know who your readers are, let’s get into the nitty-gritty of creating ideas for your blog! Here’s the million-dollar question: How can you generate exciting new content ideas for your blog? In this blink, you’ll learn two strategies that’ll help you do just that. The first technique is called the expert method. This is about breaking your content categories down into subcategories and topics. Doing so makes for a much more satisfying reading experience, as it allows your blog’s followers to quickly become experts in content categories. Think back to the bucket concept mentioned earlier. Each bucket has unique subcategories that deepen your readers’ familiarity with certain subjects. Say you want to create a blog for stay-at-home moms thinking of working as virtual assistants (people who work remotely to assist a business with administrative, creative or technical issues). One category might cover the way in which these moms market themselves. Within that bucket, you can create subcategories that deal with things such as writing pitches and creating attractive websites. So how do you come up with subcategories? Just think about what your readers need to know to master a particular category. Once you’ve done that, start dividing your subcategories into topics or blog posts. Take the pitch-writing subcategory. You can generate lots of interesting ideas for posts off the back of it – articles such as “Cold pitch or not?” for example, or “Ten tricks to creating the perfect pitch.” The second technique is known as the goal method. The key here is creating your content around your blog’s goals. That means setting targets and sticking to them. Ask yourself where you want to be by the end of the month or coming quarter. Say you want 250 additional subscribers by the end of that period. You can use that target to structure your content-creation process. What do you need to do to achieve that aim? You might need to make it easier to subscribe to your blog, write a guest post on another site or simply create more posts. Those aren’t the only strategies you can use to boost your blog. Let’s learn about a third technique next. Creating engaging content is one thing, but using it to offer products or services is quite another. How can you convince your readers to hit the buy button and turn your blog into a moneymaker? That’s where the offer method comes in. The offer method is a technique for designing content that shows readers how your service or products solves problems they didn’t even know they had. It’s a five-step process. At each stage, you’ll need to ask yourself what content will take them to the next step. The first thing you need to do is draw attention to a problem your readership has – even if they’ve never thought of it as a problem – and demonstrate that you have the solution. A great way of doing this is to highlight the difficulties your readers are likely to run into because they don’t know something. Blog entry titles such as “Ten mistakes you didn’t know you’re making” are an effective way of doing that. The second step is to provide more information now that your readers are aware of a problem. At this point, you’ll need to keep them interested by telling them a little more. A useful approach is to draw attention to the fact that you’re offering a quick and painless solution. Telling your readers you’re offering a shortcut is bound to pique their curiosity, so embrace captions like “Five simple shortcuts to great vegan meals.” By this stage, your readers will know about the problem and the benefits of your service or product, but you’ll need to give them that last little push to make the purchase. Customer reviews and the experiences of other readers can help provide just that. But as you’ll know from your own online purchases, people often have questions, even when they’re ready to buy. Including an FAQ section or live chat function are great ways of clearing up any issues standing in the way of your readers hitting the buy button. Finally, you’ll want to ensure that readers who’ve already made a purchase keep coming back for more. The key here is keeping them in the loop. Ask them to subscribe to a mailing list that details all the other wonderful products and services that you’re offering. Imagine how confusing it’d be for your friends if every time you hung out you spoke to them in a different voice and used different terminology. The same goes for brands. If you want people to associate your brand with a particular identity, you need to maintain a consistent tone. To do that, you first have to come up with a “brand voice.” This basically covers the way you communicate. It’s about sticking to a particular tone and consistently using the same kind of words and style. So, if you’re consistently witty, don’t suddenly turn super serious, or vice versa. Inconsistency confuses your readers. In fact, few things will make the experience of reading your blog more off-putting. So how do you decide what your brand voice is? There are three steps to crafting your unique voice. Start by taking stock of everything you’ve already written. Do your blog posts already have a consistent voice? Does your writing read like other blogs in your particular niche? Secondly, take some time to think about your brand. What three attributes best describe it and what it stands for? Is it artistic, charming and compassionate, or analytical, detailed and energetic? Defining your brand’s key characteristics will help you settle on a style that reflects them. Finally, you’ll want to run those attributes through the ADDE formula. That stands for attribute markers, dos, don’ts and expressions. Here’s how you do it. Say you’ve settled on “bold” as an attribute. Ask yourself what it means to have a bold brand voice. You might say that it means not being shy about challenging accepted ideas. That’s how you define your dos. Now ask yourself what it doesn’t mean. Being bold, for example, doesn’t mean using expletives. These are your don'ts. The final step is to decide which expressions best suit your brand voice. They can be specific words and catchphrases, or even puns and emojis. The key message in these blinks: There are lots of ways to go about creating exciting content – you just need a strategy for generating that big bag of ideas which will attract and maintain the interest of your readers and have them clicking that buy button.  Actionable advice: Promote your content. There are lots of ways to promote your blog, and social media is one of them. How about creating some images every time you blog, then share them with text overlays on Pinterest? Another way is to email everyone mentioned in your blog posts. Do you refer to another blogger? If so, email them and urge them to share your post. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Take someone like Dr. Dre, who started as a DJ in Los Angeles’s South Central district, moved on to become a successful producer and is now the owner of a headphone empire, as well as a high-ranking executive at Apple Music. Stories like his can be inspiring, but are also easily dismissed as something that only a happy few can achieve – specifically, those with exceptional talent and timing. But there is also power to be found in being broke. These blinks will offer insights into how being broke can help us achieve greatness, based on the experience of self-made men and women. In these blinks, you’ll find out how a poor immigrant turned an ice cream truck into a restaurant empire; why trying to reach new customer demographics can be a bad thing; and which successful computer company was founded by a guy who couldn’t operate a computer. Have you ever had to come up with something for dinner when you’re stuck with only two or three ingredients? If so, you might remember that limitations like this can often result in some of the tastiest meals. This is just one example of the truth in the old saying, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” Or, to put it another way, being short on resources can generate real creativity and inspiration that would otherwise never emerge. Having a million dollars to launch a business doesn’t mean it will be successful. On the contrary, already being rich can take away the passion and innovation that long-term success requires.   But with an empty bank account, it’s clear that your only chance for success is to dig deep and become innovative. It’s like being a basketball player who has one shot to win the game, but they’re at half-court with only a second left on the clock; there’s no other option but to go for it and take the spectacular shot. It’s also important to realize that innovation comes from a singular vision that starts from the bottom up, not the top down. It doesn’t matter if it’s entertainment, fashion or technology, ideas grow organically from the ground up – they aren’t inspired by executives dumping a bunch of money on a project. And when an idea really takes off, it’s usually because people respond enthusiastically to something real and authentic. Take Art Basel, for example, one of the world’s biggest art fairs, which takes place in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Miami Beach. While it has many established artists on display, many visitors get more excited about the unfunded street artists who are seen as being more genuine and “authentic.” This played a key part in coauthor Daymond John’s success with FUBU, which stands for For Us, By Us. The clothing line was inspired by the way real people in the streets were dressing, not by designer studios. You can also think of your brand as a personal relationship with your customer; like any good relationship, it has to be built on solid foundations. So be true to yourself – otherwise, the relationship is doomed to fail. If you’re familiar with the Rocky movies, you know that Rocky’s career falls apart when he lets his success get to his head and starts throwing money around. To get back on top, he realizes that he needs to rediscover his passion and hunger to win. A similar principle applies to business, as being hungry can keep you focused on your growth and help you stay realistic about what’s within reach. Just look at Capital One bank’s Small Business Confidence Score. This score is determined by a number of questions about a business's hiring plans, future outlook and the current economic situation. What the scores show are that overall confidence is at its highest rate since the 2008 recession, and that’s because small, hungry business owners know how to stick to business plans and use small steps to make great strides. A great way to stay hungry and successful is to think like a shark by knowing your waters while keeping focused on your target. On ABC’s reality TV show Shark Tank, one entrepreneur after another pitches their product or idea to investors. And if there’s one thing the show teaches, it’s that investors want to hear that an entrepreneur has a clear understanding of both their market and their goals. In one case, the show’s investors rejected an affordable athletic shoe company called Forus because the entrepreneurs had their target market down, but still wanted to expand in a way that took them well outside that market. With this in mind, an investment would have done them a disservice by encouraging them to focus on the wrong demographics. This is why an entrepreneur who uses the trunk of their car to sell a cheap product might have a better chance with an investor. If they can sell 50 units in under five minutes, it proves that they have a perfect understanding of their market. Some people are born with certain advantages while others start out at a disadvantage – but even if you have to work harder than others just to get on equal footing, don’t let it get you down. Being at a disadvantage and having few resources is actually a proven a recipe for success. In fact, immigrants to the United States are twice as likely as US citizens to start their own business. Rocky Aoki came to the United States from Japan in the 1960s, and in order to pay for his restaurant management classes, he rented an ice cream truck that he drove around New York City. He eventually saved up $10,000, which helped convince his father to invest in his restaurant, which went on to become the popular Japanese restaurant chain, Benihana. Rocky wanted his son, electronic dance musician Steve Aoki, to find his own success without relying on Rocky’s money. So, when Steve was 19 years old, he used the $400 he had to help start a music label by the name of Dim Mak Records with his friends. Their office was his apartment, which was regularly packed with up to 13 interns. Steve and his friends would self-produce a seven-inch single and sell it out of the back of their car after Steve’s DJ gigs until they could afford to make another one. While Steve did eventually max out ten different credit cards, today he’s a hugely popular musician with a successful label and lifestyle brand. As the Aokis show us, sometimes you have more resources at your disposal than you may think. If you’re a homeowner, you might have equity in your house that you can invest. But if you’ve taken out a loan, make sure you put money aside so you can make payments until your business starts earning money. Extra money can also come from small things you don’t need. If your car is just sitting in a garage every day, maybe you can sell it, like Steve Jobs did with his car to help buy the components for the first Apple computer. It may be that not everyone will notice or appreciate your authenticity, but it’s important to stick to your guns nevertheless. For instance, Acacia Brinley was recognized for her trendsetting Tumblr page, but her posts received a fair amount of negative feedback as well. Even so, the “selfie queen” of social media didn’t let this stop her. Remember that you don’t need to please everyone; it’s far more important that you remain true to yourself. Being broke only means you can't spend money to make things look fancy. Instead, use the Power of Broke and the fact that you’re in a can’t-lose situation to let your personality shine through. When Daymond John started FUBU, he knew he was going to be competing for shelf space with other clothing lines. But through his brand, he could show how much his community and clothing meant to him. And it didn’t take any extra money to do so. In fact, John used the Power of Broke, which forced him to spend very little money extremely wisely, to display his authenticity to the black community. John was one of the first designers to give his clothes away to hip-hop artists, who in turn wore them in music videos and helped solidify FUBU’s place in the fashion world. John then focused on Black Entertainment Television (BET), a US cable network that focuses on the black community. This way, John could reach his target audience easily, cheaply and directly. Since the Nielsen ratings company used very few black households to measure ratings when John started out, BET appeared to have a very low amount of viewers, so they charged very little for advertising. This worked in FUBU’s favor, as it allowed the brand to reach a wide audience for very little money. This is the kind of opportunity that you should keep an eye out for when things are looking bleak – one that allows you to stay in your market and stay authentic. Too many companies have gotten used to the idea of using “other people’s money” to do business. And though the thought of funding might sound appealing, there is such a thing as too much help. When you consider looking for investors, make sure you don’t risk losing control of your business. Bringing an investor on board means giving up a percentage of your business, which could also mean cutting into your already small profits or growing more quickly than you can handle.   The better kind of growth is one that is slow, profitable and under your control. Furthermore, bringing in outside capital also means having to rewrite your business plan, which can cause you to lose focus as well as control. Instead, be like Gigi Butler and stick to your vision, even when funding is nowhere to be found. Butler was determined to open a cupcake shop in Nashville, even when banks thought she was crazy and refused to give her a dime. Butler’s prior employment was as a cleaning lady for Nashville’s upper crust, so no one was willing to help fund her dream. But after maxing out credit cards and emptying her bank account down to her last 30 dollars, Gigi’s Cupcakes was finally open for business. And, sure enough, customers lined up out the door. Not only was Butler able to pay off her credit card debt, she maintained total control over her business and her profits. Today, there are Gigi’s Cupcakes locations in 24 states with $35 million in annual sales. Sometimes debt is impossible to avoid, so don’t let it get in the way of your vision. When you start turning a profit, you might be tempted to put it back into your business, or simply to enjoy it. But the smartest thing to do is to pay off your debts so that interest rates don’t eat away at your earnings and your accounts can start looking healthy and prosperous. Far too many businesses have gone under because of debt that got out of hand, so don’t be one of them. So far, we’ve seen how the Power of Broke can be applied to give hungry and focused entrepreneurs a leg up in the business world – but these same principles can be used by the major players as well. After all, most big corporations started out as small businesses, and they should all continue to use the same strategies that got them to where they are today. Yet, when companies get rich, they tend to start throwing money at problems rather than coming up with creative solutions. Take marketing, for instance; you could easily throw away millions on ad campaigns and forget about using free or low-cost resources like social media. One can only wonder why 38 percent of the current Fortune 500 companies don’t have an active Twitter account. Let’s look at a smart campaign from years ago, before the era of social media: General Mills, a company with an enormous marketing budget, wanted to reintroduce its struggling Nature Valley granola bars. Even though they could have spent millions putting ads in every grocery store, they stayed tightly focused and targeted places with active young clients, such as ski resorts and outdoor gear shops. Since then, Nature Valley has gone on to be one of General Mills’ top-selling brands. The Power of Broke can also be applied to an entire industry. At the start of 1970, cigarette advertising was everywhere in the United States, from radio and television ads to billboards and magazines, featuring beloved icons like the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel. Later in the year, however, the US government announced its intention to tighten advertising restrictions for tobacco companies; meanwhile, Chinese cigarette companies were planning on making their first foray into the American market. Rather than throwing money and lobbyists at this potential problem, the American tobacco industry saw an opportunity that wouldn’t cost a penny: they accepted the government’s advertising restrictions. The US brands knew they already had a strong hold on the market, and they also knew that without billboards and TV commercials, the new foreign brands wouldn’t stand a chance. Coca-Cola has been around so long that you can be forgiven for thinking it’s always been a success. But like any other global brand, it had to start somewhere. It’s possible to pinpoint four different phases that you need to get through patiently before your brand can go global. The first stage is the item, which is your product in its most basic form: no label, no marketing, nothing but a product that satisfies a need. So you might have a coffee maker that doesn’t even have a logo or name yet. The second stage is the label, which is when you give your product a name that sets it apart and makes it memorable. This way, after customers see it for the first time, they’ll know to ask for it by name the next time they’re in the market. The third stage is the brand, at which point you create a logo for better label recognition, as well as an identifiable style around your product. This stage accounts for the money spent on advertising and marketing, ensuring that people will seek out the product and will easily spot it on a crowded shelf. The fourth and final stage is the lifestyle, which is when your brand has grown to the point that customers have come to expect a certain level of quality and experience. This is the stage at which a product can become a status symbol, as is the case with Nike, Apple and FUBU. By leveraging the Power of Broke in each of these phases, companies have a greater chance of making it. As your product moves through these stages, you might encounter some sort of crisis, and this is when you’ll need to be patient. As the Harvard Business Review confirms, businesses that survive recessions do so by cutting costs and continuing to invest in growth, which you might do by, say, increasing funding to your research and development department. This way, you’ll be prepared to launch when the inevitable upswing comes around. The office supply chain Staples made it through the 2000 recession by shutting down underperforming stores, while increasing its overall workforce by ten percent. When the recession ended, Staples had actually become more profitable than it had been beforehand. These days, remarkable technological advances are a seemingly everyday occurrence. It’s a great time for small businesses because it’s easier than ever for them to get the funding they need. For starters, the cost of technology is extremely low. Every year, it gets cheaper and easier to maintain a website and store massive amounts of data online, which makes it less risky and costly to take potentially lucrative chances. Other great tools for small businesses are crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which allow entrepreneurs to raise money for their ideas while maintaining strict control. Honey Flow is just one example of a crowdfunding success. The company posted a five-minute video to Indiegogo about their dream to start an innovative beekeeping and honey-extracting business. They had hoped to raise $70,000 to make it to the label phase, but ended up raising an astounding $12 million, becoming the most successful Indiegogo campaign ever. Today, it’s easier than ever to turn creativity into success, even if you’re not particularly skilled. FUBU’s Daymond John couldn’t draw or sew anything more than a straight line, but it didn’t keep him from starting a clothing line. Even short basketball players who seemingly can’t compete with their taller peers can end up having successful careers by using their speed and agility to their advantage, or perhaps by managing or coaching a team if they’re passionate enough about the sport. But one of the best paths to success is to come up with creative solutions for those who need help doing something. Michael Dell wasn’t a computer genius; on the contrary, he started Dell Computers with the goal of coming up with a computer that would be more user-friendly. You don’t need to be a rich genius to become a successful entrepreneur. With the Power of Broke, all you need is some creativity to find the right idea, and a willingness to embrace change and overcome the challenges along the way. With these traits in place, there’s nothing to lose – and no limit to your possibilities. The key message in this book: It doesn’t take a lot of money to launch a business. In fact, not having money forces budding entrepreneurs to rise to the challenge with creative and innovative solutions that otherwise may not have occurred to them. There will always be challenges in the business world, but you can use the Power of Broke to stay prepared for anything that might come your way. Actionable advice: Follow Daymond John’s Shark Points for Success: Define your goal so you know where you’re headed. Do your homework: analytics are key, as is knowing the competition.

Too many people let their own ideas fall by the wayside because they were put off by someone thinking their ideas were stupid. So don’t let people disparage your ideas; they’re just afraid. Anyway, how are you going to live with yourself at 80 years old, never knowing if that one great idea would’ve made you rich? How can you know if that one idea is the kernel of something special? That’s what these blinks are about. Inside, you’ll find out how “stupid” ideas are often at the core of some of the greatest economic successes. More importantly, you’ll also discover how to take action on that one idea and find out if your “stupid” idea is the one that makes you a genius. In these blinks, you’ll learn the difference between good stupid and bad stupid; why farmers don’t lay their own eggs; and what Henry Ford’s biggest weakness was. We’ve all been through it: you come up with a great idea and can’t wait to share it with your friends, who promptly crush your enthusiasm by declaring that it’s ridiculous. Don't let it get to you! If you are deeply convinced of it, your “stupid” idea can take you down the path to success and happiness. In fact, seemingly stupid ideas have often formed some of the world´s leading innovations and businesses. People label new ideas as stupid because of doubt, fear, confusion or lack of understanding. How about “doggles”? – fashion sunglasses made for dogs. Would you have guessed that they’re bringing in around $3 million per year? The truth is that sometimes the greatest successes come as a total surprise. For example, in 1876, Western Union rejected the telephone, stating that “the device is inherently of no value to us.” Imagine the shock on their faces today! Many of the world´s leading entrepreneurs had to have their ideas rejected time and time again and, nevertheless, stuck by their goals, recognizing that their apparently stupid idea was not at all like other stupid ideas. You can make this distinction too, by thinking of those vaguely ridiculous ideas simply as the New Smart. Differentiating between plain dumb ideas and the New Smart is the first step to success. But how? You’ve got to trust your instincts. There’s no real rational way to determine whether an idea is truly stupid or merely labelled as such. You can only know that you are deeply convinced and strongly believe in it. The former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, described this trust by saying: “You know it when you feel it.” Not only will this trust in your idea help you differentiate between the stupid and the New Smart, it will also give you the courage to go after your idea, even when people tell you not to. The next blink explains why you shouldn’t hesitate over your idea, unless you want to look back on your life with some serious regrets! Imagine you’re 80 years old, sitting in your rocking chair, looking back at your life and thinking, “I wish I’d gone after that foolish idea I had back then.” Awful, right? If there’s anything you need in your old age, it’s the knowledge that you did everything possible to live your dreams while you were still able to.   Unfortunately, there’s always an excuse for not pursuing your dreams right this moment. Many people live by the deferred life plan, meaning they first do what they have to do (earn money) and only then do what they want to do. This leads people to try to get rich fast and then attempt to live their dreams. The bitter reality is, however, that the vast majority of people never get rich. Instead, they live life chasing their paycheck while their dreams fall by the wayside. Using lack of time, lack of money or lack of education as an excuse will only keep you stuck where you are. Or even worse: you’ll feel justified in not chasing your dreams! Think of yourself at 80 again. As the cliche goes, you’re not going to regret what you did, but what you didn’t do. Jeff Bezos used to remind himself this mantra to help him decide to chase his dreams. By imagining himself as an elderly man looking back on his life, he was able to decide to leave his job on Wall Street to found Amazon. By doing so, he walked away from his annual bonus at the end of the year. He could’ve waited, got his bonus, and left the company then. But he realized it wouldn’t be the missed bonus that he’d regret, but that somebody realized his idea of selling books online before he did. So, remember Jeff Bezos’ example and let your future regrets serve as today’s imperative! And once you’re brave enough to commit, it’s time to start taking the next steps in bringing the idea to life. Read on in the next blink to find out how you can turn your crazy idea into a feasible business. There’s nothing quite as daunting as beginning a project. The goal you’re striving for can seem huge and far away. How can you make sure you don’t get lost along the way? Breaking your big future benchmark of success into smaller steps will keep you motivated. For example, if you’re dreaming of becoming a successful blogger, you can start with several smaller projects, such as writing your first posts and achieving a certain number of views per month. Smaller projects give you the freedom to fail without questioning your whole idea. For example, if you’ve brainstormed up several topics to blog about and the first one doesn’t quite get the views you need, you can switch to a different topic, instead of giving up on blogging altogether! During these early phases, there’s another challenge you’ll face. Every field has its standards, and accepted methods of how things are done. These can be helpful at times, and other times they’ll block change and innovation. To succeed, constantly question current standards. Only then will you discover better ways to do things. And, even when your idea does achieve success, continue to innovate by seeing things in terms of the stupid loop.  The stupid loop describes how successful innovations become the new standard. As such, they then  need to be challenged by new “stupid” ideas in order for innovation to continue. But if you fail to reassess ideas, you’ll only limit your own success.   Henry Ford made this mistake after he revolutionized the world with his “stupid” idea for the Model T. Blinded by its success, Ford refused to consider ideas to improve it even further. This foolishness lead to a nosedive in the company’s market share. So we know now that we’ll achieve our big ideas by turning them into smaller projects, and reassessing our approach along the way. Still, it does seem like quite a long journey. Is there any way to speed things up? You’ll find out in the next blink! We’re all afraid of failure, and nobody wants to admit that their plan isn’t working. But bold ideas require courage, and crushing your fear of failure is the first step towards your goal. How can we learn to be brave? Remember why you’re doing what you’re doing! Meditating on your aspirations will give you the determination needed when fear brings you to a halt. Imagine you’re a surfer and your goal is to surf a 20-foot wave, because you know how proud of yourself you’d be. Although you’ll fall many times trying, remembering why you’re trying in the first place will keep you persistent. On the other hand, not confronting your fears will just lead to further inactivity and avoidance. But by experiencing small wins – overcoming small fears, you’ll soon be able to confront your bigger fears too. As a surfer, for example, you wouldn’t start with a 20 foot wave; you’d conquer smaller waves first. You’ve also got to be sure that you don’t miss that wave altogether! If you keep waiting until tomorrow to start your project, you could miss your chance. The longer you wait, the lazier and less capable you’ll feel. Most people procrastinate at some point, but there are ways to overcome it. First, don’t try to find free time in a busy schedule. Instead, actively make time, by cancelling other commitments that aren’t as pressing. Secondly, make life easier and simplify your tasks: don't get stuck doing unnecessary things, like spending hours on designing your blog instead of writing! And finally, tell other people about what you’re trying to achieve. This will, at the very least, put the pressure on you to have some new developments to talk about next time you see them! If you’re determined to succeed on your own, you’re only making things harder for yourself. By surrounding yourself with knowledgeable people, you’ll have a supportive safety net that you can rely on, even just for something like a second opinion. So how can we build ourselves these networks? One way is to approach someone who has already been through what you’re doing. For example, if you want to pitch an idea for a business to a group of investors, you can ask for advice from someone who successfully pitched her work to the group. Another vital part of building your network is being grateful. By giving your thanks to the person who advised you about the investors, not only will you make her feel good, but you can also ensure her future support. Imagine you are giving money to two homeless people. Without any acknowledgement, one grabs the money and goes. The other expresses gratitude and makes sure that you know how appreciated your gift is. To whom would you consider giving money again? Gratitude goes hand-in-hand with another key factor in finding support – trust. Fruitful relationships start with you trusting yourself. If you are confident in yourself and your worth, others will notice. And, they’ll be more likely to trust you too. What’s more, if you yourself trust other people, you’ll see that they’ll want to live up to your expectations. In fact, distrusting someone raises suspicions and might lead to them doubting you in return. Once you start building a trusted network around you, you’ll find the resources available to you increase. Whether it’s money, advice or experience, you can find what you’re looking for among your network. Getting fixated on what you don’t have is not going to get your idea moving. Instead, you should make do with what you’ve got and embrace ingenuity. In fact, many businesses achieve success by being resourceful and leveraging what they have. If you think that the only respectable way to build a business is by building everything from scratch by yourself, you’ll find it nearly impossible to achieve your potential for success. After all, farmers who don't lay their own eggs are not considered frauds! Supermarkets sell things that somebody else produced; theaters play movies made by other people and Google Search organizes information that is already out there. You’ll find levers everywhere around you if you go and look for them. A good place to start is with your computer! Almost everything is possible with the tools that the internet provides. You can launch your own TV show on Youtube, sell self-made products on Etsy, or write your own newspaper in a blog. If it’s money or experience that you’re lacking, then turn to the network that you’ve built. By focusing on a relationship with someone who has exactly what you need, you’ll be able to gain a mentor! And it’s not so outlandish that someone who’s achieved it all would bother helping you. Successful business people like to advise like-minded, ambitious people. For example, Bill Hewlett, the cofounder of Hewlett-Packard, mentored the young Steve Jobs during a school project in eighth grade. So, no more excuses! You have the know-how to bring your dream to life. If you’re after success, remember: there’s no time like the present. The key message in this book: If you don't start realizing that pressing idea of yours right now, it will never happen. You will always find an excuse: lack of money, time or experience. Don't live a life of regret. Embrace pressing ideas of yours now, even if other people consider them “stupid.”  Actionable advice: Write it all down!  If a whole bunch of projects are on your mind, write them down. Then you can choose which one to pursue now. Send yourself all those ideas in an email so you always have a searchable date-stamped reference for later. Now consider if you only had a short time to live, which of those ideas would you go after first? You’ll find the one pressing idea or project that you need to start working on. Now.

Wrong! You don’t need an MBA or a winning lottery ticket to start a successful business or improve the one you’ve got. You just need some common sense and a few basic guidelines. For example, every good businessperson knows how to negotiate, but you don’t need a whole semester to learn the key to good negotiation (Just check out blink seven). And that’s just one of the tips that’s helped The Personal MBA become the go-to book for anyone interested in business. In these blinks, you’ll learn why an MBA is a big fat waste of time and money; how to confirm if your business idea is any good; and how borrowing money can actually increase your profits. Want to go into business, but have no idea where to start? Business school seems like a tempting prospect, a place where all the knowledge and contacts you need are simply handed to you – but is it really your ticket to success? It has to be, right? Otherwise why else would people pay so much for their MBA? Business school is expensive, that’s for sure – the top 15 MBA programs charge up to $53,208 per year for tuition. That’s not even including fees, loan interest or living expenses! What if we factor those into the equation, plus the opportunity cost of lost wages too? Turns out there are eight different US business schools where the cost of an MBA exceeds $300,000. “Wait,” you might think, “surely not all business schools are that pricey!” True, however, any student who holds an MBA has an average debt of $41,687 (again, without accounting for additional expenses). OK, so business school costs a lot. Is this what the educational experience is worth? Short answer: nope. In the long term, an MBA does nothing for your career. If it did, a master of business administration degree should correlate with measures of success, like an increased salary, or promotions to higher level positions. And it doesn’t. Researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington conducted an extensive study into the matter. Analyzing 40 years’ worth of data, they found that there is no correlation between long-term career success and possessing an MBA, whether you graduated with flying colors or just scraped a passing grade. So if business school can’t make your entrepreneurial career blossom, what can? Well, you can learn a lot from experience, and from your own research online – or from books like this one. Now that you know not to waste your money on an MBA, let’s get down to business – your business. What kind of company should you start? You might think that since the IT industry is booming right now, starting an IT business would be a smart idea. But what if you absolutely despise IT as a field? Here’s a fact that more people should know: your business won’t thrive if you do it for money alone. Even if it’ll run itself eventually, your business will still need hundreds of work hours and generous amounts of money to set up. For example, in order to afford to hire people to deal with mundane tasks like payroll and HR, you’ll need to work incredibly hard for a few years. If you’re only in it for the money, can you see yourself persevering until your company reaches that point? Probably not! But if you start a business in a field that you like, not only will you be more likely to stick with it, you’ll also be ahead on the decision-making front. If you know a certain amount about the specific market you’re entering, you’ll be able to make sound decisions, develop an attractive product and tackle the competition. Say you’re into team sports. This may put you in a better position to judge which products meet the needs of sportsmen, making for a better line of business to focus on – even if there’s more demand for IT products. On the other hand, you might feel so passionate about an idea that it impedes your judgment. Imagine a small town, where expressionist art exhibitions are understandably in no high demand. When you’re an expressionist art lover, you may be oblivious to this lack of interest and try to found a museum of Expressionism right there. Sure, this could be a highly rewarding experience, but by no stretch is it a promising business idea – a painful truth that an enthusiastic art lover might be reluctant to acknowledge. But let’s say you’re not an oblivious expressionist art fan, or a grudging IT entrepreneur. Let’s say you’ve found just the right mind-set to start your own business. The next question is – how do you actually enter the market? Underneath that there’s another question: is there a shortcut to getting all the money you need? Read on in the following blinks to find out. So you’ve found a great new business opportunity, but you’re short on the cash you need to pursue it. Should you just stop right there? No way. Instead, leverage your investment. What is leverage? Simply put, it’s any technique that amplifies investor profits or losses. Typically, it’s the strategy of using borrowed money to increase your profit potential. In this way, you can make enormous gains with very little of your own capital. Let’s say you want to make a big investment that you couldn’t afford without borrowing money: you want to buy four properties at $100,000 each, but only have $20,000 of your own capital. If you borrow $380,000 and the properties double in value, you’ll have made $400,000 with just $20,000 of your own capital. That’s a 20-times return on your investment! But if the idea that borrowing more always means earning more seems a little too good to be true, well, you’re right. Leverage can be risky because it also amplifies your losses.  Let’s return to our example: imagine that the properties you bought lost half their value – your losses would amount to $200,000. That’s right, you’d lose ten times your own capital resources. For a real life example of this, you need only look to the catastrophic recession of 2008, which was caused in part by the enormous amount of leverage used by investment banks, who were caught with catastrophic losses when the property bubble popped. The lesson? Leverage can be great, but you’ve got to watch out. Many think that for a product to sell, it just has to be good – not true. Consider this: People will only want something if it fulfills their needs. Let’s put it this way – a vampire won’t pay to use your state-of-the-art solarium (unless you’ve allowed him to use it to trap unsuspecting customers!) All our decisions are influenced by our basic needs, including our buying decisions. Imagine selling a bottle of stale water to a hiker lost in a desert. He’d be willing to pay just about anything for that lousy bottle, just because it responds to his predominant need. The lesson here? Find your own desperate hiker. Any successful business fulfills one or more of its customers’ needs, and Harvard professors Nitin Nohria and Paul Lawrence asserted that there are four needs or drives that are common to all humans. The first of these is the desire to acquire and collect things, whether it’s stamps, shares or social status. Retailers and investment brokerages are the businesses that cater to this. Secondly, we have the drive to bond with other people, so we can feel valued and loved. Businesses such as dating services and companies that promise to make us more desirable (perfumeries, beauty salons) are the ones that meet this drive. Thirdly, we want to learn and satisfy our curiosity. Why else would you be reading these blinks right now? It goes without saying that Blinkist is one of the services that fulfills that need. Finally, we strive to defend ourselves, our loved ones and our property, which is where security firms and companies selling alarms come in. Consider your business idea in the light of each of these drives. Which of these four drives could your business cater to? Say your product meets not just one, but three of your customers’ basic needs. It’s ready to deliver! Now, where are all those clients who should be drooling over it? Well, you’ll need to get their attention first. But in this age of social media and information overload, this is no easy task. If you want customers to pay attention, you’ll need to offer something remarkable and memorable. And if we want to do this, we’ve got to think about the way we deliver our message to clients – the medium matters. For example, if the form of your message makes a customer think it’s made just for her, you’re far more likely to get her attention. Show your customer that you’ve made the extra effort, even if it’s just with a hand-addressed FedEx envelope. Sure, this can be expensive, but it’s worthwhile to inform selected prospective clients in a high-quality way – certainly better than spamming an entire town’s inboxes with irritating emails. If you want to market your product effectively, there’s another crucial aspect you should consider: the product’s end result. Think about it: people don’t buy a product for its own sake. They buy it because of the end result they’re hoping to attain. For example, a woman won’t pay $20 for a lipstick simply because the color is nice. She buys it because she hopes it will make her more desirable. A great way to highlight your product’s end result is through testimonials, in a statement made by an ordinary person who overcame adversity, all thanks to your product. Say you’re selling an acne cream – your testimonial could be from a pimply teenager who thought he was doomed to be an outcast until your product cleared his skin right up. That’s the sort of story that’s going to draw your customers in. Picture this: you’re visiting a pet store and see a puppy that you’re absolutely smitten with. But you’re unsure whether you want to buy it. The owner makes an offer to you to take the dog home for a week and guess what? It works its charms and you can’t imagine returning it once the week is over. This is an example of how a sales expert can convince a reluctant prospect to become a customer. But how, exactly? You can increase sales if you account for your clients’ fears. We all hate to make a bad choice, and this makes us cautious customers. Instead of buying the wrong thing, we’d rather buy nothing at all – right? In sales theory, this is called a major barrier to purchase. Naturally, it’s something salespersons hate. To encourage prospects to buy something, salespersons shoulder the risk of a bad transaction – by allowing the customer to return that cute puppy if things don’t work out. This strategy works for non-adorable items, too. For example, it’s often possible to try out a bed for an entire year, and return it for a full refund. This makes people more likely to purchase a bed. So if you can find out why your customers might say no, you’ll be able to talk them into a “yes.” In sales, reasons for saying no are called standard objections, and there are several of these. A customer might fear the product costs too much, or it won’t provide the promised benefits, or that he doesn’t need the product yet, and so on. If you know why your client won’t buy, you can devise an argumentative strategy and basically convince him that he’s dead wrong. Say he thinks his old laptop will have to do for a while longer. You can convince him that his old laptop is incompatible with essential new software. How do you picture a negotiation? You might see yourself sitting at a conference table and discussing a deal, but don’t get ahead of yourself! This is just the last phase of a negotiation. A good negotiation actually occurs in several stages. The first part of negotiation is setting the stage. Long before you start exchanging offers with your business partners, you can optimize your outlook in the early decisions you make. You could make sure you’re negotiating with the right person, for example: did the company send someone with real decision-making authority? Or just someone who’s been assigned to collect information for those in power? You can also create a conducive environment by choosing the setting you’re most convincing in. Will you present your offer in person, over the phone or should you organize an online meeting? An elegant office could make a great impression, but maybe your voice is a lot more confident over the phone. If you’re having trouble deciding, research data in your industry or market may prove very helpful. Once you’ve prepared, decide on the terms of your proposal. Consider how attractive your offers will be to the other party, and in every case, search for ways to make the offer even more desirable. You could even try to find out the other party’s offers. Then you can work out a way to make yours seem superior. You’ve always got to consider the worst-case scenario, so anticipate possible objections and create an argumentative strategy to defuse or counter them. And, in case they don’t work, decide on the concessions and compromises that you’re willing to accept. The final stage of negotiation is the actual discussion. Because of the effort you put in during the first two stages, you’ll be far better prepared. In fact, most of the hard work at this point is already over! Ever had a plan that seemed great until you tried to put it into action? Some bosses have great schemes they just can’t implement. Are they unlucky with their employees? Or is it possible they just don’t know how to communicate with them? Here’s what they don’t know: If you want others to do something, you should tell them why you want them to do it. Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer demonstrated this in a study where her students asked others queuing in front of a Xerox to let them go first. 60 percent of the people agreed, but when a reason for the request was provided, an impressive 95 percent complied. Moreover, if you tell people about your intentions, everyone can work in ways that support that plan, and know what to do if the situation changes. This way, you won’t have to micromanage every step. Imagine a general telling his field commander to capture a hill, but the situation changes and capturing the hill becomes strategically futile – the field commander will know how to react if he knows the larger goal is to flank the enemy. There’s another way to boost your communication, and it’s very simple: stop putting others down. Yet it’s surprising how often we find ourselves dismissing our coworkers’ comments. It might make you feel superior but it gets you nowhere, causing your partner to withdraw from the conversation, even if you don’t notice it. People can also become defensive and try to save face rather than understand your comments. Think about it: how engaged and cooperative would you be in a conversation with your boss after he said: “This is the silliest idea I’ve ever heard of.” By contrast, effective communication sees both partners actively and comfortably exchanging ideas in a dialogue that could strengthen the entire organization. Sure, it’s no fun to be unproductive, but being too busy can harm you and your work too. The best way to be productive is, in fact, through setting limits. If you have several things to do at once, your performance can be reduced across all of them. Your brain can only handle so much. Think of it like juggling: the more balls you’re trying to juggle at once, the more likely you are to drop them all. Moreover, with every task come unexpected demands that take extra time and effort to deal with. If your schedule doesn’t allow for extra time, you won’t be able to cope with those demands, especially if they’re coming from several tasks at once. So how can we stay in tune with what we can handle? Your best bet is to listen to the natural fluctuations of your energy. We’re not talking about a far-fetched, new age concept here – it’s simply that your productivity isn’t distributed evenly throughout the day. Instead, your body has a natural rhythm. Sometimes you can feel highly alert and productive. At other times, you’re far too tired to get anything done at all. Though it varies from person to person, most people are more productive in the morning than around noon. We also know that energy cycles in 90-minute-spans. So within that one-and-a-half-hour frame your energy will both rise and fall. If you’re aware of these natural fluctuations, you can take advantage of the times when you feel energized. And more importantly, you can recognize when you’re crashing and take a well-needed break. The key message in this book: If you want a thriving business, your product should cater to the core needs of your customers. By communicating confidently and cleverly, you can convince your clients to buy, your employees to cooperate and your business partners to sign your deal.  Actionable advice: Actions speak louder than words.  The next time you have to hire a new employee, don’t go for the applicants who performed best in an interview. Instead, do some extra research and find out how an applicant has performed in past months or years. Past performance is the best predictor of future performance.

At the same time, saturated markets and accelerated market dynamics demand new business approaches to connect to customers’ emotions. The answer to these demands is a walking oxymoron: the business rebel. This relatively new species of entrepreneur is driven by passion and values carried over into their organizations and business approaches. Although loved by customers and employees, the business rebel is feared by the old and clumsy competition. In these blinks, you’ll find out: how to find your inner rebel and incorporate your passions and values into your work, what expert surfers and successful business leaders have in common, why celebrating failure is essential to being successful, and why you shouldn’t listen to people with MBAs. Do you know people who’ve led a successful career but feel dissatisfied with themselves, like all they’ve accomplished has been meaningless? One name for this is a midlife crisis, but another way of putting it is that they’ve lost touch with their inner rebel. Many people realize their special talents and passions at a young age but let them go over time. Business rebels, however, manage to hold on to them into adulthood. As Pablo Picasso said, “Every child is an artist … the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” So the basic question is, how far behind have you left your inner artist? Many people gradually adapt to society’s norms and rules as they age. They start shedding their naïve dreams and passions – say, to become a Major League Baseball player or a rock star – because they’re told that it’s extremely unlikely to make money that way. But this results in a disconnect from a major part of your persona and, later down the road, a potentially unsatisfactory life. The business rebels, however, fight the expectations of society and hold onto their inner artists. The origins of many successful business rebels can be found in their childhood. Richard Branson, for example, threw together all sorts of businesses when he was a kid, including breeding parrots and growing Christmas trees. He continued his rebel spirit into business ventures as a young adult, creating multiple wildly successful businesses, namely Virgin Records and Virgin Atlantic Airways. So how do you reconnect with your inner child or inner rebel and dare to follow your passion? Try to scan through your past: your old diaries, school assignments, photos, or anything else that will help you remember your old self. You can also ask yourself: who did you always worship? What attributes do you admire in other people? Find that passion and you’ll find the source that powers your inner rebel. Are all business rebels thoughtless risk-takers and ruthless leaders? No, but it’s in their nature to test the status quo on a regular basis. Business rebels thus need to strike a balance between four distinct attributes if they want to be successful: vision, passion, instinct and agility. Having a vision allows a business rebel to establish direction for his or her organization, even when the business faces chaos from all sides. Rebels may come off as naïve or kooky for letting themselves be guided by a vision that looks unrealistic, but it’s a powerful force. And once their vision gives the organization direction, their passion fuels it. Vision and passion in a business rebel often inspire cult-like followers and organizations that have a familial environment. Then there’s the gut instinct. Steve Jobs had just the type of instinct rebel leaders need to tap into, namely, his famous sixth sense of knowing which products, such as the iPhone, were capable of changing the world. Lastly, rebels need to be agile if they want to do justice to their vision, passion and instinct. Innovations don’t last as long as they used to and nobody has time for years of marketing studies before launching a product, so rebels have to trust their instincts, make snap decisions and move quickly. But, as with everything, there is such a thing as too much. Rebels who are too extreme can manifest the four attributes to a destructive degree. For instance, instinctive business rebels may enter denial mode, i.e., they refuse to accept failure until it’s too late to learn from it. And rebels who are too obsessed with their vision can succumb to emotional outbursts and ignore important, everyday tasks. In order to avoid these situations and keep their feet on the ground, some rebel leaders look to colleagues. Bill Gates resigned from his position as CEO of Microsoft, seeing that a professional CEO was better suited to realize the company’s long-term vision. Have you come across an executive that’s highly productive and effective but totally boring? That’s what happens when people leave their passions and values outside of work. We all want to be part of something bigger than ourselves. That’s why great leaders let a set of values guide their management and organizations. The book Built to Last: Habits of Visionary Companies concludes that, among exceptionally successful companies, there is an unmistakable correlation between sustainable profitability and guiding core values. Since there is no perfect set of personal values, everyone has to find their convictions and express them as they choose. True rebels integrate them in their life and their work. So how do you find your own core values? Start by writing a list of people, characteristics and actions you admire. Try to find connections between them, and use the connections to formulate your core values. Let’s say you admire bravery and humor. Now, think about how these values are represented by the things you do at work and outside of work. You’ll probably find that your job isn’t incorporating as many values as you’d like, or maybe even making you act against your values. The next step is to identify the misalignments between the way things work and your set of values. Write down your good habits, i.e., the ones that agree with your values, and the bad ones, i.e., the ones that work against your values; work on eliminating the bad ones. Then apply your values to your organization. If one of the highest values in your organization is trust and customer satisfaction, then sales representatives who have to ask the headquarters every time they need money to fulfill even the most inconsequential of customer requests indicates a misalignment of your values. Entrusting your sales representatives with a budget to make spontaneous decisions in favor of the customer would be the right move. Starting your own company is always a whirlwind of emotion and instinct – even more so when you’re a business rebel. And when you’re just giving birth to your business, you’re sure to encounter opposition and obstacles that can easily throw you off course. Following a few guidelines will help you avoid errors. First, don’t start a business with a friend. A typical mistake for novice entrepreneurs is to start a business with a friend. They think it’s a recipe for success because they know and trust each other and it sounds like a good time. Unfortunately, these business endeavours tend to end early along with the friendship. While trust is always important in a partner, you should also be looking for someone who complements your skill set and your knowledge, and with whom you can work on a professional level. When you have a rebellious business idea, have faith in it and the talent with which you surround yourself. Your rebel business idea has to question current industry wisdom and look at things from a new perspective. As Wal-Mart’s founder Sam Walton said: “Swim upstream. Go the other way. If everybody else is doing it one way, there’s a good chance you can find your niche by going in exactly the opposite direction.” But sooner or later you’re bound to encounter people, especially people with MBAs, who will say your idea is impossible to realize. Use the valuable knowledge and skills of such people to help you solve problems, and simultaneously, don’t let them make you feel insecure about your business ideas. After all, it’s your vision and instinct that makes you the rebel entrepreneur and the MBA-holder your employee or consultant. And remember Henry Ford’s wise words: “Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off the goal.” As you start building your organization, you have to communicate your vision and values or else it’ll get awfully lonely at the top. There are multiple ways to communicate your vision to your organization. The two most effective are verbal and aspirational. The verbal approach builds on the vocabulary used in the organization. Certain words or phrases can become a mantra for your rebel organization and spread your vision and the values. For example, at Disney World, it’s “guests,” not customers; at Joie de Vivre hotels, it’s “hosts,” not the service staff. These word choices enforce the friendly, family-like atmosphere that’s part of the vision, and the customer-oriented values these companies want to represent Another powerful method for communicating your vision is by means of aspiration. When Jack Welch became CEO of General Electric in 1981, his role was to simplify the company’s complex problems. He created a concrete aspiration for the company, announcing that it needed to become either the best or second-best in every industry it was in, or it would have to leave that industry. At the time, GE was in a lot of slow-growing industries and, after Welch’s announcement, it divested about $20 billion worth of business. At the same time, it invested about $50 billion in acquisitions that were more likely to be the best or second-best in the industry, matching Welch’s vision. During his tenure, the company's value rose 4000 percent, pointing to the success of his vision and strategy. It’s your job to make complex visions and values easily understandable and tangible for your organization. Just remember: everything should be expressed in a way that an intelligent seven-year-old can understand. When your vision and values live throughout the organization, a vibrant corporate culture will arise almost on its own. Have you ever noticed that every company has rules of thumb that represent its collective wisdom and experience? Those common sentiments often trickle down from the top. You can teach those rules of thumb and sentiments to your employees. For example, a business rebel might instinctually know when it’s best to oppose conventional wisdom, which is valuable knowledge. Therefore, rebel entrepreneurs need to create an open environment for learning and sharing in their organizations, enabling every employee to learn to think like the company owner. One way is to rigorously implement open-book management, making decisions and the state of finances transparent to everybody in your organization. Being transparent and teaching your employees can have a huge impact on your business’s overall performance. The author cites a meeting he once had with his staff, in which he discussed the impact one receptionist could have on the company’s annual revenue. Doing his calculations in front of everyone, he explained how if one receptionist could get guests to upgrade their rooms by an average of $8, then – if you multiply that by fifty rooms per night, five nights a week, fifty weeks a year – it would add up to $100,000 annually. The meeting boosted his employees’ morale and the average room upgrade increased to $12. Now, ask yourself what rules of thumb you use and how you can create an environment of constant learning in your organization. In the past, the market was dominated by big, tank-like companies with endless resources and economies of scale. Today, in the internet generation, where the additional cost of another electronic page is virtually zero, economies of scale lose their power and it’s more important for companies to innovate quickly. That means there’s an intensified need for innovation and adaptability. In the same way that expert surfers unite agility with instinct to look past the wave in front of them, taking into account the potential effects of the swell and the set, an agile company must also ensure that the strategy it’s riding is a sustainable, long-term trend and not a short-lived fad. One way to implement agility and motivate quick transformation is to celebrate failure. Gavin Newsom, CEO of PlumpJack Group, a brand of wineries, resorts and restaurants in Northern California, realized his employees don’t try new ideas mainly because they’re afraid of doing something wrong. He thus came up with an award of $600 per month for the employee with the most creative solution to a problem, even if the solution failed. Thanks to that award, which highlights that Newsom valued creativity and innovation over perfection, the company has found many solutions that has led it to stand out. They were the first winery in the region, for example, to use screw caps on super premium wine. Organizational structures and the bureaucracy surrounding businesses drastically reduces their agility. Reducing your organizational footprint to the bare minimum will help you to fulfill your core values. So ask yourself: does your organizational structure keep you close to your customers? Does it enable an unhindered, informal communication between key departments? Does it allow project teams to focus on innovation and act with the long term in mind? Service today is more important than ever, because competition is higher in most markets and customers expect better service. The following three levels of services have an impact on customer satisfaction, from low to high impact: expected, desired and unexpected. Expected service includes average service and friendliness: customers may come back, but only if they don’t find something better. Desired service is what the customer prefers: customers will come back because it’s just the way they like it. Unexpected service is special and surprising, like an unexpected gift. Customers form a personal connection to you, will come back repeatedly and will even tell their friends about their experience. One way to raise employee awareness to service levels is playing a game in which they have to name a place where they experienced extraordinary service and explain what made it extraordinary. They’ll probably answer with things like, “The waiters always remember my name when I enter the restaurant” or “They love their product and it shows.” Your organization can also improve its ability to provide an extraordinary experience by determining its customers’ moments of truth. Moments of truth are the critical points of contact your customer has with your organization. These are most likely the service points in your store, sales department or customer support center. Your job is to identify these critical points together with your employees, and determine the quality and impact of the current performance. One good exercise is to go on a retreat with your service staff and let them identify and discuss all possible critical customer relation points in your organization. Then, they should specify steps for managing these moments and create service rules to ensure high quality all the time. When people buy products today, they aren’t just buying stuff: they’re buying a representation of themselves in the form of your brand. That’s why successful brands understand that the decision to buy something is highly emotional and often linked to our self-image, our aspirations and what our friends tell us. So be sure to think of your target market as more than just demographics, study psychographics. Whereas demographics, such as age and gender, describe target markets, psychographics describe the emotional motivations beneath the surface, like the desire to be hip, successful, special, etc. What could be a potentially lucrative target market for your company and how would you describe it in psychographic terms? As a rebel entrepreneur, you can connect business’s vision to the target market. Phoenix, a rock-and-roll hotel, used an analogy to Rolling Stone magazine, describing themselves as adventurous, hip, irreverent, funky and young at heart. Psychographic profiles not only help you find your target customers, but also become the framework of your concept, strongly influencing the design, services and profile of your staff. Once your concept is hashed out, tap into the early adopters to generate buzz. Early adopters are the type of people who try new inventions and styles first and are good at spreading ideas. When clothing designer Tommy Hilfiger wanted to outpace Calvin Klein in the United States, he realized white teens often emulated the styles of African-American teens, who tended to have a rebellious urban fashion sense. Thus, Hilfiger started targeting rap stars and urban teens, outselling Calvin Klein in the coveted under-twenties market. When your company outgrows its start-up character, you’ll eventually be confronted with the problems that stem from more mature organizations, i.e., complexity and bureaucracy. As a rebel entrepreneur, it’s your job to foster a little chaos and creativity in your organization. Here are a few tips: Build a clubhouse for your innovators. If new and innovative ventures start appearing inside your organization, free them from the boundaries of your policies and organizational bureaucracy as soon as possible. Your goal is to mimic the start-up feeling as authentically as possible, so use the advantage of your resources while preventing the disadvantages of excessively large teams and corporate clumsiness. For example, when Hewlett-Packard started their internet business, they immediately put their project team in a different building, so their branch would feel small like a start-up, ensuring the freedom and thrill that leads to innovative behavior. Another effective and easy way to ensure innovation is by setting a tough goal that a high percentage of revenue has to come from new products and services. By doing this – benchmarking their innovative revenue – HP and 3M, for example, have proved to be leaders in innovation. Finally, you need to celebrate your rebels. Almost every industry is fighting a war for talent, so the rebels in your company are one of your most valuable assets. Your job is to identify them and make sure they stay with you. One good way is to publicly celebrate your innovators and rebels with prizes and honors. Another good way – and possibly the only way to compete with the entrepreneurial enticements outside your company – is to outrageously compensate your top-rebels (much like NBA teams do with their biggest stars). In Japanese, the word karoshi means “death by overwork.” And while death is only the outcome of being overworked in rare cases, burnout is a widespread phenomenon. These days, most of us work far more hours than in the past and it seems we have a tendency to want it all. Rebels are particularly vulnerable to burnout because they’re used to pushing the boundaries of their own performance. And since they’re always looking for challenges, they have a high tolerance for pain. In addition, most of the rebel entrepreneurs are working towards their life’s dream. That said, there are techniques for preventing burnout and helping you keep your feet firmly on the ground. We all have our ups and downs, either over the course of a day (think: afternoon tiredness) or a year (think: winter depression). Similarly, your business experiences ups and downs. Now, think about how can you use that knowledge to organize your time as effectively as possible. After all, the work you do is not only a function of the time you invest but also the amount of energy and creativity you have available at that time. Don’t waste lots of time when you’re feeling low-energy and uncreative. Schedule your most important and creatively demanding tasks for your up-times and redundant and simple task for your down-times. But if you still feel you’re drowning in tasks and challenges, consider taking some time off. We often need more than just a long weekend or a two-week vacation to ponder deep questions like: “Am I being driven by my ego or my soul?” Many companies allow staff to take a month, or even half a year, to do the things they otherwise couldn’t. Speak with your employer or implement sabbaticals in your own organization to give your rebels the freedom to be who they are. This will keep them by your side instead of burning out or switching companies. The key message in this book: Connecting with your inner rebel makes you more successful in business and happier in life. You and your rebel company should make use of four distinct rebel attributes – vision, passion, instinct and agility – to keep up with the accelerated market conditions and spawn continuous innovation. Innovation and agility are more important than security. Actionable advice: Dare to connect with your inner passions. It may seem like the most natural thing in the world, but with time many of us lose the ability to tap in to our inner passions, let alone use them in our work. Think about what you loved most as a child and make it a part of your private and professional life. Identify your key values and rigorously live by them. Find and eliminate any discrepancies between your ideal values and parts of your life that don’t represent them. Go beyond the numbers. Define your target group with a psychographic profile instead of a demographic profile.

Do you see other companies rapidly attaining success as their loyal customers spread their brand, story and product all over the internet and the world? Well, the difference is in referrals. Referrals are recommendations for your company made by customers or partners to new prospective customers. They’re essential to any in-depth marketing strategy and can make all the difference between a floundering start-up and the next big thing. To make your company “referral worthy,” six aspects are essential. Combined, they make up what’s known as a “referral engine,” an unstoppable referral machine that will propel your company to success. In these blinks, we cover what they are and how you can apply them to your business. You’ll also learn why getting more customers isn’t always a good thing; why you shouldn’t be afraid of giving away too much; and how you can collaborate with other businesses to your mutual benefit. So, you want people to refer your company to others. Well, you can make that goal a reality by tapping into the psychological impulse that compels humans to make recommendations of any kind. The social nature of humanity means people want to make referrals as a means of earning recognition. This makes perfect sense when you consider that, within tribal societies, maintaining good social standing was a precondition for survival. After all, failing to make people like and value you could mean rejection from the tribe and near-certain death. As a result, a deep desire for social validation is hardwired into our brains. In fact, the quest for validation from others is so deep within us that it’s controlled by the same part of the brain that’s responsible for primitive functions like hunger, sleep and sex drive. To benefit from this impulse to earn social validation, your business should only present relevant and useful information. For instance, telling another tribe member about a good fishing spot during a time of famine would naturally earn the referrer a good deal of respect. But how do you make your business referral worthy? By showing that it can be trusted to provide a stellar solution or experience. This is a vital step because making referrals always carries with it the risk of losing credibility if what is being referred fails to deliver. As a result, people rarely refer businesses they don’t trust. To make matters more complicated, building trust is a long-term game, requiring commitment and consistency. Take Scott Ginsberg, an author and speaker on the art of approachability, for example. He has worn a name tag every single day for over eight years. Naturally, this grabs the attention of others in public, who often approach him. More importantly, however, this commitment to standing out has earned him the trust of others as a true expert on approachability. Why might a customer refer you? It’s an essential question that your referral strategy must address. To find your answer, you have to offer something different that people will talk about, or identify a way that you already do. Keep in mind that, while such a difference has to be extraordinary, it can often result from a slight change, rather than a groundbreaking innovation. The aim here is simply to take a product or service that’s already in high demand and make it easier to want or need. To do so, you need to innovate by doing things differently in a proven market or simplifying the product you already offer. A great example of this differentiation strategy is the Cheeseboard Pizza Collective in Berkeley, California. Unlike normal pizza shops, it only offers a single kind of pizza each day of the week. This fixed menu dramatically lowers costs and allows the business to use higher quality vegetarian ingredients. Such differentiation through innovation has meant that this cooperative has a lineup out the door and down the block, day after day. While implementing this type of change might be uncomfortable for your business initially, just remember: you’ll never maximize your difference unless you’re willing to change. So, apply a differentiation strategy and, once you have, stand out even further by infusing it with authenticity. People want to connect with and talk about businesses that are driven by a powerful purpose, and the wonderful thing about this greater purpose is that you don’t even need to communicate it; if it’s a true purpose, it’ll be present in everything you do. Businesses with a social mission, like TOMS Shoes, offer an inspiring example. TOMS donates a pair of shoes to a needy child for every pair that it sells, in the process differentiating itself in an authentic way and leading it to great success. To make your business more authentic, take a look at changemakers in industries other than your own. Just observing what other businesses do will give you a fresh perspective on your own. You may think that getting more customers is always a good thing, but the truth is a bit more complicated. Having the right kind of customers will increase the positive experiences your clients have, thereby producing buzz for your business. In other words, not all customers are a match for your business, but you can identify which ones are by creating a profile of your ideal one. Just think of a current customer who brings you the most profit and referrals. From there, be as detailed as possible: incorporate real customer stories, ask questions about the challenges your customers face, the people they trust and, finally, go to the customers who already refer your business to ask them why they do so. For instance, the customer profile for a home renovation company might be married homeowners with a combined income of over $100,000, who are entrepreneurial and have a long term plan for their lives. They’re engaged in their local community, have no intention of moving and have renovated before. Then, with your customer profile in hand, you can produce a key story that’ll engage your customers emotionally. This is essentially a narrative that you convey through your actions, marketing and branding. When you design it, keep your ideal customer in mind, trying to speak directly to her. You should acknowledge her emotions and focus on what best connects with and captivates her. Try to keep this story about you and your company concise, no longer than a single page and be sure it’s personal, revealing and honest. You’ll want to communicate things like who you are, why you do what you do and what you fear. In other words, you should seek to reveal your passion, how you found it and how you want to add to the world. What you don’t want to do is a give a chronology of your company. Finally, once you have your story, test it out on your friends, neighbors and even your spouse. Figure out what resonates most deeply and revise your narrative accordingly. Once it’s polished, you can use it to engage with potential customers. Now that you’ve set yourself apart from the pack, how can you start creating valuable content that your customers will learn and benefit from? One way is to write a five- to 20-page educational white paper based on the core principles of your business. This document can serve as your go-to educational tool for all prospects and partners. In a nutshell, its educational value should demonstrate to others why they should refer your business. For instance, the author distilled his entire previous book, the Duct Tape Marketing, into a seven-step white paper that centers on his strategy for differentiation. Since then, it has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times, serving as his primary lead conversion tool. Once you have your central white paper, you can create additional content based on it and publish this content across a variety of media. For example, how-to-guides, e-books and case studies can be published in print or online as PDFs, slide decks and recorded audio. Being able to repurpose this content across formats will breathe new life into it while reducing the work of creating new content from scratch. If your ideas for new content run dry, just take some customer questions and answer them in a blog post or on another medium. And finally, you should host a testimonial gathering party for your best customers. The stories you acquire from such an event can then be incorporated into all your other value-giving materials. To get people to the party, sell it as a networking opportunity, but also as a chance to play a central role in the creation of your company’s new marketing materials. Then, during the event itself, have guests tell their stories in front of a camera. The pictures, video and audio from the party will comprise a collection of testimonials that you can integrate into your marketing materials for years to come. In marketing, exposure is the name of the game. Here are a few useful exposure tools to put into practice: First, take advantage of the powerful targeting opportunities afforded by online advertising. While lots of people believe online advertising has low conversion rates, this misses the point; your goal in using such tools is to direct traffic to your value-giving content. In the end, it’s your quality content that will turn interested visitors into customers. The second tool at hand is press coverage, which is great for generating buzz and awareness, but also third-party validation and trust. A good press strategy begins with compiling a list of journalists that might be interested in your story. Subscribe to their e-mail alerts and follow their social media accounts; read everything they write and learn what interests them the most; subscribe to their blogs and comment with relevant ideas; and, finally, begin passing on content that’s relevant to both your field and their journalistic work. By following these steps, you’ll build credibility and reliability before preparing to push your organization’s story. And third, you can get exposure and build your reputation as an expert by taking on speaking engagements and putting together an educational presentation that can be delivered in person or in web conferences. The presentation can simply be an expanded version of your white paper, or something indirectly related. The key is that you teach your audience something valuable and you shouldn’t be afraid of giving away too much. But in addition to the value you offer, you should also be sure to prompt your audience with a call to action. To do so, begin by letting them know that you’ll provide them with helpful information. Then, after building trust, mention one of your paid offerings and how much it costs – say, a two-week program to learn the secrets of recruiting top sales talent. After your talk, take audience questions and mention that anyone in the audience can bring a guest to your program for free if they sign up today. Marketing has evolved dramatically over time, and in the modern world, businesses tend to fall into two different marketing categories: those that focus on online marketing and deliver a wealth of content, and more traditional businesses that focus on in-person interactions, in which the customer benefits from a greater sense of connection and community. However, true success means combining these approaches. The synthesis of online marketing with in-person conversations will forge a powerful trust-building synergy that’s vital to any marketing effort. For instance, after you meet a prospective client, you could contact her on LinkedIn, passing along one of your relevant educational blog posts. Remember, social networking gives you incredible access to millions of prospective customers, and if you can add authenticity to these online connections, there’s no limit to the success you can experience. When building trust in your online interactions, these three tips can help: First, publish links to your educational content through your social media account; second, actively share quality content and engage with prospective customers; and third, focus on partnerships by offering value and letting your educational content sell your product for you. When navigating through this terrain, blogs can be especially powerful as a means of uniting the online and in-person realms. After all, blogging gives you search engine exposure, community building through a reader base and a connection with customers through comment dialogue. Because of this, blogs are a great place to test and forge new ideas. The only problem is that some 900,000 blog posts are published worldwide every day, which means you need to put in the effort to produce high-quality content – otherwise, you’ll be ignored. To make sure your content hits the mark, there are a few things you can do. For starters, follow as many relevant blogs as possible and actively comment on them. On your own blog, write a minimum of three posts a week that incorporate relevant keywords identified through Wordtracker or Google’s Keyword Tool. And finally, invite guest bloggers to write posts for your site to get a perspective from outside your organization. The previous blinks have given you some great tools for collecting referrals, but it’s also important that you make it as easy as possible for customers to refer you when they are inclined to do so. A good start for this is to give every new client a customer bill of rights. This document is akin to an owner’s manual, like the one that comes with a new power tool; its purpose is to make sure customers know what their rights are and what they can expect from the relationship with your business. It should contain information on how to get started, what your agreement entails, how they can get the maximum value out of your product and explain how to resolve problems. Additionally, this kit could be accompanied by a series of automated e-mails that offer tips, or a complimentary phone consultation after purchase. You might even include other perks that exceed expectations – customers love surprises like this. All it takes to make one is to add a little something extra to your offering without advertising the added benefit. For instance, if you sell a logo design to a client, you might throw in 200 free business cards featuring the new design. So, setting customers up to refer your business is essential, but that’s just the first step in this process. The second move is to foster customer loyalty. After all, the majority of your referrals will come from a minority of customers. These are your referral champions, and you need to show them that you care. For instance, you might ask for their input on business matters, or mail them a handwritten note with a little gift, like a pair of movie tickets. Finally, make sure your customers have the tools they need to refer you easily. A great way to do so is by giving them gift certificates or referral cards that they can hand out to family, friends and coworkers. These cards should be personalized and give credit to the customer for making the referral. By now you know how crucial customer referrals are. However, another group holds the potential for even more expansive reach: partners. These are businesses with a common ideal customer and reaching out to them is vital. You can start by listing the high-quality companies you trust and would happily recommend to your own referral stars. It’s good to start with businesses you personally know and use. From there, send a letter of introduction to each of them, communicating that you have customers who might be interested and that you’d like to learn more about the company. For instance, you could request information about their value proposition and post-referral marketing procedure. After identifying potential partners who are interested, your job is to help them recognize partnership opportunities in which you both win. Co-branding is a great example. Say you have a white paper entitled, “The Top Five Referral Marketing Tips” that’s relevant to your partner’s customers. You might offer your partner the opportunity to add their logo and contact information to the paper and allow them to distribute it to their customers for free. In exchange for this valuable content, you’ll gain natural exposure. Similarly, you might offer to give an informational workshop to their customers. Or, you could organize an event with three or more partners, in which everyone has the opportunity to invite customers and present on their area of expertise. Lastly, joint marketing ventures can be an extremely productive use of your partnerships. For instance, in a three-way partnership between an electrical contractor, a plumber and a heating and cooling business, all three parties could hand out one another’s marketing materials and coupons. One of the best things about partnerships is that those with a certain edge of creativity to them are especially buzzworthy. Just take one IT company that offered free massages during its recruitment presentation. This odd stunt got the company the attention of the top accountants it was seeking, while earning new clients for the massage therapists involved. Now that you have your referral strategy laid out, you need a plan for actually receiving those referrals. The first step is to decide on the best time for asking customers to make a referral. This is usually when key customers express how impressed they are with your offering. The second step is to get your employees involved in referral-based marketing. To do so, simply encourage them to use every customer interaction to connect the customer with the brand. Third, you need to start giving referrals in order to receive them. To jump-start this process you might launch a “make-a-referral Monday” initiative, during which employees are assigned the goal of making at least one referral at the start of each week. Making this a tradition will instill referrals into your company culture and strengthen your partnership networks. Then, once those referrals start rolling in, you of course need to plan how you follow up with them. This process starts during your initial contact, when you should acknowledge that they were a referral and by giving them something extra. Whether that little add-on is free information or a box of chocolate, the most important thing is that it feels special. From there, you should make sure your referral sources feel appreciated for their work, regardless of whether it leads to a sale or not. But it’s just as important to properly handle cases in which a referral isn’t a good match for your product or service. When this happens, don’t ignore it; instead, make the effort to give a clear idea of who your ideal customer is when contacting your referral source. Similarly, you should always keep your referrers up to date on the referrals they’ve made. For instance, you might send an e-mail to a referrer that notifies her when a referral she made becomes a client. And finally, thanking your referrers publicly is a powerful motivator. This can be as simple as adding a referral page to your website or tweeting out thank yous. Doing so will demonstrate the value you place on referrers and support the image of your business as one of referral quality. The key message in this book: Getting customers and partners to recommend your business to others is essential to sustained and healthy growth. By forging deep connections with people and spreading awareness of your business, you can make your brand stand out and earn your company a reputation for being worthy of referrals.  Actionable advice: Create a list of trigger phrases. Have you ever heard of a trigger phrase? It’s a series of words that a prospective customer is likely to say when communicating that he’s looking for what you have to offer, but is unaware that you hold the solution to his problems. For instance, a trigger phrase for an accounting software company might be a complaint about insufficient data management. The prospect could say, “I keep all our finances organized on spreadsheets, but it takes forever to update.” Develop a list of such phrases for your own company by brainstorming common themes with your salespeople, or through conversations with a few key customers. Once you identify them, you can use these phrases to identify new prospects and by putting them in your marketing material, your customers will start using them too, thereby increasing the chances of their referral leading to new business for you.

It means that you set up a smoothly running company that can operate without your help, allowing you to focus on what you should be doing: driving your company’s vision and shaping its future. In these blinks, you’ll find out how a good app can act like an external brain; which three rules to apply to every incoming email; and why skills and education aren’t always the most important factors in a new hire. A lot of founders see themselves as a sort of puppet master. They want to be in total control, having their strings attached to every minor motion on stage. What most of them don’t realize is that they often do more harm than good to their company. If you are a founder, you should rather think of yourself as an initiator. You can think of your business as a set of dominos, and you are the first piece to set everything in motion. The important part here is that everything should be set up just fine, with all the pieces in place. Once the first domino falls, everything will take care of itself. The key message here is: Make yourself replaceable by building the right company structures.  As a founder, it’s easy to get caught up in all of the details of your business. But it is not your job to figure out a Customer Relations Management system or come up with a Social Media strategy. Your job is to find the right people to do this for you. You need to set up an organizational structure and then enable your employees to do their best possible jobs without further input. Again: The best job you can do is make yourself replaceable. At least in the daily operational business. Take the example of one CEO, Malte Holm, who found himself overwhelmed by small fires he had to put out. Employees were running to him every day with every little problem, and as a consequence, he found himself severely overworked. He had to think big picture and reset some of his company’s domino pieces. One of the problems was in HR. As Holm looked into it and talked to the HR manager, he discovered the cause: the manager was spending four hours stuck in traffic every day! So Holm did what he had to do to make her job easier. He helped her set up an effective home office, complete with high-speed internet connection. Finally, she could spend more time doing her job. Not only did Holm make her life easier, but it also led him to feel better. There was one fewer fire to put out, and he could get back to the work that matters. You start a new project at work. At first everything is going well and everyone is excited. But then something happens and, for whatever reason, the project stalls. Suddenly, everyone is scratching their heads, wondering what happened and what to do next. When this happens, it's usually a sign that it's not clear enough what needs to be done and who should be doing what. The key message here is: Identify tasks and clarify responsibilities. Luckily, there are some helpful project management practices that founders and company leaders can use to make sure projects run smoothly and with a lot less head-scratching along the way. The first is to make sure that every project is broken down into clear tasks. Whatever the goal of the project is, it should be divided up into as many small steps as possible. This way, it will be much clearer to everyone involved how to get from point A to point Z. Also, it's a good way to keep people motivated because, for every step they complete, they’ll feel like they're making progress and getting closer to the goal. By the way, this principle is equally true for personal projects. Let’s say you have three hours to turn in an 850-word article. Sounds daunting, right? But if you break it down into a series of 15-minute steps, you'll find it a lot less scary. If the first step is to do some research, and the second step is to create a rough outline, all that’s left is writing around 85 words every 15 minutes. That’s doable.   Now, when managing a group project, once you’ve broken things down into small enough tasks, it’s time to assign the tasks and make sure everyone knows who’s responsible for what. This is where the second management tool comes in, RACI, short for Responsible Accountable Consulted Informed. The Responsible person, often the CEO or founder, gives the project the go-ahead and is ultimately in charge. If a big project is launched without this person’s blessing, it’s probably off to a bad start. The Accountable person tracks how the project is progressing and makes sure everyone’s getting their work done. This person also keeps the boss updated and in the loop if any big changes need to be made to the project. The Consulted person is the specialist who’s brought in whenever a task requires expert advice or skills that exceed those of the regular team. Finally, the Informed person is anyone who needs to be kept up to date on the project, such as the client. The Informed can be multiple parties, but it’s often fewer people than you might expect. When everyone knows their assignment and who they need to report to, problems can be identified quickly and dealt with, and everyone can focus on moving forward. If you’re a founder and you're constantly overwhelmed with work, it’s usually a sign that you've forgotten an important aspect of great leadership: delegation. The key to delegating effectively is to make an honest assessment of what kind of tasks you’re not particularly good at or passionate about. These are the things you need to delegate to others. If you’re lousy at accounting, for instance, you should probably hand this task over to someone else. This may sound simple enough in theory, but it practice it can be difficult. Luckily, there’s a simple way to make it easier. The key message here is: Delegate better by using a system called the six levels of delegation. The first level of delegation involves simple tasks, like having someone purchase a book online for you. For things like this, all you need to do is give someone a direct order. Done. The second level involves slightly more complex tasks, like booking a flight for a specific time between New York and Phoenix. In this case, you can ask someone to do some research, see what’s available and prepare a summary for you. The third level would be if the research also comes with advice, so that you can make a more informed decision. If, say, you’re looking to buy property in Seattle, you may ask someone to research the city’s real estate agents and present you with a list of which agents they believe are the top five. At level four, you would delegate even more responsibility. For example, you might ask someone on your team with real estate experience to choose an agent in Seattle, start the process of finding and purchasing the property but to keep you updated each step of the way so that you can make the final decision. At level five, you would hand over decision making authority, while setting certain limits. For example, they can find the property and make a purchase as long as it is in a certain part of the city and under a certain price – otherwise they need to consult with you. Finally, at level six, you give full authority to another person to handle a task as they see fit. They can decide upon the agent, the location and how much to spend on the property. Determining which tasks need to be delegated and to whom can be difficult. But knowing these different levels can help you get the right task to the right person. The hardest thing for you as a founder, however, will probably be to hand over the kind of authority that level five and six call for. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how to go about recruiting those people. One of the hallmarks of any great founder or CEO is the quality of the team they put together. That's because building a team of excellent employees is easier said than done. Luckily, there are steps you can take to increase your chances of hiring great talent. The first is to make sure you pay attention to the special skill sets they bring to the table. The key message here is: When recruiting, look for skills, personality and problem-solving abilities. It’s tempting to recruit an employee with some specific person in mind, be it a specific age, gender or educational background, but this can be limiting. Instead, you should focus on the skills you need this person to have. However, you don’t want to lose sight of how important the person's personality is. After all, this is someone you might end up spending a lot of time with, and just because they have every IT skill you’re looking for doesn’t mean they have the personality of a great employee. So it’s important that you also look for skills that go hand-in-hand with good personalities, and you can often do this during a trial period. This is a good time to see if, for example, they are proactive and willing to go the extra mile. Anyone can order a book online for you. But the right hire might be the person who orders the book, and then follows up to see if it arrived on time, and whether you need something else. Another high-quality skill is attention to detail. People who can spot small mistakes, like an important client’s name missing from a guest list, are invaluable to any business. Problem-solving skills can be another sign of a potentially great hire. For example, if you’re trying to find a great writer, rather than looking at their writing samples, look at how they respond to a quick assignment like brushing up a poorly written article. After all, anyone can submit decent work that took them 50 drafts to write, but what you really want are people who can solve problems on the spot. Skills like these will prove useful in any number of situations. So if you keep this in mind during the hiring process, you’ll increase your chances of surrounding yourself with excellent employees. Great. Now you’ve got a well-oiled company in place. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean that problems will stop happening. Even worse: All of them seem to require your immediate attention. So how do you handle those day-to-day urgencies? Truth is: As long as no one’s hacking your company account, most of your problems are not as urgent as you think they are. Even though you feel like it, you don’t have to act on every problem immediately. Acknowledging this reality will ultimately help you work in more productive ways. For example, by blocking off your most productive times for others. The key message here is: Reserve your peak time for flow activities. Generally speaking, everyone has a peak time – a window of around ninety minutes during the day when your work efficiency kicks into high gear. Naturally, this is the time when you’re most likely to engage in flow activity, a time of uninterrupted concentration where you’re effortlessly able to accomplish a lot in a little time. But how can you find out when you’re most productive? Well, there’s an app for this. The author’s company produces the Less Doing Peak Time app which monitors your interactions with the app and tells you when your nervous system is at its peak. Once you’ve figured that out, make sure you get the best out of your daily peak time. To do so, reserve this time for work that typically requires high concentration, like writing or composing. You should also let your colleagues know that this time is off-limits for any calls or disturbances. And remember, just because someone says it’s urgent, that doesn’t make it a genuine emergency. Once you’ve got a grasp of your own peak times, you can also help improve your colleagues’ productivity by being aware and respecting theirs, just as you ask them to not disturb your peak times. However, when setting up meetings that require creative thinking and generating ideas, you can try to schedule it so that you’re getting as many people as possible during their peak time. This way, you’ll increase your chances of people being sharp, lively and overflowing with brilliant ideas. At the very least, this knowledge will make sure you avoid scheduling meetings during the dreaded daily slump time, when people generate more yawns than good ideas. When speaking to audiences around the world, the author regularly asks them: What keeps you from being creative? The most common answer is: My cluttered inbox. So what can you do about it? The key message here is: Tame your emails with filters and the Do, Delete or Defer rule. One first and easy fix to this problem is to create filters. For example, you can create a filter that will catch any email containing the word “unsubscribe” and send it to a separate folder. Since it will remove all those newsletters and website updates you subscribe to, this filter alone will already declutter your inbox significantly. But wait – you probably subscribed to these emails for a reason, didn’t you? Don’t worry: nothing’s being deleted. They’re just being removed as a distraction because, let’s face it, you don’t have time during the workday to browse an endless stream of newsletters. There’s always a later point to catch up. A second tip to lighten your email load is the Do, Delete or Defer Rule. When emails come in, you might waste precious time and mental energy deciding how to handle them. This rule will make your decision process way easier, as you’ll only have three options: do, delete or defer. “Do” means you do something with it immediately. It’s perfect for emails with actionable items that can be completed in five minutes or less, like one from IT about updating privacy settings on your computer. “Delete” is a handy and underrated option. For instance, if someone sends you an email just to say thanks or that they’ve finished a task, don’t respond – delete! Remember: the more emails you send, the more you’ll receive. If more people hit “Delete” instead of “Reply All,” we’d all get fewer emails. “Defer” is the third and final option for all the emails that can’t be dealt with immediately. For example, any email that relies on someone else’s input. Taming your inbox is a great way to free up the mental energy that you’ll desperately need to drive your company forward – for example, by generating new ideas more effectively. Question: What will keep you ahead of your competitors? The answer: your unique ideas. As a founder, you have vast amounts of information at your fingertips. Just think of all the podcasts, websites, newsletters or tweets out there. But this also means that your ideas can spring up at any given moment. And since ideas can be fleeting, you need to have a system in place to capture the very thoughts that can move your business forward. The key message here is: Record and store your ideas in a systematic way.  However you handle your creativity, it’s important to find a system to suit your preferences. For example, if you’re most inspired by videos or podcasts, you may enjoy using videos or voice memos to record your own ideas. And if you’re someone who needs to bounce ideas off a colleague, you may want to make sure you always record your brainstorming sessions. As for the author, he likes to use meetings to generate ideas, and he likes to preserve that information in emails, which he reads, like a digest, at the end of the day. So that’s one way you can capture your ideas. But how do you avoid drowning in a sea of information? A good storage system for ideas should essentially act like an external brain – one that takes the weight off the real brain sitting between your ears. After all, the fewer ideas you try to keep stored in the back of your mind all day, the less likely you’ll forget them. And as a bonus, you’ll have more brain power for other ideas. One excellent kind of external brain is the app called If This Then That, or IFTTT for short. You can use this app to build all sorts of shortcuts between two applications. For example, you could set it up to automatically email you your own voice memos. That way you won’t lose any of your genius ideas. Bill Gates once said, “Content is king.” Even though this was back in 1996, it's equally true today. No matter what business you’re in, great content is crucial to success. After all, it’s the primary way of reaching out to your customers. So, let’s look at how you can up your content game. The first thing you should do is recognize your limitations. If writing is not a strength of yours, then don’t waste a lot of time and effort by struggling through poorly written articles and blog posts. Instead, do what the author did. When he was trying to improve his Less Doing blog, he realized that he had a whole lot of nothing. So he hired someone to do it for him. The key message here is: For great content production, figure out what you do well, and create organizational structures that support your talent. What the author did have was a steady supply of ideas for new blog posts, so it was just a matter of  finding someone who understood his voice who could form his ideas into great articles and posts. This took some time, but in the end it allowed him to produce more content while freeing up time to pursue other projects. Another important aspect is creating an efficient means of production. When the author made his first podcast episodes, the process took around 15 hours. As a result, he could only publish one episode every six weeks and, as you can imagine, it’s tough to build a strong audience with so little content. Once he found a way to largely automate the process, however, he could put out a steady stream of podcasts and build a loyal audience. Here’s how it works in practice: First, the author spends a few hours making the recording. He then saves it in a Dropbox folder, where the editor adjusts the sound quality and adds an intro and an ending. The recording is then uploaded to both SoundCloud and YouTube, at which point subscribers are sent an email announcing the new episode, complete with a link to the podcast. With the right structure in place you can spend a fraction of the time producing your content, which in turn allows you to focus on making your content even better! Even the best content in the world can only take you so far. It’ll wither away unnoticed if you don’t have customers and fans who actively recommend you – and that means building a stable customer base. How do you do that? The key message here is: You’ll attract customers with smooth points of contact and the right free sample.  The first step is analyzing every point of contact your business has with its clients and customers. You’re looking for any way a point of contact can be improved. This includes websites, Facebook pages, customer service email exchanges or phone operators. Once you’ve identified all the points of contact, you can sort them into three categories, or phases of the customer relationship: Before, During and After. The Before category includes all contact points between prospective customers and your business. This might be your website or hearing about you at an industry conference. The During category is for points of interaction with active customers, where you should be making sure your customers are nurtured and treated well. The After category includes contact points with former customers, like a follow-up email asking if they were happy with the service. Don’t neglect these. How you end a transaction with a client will have a great impact on how you’re remembered. In all three phases, the key is providing lead magnets. A lead magnet is something of value that you can provide the customer, often for free, as a way to stoke their interest. Ideally, a lead magnet is not only something desirable but something they’ve already showed interest in. It might be the first few chapters of a book, or the first few minutes of an online course. By piquing a customer’s interest with a taste of free, high-quality content, they’ll be more likely to buy the full package. Another great thing about lead magnets is that they’re usually samples of products that you already have, so this is a perfect task for delegating to someone else. By now, you should have a good idea of how you can make your current business more automated and capable of running without you. This means you’ll have more time to spend on exciting new ideas, and even start working on founding your next business. One of the author’s clients is Justin Kavanaugh, a world-famous trainer to an impressive roster of professional athletes, including many top American football players. Throughout his career, Kavanaugh always took on a lot of work, including many high-profile speaking engagements, and always pushed himself to do more. But when his first child was born, all this changed. He had to start saying no. For someone who had never met a challenge he couldn’t accept, this was hard. In fact, Kavanaugh had to cancel some international speaking engagements he’d already agreed to. Even though it pained him to do so, he knew it was the right thing to do. The most important thing now was staying close to home, being with his child and supporting his wife. The key message here is: Sometimes, the best way forward is to say no and slow down. No matter what your business is, there will be times when slowing down adds more value than speeding up. This is something every founder and CEO needs to know from the get-go. This might mean deprioritizing the fast-paced operations of the sales department, or paying closer attention to more delicate issues like HR or improving customer relations. In the athletes he trained, Kavanaugh experienced first-hand the need to slow down. He regularly saw athletes become successful and then start getting greedy with their efforts. Suddenly, it was all about getting faster, stronger and scoring more points as quickly as possible. That raised the risk of burn-out, and overuse injuries. But whether you’re the founder of a Fortune 500 company or a football superstar, you need to regularly go back to the basics. Keep working on strengthening the skills that made you successful in the first place. The only way to do this is by taking a break every once in a while and calmly reflecting on the parts of your game that need fine tuning. This is how you stay at the top. Founders are always going to be important players in any company; but that doesn’t mean they have to be involved in all the day-to-day operations of the business. In fact, trying to do everything yourself is a sure way to burn out. At the end of the day, it’s your job to set up an organization that can run smoothly on its own, so that you can spend more time following new ideas and leading the way forward. Let’s give the last word to the author, Ari Meisel, who we interviewed in 2016. Here he is, talking about delegation and time: Meisel: The thing is, [delegation] is like a muscle that you have to use. Anything you do more than twice, there should be a process for, and if there's a process they can almost definitely be automated. So that's the thing, you're not aware of what you could possibly be taking advantage of by not having that be part of what you do or even by going through the process of automating it so you don't have to do it. Be protective of your time, it's the only thing that we have that we can't get more of. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maybe for some, who associate them with too much wasted effort and frustration, they’re even a deal-breaker. But it’s really no biggy if you know how to go about it. These blinks of The Secrets to Writing a Successful Business Plan take you right to the core of the issue – that is, why business plans are so damn important, how to avoid common mistakes in both style and content, and how to craft them successfully. In these blinks, you’ll learn when it makes sense to make your business plan a 30-page roadmap – and when it doesn’t; why you should pay extra attention to the executive summary; and which three basic financial statements you simply must include in your business plan. Most people have heard of business plans but don’t know a ton about them. So, what exactly are these tools of entrepreneurship? Well, a business plan is basically a brief write-up that lays out the basic elements of a soon-to-be company. There are a few things to keep in mind before you sit down to write a business plan, and the first is knowing when you need one. For instance, say you’re forming a new business – like opening a hair salon, buying an existing motorcycle shop or launching a start-up based on your own unique idea. Every one of these actions requires a business plan that details how operations will take place.  But what does a business plan really do? Essentially it helps structure your project, confirm its feasibility and crunch the numbers on its projected profits. So a business plan is more than a mere formal, administrative document. In fact, writing one should be a creative process that helps you flesh out your business idea.  It’s this process of thinking that will help you determine how likely your chances of success are and whether your idea is financially sound. Not just that, but in your business plan you’ll set reasonable goals, go over your benchmarks and put the finishing touches to your concept. This exercise is necessary because the time you invest here will help you identify and avoid any potential errors, thereby boosting your chances of success.  And finally, it’s important that you clearly state your value proposition. You can think of this as your elevator pitch. That is, imagine you step into an elevator only to find Mark Zuckerberg. Now you’ve got 15 seconds to win him over to your idea by answering the questions, “which problems are you solving?”, “how are you better than the competition?” and “why will you succeed where others have failed?”  Before we get to the real meat of writing a business plan, it helps to go over potentially deal-breaking mistakes and learn how to avoid them, specifically when it comes to seeking funding.  First of all, precision is everything, especially when identifying your competition. That means you need to be accurate and state exactly what you intend to do. So, while it’s nice to share your dreams with people, your business plan should deal with concrete issues like financing, product development, distribution and branding among others.  It’s also good practice to identify your competition. Because if you don’t, your potential funders will assume you lack general business insight and won’t want to invest with you. So remember, every business has competition.  But you’ll also need to answer the question, “how will this company make money?” If you take an approach that focuses too much on starting the business now and worrying about profits later, your business plan is unlikely to find much support.  The next step is to add brief biographies of your core staff members. Remember that when choosing investments, funders are putting their faith in an entrepreneur and his team. Therefore, it’s vital to make investors comfortable with you and the people working for you.  Equally important is making sure that the money you are asking for is in line with your needs. For instance, if you apply for a $100,000 loan, the investor will want to know how every dollar will be spent, whether it goes to inventory, equipment or salaries. So, if you can only account for $50,000 of the total, you’ll appear unreliable and likely won’t receive financial support.  Finally, you need to be consistent. That’s because overall consistency sends a powerful message that convinces investors of your idea’s validity. That makes outsourcing parts of your business plan a dangerous tactic. After all, you might end up with an only partially cohesive document. For example, if you tackle the sales forecast but ask a consultant to draft the marketing plan separately, the figures will likely be out of sync.  OK, now that you know about common pitfalls, let’s have a look at strategies for writing a strong business plan. The first thing to do is to put together a feasibility plan, a tool for challenging your assumptions.  This document, about five pages in total, should cover the key elements of your plan: the business idea, your main advantage over competitors, a profile of your target customer and a few snippets about daily operations. You should also include some figures that approximate your potential cash flows.  Basically, by looking at a feasibility plan you should be able to quickly determine whether your idea is solid enough to proceed or whether your initial thoughts about the business concept were too loose or naive.  Once you’ve got a strong feasibility plan and believe your idea is a good one, you should share it with your mentors and advisors. In other words, discuss your project with objective experts you trust and seek their feedback. This is a great way to further challenge your preconceived notions about your feasibility plan. On the other hand, seeking advice from family or friends who might be too quick to praise you won’t help you get an objective perspective on what matters most.  Then, if possible, begin your business with your own financial resources or those of your family.  Why? Because half of all new start-ups fail in the first five years. If your business is one of them you’ll be in a better position if you borrowed money from your grandmother than from a bank.  Now that the basics are all laid out it’s time to learn about the core of the business plan itself! We all know not to judge a book by its cover, but when it comes to business plans, the opening section can make or break the deal: it’s called the executive summary and it’s absolutely essential.  That’s because this section might be the only one your readers even look at. After all, bankers and investors are busy people, often mired in piles of business plans. Since they’ve got limited time to review them all, it’s unlikely that they’ll get past the first two pages of your plan if the story you tell doesn’t grab their attention.  But what exactly is an executive summary? It’s a rundown of your entire business plan that should be consistent with everything that follows. So, in the first paragraph state the problem you are going to solve for your customers and how your solutions are unique. Then, in a marketing paragraph, explain who your target is, how much you expect to sell and what competition you’ll face.  The following section should be brief and focus on your team. Give details about all your past experience and expertise in the industry. Finally, the last paragraph should detail your finances through key figures like your expected income over the next three years. Here you should list how much money you need to get going, then split this amount between the sum you’re putting down and how much you’ll need from outside investors.  But remember to keep it short and sweet at two pages max. And although the executive summary is the first section of your business plan, it’s actually best to write it last. That’s because you’ll do a better job once you’ve drafted the rest of the plan and know exactly what your project is all about.  You might have been working on a project for years and take things about it for granted, but it’s all new to those reading your business plan, which means you’ll need to present your ideas clearly.  For starters, you should detail your product or service, the channels through which it will be distributed and any competitors. When it comes to the product, naturally your readers will want you to paint a clear image of how it works. If you invented a new type of electric engine, investors would want to see the technical details of the device.  But your distribution channels are also important. Because whether you plan to sell your product on the internet, through retailers or on the wholesale market, it’s essential to explain why the choice you made is the right one for your business.  It’s also important to highlight your competitive advantages. Maybe you’re local, meaning you’ve got inside knowledge of a particular market or tons of experience in your field.  Then you should lay out every detail of your operations from your production techniques to your schedule. Readers will want details on your daily business routine in general, everything from your location to working hours, to the equipment you’ll use. Maybe your main supplier is on the other side of the globe. In a case like this it would be essential to explain how the two of you will work together across this distance.  Any potential legal issues should also be detailed. For instance, when opening a bar one usually needs to acquire a liquor license.  Finally, you should introduce your team. That’s because your investors will want to know who is getting paid with their money. Putting your entire family on the payroll will likely raise some red flags.  So, to be clear about this, answer these questions: “Will you work in a team or by yourself?”, “Do you want to hire people on a contractual basis?” and “Do your staff members have the necessary expertise?”  Once you’ve got this information laid out you’ll need to communicate your business strategy and your plan for reaching your goal. To do so you should break it down into three parts. First, include a market analysis that details the size of your market and potential customers or business clients. By beginning this analysis with the size of the market, you’ll show that there are enough customers to make your idea profitable.  From there you can profile your ideal customer, a crucial step in figuring out how to reach him. For instance, say you invented a new Facebook-like site for dogs. Your target is likely pet lovers between the ages of 15 and 40 who are excited about new technology.  Step two is to produce a competition analysis. If you’re anything like the average start-up entrepreneur you’re likely convinced that your idea is so unique that no competitor even comes close. Well, unfortunately this is simply never the case.  So, a competition analysis is crucial for showing your readers that you’ve realistically assessed market conditions. In this analysis, you want to identify roughly five main competitors along with their biggest strengths and weaknesses. For instance, this might relate to their marketing strategies, their delivery policy or their operating hours.  Then you can try to determine how your competitors will respond when you enter the market. For instance, will they slash their prices, steal your ideas or maybe increase their use of aggressive advertisements? Finally, the last step is to offer specific marketing techniques, of which there are many, like email marketing, press and media, internet ads, blogging and countless other strategies. To determine which are right for you, keep track of the costs of each and the potential benefits they produce. It’ll be clear which gives the most bang for your buck! There’s another aspect of your business plan that’s absolutely essential to investors and that’s the financial statements. Most of us don’t know much about this, so it’s helpful to start with the basics. Financial statements are basically charts that detail key financial figures regarding your business activity, and drafting them is the last step before you tackle the executive summary. In fact, these tables are a kind of summary that uses numbers to wrap up everything you’ve previously described.  There are three types of financial statement that every business plan should have: the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash-flow statement.  First, the balance sheet is simply a two column table divided between assets and liabilities. The former describes what you’ve got – things like equipment, money and inventory – and the latter what you owe, such as loans to a bank or debts to a supplier. The balance sheet is more or less a snapshot of your company’s money and debt.  The income statement comes second. It’s a single column chart that details your sales, minus your expenses, thereby displaying your net profits. This statement should contain everything that has changed your financial position that year.  Finally, your cash-flow statement is all about – you guessed it – cash. This statement looks very similar to one you’d receive from a bank, simply showing the in- and out-flows of money.  Accurately producing these statements requires you to rely on solid assumptions. Remember, each figure you present should be supported by evidence. Whether that comes in the form of market research, interviews or even your own hypothesis doesn’t matter as long as it’s convincing. To be cautious, you can even draft a couple of different scenarios, one conservative and one a bit more optimistic. Just change your central assumptions accordingly.  Congratulations, you’ve got everything you need to craft a stellar business plan! But now it’s time to talk about investors. Because knowing how to approach them is essential to your plan’s success.  First off, if you are going to apply for a bank loan, don’t go in assuming they’ll fully fund your business. In fact, bankers tend not to consider themselves the sole source of funding. That means you can’t expect to get more than 80 percent of your funding from a bank and, before you even apply for a bank loan, you should have secured some other funding. Not just that, but a bank will also want you to commit your own money, bringing in collateral of about 125 percent of the loan.  But if you can’t get a bank loan you can go with two other potentially more expensive options. The choice is between business angels and venture capitalists, both of whom will offer cash in exchange for shares in your company.  The first, business angels, are extremely wealthy individuals who invest up to $2 million, expecting a return of between five and ten times their original investment. The second, venture capital firms, tend to invest larger amounts of between five and ten million dollars but expect much higher returns in the range of about 30 times the original. Naturally these funding options will cost you more in the long run than a bank loan because they are assuming a greater risk.  But regardless of the type of investors you secure, they’ll all have shared requirements when it comes to the financial data you provide. All of them will be interested in what’s known as your burn-rate, that is, the amount it costs you to operate over a given period.  Investors are obsessed with this indicator because it describes how long your business can stay afloat with their investment. They’ll also likely want to see a three-year financial forecast with the first year broken down month by month.  The key message in this book: Starting a business is hard work and over half of those that get off the ground go bankrupt within their first five years. It’s crucial to put in the groundwork, and you can only troubleshoot a new business by drafting a rock solid business plan.  Actionable advice: Know your competitive advantage and don’t think that low prices are a substitute: Before deciding to launch your business take the time to consider your competitive advantages and whether you even have any. If it seems like you don’t, you might be tempted to simply undercut competitors, but this strategy rarely pans out. That’s because while prices heavily influence consumer choices, people also tend to assume there is a problem with the cheapest option. In other words, rock bottom prices alone are no replacement for a unique market edge.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

They’re all self-made billionaires, each one of them at the helm of huge business empires.  But that’s not all they have in common. When you look at the success stories of these and other entrepreneurial giants, you begin to see a pattern of underlying skills and abilities. It’s no coincidence they are all at the top – so what are their essential skills? In these blinks, you’ll learn how Hui Lin Chit made a fortune selling napkins; what billionaire Alex Spanos learned from selling sandwiches; and how to partner for success. What does it take to be a billionaire these days? To reach such heights, you have to approach your goal very differently than the average entrepreneur. In a constantly changing world, you no longer have the luxury of focusing on one thing at a time; you have to learn how to juggle multiple ideas.  Self-made billionaires maintain multiple ideas and perspectives, both big and small, at all times. Most people and companies will try to focus on one thing at a time to avoid complications. But others, like Bill Gates, achieve their success by operating in an environment of dualities, managing multiple ideas and actions simultaneously. Bill Gates demonstrates not only the success of handling multiple ideas, but also of juggling multiple companies at the same time. It’s a little known fact that while running Microsoft, Gates also started Corbis, a photo and video licensing company, as well as Cascade Investment, a holding and investment company.  This mindset of embracing duality, of juggling different ideas and investments at the same time, are common among producers. These are people who have a clear vision and bring innovative ideas to the table. Producers can unite the right kinds of people and know how to use all their resources to their advantage. On the other side of coin are the performers. These are talented and highly specialized people who excel in a specific field. We can look at Lynda and Stewart Resnick, the couple behind the successful juice company POM Wonderful, as an example of how producers and performers work together successfully. Lynda is a natural born producer who brought together all her skills to identify a great product and create the right marketing strategy to sell it. Stewart is the performer who balances the budget and oversees the company’s operations and finances. This way, Stewart can keep Lynda in check if she goes overboard in the creative department and can make sure the company continues to make a profit. Rather than focusing on one idea at a time, self-made billionaires embrace the power of duality. The following blinks will reveal the five most important dualities. So what is the unique set of skills that enable self-made billionaires to reach this elite level of success?  A billion-dollar business idea begins with something called empathic imagination: a merging of creative ideas with an understanding of and empathy for potential customers’ needs. To come up with these ideas, billionaire producers must be experts in divergent thinking, that is, freeing your mind to allow for competing ideas in order to find a novel solution to a problem. For example, in the early 1980s, finding information on different mutual funds was a time-consuming process. Entrepreneur Joe Mansueto empathized with how frustrating this was for investors, and came up with a solution to assemble the information and make it easier to digest: he took $80,000 of savings and created Morningstar, a publication that would provide investment data in a simple and accessible format. Mansueto’s thinking paid off. Mutual funds went on to become a mainstream investment tool and, as a result, Morningstar became a leading investment research and management firm. Blockbuster ideas like this are the product of empathy and insight that comes from years of market research, as well as a gut feeling for what investors and customers want. This was the case for Hui Lin Chit during the 1970s in China. He started by manufacturing zippers for clothing and later founded an apparel company; neither business turned out to be a smashing success. But Mr. Chit knew precisely who his target customers should be, namely low-income women in rural China, and understood their needs well. Mr. Chit would seize the opportunity when a friend brought up the subject of sanitary napkins. Mr. Chit bought a machine to manufacture them for $80,000 and produced a product that was cleaner, safer and preferable to what his customers were using at the time. His company, Hengan International, is now one of China’s leading domestic manufacturers. The old saying is true – time is money. But for a billionaire idea, it’s also true that timing is money. Self-made billionaires know the importance of when to be patient and when to take action. Take Steve Case for example. During the 1970s, he took ten years to patiently gain experience at companies like Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo before taking action and forever changing the way we communicate as the co-founder of America Online (AOL). Steve Case saw his opportunity in 1984 when his brother introduced him to Control Video, an early interactive video game company. This venture was ultimately unsuccessful, but it connected him to the people with whom he would go on to create AOL. Some people might have called AOL an overnight success – but Case jokes that, to him, it was ten years in the making! As you can see, to be a self-made billionaire, you have to be patient and await your chance. But you also can’t hesitate to take action when presented with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Alex Spanos is one such billionaire who seized the moment. Spanos started out selling sandwiches to migrant farm workers in California. But he saw an opportunity when the local farmers kept asking him if he knew where they could hire more workers. After all, more workers would mean greater demand for his sandwiches. When Spanos drove down to the Mexican border town of El Centro to see what he could find out, he met another farmer who had just hired 350 new workers and desperately needed housing facilities for them. Spanos jumped at this chance as well, and agreed to help the farmer – even though he wasn’t exactly sure how. He ended up investing the profits from his sandwich business into building homes for the workers. His willingness to take action paid off. The resulting housing facilities became his first step into the real estate market, a business venture that would ultimately make him a billionaire. So let’s say you have that billion-dollar idea. Now comes the question of how you successfully get that idea into the marketplace! This is done through inventive execution, a process that combines imagination and design to bring problem-solving products into the market. This is something great producers do: they think up a new product while simultaneously designing it for optimum value. As a result, producers can take action even when a market appears saturated by redesigning or changing an existing product to reach a broader audience. By reevaluating a product’s design, pricing, method of delivery and marketing, you can take it from a niche market into the mainstream. This is what Micky Arison did as CEO of the cruise ship company Carnival Corporation & plc. He was only in his thirties when his father named him his successor at the head of the company. And with only three ships in their fleet, business was slow. But Arison was eager to make an impact and redesign the cruising experience in a way that would turn the company into a billion-dollar business. To do this, he decided to market cruises as something everyone could afford, not just the wealthy. So, he dramatically expanded the number of ships in the company’s fleet to lower costs and, by the late-1980s, Carnival was the leading cruise brand worldwide.  When you pay attention to the details of product design, you’ll see that ideas powered by inventive execution can flourish when inserted into major markets. But as we’ll see in the next blink, product design isn’t everything. Launching your idea into an existing market requires a good sense of risk management as well. Since our current economic climate is constantly changing, being a risk taker is essential for survival. But are successful entrepreneurs always rewarded for extreme and fearless risk taking? What billionaire producers have is a relative view of risk. In contrast to other entrepreneurs, this gives them a better assessment of their potential gains against their potential losses. Studies show that billionaires actually don’t take more or greater risks than the average entrepreneur. According to renowned scientist Daniel Kahneman’s theories on human decision making, what separates billionaires from other people is that they are simply less afraid of losing what they have in the pursuit to earn more.  Zhang Yin displayed this attitude when she decided to shut down her successful paper-trading company in Hong Kong and start over in the United States. The risk paid off: with her husband, she launched the company America Chung Nam, which became the leading paper exporter in the United States and made Zhang Yin one of the richest people in China.  It doesn’t always work out so smoothly. But even when losses happen, future billionaires will display perseverance and try again. This resilience can be seen in former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In 1981, after eight years of employment and having become the company’s head of equity trading, Bloomberg was fired from his job at the Salomon Brothers investment bank. Despite his credentials, he had a hard time finding a new job. But he didn’t give up. Instead, he decided to start the financial software company Bloomberg L.P. The company grew to over 15,000 employees and has spawned a radio network and TV station. Bloomberg took yet another successful risk in 2002 by leaving his company to launch a political career as the mayor of New York City. These examples show us that producers are not afraid to risk what they already have when opportunity knocks. And their persistence in the face of setbacks shows us that success can come from being open to new ideas, taking chances and learning from our mistakes.  It should be noted that most of the self-made billionaires in these blinks didn’t transform their ideas into multi-billion dollar enterprises alone; this was accomplished by finding the right partner: a performer. Putting together the right producer and performer is like finding the yin and yang of a successful business. The right partners will complement each other with their respective skill sets and will show a mutual trust and support that allows the other to succeed.  One such famous partnership is that of Apple Computers’ Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Both had a vision of launching a product that could change both people’s lives and the marketplace. And they both knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses when it came to doing business: Jobs focused on the business side of Apple and Wozniak focused on product technology. With this balance of responsibilities, producers and performers can each play to their strengths and grow their business as efficiently as possible. Consider Mike and Marian Ilitch, who turned Little Caesars Pizza into the United States’ third-largest pizza restaurant chain.  Because of his empathic imagination, Mike took on the producer role, spending hours in the kitchen testing recipes and coming up with the famous marketing slogan “Pizza Pizza”. As a self-taught accountant, Marian took on the performer role, managing the finances and helping Little Caesars grow to a $2 billion company. You can think of a producer without a performer as a bird without wings. They might know where to go, but without the necessary help, they won’t be able to take off. Combined with empathic imagination, a relative view of risk, patient urgency and inventive execution, business partnerships are the final key to billion-dollar success. The key message in this book: Billionaires thrive in a world full of complexities due in large part to their ability to practice dual thinking. With enough training and dedication, anyone can develop and increase their working memory and juggle multiple ideas. By honing these mental habits, you can take your first big steps toward a business breakthrough.  Actionable advice: Give your employees some think time! Allow employees who show the potential to become successful producers to have some think time: dedicated time that can be set aside for them to come up with new projects and ideas.

These sites represent the sheer volume of information accessible to people surfing the internet.  Yet far too much of this information is hidden behind poorly designed websites, pages so cluttered or unclear that no savvy browser not to mention newbie could begin to access the treasures within. It doesn’t have to be this way. If every website and mobile app today would simply follow a few important rules, the internet could be a much friendlier, organized place. If you and your business follow these rules, you’ll discover that not only will your users find useful information but also you’ll be able to direct users to exactly what you want them to see.  So what are the magical rules? Read these blinks to find out.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how everyone moves their eyes in the same fashion, regardless of background;  why people prefer less choice than more choice in general; and  how picturing yourself as an elderly person can change how you save cash.  Say you’re looking to book a hotel room in London. You search Google for accommodations, and are immediately given 500 million options. Obviously there’s no way you could consider each one –  but such is the peril of information overload in the twenty-first century.  The prominence of computers and the internet have prompted an exponential rise in the quantity of available information. In fact, scientists at IBM have estimated that the data created over just the last two years makes up 90 percent of all the information currently in existence! In the 1950s, for instance, people could choose among two or three TV channels. But today you can access just about every program ever made, and whenever you want, through cloud services.  Yet the amount of information that people actually pay attention to is limited by the cognitive capacity of the brain. For instance, research has suggested that a person’s short-term memory is only capable of storing about four pieces of information at a time. So whenever the information presented exceeds your brain’s capacity, you start missing out. For example, studies have found that having a phone conversation while driving causes you to stop noticing some 50 percent of your surroundings – red lights and pedestrians included.  Considering this, it’s easy to see how the abundance of online information inevitably leads to the waning attention of users. In short, people surfing the internet face difficult choices every second about what to notice and think about.  But there’s actually a great opportunity for companies to take advantage of the gap between the information that’s presented and the information that people notice. For instance, sites such as Booking.com or Hotels.com that offer a simple information platform online are able to charge hotel owners a commission as high as 30 percent. We’ll learn why they can do this in the next blink. You probably have heard of the dating app called Tinder. Users glance at profile pictures and in that split second, decide whether they’re interested in dating that person. Some 1.2 billion Tinder photos are swiped every single day! Tinder offers us a great example of how rapidly a person can form an opinion about a certain subject. How exactly do people make such quick decisions? Most of our choices and judgments are influenced by processes that occur before we’re conscious of what we’re actually looking at. So instead of weighing pros and cons rationally, our subconscious mind makes a near instantaneous judgment based on a first impression. So if you run a website, in order to get people to engage, you need to find a way to make your site appeal to a user’s subconscious. But most websites are drab, colorless things that rely on long streams of text instead of visual appeal to engage viewers. This sort of design can lead to a site being overly complicated and hard for a person to follow.  For instance, Bank of America’s landing page is a perfect example of a website that is overly complicated. It offers 68 links, 15 asymmetric text blocks using multiple fonts, sizes and colors, as well as three different menu bars. That’s a lesson in what not to do. Building an engaging website requires some visual complexity – that is, a perfect balance of color and detail. For instance, bright, engaging colors are key to grabbing a person’s attention. Once that’s done, the rest of your information needs to be presented in a clear, easy-to-understand format that doesn’t overburden the quick-thinking subconscious. In certain studies, participants were shown website screenshots so rapidly that they couldn’t possibly process them all consciously. Nonetheless, the sites that rated the highest for usability and trustworthiness were those that were visually appealing.  This is known as the halo effect, when one prominent feature of a product is so appealing that it influences a person’s judgment about the project as a whole. We’ve all been there: standing in a supermarket aisle, facing ten different brands of a certain product. Some people know exactly what they want, but if you don’t, you’re likely to pick an option located in the center of the shelf.  That’s because we perceive the world and make decisions based on what’s known as the middle bias.  Our eyes don’t move systematically from side to side when we see something, but instead jump around in a predictable pattern. As you might have guessed, this pattern tends to reach its end in the “center.” Studies conducted with candy have found that human’s middle bias is so powerful that test participants would choose a sweet placed in the center, even if their favorite candy was included in the group but far off to the side. So if you want someone to click on a link, the best place for the link to exist is smack dab in the center of the screen.  But placing items centrally isn’t the only way to get people to notice them. You can also highlight specific options to boost the chances of selection. This tends to work especially well when people aren’t on the hunt for something specific, or when they’re experiencing a cognitive load such as while multitasking. It’s simple: the brightest-colored option will often be the one that’s chosen.  After scanning around jerkily, however, a person’s eyes will then move horizontally. To turn this fact to your advantage, it’s essential to carefully consider which information you’ll organize in rows and which in columns.  For example, Dell Computer built on this fact to list its computer models in columns on its website, and other information, such as prices, in horizontal rows.  Yet researchers found that customers were more focused on the horizontal rows and therefore focused their search on the cheapest computer. But when Dell switched the information around, customers spent more time looking at the products, now on the horizontal plane, and less time focusing on price. It’s always better for things to be easy, right? Well, maybe not. People are happy when they don’t have to struggle to perform a task, yet this might not always be to your benefit. Here’s why.  Easy-to-use websites work well because a user can access content and services simply. For the most part this is a desired outcome, but making your website too easy can create its own issues. For instance, Uber’s simple interface often comes into conflict with the company’s policy of surge pricing, during which prices rise with demand.  In general, with just a few clicks a user can get out of a storm and into a nice, dry car taking them home. Yet at peak times, prices go up as more users log in to find rides. While it’s still just a few clicks to reserve a car, that trip during a surge pricing period might cost a customer $150 for even a short ride. And this means unhappy customers and loads of complaints.  So sometimes making an online service more efficient means making it a bit harder to use. In fact, studies have found that by producing disfluency, that is making something more challenging to read, you can actually improve people’s attention and their long-term memory. Slowing down makes people process information more deeply, thereby activating more deliberate thinking.  There are plenty of ways to encourage this, from using an unfamiliar font or unusual layout to even having users manually enter information. For instance, Uber now has a user type in the exact number by which a standard rate is multiplied during peak hours. This simple process forces the user to slow down and ensures he or she knows how much the ride will actually cost.  The point is, if you want your customers to get something done quickly, make it easy. But if you want them to carefully consider certain information, a bit of disfluency can go a long way.  Have you ever thought about how to best provide feedback? It’s an important question, because in order to have a lasting impact, comments and criticism need to be presented in the correct way.  In fact, the proper balance of feedback follows an inverted u-curve. Too little feedback will prevent learning, as the recipient won’t see how she can improve. It’s for this reason that bathroom scales alone aren’t an effective way to shed pounds, as you’re just given a number, but don’t know how to change it. On the other hand, too much feedback can overwhelm and cause a person to ignore much of the information given. This is why certain smartphone apps that allow you to track everything, from body fat to the ingredients in every meal, haven’t really contributed to reducing obesity rates. That much information is simply too much for most people. But it’s not just important to give feedback. It’s also key to present the feedback well, and this means giving it to people exactly when they need it. For instance, the Personal Capital mobile app lets users track finances in real time, allowing them to review their balance while in line to buy something. Feedback should also make clear how a person is to achieve a desired outcome. For example, the Red Alert app was built to warn Israeli residents about potential missile attacks. When an alarm sounds, the app displays directions to the closest bomb shelter. So the app doesn’t just warn a user but also tells him exactly how to avoid danger.  It’s also important that feedback produces an emotional response in the recipient. For instance, an internet-connected pill bottle called the GlowCap shines with different colored lights then makes sounds, all with the goal of producing a feeling of urgency in the patient to take his medicine. In a world chock-full of generic information, personalization is key to getting a message across.  Consider hotel managers concerned about the environment and their laundry bills. Placing a sign in a hotel room’s shower that reads, “Please reuse your towels,” doesn’t do much to motivate the average guest. Yet “75 percent of guests in this room use their towels more than once” is far more effective, as it speaks directly to the person as they dry off.  The best part is, it’s relatively easy and inexpensive to personalize digital content. For instance, international beverage company Coca-Cola ran an experimental campaign on billboards located on certain highways in Tel Aviv. Once a special smartphone app was downloaded, when a person drove past the billboard, it would display that person’s name in huge letters.  In just a few weeks, the special Coca-Cola app was downloaded over 100,000 times, and the campaign overall increased customer engagement with the company brand significantly.  Or consider the free app called AgingBooth, which adds effects to photos that make a person look much older. Studies have found that when a person is asked to put away money for a hypothetical retirement fund, that person will save twice as much after seeing an image of himself as elderly. It’s easy to see how banks and financial service providers could benefit from such software! So personalizing information is important, but timing your outreach strategy is also essential to achieving a desired effect. One way companies can do this is through the fresh start effect, a technique that can help people lose weight, get in shape or save money. The technique works by urging people to make changes on certain days. For instance, researchers at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania have found that people are much more likely to work on goals toward the beginning of the week, month or year. But important dates like birthdays or retirement are also effective. Are you familiar with the website, Healthcare.gov? This site was built to help American citizens select an insurance plan personalized to their specific needs.  The website showcases 78,000 different insurance plans and gives people the freedom to choose their favorite. However, studies have shown that on average, users choose a plan that’s too expensive for their budget by about $900. How could this be the case? Well, when given a choice that’s complicated by an overwhelming amount of data, people either make incorrect decisions or make no decision at all.  To better understand this, a study organized by academics from Columbia and Stanford universities compared two marmalade stands that allowed customers to taste and buy jam. One stand offered 24 different choices, while the other offered only six.  When customers visited the first stand with its many choices, only three percent of people made a purchase. But at the other stand where options were limited, 30 percent of visitors bought jam.   This stems from a feeling called buyer’s remorse, or when a person immediately questions a purchase after it is completed, worrying if the product purchased was indeed the “right” one.  The plethora of choice in the digital world only enforces this dread. While the average supermarket carries about 220 different breakfast cereal brands, online retailer Amazon.com offers nearly 2,000! So the solution is to establish guided decision making, helping customers to identify the option that’s right for them.  For instance, the author proposed such a strategy for a couple looking to find a house in a popular city. He first had them narrow down all their options to about 16, using different categories such as location, size and access to good schools.  Then the couple entered a serious decision-making phase. The author set up a system in which four options would appear on a screen; the couple was only allowed to choose one of the four, losing the other options forever. The end result left them with just four houses from which to choose, a much easier amount of choice to manage.  Remember, strategies like this are effective because customers don’t actually want unlimited options, but instead a curated selection. The way humans perceive and respond to digital information is highly predictable.

Kidder","summary":"In the United States alone, over 500,000 companies are started each month! Needless to say, many of these companies will not make it. In fact, most of them won’t. So how do you make sure your company is one of the lucky few? It’s simple. You learn from the ones who have made it.  In these blinks, five founders of highly successful companies share their secrets on how to grow your fledgling start-up business into a successful company. You already know that it’s important to be passionate and dedicated. But, as you’ll see, it takes a bit more than that to succeed with your company. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to turn unused resources into new products and services;  how Sara Blakely’s pantyhose ended up on Oprah; and why the future is all that matters. You’ve probably heard of the professional social network LinkedIn. But do you know the story behind it? Most people couldn’t tell you how such huge companies get started. And, contrary to what many people think, the key isn’t to be in the right place at the right time – it’s to be there early. This is a lesson from Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn. He’s also invested in several successful start-ups, and his secret is to spot a trend before it even starts. For example, when he invests in start-ups, he looks for companies whose value has yet to be fully recognized – a sure sign that a trend has yet to begin. When Hoffman was starting LinkedIn, many people thought his idea would fail. Newspapers and headhunters already fulfilled the needs of the employment market, so why was his website necessary? Hoffman’s idea seemed bad because it came so early. This made it harder to find investors, but it also greatly diminished competition. Another reason LinkedIn became so successful is Hoffman’s ability to anticipate solutions to obvious problems. If you’ve got a great idea, chances are someone else has probably already tried it – and failed. That means you have to figure out exactly why the idea hasn’t already made it big, and what you can do differently to make it work. For example, when LinkedIn got started, people were skeptical about the value it could offer its first users; with so few members in the network, what was to be gained? This is a typical problem for many start-ups. Hoffman had a great solution, though. He developed a function that allowed new users to scan their e-mail address books for LinkedIn matches. They would then be shown a list of who was already on the network, as well as options to invite friends and colleagues to join. This network grew quickly, allowing its users to connect with more and more people. If you want to succeed in business and life, you need to know where you’re going. Sara Blakely, founder of hosiery company Spanx, knew exactly where that was for her. How did she know? She created mental snapshots: visions of herself having accomplished ambitious but concrete goals. And even though she didn’t know how she was going to accomplish them, she could use her mental snapshots to cheer herself on and renew her faith in her ability to get there somehow. For example, Blakely already dreamt about being on The Oprah Winfrey Show when she was in high school. She used that dream to fuel her work until the year 2000, when Oprah named Spanx as one of her new favorite products. But no matter how excited you are about your business idea, be careful about sharing it too openly. It’s normal to want to share your great idea with everyone you know. But instead of receiving the support you need, you may well find yourself in the discouraging position of having to constantly defend your business model against the skeptical remarks of friends and family.  Think of how Blakely’s parents reacted when she told them she wanted to sell footless pantyhose: They were extremely skeptical. Even though she had clearly invested a lot in her idea, her parents simply couldn’t see the potential. And then there’s another risk that comes with sharing your idea. Someone might steal it from you. That’s why you should only talk with potential investors until your business is up and running. Did you know that many people spend less than five percent of their time driving their car? The other 95 percent of the time, it’s just parked somewhere, taking up space. Robin Chase realized how inefficient that type of car ownership was, and so she founded Zipcar – a car rental company that offers cars for an hourly rate. You too can found a successful start-up by identifying inefficiently used resources and coming up with an efficient solution. Try imagining how we could use what we already have more efficiently, like Chase did. Another strategy is to come up with new functions for things normally used for one purpose. For example, ten years ago, our phones could only be used to call and text people; in the past decade, however, we’ve seen them develop into hi-tech computers that can take photos, play videos and send e-mails. But no matter how brilliant your idea is, your start-up won’t survive if you don’t react quickly to problems. So if you discover a big problem with your business model, don’t get discouraged. Instead, try to solve the problem as soon as possible, and inform your customers about what is going on. If you’re honest, they will be more understanding than you might expect. For example, after the first three months of running Zipcar, Robin Chase realized that there was a serious revenue problem that would eventually bleed the company dry. After consulting her whole team, she quickly concluded that without a 25 percent increase in the hourly rate, the business would die. Robin dreaded informing her customers of this. Once informed, however, most of them were prepared to pay more for what they already considered a great service. In 1998, Seth Goldman founded Honest Tea, a beverage company that sells organic, fair-trade, low-sugar tea. The company now makes more than $70 million in sales each year. So how did Goldman achieve such phenomenal success? He realized early on that the company’s success didn’t just depend on him – it also depended on the enthusiasm and engagement of his employees and customers.  One way of nurturing healthy and highly motivated employees is to lead by example. You need to be a role model for managing the stresses of the start-up life. When you’re getting a start-up on its feet, you may be tempted to overwork yourself. But if you live an unhealthy lifestyle, your employees will try to keep pace with you, which will make the whole organization unhealthy. So it’s crucial to take time off when your stress-levels get too high. When Goldman started Honest Tea, he felt like he had to work non-stop. But because he wanted to communicate a philosophy of work-life balance to his employees, he did his best to leave the office every day at 5:30 to spend time with his family. That way, his employees could see it was okay for them to leave early, too. Another thing you’ll need for a successful start-up are enthusiastic long-term customers. No matter how small your start-up is right now, the customers you already have are crucial to your future, because they establish your reputation in the market. Do whatever you can to keep them enthusiastic about what you do, and turn them into customers for life. Goldman realized that if he could get children to consume his brand from a young age, they would stick with it when they got older. So he started Honest Kids, a fruit juice for children, to encourage them to drink Honest Tea later in life.  Hosain Rahman knows the value of looking to the future. He founded the wearable technology company Jawbone in 1999, long before wearable tech was a trend. And by cultivating a future-oriented mindset, he learned how to keep his company ahead of the game. A key principle of the future-oriented mindset is that what worked yesterday won’t work today. The world is changing so rapidly and unpredictably that you must keep moving. If you allow yourself to become satisfied with your success, you’ll lose sight of what you need to change to keep your customers happy. For example, if you sell ice cream and reach your sales goal in three years, you might be tempted to relax. But usually that’s the exact moment your customer's tastes change, or a new competitor enters the market – and your company collapses. Something else Rahman learned early on is the importance of focusing on your customer’s wishes and needs. He realized the value of investing in things that directly benefit your customers, like high quality products and excellent customer service.  Take the Jawbone Up bracelet. It can analyze your health by tracking your day-to-day habits, such as sleep and exercise, and then organize all the collected data for easy access on your smartphone. But on top of this it has a sharp, customizable look: you can choose from various colors and designs to find the Up bracelet that perfectly fits your style. In a world of almost infinite choice, the only way to stand out is to develop top-notch products. That means not only paying attention to what’s needed, but paying attention to what’s wanted as well. Develop a product that looks as smooth as it functions, and you’ll be well on your way. The key message in this book: By making sure you enter markets early, with a clear idea of where you want your business to take you and by always keeping the customer in focus, you'll increase the chances of your start-up’s success.   Actionable advice: Pay attention to unmet needs – they might be a key to something big. If you're looking for start-up ideas, be vigilant for products, apps and services that you or other people would like to use, but can't find anywhere. This often indicates an unmet market need that you can jump to meet.

And it looks like it’ll only continue to permeate our lives in ever new ways. We are approaching the third wave of the internet revolution, a time when our use of information-age technology will change and enter a new stage. Let’s look at how we reached this third wave and what we can expect from it. We’ll explore the fields that’ll be revolutionized, how this may happen and what types of obstacles entrepreneurs will face in the new era. In these blinks, you’ll find out how the third wave will change the healthcare industry; what “impact investing” is and why it’s a key feature of the third wave; and that cooperation is sometimes more effective than competition. In 1980, futurist Alvin Toffler wrote The Third Wave, a book describing how the next “wave” of evolution in the information age would transform the world and create an electronic global village. But to understand this “third wave,” let’s first take a step back and look at what came before. The first wave began with the creation of the foundation and infrastructure of the online world. Companies like Sprint, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, AOL, and IBM created crucial hardware, software and networks, making the internet available to everyday users. This wasn’t exactly an easy task. These online pioneers faced an uphill battle, struggling to convince people that the internet was relevant and worthwhile. Indeed, many saw it as a fad. In a 1995 interview on PBS, the author was asked, “Why do people need [the internet]?” By the turn of the twenty-first century – the beginning of the second wave – the answer to that question was more than apparent. By this time, search engines like Google were helping people navigate ever vaster amounts of information; online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay appeared; and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter emerged, connecting more and more people. The second wave further revolutionized the world when mobile devices like Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android enabled people to access the internet wherever they went. This brings us to the third wave, on the threshold of which we currently stand. The third wave is about integrating the internet into everything we do. No longer limited to PCs, tablets and other devices, the internet is becoming part of our homes, automobiles, agriculture and cities. This technologically-integrated age has also been referred to as the Internet of Things. The third wave will find entrepreneurs taking advantage of this new era to challenge major industries such as healthcare, education, food and commuting. So, let’s dive in and discover what these future fields of entrepreneurship may look like. The third wave of the internet isn’t about creating the next viral game or social media app; it’s about innovatively addressing real-world problems. Consider health care, an industry that offers great potential for entrepreneurs. Health care is a huge market, making up one-sixth of the US economy, and since it suffers from longstanding problems, there’s plenty of room for technological improvement. The US healthcare system is notoriously slow, inefficient and expensive; many hospitals still use fax machines and hard copies of medical records, and, due to a lack of coordination and accessible data, mistakes are constantly being made. For instance, in 2011, researchers at the cancer center MD Anderson found that one out of every four patients was getting a new diagnosis following a second opinion. Many entrepreneurs have already jumped at this opportunity: between 2010 and 2014, the amount of money raised by digital health-care start-ups quadrupled. So, before long, smartphones will diagnose your symptoms, check your medical background and warn you before you have a stroke or heart attack. This constant monitoring of high-risk patients from home could potentially reduce health-care spending by 30 percent – money that would otherwise be drained into misdiagnoses and incorrect treatments. Another enormous opportunity for these entrepreneurs is the five-trillion-dollar food industry. The third wave will revolutionize how we grow, raise, store, transport and deliver food. For example, a report in The Guardian revealed that innovative researchers are already finding ways to improve bee colonies by connecting their hives to the internet. Bees are vital in the pollination of crops and their numbers are declining. But internet technology can monitor hive temperatures and create heat in order to deter the mites that lead to colony collapse. Entrepreneurs are also developing sensors to monitor food safety, even going so far as to imagine ovens that will refuse to cook spoiled meat! Such technology is badly needed in processing plants today, where USDA inspectors check less than one percent of processed meat. As we can see, the third wave represents a serious change to the old ways of doing business. In the wake of the third wave, ideas will continue to come from unexpected places, causing disruption that entrepreneurs should embrace. These ideas will lead to old paradigms being shifted or completely destroyed, which means success will only come to those who take risks and recognize future opportunities. The self-driving car is a perfect example of an innovative idea that emerged from a surprising place – in this case, the agricultural sector. Companies like Google and Uber are now embracing this technology, but it actually goes back 20 years, when the Illinois-based tractor company John Deere developed GPS navigation systems for self-driving tractors. Unfortunately, the John Deere executives didn’t see the true potential of their innovative idea. Even though it’s unlikely that John Deere would have had the means to build self-driving commercial cars from scratch, they ignored the opportunity to license the technology to a partner company or branch out into new territory. Had they been willing to take a chance and disrupt their business model for something new, who knows what level of success they would have achieved. In other cases, self-disruption might be the key to future success. This entails being aware of your customer’s current preferences and not being afraid to get rid of tried-and-true products or services in favor of new ones. Apple has done this multiple times. Some of their biggest successes have come at the expense of their previous products. Apple was not afraid to hurt iPod sales by coming out with the iPhone, or limit MacBook growth by releasing the iPad. Amazon is another expert at self-disruption. After building its reputation selling physical media, it successfully transitioned into streaming movies and TV shows, and introduced the Kindle for customers to buy and read electronic books. Successfully riding the third wave means getting out of your comfort zone and not underestimating how fast those tidal waves of change can come. But, as we’ll see in the next blink, staying on top also means looking beyond the profit margins. Historically speaking, corporations and CEOs have long adhered to economist Milton Friedman’s old dictum: “The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.” Investors have also been happy with this philosophy, but as the third wave rolls in, we’re seeing a change. There’s been an increase in impact investing, a third-wave megatrend that merges traditional business and philanthropy. Through impact investing, corporations recognize the importance of creating both financial return and social good. This results in a “best of both worlds” scenario where companies can combine profit and purpose. And this is what we see today; major institutions such as investment banks, asset management firms and private equity investors are all embracing impact investing. But this kind of practice is still in its early days: In 2013, global wealth reached over $150 trillion, but only $50 billion went toward impact investing. However, current projections suggest that by 2020, this amount will increase twenty-fold to exceed $1 trillion. This is mostly due to millennials, who are committed to creating positive social change, both as employees and consumers. This new generation wants to support companies that have a positive impact on society. And this trend has been supported by corporate policy-makers, too. In July of 2013, the G8 governments created the Social Impact Investment Taskforce to help foster a profitable, purpose-driven marketplace made up of benefit corporations, or B corporations. As a result, many US states have created laws to support such companies. These organizations include Patagonia, Kickstarter and Etsy, all of which are focused on issues like climate change, job creation and supporting the arts – in addition to making a profit. Kickstarter is a perfect example of a public-benefit company. Their mission statement is to use a global crowdfunding platform for the sole purpose of helping bring creative projects to life. For some time now, technology hubs like Silicon Valley, and creative business meccas like New York, have maintained the status quo when it comes to brilliant ideas. But this will change as the third wave engenders “the rise of the rest.” This rise in innovation will come from on-the-ground experts in diverse geographic regions. Removed from the usual insulated areas, their location will afford them direct access to the businesses they aim to affect and provide them with the kind of experience that brings about useful innovation. After all, it makes more sense for a new food company to operate out of the Midwestern United States, where there’s agricultural infrastructure, or for a health-care company to be based in Baltimore or Nashville, where you can find many medical institutes. Take Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins University. With its extensive research programs, it’s often considered one of the best medical schools in the world. So, it stands to reason that you’ll find a more innovative idea for your health-care business here than across the country in Silicon Valley. This rise of the rest will also create new opportunities and improve economic growth. This is because start-ups are the engine of America’s economy: over the past 30 years, new companies less than a year old have created an average of 1.5 million jobs per year. In fact, The Kauffman Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on entrepreneurship, found that new businesses like these are almost completely responsible for the overall increase in new jobs. There’s the Detroit-based Shinola, for example – a company that employs hundreds of former autoworkers to build such products as watches, bicycles and handbags. Their motto is “Where American is Made,” and they’ve found success exporting their goods around the world. Venture capitalists would be wise to start paying attention to what’s going on outside of the usual locations. But, as we’ll see in the next blink, these third-wave entrepreneurs won’t be revolutionizing the economy completely on their own. Second-wave companies, like Google and Amazon, managed to become overnight sensations by single-handedly creating massively popular products. While this method proved successful in the past, it won’t work in the third wave. Like companies during the first wave, innovative third-wave companies need to build strong partnerships with industry gatekeepers. Otherwise, these big corporations may regard new entrepreneurs as competition and block their path. So there are lessons to be learned from the first wave: When Apple was developing iTunes and the iPod, they needed to license music content that people could download. As a result, they needed to build partnerships with companies that might see Apple as a business threat. But at the time, iTunes was only a Macintosh program, and the computer only had a two-percent share of the market. This allowed Apple to pitch iTunes to the music corporations as a risk-free experiment, where they could safely test out online music sales. For Apple and the record labels, this was a win-win proposition. So, to follow this proven path to success, third-wave entrepreneurs will have to make early partnerships to build credibility and gain momentum in order to win over the gatekeepers. And to find the right partners, they will need to look in diverse places: For instance, when AOL was starting out, it hustled non-stop before finally landing a willing partner with the Commodore computer company. But they didn’t stop there – they kept the momentum going, with Commodore leading to a second partnership with Tandy, then a deal with Apple and finally a contract with IBM. So, even if you have a great product or a spectacular idea, you might never get them off the ground unless you make partnerships a core part of your strategy. Success in the third wave of the information age doesn’t only depend on finding like-minded business partners. Entrepreneurs will also need to work closely with the government. After all, the government has always played a crucial role in innovation. Government organizations routinely take risks by funding research, supporting projects and ideas that the private sector won’t or can’t touch. In fact, without federal assistance, many of today’s technologies wouldn’t exist. For example, the GPS technology in our cars and mobile devices is due to the Department of Defense, which created a satellite-based global positioning system as part of its nuclear deterrence program. But the best example might be the internet itself, which was created in 1972 as part of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a government agency created by President Eisenhower in 1958. The internet’s potential in private and commercial use only became apparent when the government passed the Telecommunications Act in 1996. Therefore, it’s important to understand that the government’s role will only become more crucial in the future, and in order to succeed you’ll have to work alongside it – mainly because third-wave entrepreneurs will be targeting highly regulated industries. Just think: Would you want to ride in self-driving cars that didn’t receive government approval? So, to ensure both short-term and long-term success, future innovators must work hand in hand with the government to make sure that they’re operating within the bounds of legislation. This kind of relationship can even help pave the way for future laws and policies. Certainly, it’s not uncommon to think of the government as a terrible tangle of bureaucracy and red tape. But if you have revolutionary ideas about changing the way we lend money, or the way we deliver government services, such as food or new forms of energy, the government must be a partner, not an adversary. The key message in this book: The Third Wave is the next phase of the internet and information age, and it is fast approaching. This next step in our technological evolution will be marked by businesses and entrepreneurs who possess strong partnerships, purpose-driven missions and a clear understanding of government policy.

The best things in life are free and money won’t buy you happiness. It’s hard to argue with that – but you still have to pay the rent. The trick is to find a way to earn your bread by doing something you love. And, chances are, that’s not working a nine-to-five job. That’s where these blinks come in. By laying out a non-business-y business plan, they provide a roadmap for creative thinkers who want to swap the daily grind for something more exciting and still be comfortably profitable. Designed by entrepreneur Danny Schuman, and supported by practical tips gleaned from in-depth interviews with over 100 successful self-starters, this business model might just be perfect for you. Put it into action today and there’s no telling where you’ll find yourself tomorrow. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why everyone should have their own personal \"Susie\"; how you can make more money in an initially painful but ultimately pleasing way; why preparing for meetings can be a waste of time. If you’ve ever spent a day in the office staring at the clock and just waiting for the day to be over, then you’ll know the value of earning money doing something you love. That’s where Us Doing Our Thing – UDOT, for short – comes in. It’s an entrepreneurship model that adds a little process to doing what you love and figuring out the rest along the way. UDOT entrepreneurs, or UDOTs, work for themselves rather than a boss. They focus on what they’re good at and what gets them excited. Sounds great, right? But there’s a catch: UDOTs aren’t very good at the logistical and technical side of things. That’s a problem, because success is partly built on these foundations. After all, no business is going to make it if it can’t get a website up and running or comply with existing laws and regulations. But UDOTs either don’t care or aren’t very good at that stuff. They like working things out on the fly. If that sounds familiar, these blinks are for you. Think of it as the business part of your business – the essentials that support the fun stuff. It may make the UDOT style of entrepreneurship sound like the worst business model possible. It might be chaotic, but it’s also rewarding. Granted, it doesn’t fit the common sense idea of what a business is – it’s not about planning and minimizing risk at every turn. Nor is it about making as much money as possible. What it is about is living in the moment, being flexible and experiencing your version of success. You have to make enough money to live well, of course, but as your parents probably taught you, money can’t buy happiness. Few things nurture the soul like freedom. That’s what UDOTs cherish above all else – the chance to seek out exciting new opportunities and never be bored. It may go hand-in-hand with project-based work and a degree of financial insecurity. But it’s worth it. The upsides? Well, they include working when and where you like, seeing more of your family and friends, pursuing your interests and turning down work you don’t care for. One of the challenges you’ll encounter when you start out as an entrepreneur is writing proposals and figuring out how much to charge. It’s all too easy to undervalue your work and charge less than you actually deserve. Whatever you do, don’t do that! Getting paid what you're worth starts with learning to trust yourself. Part of that involves charging your clients a fee that may make you uncomfortable at first. But if you underestimate your own value, you won't make the money that’s commensurate with the quality of work you’re providing. So here’s a good rule of thumb: Ask yourself what you think a fair price would be and double it. Don’t be scared of doing this, even if your client is a friend. They'll tell you if they think it’s too much, and you can always discuss it and see if you can agree on a compromise. Strange as it might sound, charging more means people will value your work more. If they’re paying a decent amount, they’ll assume you’re worth it. And that’ll motivate you to do better work. Self-trust isn’t just about the numbers on an invoice, though. If you want to develop trust in yourself, you need to craft an inspiring story that’ll help you get to where you want to go. Feeling sorry for yourself is a trap, and it’s hard to get out once you’ve fallen into it. You start thinking the world is conspiring against you when it really isn’t. Don’t fall back on a sob story when the going gets tough. Tell yourself a story about a time when you were hugely successful. That could be a previous project that wowed your clients. Think back to how smoothly the work went and how happy everyone was with the end product. Use it as a reminder of how good you are every time you're tempted to fall into a sad story. If you’re a budding entrepreneur, your head is probably brimming with brilliant concepts. But who can you talk to when it comes to bringing them to life? If you want to succeed, you have to learn to trust the world. That means getting over the hurdle of sharing your time and ideas with other people. Remember the old saying, “You reap what you sow.” Life really is like that. You can be sure that you’ll get in return whatever you give – and then some. When you know something that might help others, think of all the good you could do by sharing your knowledge. You could help other UDOTs build a website, avoid financial and legal pitfalls or write their invoices. Take it from the author. When he lost his agency job, he asked other professionals for help getting back on his feet and launching his own business. Over countless dinners, they shared their invaluable advice and insights. People, he learned, can be extremely generous with their time and wisdom. That’s a lesson he’s taken to heart. Today, he goes out of his way to help young entrepreneurs struggling to find their way. Trusting the world is also about having faith that the next project is always just around the corner. As a UDOT, you’ll have to get used to financial insecurity. Your money will inevitably run out at some point. But there’s always another ship on the horizon. The most important thing is to keep telling yourself that it’s going to come in any day now. That’s something the author knows all about. His marketing company, Twist, crashed after just six months when his funding sources dried up. That was a bitter pill to swallow. But there was an unforeseen upside: it meant that he had time to return to something he’d always loved doing – writing. After posting blog posts about his experience, one of his readers reached out and gave him a project to work on. That was enough to tide him over and give him renewed momentum. Soon enough, he was back on his feet and his business was thriving! But remember that having faith isn’t passive. When you need work, don’t be shy about telling everyone you know about your situation. Whether it’s posting on social media or calling up a friend or colleague, keep your communication channels open. If you’ve seen the TV series Mad Men, you’ll remember what advertising guru Don Draper thought about clients – not much! There wasn’t anything he hated more than having to deal with them. UDOTs don’t see it that way. They think of it like this: When you genuinely love your clients, you’ll never be alone in your business. In fact, building solid relationships with clients is one of the most rewarding parts of being a UDOT, both financially and emotionally. This appreciation doesn’t hinge on money, however – it hinges on mutual trust. The author built up his business by taking potential clients out to lunch and hoping they’d throw some work his way. Years later, they’re still at the core of his company, giving him his most regular gigs. That’s something small business owners know all about. Most of their earnings come from repeat customers. But it’s not enough to just feel the love – you also have to show it. Even small gestures can make a big difference. Simply sending your most loyal customers notes or articles that might interest them goes a long way. The same goes for small gifts on holidays or special occasions. Loyalty, in other words, is its own reward. Stay true to your business partners and you’ll never be alone. It doesn’t matter if it’s an IT specialist who’s helping you build an app or just your hairdresser. Every relationship can be beneficial in its own unique way. After all, those are the people who’re most likely to go the extra mile and help you meet an impossible deadline, or squeeze you in for a trim on a busy day. So far we've seen what the UDOT entrepreneurship model is and how it can help you get more out of both your business and your life. Sometimes, though, getting going and finding enough time can be a challenge. So let’s look at two easy ways to save valuable time and get going with your business. It might sound counterintuitive, but one great place to start is to not prepare for meetings. Lots of entrepreneurs spend hours boning up for meetings and doing in-depth research on their clients. UDOTs have a simpler, and more effective, strategy: active listening. Take the author. He spends no more than five or ten minutes preparing for a meeting with a prospective client. That’s more than enough time to look up some basic information. Some might call that being underprepared, but, as far as he’s concerned, there’s no such thing. Skipping the time-consuming groundwork means he goes into meetings with an open mind. Because he isn’t biased, he can actively listen to what the other person is saying and show that he’s paying attention by asking pertinent questions. The reason that’s such an effective technique is that, when you’re really listening to them, you both learn what people’s real problems are and what they’re excited about. That not only saves time; it also makes you more effective at acquiring new clients. Look at it from their perspective. Who’s more likely to be able to help them – someone who’s done a ton of research and is bringing assumptions into the meeting, or someone who is truly listening and tuning into their needs? Here’s another great tip: Write down important thoughts and ideas as soon as they come to you. You’ve probably experienced those frustrating moment when, right after you’ve had a flash of insight, some distraction comes along, derails your train of thought and, just like that, your brilliant idea is suddenly gone. Maybe the following has happened to you. You wake up in the middle of the night having found the perfect solution to a problem in your dreams. But rather than writing it down, you roll over and go back to sleep, sure that you won’t forget it. By morning, however, it’s long gone. To make sure you don’t forget your ideas, get into the habit of writing your thoughts down as soon as you have them. Think of it as an autosave function that prevents you from losing valuable work. How you do it is up to you. You can keep it old school and use pen and paper or embrace modern technology and use something like Apple Notes or QuickVoice Pro. The most important thing is to record your ideas before they disappear! You’ve probably been told a million times that you’ll only be successful if you work really hard all the time. There’s some truth in that, but it also leaves something out. When it comes to productivity, playtime is just as important as hard work. Creativity thrives when you take time out and play. The key is to create the time and space to let it happen. It could be taking the dog for a walk, playing an instrument, watching TV or just idly daydreaming. Let your mind wander and you’ll be amazed how often inspiration strikes! If you’re looking for something a bit more radical, you can follow the example of UDOT entrepreneur Kate Kimmerle, CEO of the cosmetics company Revolution Beauty. When her well of ideas runs dry she hops on a plane to a holiday destination with nothing but a notepad and waits for that aha moment! Then there’s author Gretchen Rubin. She took a full year off to figure out what would make her happier in life and ended up writing a book about her experience called The Happiness Project. Stretching yourself, learning new skills and expanding your horizons are just as important as playtime. In other words, you’ve got to throw yourself in the deep end every now and then. Uncomfortable? Sure, but discomfort is a sign of growth. The payoff is well worth it. Nothing feels better than learning something new. Push through your discomfort and you’ll emerge on the other side feeling more self-confident and ready to take on the world. Take it from the author. When he started his company, his computer skills didn’t extend much further than creating a Word document. It took him hours to learn how to create a business proposal and a website. Mastering those new skills didn’t just feel great, they made a big difference as he continued to grow his business. The key message in these blinks: There are as many styles of entrepreneurship as there are individual entrepreneurs. You can spend every second focused on chasing money, or you can focus on what you love to do, and creating ideas that solve problems. Success will come by trusting yourself and trusting the world, by building great relationships with the people around you, and being open to inspiration. When you start with a positive mindset, you’ll be amazed how many open doors you’ll find.  Actionable advice: Find a positivity buddy.  Building your own business from the ground up is one of the most exciting challenges you’ll ever take on. But it’s also going to be tough, so it’s important to find someone who can keep your spirits up when everything’s going wrong. Many people have an “accountability buddy,” to help keep them on track. But that can become less joyful and more painful when it turns into constant reminders of your failures. Instead, find a “positivity buddy,” a friend who’ll remind you how fabulous you are and give your self-esteem a boost when it feels like you’re carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.

Who could’ve imagined that one day all members of Congress – not to mention the President of the United States – would have their own Twitter account? And who could’ve envisioned that Twitter would be the central tool in accelerating the revolution in Egypt? In Things a Little Bird Told Me, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone addresses the question: Just how did Twitter become the phenomenon it is today? Stone recounts many entertaining stories from his career, sharing lots of key insights and lessons he learned during Twitter’s inception and development. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to unlock your creativity – by limiting yourself, how imagining the absolute worst-case scenario will increase your chances of success, that “hashtags,” “retweets,” and even the word “tweet” itself actually came from Twitter users, how Twitter helped a college dean to rescue one of his students from an Egyptian jail and how Twitter’s founders got Mark Zuckerberg to offer to buy the company for $500 million – and why they turned him down. Think back to your school years when being faced with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil presented so many possibilities that you simply had no idea where to begin. It’s only when the teacher would offer a direction, like “draw a rainbow” or “write a short story,” that the ideas would start to flow. Though it may seem counterintuitive, such limitations can often be a springboard for creativity. Why? Because whenever there are limitations on a task we try to perform, we have to abandon our usual approach. To come up with a solution to a problem, we are forced to get creative. Everyone has to deal with such constraints – even people who are the most accomplished in their field. Take filmmaker Steven Spielberg, for example, who’d originally envisioned using an animatronic shark for the hit movie Jaws. The constraint was a financial one: the shark was too expensive: a limitation that forced him to be creative. His solution? To avoid directly showing the shark by shooting from the shark’s point of view. The result? Jaws ended up being far scarier than it would’ve been had Spielberg been able to use an animatronic shark, and the film became a megahit. Furthermore, the effect was so terrifying that Spielberg’s POV technique subsequently became very popular in horror films. This principle – that constraints inspire creativity – can also be applied to products, like Twitter, and their users. Twitter’s users are limited to 140 characters per tweet, which encourages them to find ways to express their ideas concisely. It’s even considered a valuable skill to be able to craft a Tweet that’s exactly 140 characters long – known in the Twitter community as a “twoosh” – a challenge that sparks users’ creativity. In 2008, when Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg offered to buy Twitter, its founders, Evan Williams and Biz Stone, jokingly told him that they would sell – for a ludicrous $500 million. Although this price was obviously much higher than Twitter’s actual valuation at the time, Zuckerberg agreed. Williams and Stone weren’t serious about selling their company, but surely Zuckerberg’s incredible offer was tempting? Actually, no. Twitter’s founders were convinced that their idea could be worth far more. And they were right: as a result of Zuckerberg’s offer, the company’s value skyrocketed and is worth about $15 billion today. What can we take away from this success story? If you believe in yourself and your idea, others will notice you and follow suit. The self-confidence that Twitter’s founders displayed in valuing their product so highly seduced others into believing in the product too. But how can you effectively signal this self-belief to others? Often, the best way is through “branding” yourself. For example, before Twitter, Biz Stone had business cards with the title “Genius” printed on them. He’d also tell people about completely fictional business deals he’d played a part in. It was exactly this outlandish confidence and self-belief that helped him to land a job with Google. Sometimes, however, you’ll find it difficult to get people to notice you, no matter how much self-belief you have. In such cases, you have to get creative. For instance, if you’re aiming to get noticed in a competitive field, but the skills you have aren’t unique, you have to create a niche for yourself. Imagine, for example, you’re finding it hard to get recognized as a good football player in a school already filled with good players. What can you do to get yourself noticed? You could encourage the school to offer a new sport, such as lacrosse. By doing so, you’ll find it a lot easier to stand out, as you’ll have less competition. At some point, many of us find ourselves bored with our jobs and feeling that our well of creativity is drying up. We become desperate to try something new, but at the same time are terrified of the risks involved. “What if I’m simply no good at it?,” we wonder. “What if it fails?” How can we overcome this fearful way of thinking? The first thing to consider is that creativity never really dries up, but is in fact a renewable resource. Therefore, whatever task you put your mind to will stimulate your creativity, so there’s little reason to fear moving onto a new venture if you’re dissatisfied in your current position. For example, although Biz Stone had a lucrative position at Google, he wanted to pursue a new project. He decided to take a leap of faith and leave Google to join the podcasting company Odeo – which he eventually dropped to focus on the ultimately more successful Twitter. However, once you’re ready to accept the risks and dive into something completely new, it’s crucial to first investigate the potential negative outcomes to make yourself aware of the worst-case scenario. Why? Because when we start something new, we’re often discouraged by thoughts of failure, causing the steps we take to be tentative and half-hearted. In order to overcome this, we have to consider the question, “What’s the worst that can happen?” as it’s often not as terrifying as you might believe. For example, if you’re attracted to someone, you might be scared to ask them out on a date because you fear being rejected. But when you consider the worst-case scenario, you realize it’s that they say “no” – that’s it! Once we realize that the risks aren’t as potentially devastating as we first believed, we can muster up the confidence to give all we have to make our new project succeed. We all have to deal with failure at some point in our lives, and being aware of this can keep many of us from trying something new. But it doesn’t need to be the case: there are lots of productive ways to deal with failure. First, whenever you fail, try to remain positive and find a solution. Take the way Timothy Preston handled a potential failure: Following the tsunami in Indonesia in 2004, eight incubators for infants were donated to an Indonesian hospital. But when Preston – an MIT professor with a team designing an incubator for the developing world – checked on them four years later, he discovered that they’d all broken down because no one knew how to service them. Rather than letting pessimism get the best of him and abandoning the project, Preston decided to stay positive and find a solution. One colleague had noticed that all the Toyota trucks in the area were running perfectly – which meant that local mechanics clearly knew how to repair them. Preston thus built incubators using truck parts so local mechanics would know how to fix them. Second, when you fail, you must admit your failures to others. That way they’ll know you’re working on a solution and be patient with you. For example, as Twitter’s popularity increased, so did the amount of service outages due to the overwhelming demand on the servers. Rather than keeping quiet, Twitter informed their users about the problem and assured them that they were working on it – and the error message was accompanied by an image of a whale being lifted by birds. As a result, any disappointment the users had was eased by their belief that Twitter was being straight with them. In fact, their acceptance of the situation was so great that the “Fail Whale” became an internet meme, probably attracting even more users. If a great idea springs to your mind, is your first instinct to keep it to yourself? If so, you’re probably making a mistake. Why? Because ideas rarely come out fully formed and perfect. It’s only with the input and assistance of others that these ideas can be improved – which is exactly what Biz Stone discovered when he was designing the Twitter logo. At first, Stone simply drew a sketch of a bird based on an image he found online. Since this first attempt wasn’t quite right, Stone allowed someone else to make a few changes that he hadn’t considered. After that, he sought out a professional designer to finalize the logo. Had Stone not used outside sources, allowed others to give critical input and, finally, called on the services of a professional, the iconic Twitter logo never would’ve been realized. But this process shouldn’t end once you’ve released your product. Once it’s out there, the opinions of your users can be a crucial source of guidance for how to improve your product. That’s because your users know what they want. It’s extremely useful, therefore, to observe their behavior, listen to their opinions and implement ideas in response to them. Twitter is a great example of the value of this process, as many of its popular features were actually inspired by its users. For example, users initially would copy and paste those tweets that they wanted to share. Observing this behavior, Twitter created the “retweet.” Another example is the hashtag, which was first suggested by one user at the South by Southwest festival who wanted all tweets about the event to be tagged together. The user’s solution was to add “#sxsw” to his tweets. The hashtag later became one of Twitter’s most famous features. If these examples aren’t enough to convince you to listen to your users, this should: even the word “tweet” was invented by Twitter users themselves! Do you remember how torturous even the easiest classes in school were if you didn’t care about the subject matter? Or perhaps you recall getting an “easy A” in a difficult class because it was a subject you loved? In that vein, you have to be a passionate, avid user of your product for it to become a success. For example, as Stone and Williams were developing the podcasting app Odeo, they realized they didn’t care about podcasting, nor did they know anything about audio. Unsurprisingly, Odeo didn’t pan out. However, Stone was passionate about connecting people, so they began to develop a product focused on the status update – Twitter. Part of the reason that Twitter was successful and Odeo was not is that the founders were more passionate about Twitter and thus able to experience the service from a user’s perspective. But it’s not just founders who benefit from following their passions. Employees also should be encouraged to work on whatever they’re truly interested in. Why? Employees are hired because they’re talented and intelligent. Therefore, letting them follow their own passions will lead ultimately to the development of great products. For example, after selling Odeo, Stone and Williams used their team’s passion to help find a new direction for the company by holding a “hackathon” in which employees could focus on their own ideas. Out of this process, the idea that would lead to the creation of Twitter was born. Of course, sometimes you’ll lose your passion in a project. In such cases, it’s crucial that you allow yourself to take on a new project that reignites your interest. For example, when Stone’s interest in Twitter waned, he followed his passion, creating the app Jelly, a search engine with a twist: questions entered into Jelly are answered by real people. Most of us are aware of Google’s motto “Don't be evil.” However, in striving to succeed with your company, it’s not enough to merely refrain from doing evil. Rather, if you want your company to succeed, you must actively do good – which, in business, means offering your partners, employees and users a good deal. And the best deal is a win-win deal as it benefits both parties. By ensuring that the other party benefits equally, you stand a greater chance of establishing a long-term relationship with them. For example, a major UK mobile company offered to pre-install Stone’s app Jelly on their phones before they knew the first thing about it. Why? The mobile company had had a very productive relationship with the same staff at Twitter and believed that Jelly would be equally as productive. But how can you make a win-win deal with your users? The answer is to focus on their interests, rather than solely on monetization. While most websites use advertising to make money, their webpages often contain more ads than content. Such an approach alienates the user, as they feel they’re being exploited because they’re getting very little out of the arrangement. To avoid this, companies must ensure that their users benefit from the ads that they see. Twitter, for example, tracks retweets, favorites and clickthroughs in order to deliver only those ads that users will find interesting. Finally, making a win-win deal with employees means giving them an incentive to work with you. Of course, this incentive has to be offered right from the outset. It won’t be effective if it’s only to persuade the employee to stay with the company – which is what happened when two Twitter employees were about to leave the company to work with Stone on Jelly. Although Twitter offered generous financial incentives to stay, they refused.  Imagine you were alive fifty years ago and an earthquake hit a nearby town where your friends lived. Would there have been anything you could’ve done to help them? Probably not, as you wouldn’t have even been aware that the earthquake happened until you saw the paper the next morning. Today, however, technology has made the world a much smaller place, as information travels faster than ever before. Services, like Twitter, connect people across the globe, enabling them to speak their minds freely, understand each other and even help each other out. For example, in 2008, Berkeley student James Buck was arrested in Egypt while working on a project about the country’s anti-government groups. With no other way to communicate, he tweeted that he’d been arrested. Having read this tweet, his friends informed the dean of their school, who arranged a lawyer for Buck in Egypt. The result? He was freed. And the power of Twitter goes beyond just helping our friends when they’re in trouble. By using technology to connect with one another, we become global citizens out to do good for the whole world. This connection enables us to empathize with each other – and help others simply because it feels good to do so. For example, people hold “Twestivals” on Twitter to generate awareness of social causes – such as supporting homeless shelters and getting clean water to people in arid regions. Equally importantly, it’s used to raise the funds to do something about such problems. Another example can be found in Twitter’s support of projects like Product(RED), which partners with companies to raise money to fight AIDS. On World Aids Day, Twitter colored their interface red, a gesture which put Product(RED) on the map, ensuring that its name was universally known. This increased the impact of the project as other social media platforms reached out to assist them. The key message in this book: When you’re developing an idea, it’s important to set yourself limitations, as these are often a springboard for creativity. At the same time, you should be prepared to take big risks, and learn how to handle inevitable failures. Once you’ve realized your idea and created your product, continue perfecting it by being open to other people’s criticism and establishing win-win deals with partners, employees and users.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Jones","summary":"Having a career used to mean working for the same employer for many years, gradually advancing to the top. But times have changed. Modern careers are unpredictable, and most of us will have many jobs in the course of our lifetime. That means that it’s more important than ever to learn to negotiate change by becoming resilient and adaptable. Some people have a knack for these skills, but it’s up to the rest of us to learn them. Those who do, usually end up with a very particular mind-set – they think like an entrepreneur, seeking out new opportunities and coming up with new ideas. And they act like CEOs, taking responsibility, planning ahead and staying grounded in their core values. Beverly E. Jones presents a collection of 50 tips for cultivating both. The following blinks distill some of the best, with a focus on learning to manage crucial points of career changes like a pro. In these blinks, you’ll learn: why you need to have a plan on day one; why it’s crucial to keep it classy when you’re on your way out the door; and why rejecting a compliment is a missed opportunity. New beginnings are exciting, but a strong start requires more than just a positive outlook, something the author, Beverly E. Jones, learned the hard way. On her first day at a Washington law firm 30 years ago, she faced a surprisingly chilly reception. A senior partner even told her that he didn’t see why his colleagues had hired her. She would need to prove herself to get work inside the firm, he told her. She spent her first day with nothing to do – no one offered her any work, and she hadn’t prepared anything for herself. Things quickly got better, partly because she learned something from the disaster of the first day right away: no one else was going to make her successful – she had to do it herself. On day two, she had already begun planning ways to keep busy, manage clients and make others inside the firm aware of what she could do. These days, an employer would probably do a better job of onboarding you to a new job. But creating your own plan for success is still crucial, and a few tricks can help. Figure out what your boss wants. Keep an eye on her schedule, how she prefers to communicate, and what she needs to keep her bosses happy. How does she typically share information with both subordinates and superiors? Don’t expect to be told these things. As you start to settle in, set yourself realistic objectives that you can work toward in the short term. Prioritizing and achieving goals will help keep you on the right track. High-priority items can be included in this, but so can small, achievable things like scheduling introductory meetings with new colleagues. Put in an intense effort for four to six weeks, giving an extraordinary amount of focus to kickstarting your new endeavor. Clear your calendar to focus on work – it won’t be sustainable for the long term, but it doesn’t need to be. Set a deadline for transitioning back into a more normal life, satisfied that the intense work you’ve put in is a worthwhile upfront investment. This step isn’t likely to be easy but, as the CEO of your own career, laying the groundwork for future success is crucial. Meanwhile, keep an eye on your stress as you adjust to a new and unfamiliar environment. Take responsibility for managing this and be sure that you invest time in a fitness program that will help you stay cool-headed and energetic. The only person who can keep you healthy and functioning at your best is you. When Jones began working at her first law firm, it became clear that the successful lawyers were the ones who cultivated their own clients, behaving in effect like entrepreneurs within the larger firm. She learned to do likewise, which also meant marketing herself, doing plenty of billable work and keeping an eye on the bottom line by making sure that she brought in enough money to cover what it cost the firm to employ her. Over time, she realized that every large organization is a collection of small outfits. And those small outfits thrive when individual employees cultivate an entrepreneurial mind-set. There’s even a term for those who do this – intrapreneur. An intrapreneur takes initiative by handling what needs to be done whether or not they’re asked to do so. Intrapreneurs have the get-up-and-go to follow through with “first draft” ideas until they’re polished, profitable products. Anyone can cultivate an intrapreneurial mind-set, bringing a whole new vitality to an existing job. To do so, first, make sure that you understand the larger mission of the organization for which you work. This is pivotal, as an intrapreneur needs to set their goals and make plans to achieve them, something that needs to be in accord with collective strategies. The same goes for practical matters – you should have a grasp of the basic functions of your business and a mental picture of how those operate in your workplace. Understand the roles played by marketing and sales divisions, for example, and also how human resources and public affairs fit into the picture. Focus on the people you’re working for – your customers. This means the people who buy the products you create, and also people like your boss or coworkers who rely on your work to do theirs. What do these people want and need? How do they think? Finally, get comfortable with an entrepreneur’s familiar friend – failure. Entrepreneurs who succeed get used to learning from failure, which means that fear of it never stops them from taking chances or striving to innovate. Start easing your fear of failure by seeking out situations where there’s no guarantee you’ll succeed. If you’re a terrible dancer, for example, try signing up for a dance class. Go through the experience, enjoy what you can and see how little there is to fear in not excelling. Rejection is a rite of passage for people who strive for greatness, and yet most of us still struggle with it. Take Paul, one of the author's clients. He was turned down for his dream job despite being a highly qualified, high-achieving professional. He knew that he compared favorably to his main competition for the job, and he felt confident about his chances of being selected. When he found out that he hadn’t been chosen, Paul reported to the author that, aside from feeling intensely frustrated, he also felt angry about his frustration. These emotions, he thought, were not only unbecoming – they simply weren’t the right way to handle rejection. One of the techniques the author taught Paul was to take a closer look at his feelings through writing. At the author’s suggestion, he made notes about what he was experiencing, trying to describe things precisely. He distanced himself from the emotion by taking a detailed look at the pain he suffered. Another writing-based strategy that can help with rejection is to keep a gratitude journal, which helps tamp down negative thinking. Listing the things that you’re grateful about for just a few minutes each day can already have a big effect. For one thing, it helps keep worries at bay – feeling gratitude lessens activity in the part of the brain associated with anxiety. Finally, a game face and a gracious attitude can both help keep doors open in the future. In Paul’s case, it helped to talk honestly about his disappointment, and he was able to discuss with people like his partner and good friends, who supported him and helped him keep things in perspective. But it was equally important to maintain a professional demeanor with the rest of the world. Despite his disappointment, Paul made a point of thanking the people involved in the hiring process. This paid dividends later on when one of them reached out to him later on and helped him get a job that suited him even better than the one on which he’d missed out! Paul’s decisions helped him to be more resilient and find the silver lining in a tough setback. And he did so while taking responsibility for his process as a CEO would. That helped him to not just get through his tough spot, but to build up his capacity for handling similar challenges in the future. It’s hard to build something in the middle of change. But like it or not, change happens – transitions, mergers, acquisitions and liquidations are all part of the landscape in the professional world. One of the author’s mentees, Andrea, is an expert at surviving and thriving in uncertain times. Some of her tips will keep you from freezing up when change is blowing in. For one thing, Andrea is always ready for change because she thinks like a CEO. That means she’s focused on the big picture, making sure that she understands her industry and the factors that affect it. This means keeping an eye on the market she works in, the regulatory framework of her industry, changes in the political environment and innovations on the horizon. Knowing all this helps Andrea see change coming and be prepared when it arrives. Seeing the big picture also keeps her from thinking that change is all about her, rather than what it is – temporary and impersonal. This means that instead of getting upset and resorting to complaining, she can stay focused on dealing with the situation at hand. Staying on an even keel is even easier when you’ve cultivated stability in your life outside of work. For Andrea, this means balancing her busy work schedule with staying active in her church and connected to friends, family and mentors. It also means avoiding financial pressure, which would make losing her job a disaster. Following Andrea’s example means thinking twice about big expenditures, like a large house. It can also mean developing avenues for additional income – perhaps something like part-time work or consulting – which further reduce financial pressure. Building an emergency fund can have the same effect, letting you know that you have a safety net. There’s another benefit to this, too. The author has noticed that clients who start a new side enterprise often bring fresh energy to their main job. What better way to boost your capacity for entrepreneurial thinking than starting something yourself? Let’s face it – taking a compliment can be tough. The author used to believe that modesty was the polite response to praise. As a young professional, she even downplayed her work if someone praised it, saying that it was nothing, or that credit belonged elsewhere. But brushing aside a compliment can devalue your accomplishments. The complimenter might believe you when you say “no big deal,” leading them to reassess the value of what you’ve done. It also robs you both of an opportunity – after all, a compliment is more than just a positive assessment. It’s also an enjoyable moment that makes both people feel good, so chances are that the person approaching you with a compliment is feeling positive about it. By rejecting her praise, you’re knocking the wind out of her sails rather than reinforcing her good mood. You’re also denying yourself the benefit of a compliment, which is like a little reward for your brain. What’s more, research has shown that it’s a reward that will boost your performance – if you accept it! Using feedback to connect professionally is a vital element to thinking like an entrepreneur – one that will keep you from feeling isolated as you operate independently. So be sure that you can take on board whatever positivity that connection offers you! The good news is that handling praise gracefully can be learned. There are five basic steps. First, accept the compliment. Even if it’s difficult, and you feel like you don’t deserve it, start by saying “thank you.” Then show your satisfaction with the work. It’s not immodest to extend the pleasant moment that starts when you say “thanks.” You can always acknowledge that you’re happy with how your work came out by saying, for example, that you’re proud of the outcome. The flip side to taking pride in your contribution, of course, is to remember to include others. Don’t forget to pass the credit around to those who helped make things happen. If it was really a team effort, acknowledge it as such. Then give something back, if you can be sincere about it. Fake praise does no one any good. But if the person giving the compliment played a part in your success, mention something about that. When the exchange runs its course, don’t prolong it. If the compliments continue past a comfortable point, there’s nothing wrong with lightly cutting things off – say you’re about to blush, for example, and move on. As a teenager, the author had a serious tea-drinking habit, and she always added lots of sugar. She knew it was unhealthy, but drinking tea without that added sweetness seemed impossible. One day, inspiration struck, and she removed a few grains of sugar from a heaping spoonful. In the days that followed, she removed a few more. Over the course of a year, she gradually reduced the amount of sugar on her spoon until she could drink sugarless tea. The Sugar Grain Principle of incremental change has been helping her achieve things ever since, and it eventually led to the Sugar Grain Process, the author’s five-step process for tackling career change. The first step is to visualize the career you want – just as the author visualized drinking tea without sugar. List the things you’d like to see in the next chapter of your career, starting with the pros and cons of what you’re presently doing. Next, define some general, achievable goals that will bring you closer to your wish list – things like “manage stress better” or “hone technical expertise.” Three goals are generally realistic to start with. Third, try to think of some “sugar grains” for each goal – small items that will lead you in the right direction. Don’t call these “steps” – the point isn’t that they form a direct path, but rather that they help you get active and build momentum. One grain often leads to another, so be open to that. If the first grain is attending a function, and you meet someone inspiring there, the next might be to get in touch with that person. The fourth step is setting your pace. Knowing what you want to accomplish should give you an idea of how fast you’ll need to move; if your goal isn’t time-sensitive then there’s no rush and one sugar grain a week might be plenty. What’s important is that you pick a pace and stick to it – the process works because you commit to keeping a steady and consistent pace. Finally, keep a record of the process. That’ll help you mark your progress, and you’ll probably find that examining your record will offer novel insights and new ideas for sugar grains. Eventually, you’ll find that the process and the nimble, entrepreneurial mind-set that it encourages are building their own momentum – you may even miss your sugar grains once you reach your goal! One of the author’s consulting clients, “Bill,” was let go from his law firm with little notice and a small severance payment. A group he was part of had quit the firm and taken their clients with them. In the resulting turmoil, Bill was fired. Bill was shocked and angry, but he also took the time to look at things objectively. He didn’t know colleagues outside of his former group well, so most would probably only remember him for having been laid off. Determined to change that, he contacted leaders and staff at the firm and found a way to thank them for anything he could without being insincere – things like training they’d given him, or their contributions to a positive work environment. Then, over the years, he did his best to stay in touch. These actions changed the impression of him that lingered after he’d gone, to such great effect that one day he was even re-hired as a partner! Leaving a good impression on the way out is something anyone can do, and it’s just the kind of quick pivot in a tough situation that exemplifies the behavior of a CEO. Learning to do this starts with a few simple strategies: First, let your boss know right away when you’ve committed to a new opportunity. It may be uncomfortable to break the news, but it’s better to do it before she hears things secondhand. On the way out, don’t be overly frank. Everyone fantasizes about saying what they really think on the way out the door, but it’s more important to end things on a good note. Even in an exit interview, it pays to watch what you say – you can’t always count on word not getting around. When it comes to your actual work, tie things up neatly. Finish things or get them as close to completion as possible. Leave detailed notes that will help your successor or your coworkers take over your responsibilities. Then take time to thank people. Consider those who have helped you or contributed to your success, and let them know. Be honest and as specific as possible. Handwritten notes are a great way to do this, as is a personal visit. Finally, make it possible to stay in contact. Make sure your contact information is widely known and connect with people on LinkedIn while there’s still time. If you want to keep in touch with people in the future, don’t leave it to chance. The key message in these blinks: Careers are no longer “one size fits all,” and most of us will have our fair share of departures and fresh starts in the course of our working lives. That means it’s vital that we get comfortable with change and learn to be resilient to anything that comes our way, as well as being nimble when we recognize opportunity. An entrepreneurial mind-set and a CEO’s resolve can help us ensure that, no matter what the situation, we’re grounded and prepared for anything, making the most of the opportunities at our disposal. Actionable advice: Do a little something every day. Once you have a goal, don't wait until you've got a master plan to start working toward it. Instead, take small steps every day – regular action will help you get the ball rolling. You can always let a plan form once you’ve got some momentum going. Got feedback?

Whether it’s making hasty decisions that you regret just a few minutes later, or blocking all the good ideas out, sometimes it feels like our minds are working against us! Well, thankfully it’s not that extreme. Most of our mind’s evil tricks can be controlled and turned into advantages – after all, if other people have the same tripwires, knowing how to overcome yours can be the key to understanding those around you. Thinking inside the box is a problem that almost everyone struggles with. It’s a cliché that springs from corporate culture in the 1960s and 1970s, but it refers to real phenomena in our minds. These blinks explain what it means to think inside the box and gives a simple and straightforward step-by-step approach to busting out of it. In these blinks, you’ll discover how to avoid tunnel vision; why we’ll have to re-think our image of the world as round; and how pens almost killed Bic. How many times have you been asked to “think outside the box”? While this sage advice has been around for almost half a century, it’s much easier said than done. In part, this is because of the way we think. Mental models – or “boxes” – enable us to process and make sense of our complex reality. Our mind is constantly developing simplified models of the world, sorting information into categories and patterns while also developing more sophisticated constructions like rules and paradigms. Without these models, we would lose our ability to think efficiently. In fact, it’s impossible to reason without boxes – that’s just how our brain works. If you live in Germany, for example, you’ve learned to associate light beige cars with taxis, i.e., you’ve created a “box” for taxis. While you know that not all vehicles of that color will offer you a ride, you can nonetheless rule out numerous non-taxi cars in your search for a ride from point A to point B. If you travel to New York City, however, you won’t linger in a boxless void for long. Almost instantly, you will develop a new box based on the new information from your environment, and thus keep a keen eye out for a yellow car if you need a lift. See, there isn’t just “the box.” Rather, there are multiple boxes, all of which are shaped by your identity – and your identity’s like a series of boxes, too. You can be comprised of an infinite combination of identities – for example, an IT specialist, an Australian, a woman and so on – and thus there is an infinite number of boxes outside your specific worldview. Boxes are the buttress for our capacity to think; you can’t avoid them. Once you step out of one, you’ll simply find yourself in another. So if leaving one box simply means entering another, how can you ever “think outside the box”? Well, you don’t. Rather, innovation requires you to develop entirely new boxes. If you don’t develop new boxes, you run the risk of suffering the damaging side effects of established boxes: tunnel vision. Tunnel vision occurs when you lose the awareness that your individual perception of the world is merely an interpretation based on a subjective sample of information. After all, it’s your perception – you can’t have anyone else’s. What you perceive is not some objective reality, nor is it even the best guess at what an interpretation of our complex reality should look like, and believing your box is the right one constrains the realm of the thinkable. For example, just think about how long it took people to accept the idea that, despite their subjective inference that the Earth was flat, it’s actually spherical. And in 2011, our understanding of Earth as a round globe was once again dethroned, this time by a more potato-shaped model. And that model will also need to be adapted as rotation and gravity change the landscape of the Earth. This tunnel vision can be severely damaging for creative thinking. Just look at Bic, a company that up to the 1970s defined itself as a manufacturer of plastic ballpoint pens. But defining themselves in terms of ballpoint pens was too constricting: their only opportunities for innovation were limited to different colors and designs! If we can overcome tunnel vision, we can create new boxes that offer a range of fresh possibilities. Replacing the “flat Earth” box with the “globe” box meant that people believed it was impossible to fall off the Earth, thus giving them the confidence to sail all around the world and explore other continents. And when Bic altered its self-perception from a pen producer to a plastic products producer, it was suddenly able to branch out into a wider array of products from lighters to razors and even cell phones. So how can we break free from conventional thinking and build new boxes? The following blinks hold the answer. If your “train of thought” were an actual train, would you be a passenger or the conductor? Developing an awareness of boxes and the limitations they place on our thinking is the first step to getting into the engine room and taking control. Start with the simple understanding that sticking to the familiar will always feel right. The human mind tends to cling to its existing set of boxes, unconsciously accepting information that confirms our worldviews and discarding contradictory information. This, of course, makes it difficult to adjust our perspective. For example, when Dick Fosbury set a new Olympic record for the high jump in 1968, he was ridiculed for his unconventional technique. Although jumping backward enabled him to jump higher than anybody else, people simply felt he was doing it wrong. Guess what: Since 1976 no one has won a gold medal in high jump without using the appropriately named Fosbury Flop! Second, realize that the human mind has an unreliable default setting. We’re all routinely fooled by a phenomenon called cognitive bias, i.e., the subconscious programming that causes us to favor simple intuition at the expense of objective analysis. As a consequence, we make logical errors and often miscalculate probability, value or risk. To illustrate this, imagine a frozen pond in winter. Most people would feel more secure skating on the ice if they could see others out there doing the same. Yet their intuition couldn’t be more wrong: it’s less risky to skate alone, without the additional weight. Furthermore, as research in behavioral economics has shown, cognitive biases also affect our financial and business decisions. Investors, for example, tend to hold on to stocks even after they’ve fallen below acquisition price rather than to recognize the loss and cut ties with a losing stock. As we’ve seen, boxes simultaneously enable and constrain our thinking. But once you are aware that all our subjective and collective models of the world, i.e., our boxes, are necessarily incomplete, you can then examine your own boxes. Recognizing and challenging your boxes is the key to creating new ones. Ask yourself and your colleagues about key values, objectives, hopes and fears in order to identify which boxes you’re stuck in and which beliefs and assumptions might be holding you back. There are no “right” or “wrong” boxes. Rather, you must ask yourself: Will this box still be useful tomorrow? For decades, it was understood that male teenagers and young adults were the target market for video games. No one questioned this assumption. After all, why change a winning concept? Well, because a game company could easily triple their customer base by including other demographics such as women, senior citizens and preschoolers, that’s why! But if video game companies aren’t aware of this box, then they can’t transcend its limitations. Even when innovators do create new boxes, these new paradigms won’t last for eternity. Say, for example, that a video game company has successfully tapped into new target groups, such as women and toddlers. Good job! However, in the meantime, the company’s most loyal customers, the male adolescents, have changed: they’ve grown up. What do they want to play now? Answering this question will require a new box. Never forget that even the greatest new idea is destined to become obsolete one day. No matter how thoroughly and deliberately you develop your boxes, you will always have to come back to square one and start all over again. The world won’t stop changing, and we must constantly adapt our mental models of it to keep or even set the pace. The idea that great innovations come from geniuses who find inspiration from within is romantic, but bogus. As we’ve seen, we’re unlikely to come up with any game-changing ideas if we just let our minds run on autopilot. For this reason, we need to be diligent in gathering information to remove the blinders imposed by your old boxes. The authors identify areas where we need to gather information: the global environment (society, economics, science, etc.); your industry, field or area (customers, competitors and so on); and your company, team or context (things like products and organization). The goal of this step is to generate questions, not find answers. To illustrate this process, let’s take another look at the video game industry, this time following the fictional company Ultragames. Concerning global trends, Ultragames is affected by an aging consumer base along with the evolution of the internet and mobile technology. The company always operated under the assumption that gamers were predominantly male teenagers and young men, yet after investigating new data on their industry, they’ve discovered that the average gamer’s age has risen to 37 and that women now comprise 42 percent of the industry’s customer base. Then, to gather data in the company sphere, Ultragames conducts a survey on its products. It reveals that the emerging adult gamer demographic is less concerned with price, and more interested in Ultragames’ “no sex, no violence” policy, as it makes it easy to find and purchase games for their kids. Now that they’ve got the data, it’s time to develop some questions. One such question Ultragames might ask after pondering this new information is: How can we develop products that appeal to all ages without compromising our family-friendly values? Imagine you’re a gold digger in Yukon in the nineteenth century. You wouldn’t expect to find a nugget in your first 30 pans of sand, would you? The reality is that you’ll be standing over the water for a long time before you catch gold. The same goes for finding innovative ideas. At this stage, your objective is to come up with a wide range of possible new boxes. It’s important not to limit your creativity by discarding ideas before they have a chance to develop. Go into this exercise with the assumption that there are no such things as bad ideas, and encourage your team to look at your problem from all possible angles, even if they might seem crazy or far-fetched. For example, when NASA was trying to develop a way to land on alien planets with minimal contamination from terrestrial chemicals, they surely didn’t envision their multi-billion dollar spacecraft landing on the planet by bouncing around in a shell made of airbags. Yet that’s how Pathfinder ended up landing on Mars in 1997. Once you have a sizeable collection of ideas, it’s time to evaluate them using clearly defined criteria. Your assessments should never be made on intuition, but rather by means of a methodology that prevents the cognitive biases that limit your imagination. But which criteria should you use? Some, such as budget constraints, technological feasibility or government regulations, are relevant for all businesses. Others are more individual, like your brand image, your areas of expertise, the targeted timeframe, and so on. Ultragames, for example, might feel that developing individual games for each new market segment is too costly. They need an idea that would satisfy their financial criteria and also compliment their family-friendly corporate identity, such as educational games for all ages. You may have to repeat these two steps several times before you hit gold. Once you have, remember that you should doubt even your winning ideas! Now that you’ve learned how to break free from confining boxes, our final blinks will show you how to create the most innovative ideas for your business. Imagine your business as a house of cards: if you want to remodel, your mental programming limits you to only working on the upper floor for fear that the whole house will come crumbling down. This comes at the expense of radical transformation, as you are not able to touch the foundations upon which your company was built. But it is in challenging the most fundamental aspects of your business that you find the most creative potential. Think back to Bic’s defining moment. They could have created more superficial boxes, for example, by manufacturing all kinds of pens instead of just ballpoint, or even plastic office supplies. Instead, they went for an even bigger box: any disposable plastic item. Other companies have made similarly grand transformations by creating new, big boxes. Nintendo, for example, made playing cards before switching to video consoles, and LG evolved from an industrial chemical producer to a manufacturer of high-tech appliances. When you dare to fundamentally shift your perception, it unleashes a cascade of new ideas, and you’ll discover that each box is a box within a box within a box. For example, Bic’s new concept contains all the boxes we mentioned previously (pens and plastic office supplies), including its original product. Once they created a new big box that defined who they were as a company, they could fill it with medium-sized boxes, and fill those with smaller ones, thus generating a whole range of new products. Similarly, Nintendo’s shift in self-perception opened the door to video game production, merchandising and even a movie. Thinking big isn’t easy when it comes to building new boxes. Nevertheless, if you can create big enough boxes, you will significantly broaden your scope of possibilities. What’s the difference between companies that get left behind by revolutionary changes and those that profit from or even spearhead them? In short: Their ability to change boxes in real time. Long term success in business requires you to keep your mind open to many possible futures. Beware of the ever-lurking trap of tunnel vision: all too often, we plan for one vision of the future – one that is likely based on our present understanding. In other words, we use predictive thinking to prepare for the future. We should, in contrast, employ prospective thinking, which asks: What could happen? What could I make happen? By imagining multiple possible scenarios, your business can stay flexible and well prepared with not only a plan A, but also plans B and C. When planning for the future, there are two kinds of reasoning available: deduction and induction. With deduction, we take an existing box and sort information into it. For example, you might ask: “What are the most important trends that will affect our industry?” The problem with this type of reasoning is that the range of possible answers is limited, and focuses too much on what is presently known. Induction, in contrast, works the other way around: you take information and try to find a box for it. Inductive thinking asks questions that have an unlimited set of answers, inspiring creativity by moving away from commonly shared associations. For example, you might ask: “How could scenario XY become the most important trend affecting our industry in the future?” This approach allows you to discover opportunities other competitors simply don’t have on their radars, i.e., truly innovative approaches. As an example, consider that executives from the high-quality glass industry would likely agree that developing screens for mobile communication devices would be among the most important market innovations in the foreseeable future. But wouldn’t it be better to start a technological revolution while everyone else is competing for a piece of that pie? Like developing materials that make glass obsolete? Or something entirely different? The key message in this book: It’s exceedingly difficult to see beyond our own limited perspective. But we’ll have to if we want to think creatively. To stimulate creative thinking, we must constantly challenge our worldview – the “boxes” that encapsulate what we believe to be possible – and apply methods that keep our subconscious from sabotaging us.  Actionable advice: Dare to err!  A fear of failure will limit you to only obtaining the low-hanging fruit – the safe, obvious and ordinary ideas. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes! It’s the only way you can break out of your current, confining boxes and develop new ones that inspire innovation!

Each time a customer settles into the driver’s seat, she will see your brand logo on the steering wheel, reminding her of the company whose product she’s using – your company. And if you sell phones, shirts or books, the story is much the same: your product is a subtle reminder of your company. But what if you sell haircuts, bus rides or some other, less physical product – in other words, what if you offer services? How do you go about designing those? What should you keep in mind? What keeps customers coming back for more? These blinks explain the basic principles of successful service design and provide you with methods and tools to enhance your service. You will learn how to create a good service experience, how to interact with your customers and how to make those customers come back for more. In these blinks, you’ll learn why quantitative data cannot distinguish between Prince Charles and Ozzy Osbourne; why service design is like making a movie; and why the service experience begins well before you offer your actual service. What is service design? Well, there’s no single definition; it’s an evolving and interdisciplinary approach that combines multiple methods and tools to design new services. However, there are five common principles that most everyone agrees on. The first is that the process of service design should be user-centered. Or, to put it another way, when designing a service, the customer should be treated as a crucial piece of the process. Unlike a physical product, a service is a process – an interaction between the service provider and the service user, the customer. So any successful service will recognize the customer as a central part of the process. For instance, let’s look at a public transportation service, such as a bus. This is a valuable public service that benefits countless customers; the service would be of little value, however, if the bus didn’t stop at and travel to locations convenient to these customers. Okay, so what if you’re trying to design a successful service of your own. There’s one pitfall, in particular, to be wary of: an overreliance on quantitative data, such as statistics. Statistics are undoubtedly a great source of information, especially for discovering popular trends, such as when during the day people are most in need of a bus, but this isn’t enough to provide a valuable service. Let’s say there are two people with very similar traits. They’re both married and financially successful men, they’re both around 70 years old, and they were both born in the United Kingdom. But based on these statistics alone, you wouldn’t know which one is Prince Charles and which one is Ozzy Osbourne, and it goes without saying that these men are quite different from one another. This should remind you that no two customers are exactly alike. Each one has a culture, a set of habits, a range of motivations. If you want to fully understand your customer base, you can’t underestimate these differences; this qualitative information must be considered in combination with statistics in your efforts for a successful service design. When creating and designing a new service, it’s important to involve not only customers in the process but other stakeholders as well. This brings us to the second principle of service design: it should be a co-creative process. A stakeholder is anyone who’s involved with the service – including managers, marketers and engineers, as well as possible private organizations and governmental agencies. Of course, customers can also be counted as stakeholders. All these people should have a direct or indirect say in the creative process of service design since they all play an important role in the successful development, operation and usage of the service. If providing a public-transportation service, you’d need to cooperate with an array of individuals: government officials to make sure you adhere to regulations, engineers who could confirm that your buses are safe and perhaps a marketing firm to promote the new service. These are just a few of the people you might need to consider for your co-creative environment. The purpose of such an environment is to ensure that all your stakeholders’ needs are accounted for, which shouldn’t be seen as a burden since each stakeholder has the potential to contribute valuable expertise and ideas. The third principle of service design is sequencing, that is, the sequence – or timeline – of providing a service. You can think of sequencing like a movie. Every movie is made up of a series of still frames that, when put together and played in sequence, tell the story of the movie. As all movies are composed of a sequence of still frames, all services are composed of a sequence of touchpoints or interactions; when put together, they form the complete service. Sequencing is helpful because it allows you to break down each step of the user experience – all the interactions, all the touchpoints – to get a detailed overview. Details that might otherwise be overlooked often get caught in the sequencing process. For instance, if you were opening a new barbershop, a service-design sequence will make it clear that the floor needs sweeping between each customer, and that you should provide things, such as magazines or TVs to keep customers comfortable if they arrive early. Now that we’ve covered the first three principles of service design let’s turn to the last two – evidencing and holistic thinking. When designing a service, it’s good to think of a tangible item, or physical evidence, for your service. This is something that can prolong the service and act as a reminder for a customer after they’ve used the service – a sort of service souvenir, if you will. Tourists and travelers bring home evidence from their trips in the form of coffee mugs, snow globes or postcards that depict the places they’ve been, whether it’s a hotel, the French Riviera or Niagara Falls. Your service souvenir should function similarly. It should extend the experience into a post-service period and remind your customers of the great time they had, thus increasing the chances that they’ll become return customers. Finally, to help you see the complete, big picture of your service, it’s time to take a holistic approach. So far, we’ve mostly covered methods to help you see every tiny detail of your service, the goal being to overlook nothing. But it’s just as important not to get lost in the details and fail to see the grand design. For example, you might be thinking a lot about what people see – but don’t forget what they hear, smell and even taste while interacting with your service. All of these senses can ultimately play a part. Going back to the barbershop, customers are sure to be affected by the interior design, so rather than having harsh colors, you might want to choose a calming pastel. Thinking holistically will also help you see the potential for alternative sequences that could improve how the service begins, ends or unfolds. For instance, what if there was always a pot of freshly brewed coffee in your barbershop? Customers would not only have the option to enjoy a cup; the fresh brew would also fill the shop with a pleasant aroma. Talk about making a good first impression. Now that we’ve covered the five principles of service-design thinking, it’s time to break out the toolbox. You’ll remember that the third principle of service-design thinking is to make the process co-creative and to consider input from all stakeholders. But sometimes this is easier said than done. A stakeholder map, the first tool in the toolbox, can obviate confusion. A stakeholder map provides a visual representation of every stakeholder that is involved with your service. It shows every manager, marketer, government agent and employee. You can generate this map by making a thorough list that includes every possible stakeholder along with a notation of what that stakeholder’s relationships is to the service and to all other stakeholders. You can then draw lines and use symbols to illustrate those connections, making a visual guide that allows you to fully grasp the complexity of your service. The map can also use circles of influence, centered around a bull’s-eye. The closer a stakeholder is to the bull’s-eye, the more influence the stakeholder has. A stakeholder map was of great help when the service-design company DesignThinkers was working with the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Specifically, they were working with the NL Agency, a troubled department that was in charge of a policy aimed at building better relations between the government and international business. DesignThinkers was hired to help the NL Agency reach their goals, and they used a stakeholder map to help figure out why the agency was running into problems. The map was a great asset. It allowed the team to consider the complex relationships between all the businesses and government agents and how they affected the work. The map made it clear why the agency was mired in conflict and confusion: the managers were spending too much time dealing with confused staff that were trying to follow agency orders as well as those from the influential outside forces. This allowed the NL Agency to refocus on what was truly important: the customers, businesses and educational institutions that the agency was designed to help. A stakeholder map isn’t the only tool that can help you see the big picture of your service. There’s also a tool called the customer journey map that works as a great visual aid for service designers. A customer journey map can be created by listing and connecting all of the touchpoints and interactions that you make with a customer. Here, it’s important to reach out to customers and ask them about their experiences to make sure you get each and every part of their journey. After all, they’re the real experts. So, for your barbershop, did you note the very first interaction, when they noticed your service online? How was their next experience, when they made their appointment over the phone? What happened once they arrived at the shop? Did they find the location easily? Did they like the coffee and magazines that were offered? And were they happy with the haircut and payment options? These are just a few of the possible interactions that can make up a customer journey map, and when you visualize all these touchpoints in a timeline, they can provide valuable insight, as well as opportunities for improvement. Let’s say that your number one complaint is that customers feel like they have to wait too long to receive service. They don’t appreciate having to sit around while you make coffee and sweep the floor in between customers. With the help of a customer journey map, you could easily figure out how to improve their experience and change some of these individual touchpoints. And since the map presents the full picture, you’ll know how a change might affect the other interactions to which they’re connected. So maybe you need to hire another member of staff to sweep and make coffee, allowing you to see customers earlier. In this way, a customer journey map is a tool for seeing both the big picture and each of the individual touchpoints, which is necessary if you’re going to successfully improve your service. Whether you’re hoping to make a big improvement or just a small one – like redesigning your website – a customer journey map will show just how that improvement will affect all the other aspects of your service. The key message in this book: Service-design thinking is a dynamic process that includes not only the service providers and their customers but also all the service’s stakeholders. It’s about paying attention to every little detail as well as seeing the big picture of the overall customer experience. In short, there’s a whole lot more to service design than just a transaction with a customer. Actionable advice: Use questionnaires to learn more about your customers. Next time you want to collect more qualitative information about your customer base, use a questionnaire. For example, say you’re designing a new bus service. To learn more about your customers, send out a questionnaire about their preferences and motivations. This way, you could find out whether they prefer to listen to music, read or chat while on the bus. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Now picture a tank arriving beside the car, its tracks easily gripping the ground, propelling the tank through the mire with no problem at all. What’s the difference between the tank and the car? Traction. It doesn’t matter how good your product is, or how high you rev the engine: if it isn’t equipped to tackle the tough conditions where new companies fight for a market share, it’ll never lift itself out of the mire. So is your start-up going to be a tank or a car? These blinks explain the authors’ key insights into the traction channels that will become your start-up’s caterpillar tracks, propelling you ahead of the crowd. After reading these blinks, you’ll learn why having a good product won’t guarantee your start-up’s success; how Google’s early partnership strategy won it more users; and how to use social media for traction without annoying people on Twitter. Countless start-ups launch every day, but only a fraction succeed. Why? The answer lies in traction: the growth of customer demand for a product. Traction is crucial because the defining metric for any start-up is its growth rate, and this growth can only be driven by a corresponding growth in consumer demand. However, the amount of traction your company needs depends on the stage it’s reached. Early on, even a handful of new customers count as traction, but by the time you have a customer base of 10,000, only increments of thousands will work. Another key to understanding traction is that it isn’t just about a good product; it also depends on solid marketing strategy. Many mistakenly think that a great product is all that’s needed to attract customers. However, this is almost never true. Your product needs to be marketed to the right audience in the right way. Nonetheless, what you’re selling is still important. Split your time 50/50 between product development and traction. By devoting time to traction early on, you’ll also get valuable feedback that will help you further develop your products. For example, when Dropbox started out, they tested search engine marketing but quickly realized it was too expensive: gaining a single customer cost twice the amount they made from a subscription! Luckily, they had time to experiment with cheaper and more effective viral marketing strategies. A final advantage of thinking about traction early on is that it builds useful experience and allows you to grow quickly once the product is ready. For example, marketing software company Marketo started blogging about their product long before it was fully developed. This led to a better product thanks to the feedback they received, but also resulted in a ready-made customer base of 14,000 buyers on the day they launched. So how does your start-up build traction? Read on to learn about proven techniques. How do you start building traction? The key is to create a traction channel, that is, a way to market or distribute your product. In order to achieve this, consider both traditional public relations, like stories in newspapers, and unconventional PR, like flash mobs centered on your product. Let’s first examine traditional media. Think of it as a food chain with small blogs at the bottom. In order to get broad coverage, you don’t call the big fish like CNN directly. Instead, approach smaller blogs and perhaps one of the bigger news sites will pick up on the story, resulting in lots of attention. This technique worked for DonorsChoose.org, which allows teachers to raise money for things like gadgets for science classes. The company was first noticed by a few small, local media outlets, and the resulting coverage attracted the attention of Newsweek. And then, when someone on Oprah Winfrey’s team saw the Newsweek piece, the website appeared on Winfrey’s annual Favorite Things list – which brought many new sponsors to DonorsChoose. Another route to media coverage is unconventional PR. This could mean techniques like flash mobs or creative customer appreciation gestures. This can be a great traction channel because it never gets boring and can attract a lot of attention. However, make sure that your quirky idea isn’t misunderstood. What makes one person laugh could offend someone else – or simply not attract very much attention. On the other hand, if you’re hoping to reach a broader demographic, think about traditional offline advertisements such as radio, TV and billboards. This can actually be done quite cheaply by advertising in local media or digging for remnant advertising – unused ad space which can carry discounts of up to 90 percent. This is especially good in targeting an older audience that might not engage with technology as frequently. Unfortunately, however, the success rate of offline advertisements is difficult to track. Social media isn’t just for sharing pictures of what you ate for lunch; it can also get your start-up a lot of traction. The first way to achieve traction through social media is via viral marketing: encouraging your existing users to refer new ones. Once you start the ball rolling, it gathers its own momentum. It’s all about encouraging your users to refer other users to you – and ultimately growing your customer base in an exponential way. Viral marketing is cheap and fast, but it can also be difficult to pull off. There are two factors that make it successful. First, you need as many people to recommend your product as possible. One way to achieve this is to give your existing users incentives. Dropbox, for example, offered users more storage space if they referred a friend. Second, you need to maximize the number of referrals who go on to become users. This happens by making it as quick and easy as possible for referrals to buy or use your product. So make your sign-up process simple and fast. In-house blogs are another avenue for growing traction. Not only do they allow you to communicate with and show your product to potential users, they are also great for soliciting feedback. While company blogs keep devoted customers engaged, it can take a while to build up a reader base for them. So instead, consider sponsoring a third-party blog that your customers already like, in order to gain attention. The goal is to build a community of users, which is ultimately how you achieve traction and ensure a stable customer base. Devoted users are more likely to refer others to your product and you don’t have to worry about losing them to the competition. They’re also a great way to generate product-development ideas. So, in order to foster a strong community, give users opportunities to interact. Encourage friendly but honest communication via social media, blog comments, forums or even at parties and meet-ups! How can online advertising help you gain traction? The first factors to consider are Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Optimization (SEO). Let’s start with SEM: These are the ads displayed next to search engine results. So when someone does a related search, they see your ad and are informed about your product. For example, if your company produces Danish backpacks, it’d be a good idea to have ads appear anytime someone searches for “Danish backpacks” on Google. You pay for each time a user clicks on your ad. One way to decrease costs is to target long, specific search phrases, as they will help narrow down the people clicking on your ads to only those who are truly interested. SEO, on the other hand, involves pushing your website to the top of the results people get when they search for related words. This is important because data shows that only ten percent of all clicks happen beyond the tenth search result. Take, for example, that Danish backpack manufacturer. It currently only appears on page three of the Google search results for “best backpacks.” The manufacturer should engage in SEO by adding that crucial keyword “backpacks” to more parts of the site, or adding more precise search terms that highlight what's unique about their product, like “backpacks from Denmark,\" as this will improve its search engine rankings. In addition to search engines, social and display ads also raise awareness. Display ads, also known as banner ads, appear on websites and target all visitors to the site, in a similar fashion to a traditional print advertisement, although with added clickability and a younger audience reach. Similarly, social ads appear on social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter. Since most people use these sites for pleasure, it’s best practice to use social ads to start a conversation that guides attention toward your product rather than making a hard sell, as this would most likely just annoy users. For example, eyeglasses maker Warby Parker encourages customers to try glasses on, take a photo wearing them and then post it on their social networks. This way the company doesn’t pay for advertising but still gains attention while its customers have fun. You wouldn’t start a business without a support network, so why market without one? Partnering with other companies in a mutually beneficial way is called business development, and it’s a clever way to build traction. Google is a great example of a company that leveraged partnerships to become a worldwide success. In 1999, it partnered with Netscape and Yahoo! by becoming the default search engine for the former and improving the search results of the latter. It was a win-win situation, as Google enhanced these sites’ search capabilities and itself gained many new users itself in the process. Other collaborative ways to get traction include attending trade shows, speaking engagements and other offline events. Trade shows are oriented toward the latest product innovations in an industry, but they also attract people who might help with your next step. For example, bicycle brake manufacturer SlidePad Technologies began attending trade shows before their product was even ready, and landed a deal with major bike manufacturer Janis. While they didn’t have a final product to show, they met Janis executives at a trade show and learned what they needed to do to form a partnership. SlidePad then met those requirements and eventually partnered with the bigger company – enabling them to get traction and reach thousands of customers! Other offline events like conferences, meet-ups and parties are also a great way to find people and promote your product. For example, Twitter promoted itself at the SXSW conference in 2007 by putting TVs showing live tweets in the conference hallways. By the end of the week, their traffic had jumped from 20,000 to over 60,000 tweets. Another way to capitalize on these offline events is to take on speaking engagements. Not only does this improve your speaking and management skills, it also spreads awareness of your product. Sometimes the most obvious methods are also the most effective. Email, for example, is still a powerful traction channel for reaching customers, especially those who’ve expressed interest in your product. It’s personal and gets you the undivided attention of prospective buyers. However, it’s important to differentiate your emails from unsolicited spam. Find legitimate ways of attaining email addresses, such as asking for them on your blog or at the end of a conference. That way, when you reach out with product improvements or other news, your customers will want to share it – further improving their connection with your company, and improving your traction! Another avenue to consider is traditional sales: approaching customers and proposing the direct exchange of products for money. This personal traction channel works especially well for expensive products. That’s because personal contact builds trust, so potential customers are willing to spend more on your product. The best way to approach sales is to get people you know to be your first customers. But if that’s not possible, cold calling, or contacting unknown people who might be interested, will have to be done. In either scenario, the key to success is to thoroughly prepare what you want to say thoroughly. And ultimately, the goal of any good sales strategy is that it is durable and works for future customers too. To that end, ask yourself: How do customers make purchasing decisions? What common questions do they ask? How do you address their concerns? And what are the most effective ways to influence their decisions during a pitch? These questions form the basis for a solid sales strategy. As you now know, there are multiple traction channels. Read on to learn which one is best for you. Each of these traction channels have proven effective for different companies, but which is the best for you? Well, it’s important to keep an open mind – don’t rule anything out in the very beginning. Try the Bullseye Framework, a five-step tool to find the best traction channel for you: One: start by brainstorming all the different traction channels in your industry, and how you might use them with your particular product. Ask yourself questions like: Where would we get potential customers’ email addresses? Which companies would we partner with and why? Two: put all the channels into one of three groups: really promising ones, possible ones and long shots. Three: choose the three top options and put them on your A-list. Four: test these three options. Try to keep the tests cheap because you’re just exploring. Consider these questions: How much will you spend in order to gain one customer with this channel? How many customers can you get this way? And are those the customers you want and need? Five: focus on the channel that seems the most promising, or repeat the process if none of the channels seem to be working. Remember also that the right channels for you may change as your business develops. Think of your business’ lifecycle in three phases: product development, marketing and scaling. In principle the goal for every traction channel remains the same – increasing the customer base – but what this means in practice will change. In the first phase you might be happy just to generate some interest in your product, but in phase two you’ll need to generate thousands of customers, so this narrows your channel options. So just as you’d review your business plan as your company grows, review your traction channels periodically too. Traction will determine the success of your start-up. This is why you should take some time to develop a well-thought-out strategy. To do so, set clear and specific goals and frame your overall strategy around it. For example, when DuckDuckGo wanted to become a serious player in the search engine market, the company determined its traction goals, including the number of people it wanted to be using their product as their primary search engine, and how many searches per month should be completed (in their case, 100 million). You may also find traction sub-goals, such as number of Facebook shares, helpful indications of your progress. An additional benefit of setting traction goals is that they help organize your start-up’s limited resources. Start-ups always operate in a hectic environment where there are too many things to do and never enough time or money to do them. But tasks like product development, designing a company logo and building a team all serve the same ultimate purpose: gaining traction. This is why you should determine a critical path of actions that will lead you toward your traction goals, and then focus intently on following that path. For DuckDuckGo, the critical path to reaching 100 million searches a month included getting more press coverage and improving search speed. Having traction goals allowed them to focus on these steps and put other tasks like optimizing product features on the backburner. But just as the best traction channel for your company can change over time, so can the critical path. This is why you need to be flexible and open-minded. Constantly review and improve your path, keeping top-notch traction as your main priority. The key message in this book: Even great products don’t sell themselves. A start-up stands or falls on the customer base it can build. This is why you need to think about traction early and often, and build your company’s goals around achieving that traction. Actionable advice: Attend a trade show: they’re great for getting press and viral marketing – and for building partnerships. Do some research on which trade shows are popular in your industry and then attend a few. They are a great way to get media attention, build a customer base that can spread your message virally, and meet other businesses who might become future collaborators. Just make sure you do put on a good show that makes you stand out among all the other start-ups. Suggested further reading: Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey A.

Are you satisfied with results? Perhaps you feel your success is being hampered by hundreds of issues, like employee bickering or too much bureaucracy. Or maybe you feel like you need to reinvent the wheel just to survive the next few months. These blinks outline a step-by-step method to solving your business problems. The Entrepreneurial Operating System will help you weed out unnecessary processes in your organization and help you regain footing in your chosen market. Based on lessons learned through practice and experience, this system shows you how focusing on just six elements can help get your company back on track. So get your leadership team on board and take the first steps toward revitalizing your company by reading these blinks. In these blinks, you’ll learn why trying to please everyone is a bad idea; why one is the magic number when it comes to responsibility; and why a company needs “rocks” to thrive. When we reflect on Steve Jobs’s tenure at Apple, it’s clear his work inspired many people. After all, his goal was to build a company that didn’t just create technology but improved humanity. While the goal of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) isn’t as lofty, its powers shouldn’t be underestimated. This entrepreneurial tool is like an abbreviated business plan, seeking answers to a series of questions to get your company on track. It has six steps. The first is to define a vision for your company. Your vision will guide every other process and decision in your organization, which means that it needs to be crystal clear. It will define your organization, where it goes and how it gets there. Beyond that, your vision needs to be understood and shared by everyone in the organization. If it isn’t, your employees won’t move or act in concert. Finding a vision begins by defining what you want to be like as an organization. To do so, have your leadership team identify two things: your core values and your core focus. Your core values are three to seven fundamental principles by which your company is guided. For example, among the core values of American restaurant chain Zoup! Fresh Soup Company are a “can do” attitude and a passion for the company’s brand. These values determine who the company hires as well as how it handles staff, clients and business partners. Once you’ve defined your core values, you can move to your core focus by defining what your company seeks to provide. Or, to put it another way, which needs your company wants to satisfy. Why is defining this focus important? Let’s look at laser printer service and supply company, Image One. The company faced problems when it expanded its business into computer networking. Amid the turmoil, company executives reminded themselves of Image One’s core focus: to simplify the printing environment of its clients. So they decided to ditch the computer division and stick to their core focus. Ever since, the company has thrived, experiencing an annual average growth rate of 30 percent. Imagine you’re planning an around-the-world getaway. You’re probably thinking about which cities to visit, how to pack in smaller attractions and, of course, how to get around. When developing a business plan, you need to consider similar details. Ensure that your leadership team plans carefully what will be accomplished, when it will happen and how. To do so, brainstorm a ten-year target with your team. This is your company’s larger-than-life goal for where you want to be in ten years, crucial to defining your company’s overall direction. Next, suss out your three-year picture. This should describe which strategies you’ll use over the next three years to approach your ten-year target. Once you’ve done that, you can make a one-year plan that states what has to happen in the next 365 days. And finally, you should define your quarterly rocks. These are specific, attainable and measurable milestones you can reach within the next 90 days. After you’ve planned for the future, both near and far, you can decide on a marketing strategy. The first step is to ensure efficiency in how you win loyal customers. Remember, you can’t make everyone happy. Trying to do so might just end up frustrating loyal clients. This is why you need to define a target market and adapt your strategy to it. For instance, if you’re the owner of a small aquatics center, it’s not in your business interest to cater to both active children and stressed-out adults. The needs of the two customer bases are different, and you won’t be able to satisfy them both simultaneously. Having defined your target market, you should identify any issues that might affect your business. In the case of the aquatics center, for example, these might be rising energy costs or a similar business opening nearby. Being aware of these will help you address them ahead of time. Every good manager knows you’re only as strong as the people who work for you. This is why staff members are the second crucial component to organizational success. So how can you make sure you’re employing people who share your company’s values? Use the people analyzer! This chart allocates one column to each of your company’s core values and a row to each employee. To populate your chart, record which employees adhere to which core values with a plus mark for “most of the time,” a plus/minus for “sometimes” and a minus for “never.” Once you’ve collected this data, look for employees who exhibit most of your core values most of the time and all of your core values at least some of the time. While an employee might be growth oriented – a possible core value – that person might not always adhere to another value important to your company’s success, such as fairness. Having the right people on your team is key, but you also need to make sure people are in the right roles. The GWC (Get, Want, Capacity) chart helps you ensure all employees are doing jobs that are best suited to their skills. To use this chart, you ask three questions. Does the employee Get it – does she understand her role? Does she Want it – does she like the job? And does she have the Capacity, whether intelligence, experience or any other quality, to perform the job effectively? If your answer to any of these questions is “no,” then you know the person isn’t right for the job. Let’s say one of your most talented engineers is in line for a promotion to an executive position. He Gets it, knowing what the position entails; he has the Capacity to be a good executive, too. But there’s a problem, as he dreads meetings – he doesn’t Want it enough, and thus wouldn’t make a good executive. The third key to optimizing your business for success is good data management. Many people greet this term with contempt, but managing data doesn’t have to be a grueling task. In fact, keeping track of information crucial to your business is simple with a couple of easy-to-use tools. You can monitor and manage employee performance with a scorecard. Decide with your leadership team which performance factors – from five to 15 – to monitor and set a target goal for each, such as number of sales proposals given or new subscribers won. Define then who is responsible for reaching a given weekly target and, when someone doesn’t meet a goal, follow up to find out what happened. By tracking employee performance, you’ll be able to identify any issues early on. And by quantifying performance in this fashion, you can hold people accountable clearly and objectively and also trigger healthy competition. Yet what do you do if your scorecard indicates that your team is failing to meet its targets or is facing another problem? Here’s where the fourth key to managerial success comes in. It’s designed to help you identify important issues before they can harm your business. The name of the game is IDS, or identify, discuss and solve. Begin by listing everything that doesn’t work the way it should, making sure your staff is comfortable reporting any concerns. Then, approach the issues using the three steps stated above. First, identify what’s going on, bearing in mind that some issues might be symptoms of bigger problems. Then discuss, giving everyone on your team the chance to voice opinions about key issues and suggest ways to handle them. And finally, solve by deciding on solutions. Often you’ll solve an issue by assigning a concrete task to a particular person. When they complete this task, the issue should ideally disappear. Just like your vital organs power your body, core processes keep your company running smoothly. On average, companies have seven such areas, such as marketing, human relations and operations. These processes represent the fifth component of the Entrepreneurial Operating System. For your company to thrive, you need to identify, document and streamline them all. Here’s how. The first step is to have your leadership team list all the processes that are core to your business. Once your leadership team understands how these processes function within the company, they can begin working on ways to simplify them. Be sure that everyone on the team agrees with the list and uses the same names to refer to the different processes. Doing so will add clarity and simplify work moving forward. Once you’ve agreed on a list, have the people in charge of each process document each important step. For instance, the head of human resources might write down the steps she takes when recruiting, orienting or terminating employees. Next, you should review the process yourself. By taking a look at the steps team members have articulated, you’ll likely identify some that are redundant or discover areas that can be simplified, such as with technology. You might find that a department prints and files a paper copy of every company document, even though the same documents are saved and filed both in the cloud and on the company’s intranet servers. In this case, printing just creates extra work and adds cost. After you clarify redundancies, you can eliminate other unnecessary tasks, simplifying processes however you can. From there, the remaining task is to ensure that your processes line up with your company’s core values, the values you and your leadership team defined from the start. If one of your core values is family orientation, for example, you’ll want to not sell just family-friendly products but also provide family-friendly working conditions, such as offering paid family leave. Now that your processes are under control, it’s time to learn the final step of the Entrepreneurial Operating System. Remember the concept of “quarterly rocks” from an earlier blink? These small milestones help you realize your company’s greater goals. But for these rocks to be effective and lead you toward success, you need constantly to set new goals. To do so, meet quarterly with your leadership staff to review progress and set goals for the next quarter. Setting quarterly targets is effective, because 90 days is about as long as one person can remain focused on a single project. At the meeting, have your leadership team list everything that needs to be accomplished during the next quarter. Teams should generate around ten to 20 goals on average. Since this is far too many goals to realistically reach, the second step is to discuss ideas and whittle them down to seven top priority goals, or rocks. Rocks differ from goals in general in that they’re specific, attainable and measurable. For instance, one of your rocks might be to hire a new expert for human relations. Once you’ve chosen your top goals, make sure people are accountable for them. Assign each rock to a person on your leadership team who will be in charge of realizing it. It’s key that only one person be assigned to each rock; when multiple people are in charge, nobody feels responsible. After all your rocks have been assigned, each member of your team should set a personal rock. This can happen on a “rock sheet,” or diagram that lists company rocks and individual rocks. You can use this list at weekly meetings to monitor progress. By making clear the responsibilities of each leader, you’ll create maximum accountability. Finally, share the company’s rocks with every person in the organization and have each department generate rocks, too. Do this by inviting everyone to a quarterly meeting where you share new rocks and report on those from the previous quarter.   From here you can have departments and employees decide on one to three individual rocks in line with those of the company at large. The key message in this book: To gain traction in the market, you need to develop a clear and coherent plan for your business. But that’s not all. It’s also essential to have the right people in the right places, track data, streamline processes and account for any potential issues in your business.  Actionable advice: Keep meetings focused by shouting, “tangent alert!” Meetings and discussions go on too long because participants go off on tangents, or stray from the issue at hand. To prevent this, invite meeting participants to say “tangent alert!” when they notice a conversation is drifting. This will help your team stay focused and accomplish the meeting’s goals.

If you own a computer repair shop, a bookstore or deli, how do you get locals in the front door? Your signage is bold; you’ve handed out leaflets on the weekend; you’re registered with the local business bureau; and of course, you’ve built a website for your business. But now what? How do you make sure that someone finds your business when searching online for a particular service, for example? By knowing how to market your business online. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to ensure your business makes it to the top of search results on Google, as well as how to entice prospective customers to call or visit your shop. In our digital age, a tasteful storefront and leaflets aren’t enough; it’s time to start an online marketing campaign to build your local business. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why search engines are essentially digital Yellow Pages; what the acronyms SEO and PPC stand for; and why for a local business, Google AdWords is the holy grail. An established lawyer enjoys a broad client base and large income. For years, he’s advertised successfully in the local yellow pages. Yet recently, his list of new clients has been steadily dwindling. To combat this, he decides to invest in larger, more expensive print ads in local business directories but sees no resulting bump in client referrals. What is this lawyer doing wrong? Our lawyer is basically behind the digital ball; he’s failed to keep up with a changing world. To put it another way, he’s using traditional forms of marketing that are outdated in today’s market. He’s not alone, as this strategy is common with many established local businesses. Local business directories, along with other traditional advertising such as billboards and posters – even ads in newspapers or on radio and television – are not as effective as they once were. Think about it: When was the last time you flipped through a local Yellow Pages or saw an ad on television that inspired you to make a purchase? Most local American businesses struggle with marketing, an essential component of business success. Even if you’re the best in your market, if you don’t know how to get new clients through your doors, you won’t get very far. Marketing is crucial – and today, good marketing is online marketing. While business directories like the Yellow Pages were once the main advertising tool for local shops, today online search engines have taken their place. Not ten years ago, if you were looking for a lawyer, dentist or plumber, you’d first flip through your local business directory. Today, however, most people use Google or another search engine to find local services. Right now, there are dozens of locals in your area using the internet to find a service like the one you provide. The question is, will they find you? So how can today’s popular search engines help potential clients find your business online? There are two ways that Google can help push your shop into the digital spotlight. The first is through search engine optimization or SEO. This process helps you, using relevant keywords, bump your website closer to the top of search results when someone searches online for your particular service. Let’s say your business is cosmetic dentistry. Your goal is to come up with keywords, or potential search terms that someone would type into Google to find a dentist like you. Good keywords would include “cosmetic dentist” and “cosmetic dentistry,” of course. You could also include words such as those that reference specific products or procedures, like “dental implants” and “crowns.” Keep in mind that Google uses an algorithm to determine how relevant the content of a website is to a selected keyword. The most relevant sites are thus displayed first in results when someone searches for those words. Yet you should also know that pay-per-click (PPC) ads have an advantage over SEO, the biggest boon being that PPC ads are placed above SEO results in search. This prime positioning makes a huge difference – people often only look at the top of a search results page, choosing the first link out of convenience or being too lazy to scroll down. If you choose PPC ads, you’re likely to see an immediate payoff. From day one, your website will show up at the top of Google search results! In contrast, effective SEO is a long-term investment. It can take between three and six months to see results, and hiring a firm to handle SEO can be expensive. Many companies charge from $1,000 to $2,000 a month to identify keywords that are right for you. There is no guarantee of success, either. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how to use PPC effectively with the leading search engine, Google. Google is one of the most influential and successful companies of the information age. But did you know that around 90 percent of Google’s earnings come from its advertising services? This program is called Google AdWords, and its specialty is pay-per-click (PPC) marketing. There are a few reasons why AdWords stands out from other online marketing services, but its primary strength is the program’s incredible reach. Every day, some 6 billion searches run through Google. Each search attempt represents an individual’s need for a piece of information or a demand for a service. As a business, you can take advantage of this by meeting a search request with an offer and, eventually, turning the offer into a profitable deal. The real benefit here is that Google already has the attention of prospective customers – eliminating the fishing for attention a business usually needs to do via television, radio or newspaper advertising. Another benefit of advertising online is that results are easy to track. With traditional ads, for example, you know how many people subscribe to a newspaper but not how many people actually looked at your ad on page 10. And print advertising is very expensive, too. With Google AdWords, however, you have total control over your budget. You decide how much you’ll pay for a click, and you only pay when someone actually clicks on your ad and lands on your website. You can determine which day of the week and time of day people see your ad; and importantly, you can ensure that people who live near your business are the ones who see your ad. You could set an ad to be displayed on searches that only take place within a 10-, 20- or 50-mile radius from your business, for example – ideal for local marketing. While Google can help bring potential clients to your website, the quality of your landing page has the power to seal a deal. A website’s landing page is the first page that’s displayed after a user clicks through an ad. Great landing pages convert leads, or initial customer interest, into inquiries, or potential customers. Simple math explains why a landing page is so important. By doubling the conversion rate on your landing page, you’ll double your prospective clients. A conversion rate refers to the percentage of site visitors who do something beyond just visiting, such as calling your shop or subscribing to a newsletter. Let’s dig into this process a bit more. Here we have two advertisers, advertiser A and advertiser B. They have identical ads, are charged the same cost per click and claim the same number of monthly visitors to their respective websites. Yet the conversion rate of A’s landing page is 5 percent, which translates into 50 new leads a month, while the conversion rate for B is 10 percent, or 100 new leads a month. Since both firms are paying the same amount for ads, the cost of acquiring a new lead for B is half what it is for A. This shows you how a strong landing page can double your business and cut costs, too. When designing a landing page, make sure that it represents a call to action for potential clients. In other words, your priority is to keep clients focused on the action you want them to take, such as calling you. Avoid too many distractions on your landing page, like lots of links or a questions-and-answers section. Keeping your landing page sparse serves a double function: you also want to avoid giving away too much information that will make it unnecessary for an interested customer to contact you. These are just the basics of building an effective landing page. There are a few more things you should know about this important tool, which we’ll explore next. What’s the most effective way to get a potential client interested in your business? If you provide a service, for example, then offering a free consultation might be your strongest lure. Your top offer for new clients then should be clearly and accurately displayed on your website’s landing page, so any visitor knows exactly where to go and what to do. Here’s how to design a successful landing page that highlights your offer effectively. Start with the web page’s header at the very top. This section should include only your logo to the left and a call to action to the right. Choose a call to action that is motivating. It could be something as simple as, “Call now for a free consultation!” The headline section of your landing page sits below the header, and it’s the most widely read part of your page. This section should include text that describes the benefits of doing business with you or outlines the value you can offer a potential client. Ask questions that inspire “yes” answers. By getting a prospective client in “yes-mode,” you’ll make them more likely to contact you. If you’re a chiropractor, for example, you might ask, “Would you like to get rid of your back pain?” You can then encourage people who say “yes” to call for a free initial session or to visit your offices. After the headline section, comes a contact form. This should be located on the upper right-hand side of the landing page. Ask for only the minimum amount of data necessary, like a person’s full name and email, and perhaps any specific questions they have about your business. Remember, the more data points you ask for, the less likely a person is to contact you. Keep it simple. At the bottom of all this is the proof zone. This is where you prove to your prospective client that your business is credible. Include customer testimonials in this space. Any smart investor knows that when investing in the stock market, you need to have quality, transparent reporting to make sound financial decisions. The same goes for marketing, as when you market your company, you’re investing in the future of your business. So for your marketing efforts to succeed, you need smart reporting that tells you if your strategy is paying off. But before you learn how to measure success, it’s important to understand that most new leads generated by local businesses come as a phone call. Local businesses are different than e-commerce sites that primarily sell products online. Someone who visits the website of a local business will generally not make an immediate transaction but will either send an email or call the business for more information. The authors found that some 60 to 70 percent of local business leads are generated via phone calls. In these cases, a sale occurs only after a client has asked for a free consultation or received an initial session. So how can you use your online presence to get more potential clients to call you? A great way to do this is with dynamic call tracking systems. This tool lets you see which ads and keywords trigger a client to call. Dynamic call tracking systems connect call data to keywords placed via Google AdWords. For every ad and keyword you place with AdWords, you can see not only how much each click costs and the number of clicks received but also the conversion rate – how many times a keyword leads to a phone call. Such data can be helpful when optimizing a marketing campaign, as it clues you into effective keywords and identifies words to abandon. Using a call tracking service can help you manage your budget and boost the overall success of your marketing strategy. The key message in this book: With the rise of the internet, business has changed and so has business marketing. Older methods of investing in print ads or business directories no longer work. To ensure a steady stream of new customers, your business needs to build a strong online ad strategy.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Companies have never had so much information about customers at their fingertips. But all that data can be overwhelming. If you’re not asking the right questions, you’ll never discover what your customers truly want and need.  That’s why it pays to think carefully about your user research methodology. With so many different approaches out there, you want to make sure you’re picking the right method for your business. Luckily, the insights of seasoned professional Stephanie Marsh make this easy to do. Marsh is a user experience and research consultant who has worked with everyone from the British government to EasyJet. As actionable as they are insightful, these blinks offer a crash course in making your research count.   Along the way, you’ll learn why you should avoid asking open-ended questions;  how to tackle sensitive topics; and  why observation is just as important as the questions you ask.  Being a natural-born number cruncher probably didn’t do much for your popularity in the playground, but it does set you up for success in the job market. Today’s data-driven world is mad about numbers. The folks who know how to collect and analyze them are ideally placed to help companies conduct user research. User research is key in any business strategy, and there’s never a bad time to do it. Let’s say you’re developing a new product. The first thing you’ll want to find out is straightforward – will folks like it enough to reach for their wallets? Well, you’ll only know if you ask them – that’s user research. When you’re still in the early stages of product development, it’s enough to sketch your idea on a piece of paper and see how people react to it. This way, you gain a sense of whether your product addresses a common problem. If you get positive feedback, you might be onto something. Now’s the time to start investing time and money. Your aim now is to perfect your product. If you’re working on something that already exists, user research will help you beat the competition.  Like all experimental trials, user research should be carried out according to legal and ethical requirements. The key here is transparency. Make sure participants know what they’re taking part in and be upfront about your objectives and methods. In practice, that means using your first research session to explain everything and ask participants for legal consent to have their data collected, saved and used. It’s also important to tell them whether you’re recording their data. If you’re using video or audio equipment, point that out. You should also make sure you’re clear about whether or not you’ll use their data for other research purposes. Once you’ve explained all that, you need to explicitly ask for their consent. If they withhold it, end the research session immediately and destroy the information you’ve collected so far.  The data generated by user research is only valuable if your participants are honest. But getting an honest answer is often harder than you may think. Sometimes people are just too polite to tell you they don’t like your product. So how do you get the information you need?  For starters, don’t just focus on what they’re saying. Pay attention to how they behave. Consider this example from the author’s experience as a consultant. When she was working with the British government, she assessed how user-friendly its website was. To do that, she ran a user test in which participants completed a series of tasks on the site. Some tasks were simple, while others were more complicated.  One participant proved harder to deal with than others. Overall, she seemed to have had a fairly smooth user experience. But when the author quizzed her after the trial, she claimed that the site was awful. She went on to criticize the current prime minister and his political positions. It was clear that her feelings about the government influenced her perception of the website. That’s a great example of how external factors can sway opinions. It also shows that it pays to observe behavior, rather than just ask questions!  Another way of getting usable data out of your research is to formulate your questions as carefully as possible. Neutrality is the watchword here. When you ask a question like “Do you like this?” you may put participants on the spot, and they may feel compelled to give a positive or negative answer. That often distorts their actual experience, which might have been less clear-cut.  Questions like “What, if anything, did you like or dislike about this?” are much more balanced. They give participants the chance to comment on positive and negative features without either endorsing or rejecting your product entirely.  Now you know that user research is vital to determining the viability of your product. But how do you actually do it? It’s time to talk about methodology. Before you decide on your approach, you need to know what kinds of methods are out there.  Let’s kick things off with moderated usability testing. It’s a mouthful, but it’s a pretty simple concept. “To moderate” in this case means to monitor. In this approach, you observe a participant try out a product or service. Sometimes you’ll literally look over their shoulder. Other times, you’ll use screen-sharing tools to watch what they’re doing remotely. Moderated tests have one big advantage – they’re highly interactive. When participants get stuck or run into problems, they can ask you questions directly. That gives you an insight into their experience and tells you what you’ll need to fix before rolling out your product. You can also ask follow-up questions and have deeper conversations with trial users. Finally, conducting moderated tests is relatively cheap. If you’re in the room, all you need is a pen and paper or a computer to jot down your observations.  That said, moderated usability testing isn’t always the right option. While it might not cost much financially, it’s pretty time-intensive, as you’ll have to be present at each session. Then there’s the logistical headache of agreeing on a place and time with participants. This issue means that you can only use this method with a small number of people. If an average interview takes 45 minutes, you’ll only be able to squeeze so many participants into a day. While your research will lead to plenty of insights, it won’t be statistically significant.  That matters because you need to convince your superiors that your findings are worthwhile. Lots of bosses just won’t be impressed with data gathered from five people, even if you explain the value of this in-depth research. In other words, moderated usability testing can be a tough sell. You’ve probably already guessed one of the obvious alternatives to moderated usability testing – that’s right, unmoderated usability testing. The set-up is almost identical to the one we discussed in the previous blink. However, there’s one important difference – participants are left to their own devices as they complete tasks and test your product or service. That makes your life pretty easy, right?  Well, yes – unmoderated usability testing definitely has its advantages. First off, you can carry out this kind of testing remotely, allowing participants to take part wherever and whenever suits them. That’s handy if you’re attempting to create a large data pool and don’t have time to schedule individual meetings with each user. One added bonus is that you can reach out to people who live in hard-to-reach locations, as well as people who don’t have the financial means to travel to you.  Unmoderated usability is also fast. A large-scale study can usually be completed in just a couple of days. If you’re pressed for time and need a quick turnaround, this is the method for you.  There are drawbacks, however. If you’re asking participants to complete a task without assistance, you might end up excluding certain demographics. A remote computer test, for example, won’t be accessible to people without an internet connection. Elderly participants will probably struggle with computer-based tasks. That’s only important if you intend to find customers within these groups, of course, but it is worth bearing in mind.  The other issue with unmoderated usability testing is the quality of the data. While you’re sure to end up with lots of information, it will inevitably be fairly superficial. Some of it won’t be usable at all – that’s the downside of not being onsite to help participants with their tasks. In fact, you won’t have much control over the entire process at all.  So far we’ve looked at a couple of research methods which might be new to you. In this blink, we’ll turn our attention to one you’ve definitely heard of before – the survey. It’s probably the most widely used and well-known methodology in user research. Let’s start with the obvious stuff. A survey is the statistical equivalent of an industrial trawler – it collects vast amounts of quantitative data. The key here is a representative sample – a group of people that represents your target market as a whole. As a rule of thumb, this group should contain at least 2,000 individuals. Any less than that and your data won’t be statistically significant.  So, say 100,000 people use your services or buy your product every year. If you select 2,000 of these users, you can be reasonably confident that your data will represent the experiences of all your customers.  That brings us to survey design. To craft an effective survey, pay attention to a couple of factors. First off, you should have a clearly identified purpose. Secondly, you’ll need to target a pre-selected group of participants. Finally, you’ll have to pick a medium – are you going to use web-based tools, for example, or stick to an old-school paper-and-pen approach?  It’s also important to keep your survey short and snappy and tell would-be participants how much time it will take. The shorter it is, the more people will likely take part. If you’re using an online survey, you might want to add a progress bar so that respondents know how much of the questionnaire is left. That’s a simple but effective incentive to complete the survey.  And here’s one last tip. Surveys can be built around “open-ended” or “closed” answers. Generally, it’s a good idea to keep the former to a minimum and focus more heavily on the latter. Why? Well, answering open-ended questions takes more time and thought than responding to simple “yes or no” questions. The easier the survey, the greater the chances participants will finish it. What comes to mind when you think of user research? Chances are, it’s a company asking what customers think of its latest technological gizmo. Sure – that is a pretty common question. But user research also tackles more sensitive issues. In this case, it’s important to proceed carefully and tactfully.  Take it from the author. In 2014, she was conducting user research for a charity that helps people with terminal illnesses and their loved ones. Most of the folks she was talking to were either terminally ill or related to someone who was. As you can imagine, emotions were running high.  The author understood that this was a situation in which participants’ well-being trumped her job of gathering data. That’s why she started each interview by reminding people that they could stop at any point. If she noticed that a participant was becoming upset, she gently brought things to a close herself and made sure a counselor was on hand to offer support.  How you structure your interview sessions also makes a difference when it comes to delicate subjects. If you’re talking about something personal, it’s generally a good idea to take it slow, start with easy questions and build toward more complex issues.  One way of doing that is to kick the session off by explaining the context of your research and giving participants a chance to ask you questions. Once you’ve done that, you can move onto warm-up questions of your own. These are designed to help you get to know participants a little better. Keep it vague at this point, and try to find out how much experience or knowledge your subjects have of the topic you’re exploring. Once you’ve put participants at ease, you can move on to more sensitive and personal questions.  User research isn’t just about gathering data – it’s also about communication. Participants won’t always give you the unambiguous and straightforward answers you need. Luckily, there are a few tricks you can use to get through difficult interviews.   Let’s start with awkward silences. There are few things interviewers dread more, but they’re part and parcel of user research. That means you should accept them, rather than filling them with your own words. Why? Well, improvising and making conversation is usually counterproductive, since it derails the conversation and steers you away from your research topic.  There’s also a risk that you’ll end up asking leading questions, thus compromising your neutrality. Remember, your data is only useful if it reflects what people actually think. If you’re pushing people to say something, chances are their response won’t reflect their true opinion.  So instead, try to ride out those awkward silences. Sooner or later, participants will fill them. You can encourage them, but ultimately you’ll want to wait to see what they say without your interference. If a participant is truly tongue-tied, you can talk to them, but this should be an exception rather than the rule. Fielding questions is another aspect of interviewing that can be difficult. When deciding whether to allow yourself to be drawn in, it’s useful to identify what kind of question you’re being asked. If a participant isn’t sure what you mean and asks you to clarify, you can rephrase your question. But if they ask you what you think, you should resist commenting. Diplomatically remind them that you’re interested in their opinion and tell them that you’re happy to share your point of view after the interview.  Like fish in water, humans usually take their environment for granted. We function on autopilot and don’t question our immediate surroundings. That means you’re unlikely to gain any real insights by asking interviewees how they feel about the world around them. That’s where ethnography comes in.  Ethnography is the study of people and culture. It involves in-depth observation of how people behave and interact with their surroundings. As an ethnographic researcher, your aim is to reveal things you may have missed by failing to consider the real-world application of your products or services.  Take airports, for example. Initially, planners wanted to install electric sockets in the walls near the ground. That makes intuitive sense – after all, that’s where sockets go in most buildings. An ethnographic approach, however, shows that this is far from optimal because it means travelers have to sit on the floor to charge their devices. If you’ve ever wondered how anyone came up with the great idea of incorporating sockets into airport seating, there’s your answer! Modern technology makes this kind of research simple. Because the ethnographer doesn’t have to be present, researchers can practice so-called “mobile ethnography.” That’s useful because on-site ethnography isn’t practical in every situation. Like moderated usability research, it requires the researcher to be somewhere at a certain time. Today, however, the latest tech devices mean that participants can record their own daily activities, as well as their own thoughts and feelings. Mobile ethnography is essentially about reviewing and analyzing that self-collected data remotely. This way, it’s less intrusive, and folks can participate in your research wherever and whenever is convenient for them. Now you know about the different user research methods out there. That means you can start finding out how people feel about the service, product or experience you’re offering. Once you’ve figured out which method best suits you, you’re ready to dive in and gather that most precious of business resources – data. The key message in these blinks: There’s no one way to do user research. The key is choosing the methodology that suits your company’s needs and resources. Some approaches like interviews are cheap but take time. Others, like surveys, are more expensive but quicker and simpler. So, clarify what you’re looking for before you start your research. If you want in-depth qualitative data, be prepared to conduct extensive, in-person interviews. If you want a large sample of more general data, a survey might be the best way to go.  Actionable advice: Need a quick fix? Try guerilla research. You can carry out effective user research even if you’re short on resources and time. Call it guerilla research – a highly mobile, low-resource way of finding out what people think of your product or service. Simply approach random people in public spaces, like cafés, and ask them to test your wares. It’s the perfect method if you’re still working on a prototype and need some first impressions. It’s also a great way of practicing your interview and communication skills.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

There are two kinds: functional jobs and social jobs. Functional jobs are specific things customers need to get done, such as tending to the garden or buying groceries. Social jobs are the things customers want to do in order to impress others, such as buying a trendy outfit or wowing their boss with an amazing presentation. The next step in identifying value is understanding customer pains: the things in life that stand in the way of a customer performing a functional or social job. The first customer pain is unwanted outcomes, which is when a customer doesn’t get the outcome he was after. Maybe the customer bought a garden sprinkler that turned out to be useless or worked on a presentation that put everyone to sleep – both examples are unwanted outcomes. The second customer pain is obstacles, which prevent the customer from even starting a job. Maybe that coveted sprinkler system is just too expensive; or maybe the customer simply doesn’t have the time to prepare a satisfactory presentation. The last customer pain is risks – the unpleasant things that happen when a job goes unperformed. Without a sprinkler system, for instance, your customer’s garden might die; and if that customer doesn’t nail the presentation, she won’t get a promotion. The final step in determining value is recognizing the three types of customer gains: the things customers are hoping to get. The first is required gains, which is the basic function of a product. The required gain of a sprinkler is that the plants get watered. The second is expected gains. Customers expect a sprinkler to be well made and reliable. The third is desired gains, which is when a product goes beyond expectations – such as a sprinkler system that can be operated with a smartphone app. Once you understand the needs and wants of your customers, you’re on your way to delivering a valuable product. The next step is to identify and understand all the components of your product. This will allow you to determine and design the value proposition. You already have your starting point – you’ve identified the value of a sprinkler system that can be operated with a smartphone. Okay, now let’s break this down into its individual components. Imagine your product being advertised in a shop window, with the display listing all its different features. There’s your product’s physical/tangible component, which is the sprinkler itself. Then there’s the intangible component, such as a five-year warranty. And there’s a digital component: the smartphone app that controls the system. Breaking things down like this further identifies the ways your product or service alleviates customer pains. And the more pains you relieve, the more valuable you become. Focus on the biggest customer pains. For functional jobs, ask questions like, “How can I save customers time and money?” (One option might be to offer discounted installation services.) For social jobs, ask, “Can I help customers be seen favorably by others?” Perhaps you can offer an online social platform where people share photos of their flourishing gardens. Finally, to ensure your product’s value and its appeal to customers, identify exactly how your product creates expected and desired gains for your customers. Since you can’t cover everything, focus on the most important areas. Then ask questions like, “How can I exceed the expectations of my customers?” And, “How can I make my customer’s life easier?” For example, you could offer 24-hour customer service or design a sprinkler hose that never gets tangled. By relieving pain, providing gains and helping customers perform their jobs, your product already has a fantastic value proposition. Now that you’ve designed the initial value proposition for your product or service, you can take the next step: figuring out how well it will fit in the marketplace.   There are three different stages for determining whether your product fits the market. The first indicator of a good fit is presentation. Does your product’s value proposition look good on paper? Can you point to how it tackles all of a customer's jobs, pains and gains? Keep in mind that this is just a hypothetical fit, so it’s a good idea to design a few different models of your product before you go out into the marketplace and get real customer feedback. That’s where the second fit happens – in the marketplace, where you roll out a product or service and get the customer feedback that tells you how well you’re actually doing. This is when you get real facts about your product and can make adjustments to attain the best possible fit. The first model you put out there might receive some negative feedback. For instance, maybe some customers will tell you that your sprinkler-control app becomes unresponsive after a few minutes. If customer feedback indicates that your product isn’t meeting expectations, then it’s time to redesign the product, reintroduce it to the market and continue fine-tuning it until it’s a perfect fit. The last stage is the financial fit. Here you get the cold, hard facts that reveal whether your value proposition is profitable and scalable. The goal is for your value proposition to lead you to a profitable business. Generally speaking, this happens when the revenue you generate exceeds the costs of your business. Whether you’re trying to sell a sprinkler system or a fashionable pair of shoes, you’ll only succeed if your value proposition generates more revenue than costs. Next, we’ll look at some strategies to help you come up with truly valuable ideas for products and services. It might not be obvious, but an ornithologist and an entrepreneur have a lot in common. Only, instead of studying birds to understand avian habits, entrepreneurs study customers to understand consumer habits. Those habits reveal crucial information: customers’ wants and desires. One inexpensive and easy way to start gaining insight is to analyze customer data.   Once you have a website, you can use the tracking and analysis services provided by Google Analytics. With this data, you can look at how customers end up at your site and see whether it’s through browser searches or links provided by other websites. You can also make a list of the top ten most visited pages on your site and the top ten least visited pages. From there, you can go a step further and immerse yourself in your customers’ world to find out more about their jobs, gains and pains. For example, people in business-to-consumer (or B2C) endeavors – businesses that sell consumer goods like toothbrushes or lamps – might spend a day observing a potential customer’s family. This allows you insight into those day-to-day jobs, such as making breakfast for hungry kids, and what pains and potential gains are connected with them. This is the kind of first-hand observation that can lead to ideas about how to improve, for instance, a slow toaster. Another, less direct approach is to observe your potential customers by visiting the stores they go to. Notice which products they’re looking for, which ones they select and which ones they ignore. Over the course of a full day, you should be able to see patterns in their shopping habits. For business-to-business (or B2B) endeavors – where one business sells products to another business – you can use a similar strategy. Spend a day or more at the headquarters of a potential customer and set up some workshops with their employees to find out about the pains and gains of their jobs. You might gain some helpful information – that they’re unhappy with their copy machines due to the confusing and hard-to-use interface, for example. Maybe you’ve heard the old cliché about a billion-dollar business being based on an idea scribbled on a bar napkin. Indeed, it’s a good idea to always jot down your ideas somewhere. The goal is to put the central idea of a value proposition onto a piece of paper no bigger than a napkin – and then share it. Don’t bother with any details. This way you can quickly visualize and share an idea with coworkers, or even customers. You don’t need to worry about negative feedback here, either. If an idea doesn’t pan out, just move on to the next one. It’ll likely take more than a few napkins before you strike gold. Ikea has a clear (and good) central idea. If written on a napkin, it would probably say something like, “Provide customers with packaged components of fashionable furniture they can put together at home for low cost.” As you can see, a napkin-sketch can be a very rudimentary idea for a prototype. Ad-libs are another helpful tool to spark a valuable idea. Ad-libs are short sentences that require you to fill in the blanks, such as: “Our (blank) helps (blank) who want to (blank) by providing (blank) and (blank).”   In the first two blanks, you put in your product and your target customer, and in the third blank you put in the job that you’re helping the customers perform. In the last two blanks, put in the action related to the pain the product helps alleviate, and then the gain you’re providing. You should end up with something like this: “Our programmable sprinkler system helps gardeners who want to grow an amazing and healthy vegetable or flower garden at home by providing a modern and time-saving system that can help them grow the garden of their dreams and is easy and stress-free to use. To see how you stack up against the competition, you can add a couple blanks to the beginning of the sentence, so that it reads, “Unlike (blank product) from (blank competitor), our product…” and so on. After you’ve come up with a couple of ideas for a product or service that is hopefully useful and therefore valuable, the next step is to see how it actually tests with real customers. At this point, you’ve already asked people for their opinions about your proposed service. However, while these responses are valuable, they’re not always accurate. This is why it’s crucial to get customers to interact with prototypes as soon as possible. There are always high levels of uncertainty when designing a value proposition. So gathering as much evidence as you can to validate your idea is key to moving forward. A great way to get this validation is through full-size prototypes and accurate models that allow you to test how customers really use your product or service. This is the idea behind car shows. They offer customers a chance to interact with prototypes that showcase new technologies; meanwhile, the car companies observe the customers and collect important data. Since these demonstrations don’t always turn out as hoped, you should try to make an inexpensive prototype that won’t take too long to build. Remember, you might have to make adjustments and produce a whole series of prototypes before you get it just right. Another way to gain early insight into customer interest is pre-sales. This is both a way to present customers with your value proposition and a chance to pay for a product that is still in development. Furthermore, it tells you how eager customers are to see your idea come to life. Kickstarter is a popular way to take advantage of pre-sales data. There are many creators and inventors who’ve used it to assess the viability of their value proposition. If your value proposition is geared toward business-to-business, you can still gauge pre-sale interest by presenting your idea to different companies and, if they’re interested, having them sign letters of intent. A letter of intent works kind of like Kickstarter; it’s a commitment on their part to buy your product when it’s finished. Okay, you’re now ready to start designing your own value proposition using the tools described in these blinks. Good luck! The value of a product or service derives from its ability to help people perform a functional or social job – that is, it makes customers’ lives easier. To find out how your product or service can do this, you need to empathize with your customers and learn which jobs they need help with. Once you have your idea, you’ll need to test and adjust your prototypes until you have the perfect product.  Actionable advice: Include some “call to action” in your prototype phase already. A call to action is a good way to figure out how much potential customers are ready to pay for your product or service. Say you sell cars. You could show people a prototype and then offer them the opportunity to pre-reserve one by paying a sum of their choosing between $250 and $10,000. The more they pay, the higher they go in the queue, so you can easily gauge their enthusiasm for getting one of your cars. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

They carefully collected the knowledge of the world and transcribed and conserved it for the future. But with the invention of the printing press, their efforts became obsolete. And now, in the age of the internet and digital technology, printed books are in the boat the monks were once in. In a word, information – once an inert mass, contained in the pages of books – has turned into vapor. Yet it’s not only information that has been vaporized. A number of physical things – and with them whole industries – have begun to vanish into thin air. These blinks explain what an economy in a gaseous state will look like. They tell you what goes hand in hand with the vaporization of information and the economy, which opportunities and risks a vaporized economy entails and how to best prepare for it. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the three chemical states of information; how internet giants like Google and Facebook create value in a vaporized world; and what the vaporization of our economy means for human labor. With all of our handy internet-connected devices, it’s easy to understand why today is called “the information age.” Less easy to understand is how this information behaves. It’s helpful to think of information like water, or other chemical elements since it can exist in a variety of different states depending on how we want to use it. To start with, information can be in a solid state, like in a book or on a CD. The downside of having information in a solid state is that it’s hard to share with more than one person. But selling information in physical form is a convenient way to monetize it, which is another reason why keeping information in a solid state has, historically, been preferred. Remarkably, the way we exchanged information didn’t change much at all between 1455 (when Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press) and the recent emergence of the internet. Throughout this span of time, information was always stored in a solid state, whether as books, CDs or DVDs. Though these physical states are durable and long-lasting ways to store information, they also demand a lot of money and energy to produce and distribute. What’s more, they eat up storage space and can only be shared one person at a time. Plus, things like laser discs quickly become obsolete. So when the internet emerged, people didn’t hesitate to free information from its physical constraints and transform it into a more liquid state. Imagine an ice cube beginning to melt; information, water-like, was now much easier to spread over a large area. With the click of a mouse, it was simple to post, edit and instantaneously share a file with the entire world. But there was still another change of state in store. As information moved from desktop computers to the smartphones, it became like a vapor: fast-moving, free and constantly changing. This is where we are now. With high-speed internet in our pockets, information is no longer bound to your office, or even to your laptop. It moves all around you, like atmospheric gasses. No matter where or who you are, be it a scientist in a lab or a monk in a mountaintop monastery, today learning anything, at any time, is but a tap or two away. One of the greatest strengths of today’s software-based technologies is that they allow us to do more with fewer resources. They help us monitor and analyze functions while providing new information and insights that allow us to make better designs. For instance, today’s cars can collect data about their own performance, and this data helps car companies produce more efficient models that pollute less. Software can even be used to replace major utilities, such as telecommunications networks that handle the traffic of thousands of people talking and messaging. With today’s advanced software, we could get rid of all the telephone poles and wires, and replace them with an efficient internet-based network that would route calls better and more reliably than before. Many of the physical goods in our day-to-day life could also be replaced by software, along with all of those old CDs and DVDs. It’s only a matter of time. Vaporization will encompass everything, from single jobs and stores to companies and entire industries. Anything that can be vaporized and replaced with software will be vaporized. Indeed, this process has already begun, and the music industry is a prime example. Big record shops have been replaced by online services like the iTunes store and Amazon. Instead of dealing with limited physical selections and waiting in line at a store, now anyone with an internet connection has access to a wealth of digital music. And when these record stores are replaced, the whole consumer experience and supply chain are vaporized too. The industry that produces CD packaging will disappear too, as will the warehouses that stored inventories of CDs. And the same fate awaits the industries that produce secondary products like CD players. All of them will have been made redundant by software. Internet giants like eBay, Amazon, Google and Snapchat didn’t stumble upon popularity. Each company knew how to connect the right people with one another, kind of like the operators at an old-fashioned switchboard. For Amazon and eBay, the “right people” were obvious – these platforms wanted to connect buyers with sellers. But the same strategy holds true for other internet giants. Google has made a fortune connecting information seekers with those who have the information being sought. YouTube connects video producers with viewers. And social apps like Snapchat are just facilitators for everyday people who want to stay connected with one another. But as each of these companies grew, their ecosystem of connections became more complex as different and unexpected users joined in. Take Apple’s App Store, for instance. What started as a place for developers to sell helpful applications soon morphed into a highly competitive marketplace, with developers hiring firms to raise their sales. These platforms aren’t the kinds of public spaces where people can exercise freedom of speech. The platform owner can make up arbitrary rules – whether well explained or not – that they can then enforce, which gives users two choices: either to comply completely or not participate at all Apple says this ensures the apps being sold in the App Store meet their standards for what’s acceptable. Yet they often give vague reasons, like an app being “creepy,” “objectionable” or “over the line” to explain a rejection. And even though fart apps routinely get kicked out, you can find, for example, a “Sexy Poker” app in their store. It should also be noted that Apple receives 30 percent of every purchase in the App Store, but that the system for determining an app’s ranking, which plays a huge role in an app’s chances for success, is also extremely vague. This has led to rumors that secret payoffs, bribes, gifts and other dubious methods can be used to boost an app’s ranking in the store. Making up rules isn’t just a way for internet companies to control user behavior; it can also help ensure that users remain loyal and return to the platform. This can be difficult in a vaporized economy, as users tend to gravitate toward whichever platform is the biggest. So let’s look at some different methods companies use to bind people to a platform and make them more active – all while generating more profits in the process. One of the most common ways to hold on to users is to create unique tools that allow them to generate their own content. Whether they’re posting photos or videos, or just creating chat threads, these tools promote engagement and keep users from leaving, because, if they leave, they lose access to all their content. This is why Apple and Google offer free content creation tools in the form of iMovie and YouTube. Another effective way to keep users loyal is to make it easy to find content and then share and chat about it. Facebook and other social media companies thrive on this dynamic. It’s also common for successful platforms to offer storage and playback features to their users. Without these features, platform owners run the risk of users finding a way to take their content elsewhere. This is why Google has a whole line of hardware such as the Chromebook and Nexus, as well as features like the Chromecast. It’s also why Apple provides content that is only compatible with their own products. Providing content can also lead to monetization when a platform establishes its own marketplace for content, where owners can take a cut of each transaction, as in the iTunes Store. But another popular method used by many platforms is to get users to fill out elaborate profiles, after which they can sell this detailed user data to marketing firms. The vaporized economy has offered a variety of ways for businesses to make money, most of which involve turning data into big bucks. Having people constantly connected to the internet produces massive amounts of data, and this amount is set to grow further. By 2020, it’s estimated that every person will be producing a mind-boggling 1.7 megabits of data per second. This will be due to the internet of things, where everyday objects, like your refrigerator and washing machine, will all be connected to the internet and collecting data. Today, most of us still like to think that there is some time during the day when we’re offline. But, before long, we’ll all be permanently connected and continuously producing data. When this happens, big-data companies will mine the output coming from these appliances and monitor and improve on the measurements. Take a keg of beer, for instance. The US company SteadyServ has a sensor that goes on the bottom of a keg and streams data to a server to allow restaurants and bars to manage their inventories in real time. So, when a keg is nearly empty, an alert can be triggered for a replacement. But more importantly, companies will also be able to closely monitor sales at different bars in real time to get a better understanding of local, state-wide or national trends. Traditional companies are also placing more and more value on data, but they struggle with the sheer volume of it all.  The challenge lies in how to archive, sort, search and effectively analyze data for useful information, all while keeping it out of the hands of malicious hackers. But surmounting this challenge will unlock plenty of future business opportunities. Back in the day, a business could be accurately valued by taking stock of its physical assets. But this doesn’t apply to companies like Airbnb and Uber, which have no actual rooms or cars of their own. So how does Airbnb get valued at $30 billion and Uber at $66 billion? They create a peer-to-peer marketplace by operating software that acts as the middleman between their clients, who own the apartments and cars, and their users, who want to temporarily use this property. This model is also known as “access-instead-of-ownership” and part of the platform’s success is due to its collaborative nature, matching, for example, users seeking lodging with those who already own apartments that they can rent out. In addition, both parties can choose whether or not they want to do business with the other based on ratings from previous transactions. And innovative blockchain technology promises to take this model to the next level by vaporizing even more middlemen. Blockchain technology relies on the principles of cryptography to allow for business transactions between two parties without any company or banking oversight, and thus without any associated fees. It’s already being used for Bitcoin, the electronic currency. Platforms operating on blockchain payments can be completely independent of banks and credit card companies that take big percentages on transactions and sell user data for dubious purposes. A “blockchain” version of Airbnb, for instance, could allow users and owners to save money. Another example of a streamlined service is crowdfunding, which is making it easier for entrepreneurs to find funding. Crowdfunding bypasses the slow, traditional process of raising investor funds by getting rid of the paperwork and endless interviews. It puts the power in the hands of individuals to reach out on a software platform, attract investors through incentives and even integrate feedback during the development process. The previous blinks have described the vaporization of services, physical products and even entire industries. So you may well be wondering, “How many jobs is this going to take away?” It’s true that, along with the vaporization of human labor, automated robots are already capable of replacing a number of human tasks. At the Henn-na Hotel in Nagasaki, Japan, ten robots are capable of maintaining the hotel by performing a variety of functions, including carrying luggage, changing bed sheets and cleaning rooms. These aren’t exactly desirable jobs, but other fields such as journalism, medicine, law and accounting are also already under threat of becoming automated. In fact, a 2011 Oxford report estimated that 47 percent of all US jobs could soon be automated. This might not be entirely bad news. There are optimists who see automation as a chance to raise the living standards of everyone and expand personal freedoms. But then there are also those who believe that automation will render a large portion of society permanently unemployed. The important question is whether or not automation will destroy more jobs than new forms of businesses can create. Unfortunately, it’s too soon to tell. But what we do know for certain is that our education system is unprepared to deal with the challenge of re-educating and training millions of displaced workers. It was never designed to educate a workforce and teach professional skills, but rather to teach students about abstract ideas. In a vaporized economy, the education system must adapt so that humans perform the tasks that computers can’t handle, like holding student discussions, debating and applying knowledge in novel ways to solve ideas. While we might not be able to prevent the loss of jobs, we can make sure we’re ready and prepared for what lies ahead. The key message in this book: Thanks to the advent of the internet, more and more information is vaporizing – that is, becoming divorced from tangible objects and entering the cloud. By leveraging information from our environment and feeding it into software, we will be able to do ever more things with ever fewer resources. Today, the data a business generates and collects is its primary asset. And the success of future generations may depend on their ability to perform jobs that can’t be automated. Actionable advice: Be aware of the role you play online. Everything you do in a virtual store is tracked. Every offer you notice and respond to is processed and used to build a profile of you. So think twice whether you really need a profile on that shopping site and whether you agree with the access rights of that app you just downloaded. Got feedback?
