[{"title":"Strategic Connections","author":"Anne Baber, Lynne Waymon, André Alphonso, Jim Wylde","summary":"We all know that in the modern business environment, networking is important. Yet, how many of us actually know how to network properly? The truth is, hardly any of us do. Most people associate networking with awkward attempts to chat with colleagues at a dinner party or with competitors at conferences. Perhaps as a result of bad experiences, many of us deliberately avoid the whole process of networking and assume that we are no good at it. But this view of networking is false. There is much more to the process than we think, and these blinks show you exactly why. Reading them will give you the skills and information you need to become a strategic networker. In these blinks, you’ll discover why everyone you know belongs in a particular net; and why you should introduce yourself like James Bond. Unfortunately, many people feel that their jobs or their personalities make networking either unnecessary or impossible. “I’m a doctor,” they say, “I don’t need to network!” Or, “I’m an introvert. Networking just isn’t part of my skill set.” This kind of passive thinking is seriously outdated. The concept of networking has gradually shifted over the years within our changing environment. Today’s workplace is becoming increasingly collaborative. Business today is much less about protecting your ideas or preserving your hard-earned position within the company hierarchy, and much more about spreading novel strategies and working with your colleagues, no matter how far up the totem pole they might be. In this kind of collaborative environment, networking, the process of creating relationships that are beneficial for individual or organizational success, is vital. Today, we have access to people all across the globe whose skills and knowledge complement our own. Whatever you do for work, there is a fair chance that there’s someone out there whose skills would be of great benefit to you. So if you are a doctor, for example, you could look for someone with experience in growing a business, and could help you expand your practice. In this network-oriented world, everyone has a role to play; anyone can develop a networker identity, enabling himself to reap the multiple benefits of an interconnected world. Introverts, for example, might feel that their personalities limit their abilities to network. However, they might also be adept planners and listeners – two qualities that are crucial for networking. Clearly, networking has significant benefits in the modern workplace. The following blinks will show you how to develop the skills that will make you a strategic networker. The first step to becoming a networker is easy, and has everything to do with developing the right mindset. All you have to do, no matter what your job title is, is add “plus networker” to the end of it. So, you’re no longer merely an “accountant” or a “doctor,” but instead an “accountant plus networker” or a “doctor plus networker”. When you accept that networking is part of your professional role, you can then approach it in a strategic way, just as you would your actual professional role. These tips will help you become a better strategic networker: First, be proactive. If you want to be the best networker, don’t sit around and wait for things to happen to you. You have to make moves! Go to conferences, join groups of like-minded people and seek out relationships that could help you and the company you work for. For example, a partner at an architectural firm that specializes in hospital design could join the American Institute of Architects or a hospital administrators’ association. At either organization, she is likely to find plenty of potential contacts that could help her expand and improve her business. Another way to be proactive is to always think about what your personal network can do for your company. Ask your boss if there is anything the company needs help with; maybe the right person for the job is already part of your personal network! You’ll never know unless you ask. Finally, strategic networkers are always ready for chance encounters with potential contacts. Indeed, some of the best contacts you will ever make will be the result of chance encounters. It could be the CEO you meet in the hallway, or the friend of a friend you bump into in the elevator. Make sure you are ready for them by preparing what you might say, thinking about how you might describe your job and deciding what kinds of connections you want to make. So who exactly belongs in your network? Your co-workers? People in the same industry? Your friends and family? It could be any and all of these! In fact, everyone’s network consists of four nets: The WorkNet includes everyone you work with on a daily basis, such as your co-workers. Your OrgNet includes people in other divisions and departments from your organization; these could be your friends in finance or IT. The ProNet includes professional contacts outside your workplace. These could be your colleagues in, say, the national engineers’ association, or your former clients and co-workers. And finally, your LifeNet encompasses your family, friends and even the people you play squash with. Ask yourself how solid your connections are in each of these nets – a good networker has them all covered. However, it’s not enough to simply know people that fall into each of these categories. To develop a strong network you need to develop trusting relationships with the people in your nets. So how do you cultivate trust between you and your contacts? Show them your competencies and character. Demonstrating character is obvious: you simply need to show people that you embody the qualities of a trustworthy person by being honest, open and loyal. Yet even the most honest person won’t be trusted if he isn’t capable of getting the job done – you need to show people that you’re actually good at what you do. Show them your successes from the past and make sure you have the right skills to do your job well. For example, if you work as an HR manager, prove that you can be trusted by showing that you are well organized and a good listener. But no matter what, always remember that building trust takes time. On average, it takes six to eight conversations to build trust with a new contact, so keep at it. You might find that to develop your network, you’ll have to attend a range of events relevant to your field. But it’s not enough for you to just show up. In order to build trusting relationships, you’ll have to actually meet and talk to people. By improving your social acumen you’ll be better equipped to go through the rituals inherent in effective networking. This can be daunting to some people, so here are a few tips to help you manage: Be sure to learn peoples’ names and make sure they remember yours as well. When meeting someone new, repeat your name to her. For example: “I’m Thomas, Thomas Smith.” Likewise, you should repeat her first name in order to better remember it: “It’s nice to meet you, Louise.” Be confident about joining groups. When you arrive at an event it can often seem as if everyone has already formed their cliques – but that’s all in your mind. Don’t think: “I have to break into this group.” Instead think: “This group isn’t complete without me.” Finally, when it’s time to end the conversation with a new contact, find a way to turn it into a greater networking opportunity, both for you and for her. When you’re ready to end your conversation, ask her to introduce you to someone in your field. For example, if you’re an architect, just ask if she knows anyone at the event who is also involved in architecture. You could also introduce your new contact to others: “John, I’d like to introduce you to Laura. She’s also a doctor.” While you’re involved in conversations with new contacts, it’s important to keep focused on building an actual relationship. Pay close attention to what your contact reveals about her character and competencies. Maybe she’s a great accountant, just when your firm is looking for one. It’s natural to feel uncomfortable when talking about yourself. Even so, it’s something you’ll have to get over to become a successful networker. Here are some tips to help you out: When someone asks what you do, answer with more than just your job title. Instead, answer with something that demonstrates your competencies. A good way to do this is to use the Best/Test. First, reveal one skill you want people to remember about you, then come up with an example that backs up that skill. So, you might say, “I make sure software development projects stay on schedule. Due to our precise and timely delivery, IBM is interested in our work.” Another way to help your new contacts remember you and your competencies is to tell them stories. The best stories follow the 5-S story formula. It starts with a segue. Signal that you have something to say. For example, “This great thing happened to me!” Then, describe the situation, “Last week I went to a conference in Paris with my CEO.” Next, introduce the SNAFU, that is, the problem you had to solve: “The night before the conference my boss called to tell me that his wife had just gone into labor. He had to fly back to Berlin to be with her, but there were still nearly 200 people expecting us to present our research the next day.” Then, present your solution: “I suggested that I do the presentation myself, even though the thought terrified me. My boss agreed, and I spent all night practicing.” Finally, explain the experience’s significance by highlighting the positive impact it had on you, on others or on your organization: “The presentation went really well and my boss was very impressed.” If you stick with the 5-S formula, you can be sure to create a memorable story that demonstrates your key qualities and competencies to your new contacts. Today, it seems like new technologies are coming out faster than we can keep up. Just think about how technology has changed our lives even in the past five to ten years. Fortunately, your new networking identity and networking skills give you the tools to enjoy success in a changing environment. In order to be an adaptable networker, you’ll need to follow these three principles: reframe networking, risk reaching out and reinforce collaborative culture. By reframing networking in your mind, you encourage yourself to acknowledge the importance of networking. By committing to your networker identity, you know that you’re far more than your mere job description. Remind yourself that you’re not just your job title; you have plenty of untapped talents. Risking reaching out urges you to leave your comfort zone in order to develop new relationships. Recall your newfound networking skills to help you feel more confident when reaching out to new contacts. Reinforcing the collaborative culture encourages you to act as if you own the organization you work for. If you treat it as your own, you’ll be better equipped to develop strategies to help the company achieve greater success. Finally, remember to apply your face-to-face trust-building strategies online, too. In our modern world, lots of networking is done online, and it’s just as important to keep your word online as in person. Say you’ve received an important query from your boss and you fail to reply as the day’s workload steadily grows. Your boss finally has to remind you to reply a few hours later, but you rush your response and your answer is inaccurate, on top of being late. Do you think she’ll trust you with a similar task in the future? Being as reliable online as you are in person is key to building trust among your contacts. By making these practices part of your everyday life, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a strategic networker. The key message in this book: Networking is more important today than it has ever been, which means that developing networking skills is paramount for today’s workers. You can become a strategic networker by leveraging your contacts in new and creative ways, and fully committing to your networker identity.

And the pleasures of stretching needn’t be limited to the physical realm. At work, you can stretch your mind by looking for creative solutions, being proactive about developing tasks that really interest you and interacting as much as possible with your coworkers and, during breaks, with other friends and acquaintances. Though fun, stretching is not always easy. Many office workers end up a crumpled, dispirited heap, gazing listlessly at their computer screens without any idea of what to do. It’s almost as if they’re just waiting to get fired. So how do you avoid this and become an alert and excited person instead? In these blinks, we’ll explore how to remain open and motivated in the workplace; how to multiply career options and opportunities; and how to bounce back strong after a career setback. Before entering the professional world, you are surrounded by parents and teachers who can point you in the right direction and straighten you out if you get off track. But after college, you’re more or less on your own, even though there’s still a great deal of growing, or stretching, that needs to be done. That’s why there are three stretch imperatives that every professional hoping to stay at the top of the game should keep in mind. The first stretch imperative is to remember that you are in control. If you’re unhappy with a job, it can be easy to blame your boss or be too lazy to do anything about it. But this isn’t good for you or your employer. Let’s look at a typical career: You graduate from college and decide to pick up a job in construction because you thought you might enjoy working with your hands. But after a while you realize that you’d rather work with people. What do you do? You take control and find another job, this time as a camp counselor. But here you realize you’d rather work with adults instead of kids, so you decide to work in sales instead. And this leads us to the second stretch imperative: Give yourself options and broaden your horizons so that you have a healthy amount of possible opportunities. Let’s say you hate your boss in the sales department but you don’t have the qualifications for anything else. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, you take action. You sign up for adult education classes and earn a second or third degree, such as an MBA. And this brings us to the third stretch imperative: Setting goals. These don’t have to be related to your career; they just need to be realistic goals that will help you stay on track, especially during tough times. Everyone hits a rough patch at one point or another in their career. When you hit one, remember that gaining experiences is always productive and will help you in the search for what’s right for you. If you’ve worked at enough office jobs, then you’re surely familiar with the unhappy employee who dozes off at his desk, despite a veritable drip feed of caffeine. No one wants to be this employee. In fact, the best kind of employee is the polar opposite of dissatisfied and slumberous. She’s alert and engaged, learning on the job and continuing to develop her skill set. If you have a full-time job, then you know how hard it can be to continue your education in the small amount of spare time you do have. That’s why you must learn on the job. Let’s look at Jonah, who got a job as a teacher, but began to worry after realizing how difficult his work really was. He knew he needed to improve, but he had no time to get more training. So he took matters into his own hands. Jonah performed a self-assessment and realized that he needed to be more organized, so he began interviewing other teachers on how he could better structure his class. He also recognized that too much class time was spent with him talking, and that students learned more when they had time to practice. So he shortened his lectures and created more practical exercises that allowed his students to develop their skills. The results were great: Jonah is now training other teachers and on track to becoming the next school principal. The key is that Jonah was open to change and feedback, a quality that is essential to keeping yourself from getting stuck in a career rut. Chris, a frustrated executive trainer who was having trouble connecting with his trainees, is another good example of the benefits of openness. Despite the trouble he was having, Chris remained open with his boss and receptive to the feedback he received. This allowed Chris and his boss to work together and pinpoint the problem. Eventually it became clear that Chris wasn’t listening to his trainees. He’d developed a habit of criticizing their ideas before they could fully explain themselves. By being open to change and feedback, Chris learned that being a leader isn’t about him – it’s about being part of a team. And once he began listening to his team members, his leadership skills greatly improved. It’s generally a good idea to give yourself options. Most people don’t apply to only one college or send out applications to only one job. They put their eggs in multiple baskets. Use the same approach for your career and increase your options by utilizing a broad network of contacts. Everyone has at least two different kinds of contacts: professional colleagues and personal friends. Both can be used to provide more options as your career progresses. For example, Zach started out in a marketing company, working day and night and never taking the time to develop a social life or expand his contact list. And when Zach decided to strike out on his own, he was working even longer hours, but still not giving any attention to his contacts – even though he was growing quite concerned about his lack of clients. Luckily he had one good personal contact – his dad, who was an experienced entrepreneur and recognized his problem right away. He explained to Zack the importance of having good contacts, especially in the world of sales. Sure enough, after focusing on his network and sharpening his social skills, Zach’s company began to thrive. Another way to increase your career options is to collect a variety of experiences. You may not have a clear idea of what you want to do with your life, so why not try a number of different jobs and discover what’s out there? Alexandra did exactly this after earning a graduate degree in international relations and feeling disillusioned after working for a financial service company during the 2008 economic crisis. As Alexandra began to reflect on what she wanted to do with her life, she realized she had a real passion for nature and conservation. She was drawn to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, and began reaching out to people from the organization and adding them to her network. Those within Lewa recognized that Alexandra’s experience in finance and international relations could be a great benefit, so they hired her as an international-development manager. And with Lewa on her résumé, Alexandra was able to add nature conservation to her growing list of experiences. When your career hits rock bottom, one of two things can happen to it: it can either shatter like a glass or bounce back to new heights like a rubber ball. With the right frame of mind, you can turn a career setback into the start of a new chapter. If you lose your job, there’s no reason to give up – especially if you have your network in place and remember that you’re still in control. So keep in mind that any setback can be an opportunity to gain experiences and propel forward movement. Even when things look bleak, you can come soaring back. All it takes is the right amount of positive determination. When journalist Jill Abramson was run over by a truck in New York City, she had to face an enormous uphill battle to learn how to walk again. But that’s exactly what she did, because she never gave up her belief that she could accomplish the goals she set for herself. And not only did she get back on her feet; she went on to become the first female executive director of the New York Times. To help you hold on to your goals when times are tough, here are three “ounces” of advice: The first is to pounce. You’ve got to keep learning and takings risks. Don’t worry about looking dumb or falling on your face. It’s far more important to stay curious and always be asking questions. The second is to trounce. Keep practicing and developing your skills no matter how many times you fail. It’s not about reaching perfection, it’s about continuing to grow and knowing that sooner or later your continual practice will pay off. The third is to announce. Share both your goals and difficulties with your peers. This will keep you focused on reaching those goals as well as on improving yourself. After all, it’s easy to let a goal slip away if you’re the only one who knows about it, so improve your chances of following through by letting the world know what you’re aiming for. It’s common for people to have anxieties about an unpredictable future, but when you take the right steps toward becoming aware and prepared, you can rest easy. One thing’s for sure: Whatever career path you are currently on will change within your lifetime. Everything about the traditional workday is changing. The hours are becoming more flexible just as companies are becoming less tied down to physical locations. Even universities are responding to the constant changes by regularly updating their programs to match emerging fields. Indeed, both universities and corporations know how important it is for adults to keep learning new skills. Georgia Tech, Udacity and AT&T, in an effort to keep the US workforce up to date and competitive, have pooled their resources to create a relatively accessible master’s degree program in computer science that only costs $7,000. Workplace hierarchies are flattening out these days, so it’ll also be to your advantage if you can show employers that you come with your own leadership skills and the ability to turn visions into reality. Ideally, this should also include a strong capacity to collaborate and work with social media. But being prepared for the future requires non-technical skills as well. You shouldn’t underestimate emotional intelligence as a key part of your continued development, which means learning how to accurately understand and respond to the emotions of others. After all, it’s not just the economy that’s changing; people are changing, too. Lady Gaga recognized this a few years ago. In 2012, she launched the Born This Way Foundation to promote emotional intelligence, well-being and kindness in schools. So if you really want to secure your place in tomorrow’s workforce, develop a sharp emotional intelligence. It will allow you to explain how your personality complements your skills, making you an indispensable asset for any company. The key message in this book: In order to stay competitive in the future, you have to keep learning today. So stay current and observe the changes going on around you. With the right perspective, you can stay ahead of the curve while simultaneously collecting contacts, experiences and furthering your education. With this foresight, you’ll be in a good position no matter what lays ahead. Actionable advice: Become helpful instead of doleful. If you don’t feel like you’re being useful at your workplace, don’t just sit there being depressed. Find at least one thing that you can do to make someone’s life a little easier at work. If you’re not sure how to do that, observe your coworkers with genuine interest and curiosity. This will help you develop empathy, grow your network and gain new inspiration for ways in which you can be more engaged and happy at work. Got feedback?

It’s taken for granted that bigger is better. As a result, we spend our lives chasing rewards, trying to accumulate resources and desiring what others have. There are obvious drawbacks to this outlook when it comes to happiness and peace, but the truth is it’s not even a recipe for success. In reality, you’re much better off focusing on what you can accomplish with what you’ve already got. That’s why you should adopt a new perspective. These blinks explain why you should forget about chasing, and start thinking about stretching. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to stretch your resources to the limit; why planning isn’t necessarily good; and how your self-expectations influence your success.   If you saw your neighbor driving home in a shiny new car, how would it make you feel? For most people, the sight might cause a pang of jealousy. After all, the entire human conception of success is based on having better stuff than others. This habit is called chasing and it pushes us to pursue things we don’t actually need. For instance, researchers at Vanderbilt University found that people literally tend to perceive their neighbor’s lawn as greener than their own. It may be a cliché, but, in the popular imagination, a healthy green lawn means success and prosperity. The desire for such status symbols is in fact so powerful that people work tirelessly to have the best lawn in the neighborhood. However, the results are often for naught: Meticulously manicuring your lawn necessarily means diverting resources from what makes you truly happy! So what’s the solution? Well, on the other end of the spectrum from chasing is what’s called the stretcher mindset. In a nutshell, it refers to focusing on what you want to accomplish with the resources at your disposal. In order to have a stretcher mindset, the first step is to feel assured that you’re in control. For example, say you work in a clothing store. Retail can be soul crushing, but by simply imagining yourself as the owner of the store you can boost your confidence in an instant. Just thinking that you’re in charge of the circumstances will help you seize the reins and tap into your creativity. Beyond that, staying mindful of the situation at hand and the resources at your disposal will compel you to be creative with what you’ve got. In other words, you’ll have to recognize your limits and, once you know what you can and can’t do, you’ll be able to creatively pursue the options before you. That’s why studies have found that teams with a deadline or budget produce better results than those with more open-ended parameters. When making an important decision, whether it’s choosing a new IT system at the office or a medical treatment for an illness in the family, people tend to place their trust in experts. However, experts aren’t always the most reliable people. In fact, traditional experts often don’t have the best perspective. For instance, in 20 years of analyzing political issues, the psychologist Phil Tetlock found that experts aren’t any better at predicting future events than your average person, regardless of their professional experience. Whether people were liberal or conservative, optimistic or pessimistic, the results were the same. In most cases, the experts and non-experts offered comparable prognoses. In fact, professional experience can actually be a hindrance. As people gain experience, they also become stuck in their knowledge, unable to move past conventional approaches. As a result, outsiders tend to overshadow experts. Outsiders are newcomers to a field, people who lack deep experience. Naturally, you can’t be a newcomer at all times, but you can think like an outsider. It’s as easy as following four steps: First, explore the world and experience new things that help you see them from a different angle. For example, if you’re a political expert, you might go to a musical, watch a cartoon or do something that’s entirely unrelated to the political world. But you also need to stay in touch with what you already know, which is the second step. Of course, you can’t know everything about your field, so work to share your ideas with others, seeking feedback and learning as you go. From there you can move on to the third step: looking for solutions outside of your own domain. The design company IDEO offers a good example. They have an open office in which employees hear about the problems and innovations of other departments, thereby inspiring them to find solutions to their own problems. And finally, whatever ideas and innovations you do develop, it’s key to constantly test your assumptions, expecting that most of them will fail. Whether it’s for a summer vacation or a work project, most people love having a plan. Planning offers a comfortable roadmap to follow, ensuring that we’ll achieve the best results. But there’s a downside, too. Planning can also cause us to miss out on all kinds of beneficial things. Often, people learn more by acting than by planning. For instance, the Stanford professor Kathy Eisenhardt found that executive teams who make more rapid-fire decisions tend to collect more information and generate more alternatives than those with long and detailed plans. That’s because quick-acting teams focus on the present, working with real-time information about their work and competition. Planners, on the other hand, tend to spend most of their time and energy trying to figure out what the future might look like. Beyond that, planning can cause us to miss valuable information that’s right in front of our eyes. After all, burying your head in project planning can make it difficult to notice your surroundings. Just take an experiment by the psychologist Malcolm Brenner. Brenner asked participants to speak and listen simultaneously. He found that, as it came time for a subject to speak, it was common for her to block out outside information. She directed her energy to what she was planning to say. The same thing happened as participants finished speaking. They would reflect on what they had said, missing how others were reacting to their words. Simply put, whether it’s for a project or for what to say next, planning causes us to miss out on the world unfolding around us. That’s why, instead of planning, stretchers embrace improvisation as the key to progress. After all, when we improvise, we free ourselves up to move and use resources in the most efficient way. We can bend, stretch and position ourselves relative to challenges in the world, making the actions we take all the more effective. People often act as we expect they will – a fact that can have a major effect on our interpersonal interactions. Expectations influence experience, and they can define relationships, too. Our expectations are essentially images of people or things that we haven’t yet encountered. Just imagine a new employee joins your company. You haven’t so much as spoken to him but your coworker assures you that he’s a jerk. When you do meet this new colleague, you’ll likely treat him differently than if you hadn’t heard anything about him. However, expectations shape more than just first impressions. They also direct feelings in ongoing relationships. Consider the example above. Now that you have a bad impression of your new officemate, you might send him signals that express these negative feelings. As you ask him rude questions or adopt a cold tone when speaking with him, you’ll eventually lead him to view you as a jerk as well. So expectations can damage your relationships with others, but the expectations you hold about yourself can also affect the way you handle challenging situations. That’s because having lower expectations about your abilities will lead you to see challenges as threats, making it harder for you to rise to the occasion. Such a mindset can have a pretty bad effect. Being scared or mistrusting your ability will lead to hesitation and passivity. As a result, when faced with a challenge – say, the chance to give a speech at a conference – you’ll shrink away from the opportunity. Instead of welcoming a new experience, you’ll block yourself and choose to remain passive instead. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Stretchers know that you can overcome such obstacles by developing positive self-expectations, leading to a transformation that allows you to see challenges as opportunities. If you regard that speech as an opportunity to demonstrate your skills at the podium, you’ll not only take on the task, you’ll also gain new skills and open up greater resources for future growth. Whether it’s a morning coffee ritual or an evening stroll, everyday routines give you a structure that helps you accomplish more things in a shorter time. That being said, people also tend to see routines as boring and inflexible. So how can you get the most out of your routine without letting it bog you down? It’s simple, actually: add a touch of creativity. This will help you transform the way you understand your routine and the way it functions. Stretchers do this on a regular basis by mixing up combinations in their routine work. In other words, you can do the same exact things every day and, as long as your individuality shines through, always feel that your work is new and exciting. For instance, you could probably get your kid’s lunch ready for school on autopilot. But if you adopt a stretcher mindset, you might think to add a little note to your son’s lunch, wishing him a great day. This little touch of creativity will make him happier and get you out of your routine without disrupting your day. Injecting a dose of creativity can do wonders for a stretcher and a similar approach can be used to challenge your assumptions about competitors. For most people, competitors are there to be beaten. But this outlook isn’t necessarily conducive to coexisting with competitors. A better strategy is to treat them like friends. Working to beat the competition may be a great motivation, but it’s not as good as working together. Just take the professors Paul Ingram and Peter Roberts, both of whom studied hotel managers. They found that managers who were friends with their competitors brought in 15 percent more revenue than those without other manager friends. These friendships positively impacted the work of the managers by giving them greater access to knowledge about their field and prospective clients. It’s just one more reason to break down mental barriers, get creative and focus on building relationships. Now that you’ve got a sense of what it takes to be a successful stretcher, it’s time for another important lesson: how to avoid overstretching. Without this knowledge about how to keep yourself in check, you’ll risk injuring yourself or others. To stay safe, just avoid these common mistakes: The first way that people tend to overstretch is by becoming a cheapskate. For instance, while carefully managing your resources is key to being a stretcher, there’s a limit to how far you can go. Remember, the difference between being economical and being a cheapskate is that the former saves to invest in something meaningful while the latter is scared of spending any money at all. The second risk is that of spreading yourself too thin or looking in too many directions at once. To avoid going down paths that have nothing to offer, you should make your career your number-one priority. Become a specialist in your field and learn everything you can about it. Once you’ve established that base, you can begin exploring new ideas. Third, keep in mind that changes can often be helpful, but only after you’ve properly analyzed the past. Without this reflection, you risk leaping without learning. In other words, failure is a great way to learn, but only if you properly consider what went wrong. For instance, if your business goes bankrupt, you should certainly prepare to found a new one, but only after you understand why your first attempt went belly up. Fourth, while you know now that having high expectations can foster confidence and courage, having unrealistically high expectations is a recipe for disaster. Nobody expects to run a marathon after their first jog, so be realistic about your goals. Otherwise, you’ll risk disappointment at every turn, no matter how much you succeed. And, finally, when mixing up your routine, make sure that you strike a balance between novelty and usefulness. Without a good mix of the two, you’ll be in danger of producing a toxic mixture that will kill innovation. As people age, they start to learn that working out is necessary to avoid injuries, and the same goes for stretchers. But instead of hitting the gym, the ticket here is to work on balance, specifically between your existing resources and your exploration of new things. Look around and identify the resources you have at your disposal but haven’t used. This can turn up all kinds of gems. For instance, a recent Indiana University study found that the most important scientific papers were “sleeping beauties,” papers that were published but forgotten. Identifying your own sleeping beauties is crucial. You’ve got to ask the right question, namely, what personal resources, skills, connections or ideas have you left unused? Make a list of all these resources along with their potential to help you advance an objective and you’ll have a good sense of where to focus. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to explore new things. Just set aside a few hours each week to read something new, go to a workshop or spend time working with new colleagues. You never know what kind of ideas you’ll stumble upon. But flexing those balancing muscles won’t be effective if you don’t also take breaks to be grateful for all the hard work you’ve done. After all, too much concentration can be a disaster for creativity. If you feel overwhelmed by your work, you should take a breather. Get out of the office. Spend some casual time with a client. Take an afternoon stroll. This last one is great because it’s simple and effective. A group of Stanford University psychologists even found that people who take a walk during their breaks are 81 percent more efficient compared to those who sit. Another great way to decompress is by spending time reflecting on what you’re grateful for. This can be as simple as setting aside time once a week to write down five things in your life that make you feel gratitude. This will help you see the overall picture, and remind you what it is you’re stretching toward. The key message in this book: You have all the resources you need to be successful right in front of you, it’s just a matter of identifying and prioritizing them. So, rather than chasing after what other people have, focus on what you’ve got and expand from there. Look at things like a newcomer, beware the pitfalls of planning, get creative with your routine, be sure not to overstretch and engage in some mental workouts. And when you need a breather, remember what you’re grateful for. Actionable advice: Take a moment to reflect. The next time you find yourself rushing into a new project, take a few days off for a trip. Get out of your environment and break free from your routine. By taking this space, you’ll be able to reflect on what you learned from your last project, how your plan went and whether having a plan for this project even makes sense. Got feedback?

Chances are, you’ll find row upon row of titles. The self-help and self-improvement market is truly massive – because people really want to know what will make them better, more successful people. And yet, of the thousands of titles, only a few have become classics. Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude is one of them.  Though hatched way back in the 1950s, the book’s ideas are still relevant today. They show you how anyone can become a success, just by adopting a positive way of thinking. These blinks highlight some of those ideas. Read on and start your journey toward a new, successful life. Also find out how a positive mental attitude allowed Henry Ford to change the world; how a swamp became one of America’s greatest entertainment spots; and why the Wright brothers succeeded where all others failed. To many of us, success is a mysterious thing. Is it the result of favorable conditions over which we have no real control? Does it come down to knowing the right people, or having the right timing? No, no and no. In fact, success is about having a positive mental attitude (PMA).  The level of your success directly corresponds to whether you nurture your PMA – or its rival, your negative mental attitude (NMA). People with PMA are success magnets. They approach life with positivity, and they’re unfazed by failures or mistakes; in fact, they see missteps as opportunities. To someone with a PMA, each failure is a step that brings you closer to a solution. Because they’re unafraid of failure, such people are unafraid of trying, even if success seems unlikely. They’re eager to try, and hungry for self-improvement. Those with a PMA achieve greatness because they burn to accomplish new goals and ascend to new heights. Take Henry Ford, a prime example a man with a PMA. He wanted to develop a cheap V8 engine suitable for mass production. Hitherto, eight cylinder engines were only used in luxury cars, and Ford’s engineers criticized his dream, claiming it was impossible. Nevertheless, he continued to fight for his idea, and after a year, he achieved the unachievable: the mass production of the V8 prototype.  The V8 was a massive hit – the innovation that established Ford’s brand, making him one of the most successful businessmen in history. And all thanks to his PMA.  The great news is, it’s never too late to improve your mental outlook. Anyone who starts working at the age of 25 will work roughly 100,000 hours before retiring at around the age 67. This means you have plenty of time to start cultivating your PMA. Success is all about confronting and solving problems. Just think of history’s greatest minds and business moguls: behind every great invention or innovation was a problem that someone faced and tried to solve. It’s precisely our mental attitude that dictates how we handle problems. When you encounter a challenge, do you resign yourself to failure and throw your hands up, or do you find the positive in the problem and take it upon yourself to fix it? Obviously, those who succeed adopt a PMA and therefore take the more productive approach. Conversely, those with a NMA will fall short of their goals, as they admit defeat at the first sign of trouble – when their prototype fails, for example, or when a potential investor turns them down. People who care about developing their PMA see setbacks as a challenge to be taken. So, instead of giving up, they try harder. This reaction is known as inspirational dissatisfaction, and those who have it use it to rise above even the most desperate and hopeless situations. Even serving time can be a positive opportunity, as a man named Charlie Ward taught us. During his time in prison, Ward was able to change his NMA to a PMA. This shift won him the respect of both inmates and prison guards, and he moved up in the prison hierarchy. During this time, he met the industrialist Herbert Bigelow, who was serving time for tax fraud. Bigelow was so impressed by Ward that he promised him a decent job after he was released. Sure enough, when Ward was released, he got that job. Furthermore, after Bigelow died, Ward became CEO of the company and died a millionaire. So literally any problem, whether professional or personal, can be conquered with a PMA.  Maybe you’ve learned to live with some sort of visual impairment. But what if you suffer from mental near- or farsightedness? Such dysfunctional mentality will bar your way to success. So what is mental nearsightedness? It means you’re unable to see the possibilities lying in your future. Perhaps you fail to understand the importance of planning and having goals to strive for, or you waste all your energy tackling problems that are right in front of you, and are blind to the bigger picture. But being able to plan for the future is one of our biggest evolutionary advantages. Take Dick Pope, a man who wasn’t blinded by mental nearsightedness. Pope saw an opportunity to build a tourist attraction on the farmland surrounding the town of Winter Haven, Florida, where others saw nothing but desolate swampland. So he bought an old cypress swamp and turned it into the now famous Cypress Gardens. He also offered photography equipment and free advice on taking pictures, giving tourists the joy of going home with wonderful pictures to show their friends, thereby spreading word of the gardens. And it’s not just nearsightedness that hurts your success: mentally farsighted people have problems, too. They want to leap immediately to the top. They dream of the future but forget to work on the things they need to get there. Consequently, they fail to reach their goals and don't take the opportunities that are right in front of them every day. And such everyday opportunities are often the most lucrative. Consider the paper clip or the Post-It note. Both are simple designs to solve a tiny, yet widespread problem. People who recognize such everyday problems can generate millions. Mentally farsighted people never grasp this. So, if you want to be successful, you must notice the opportunities in front of you, but also plan out how you want to make your mark on the world. A PMA gives you a solid grounding for success but it must be accompanied by determination and motivation. Rather than blaming all your difficulties on the world, you should set about changing it into a place you want to live in. When you feel determined to make a difference, your motivation will soar, which will allow you to reach new heights in your life. Someone who embodied passionate determination and motivation is farmer Milo Jones. Due to a severe illness, Jones became paralyzed. Although his body no longer served him, his head was working overtime and he began figuring out how to accomplish certain tasks in the most effective way. With this motivation, determination and PMA, he managed to convert his little corn farm into an empire that sold Jones' Little Pork Sausages, which made him a millionaire. But keep in mind that along with your determination, you’ll also need goals. It’s best to write your goals down and attach a deadline to them. For example, noting what you want to achieve by the end of the year. The higher you set your goals, the more you’ll fight for them and the more you’ll achieve.  If you have a particularly challenging goal, you should break it down into smaller goals that you can achieve in the next week or month to build up to the end goal. So, for example, if your dream is to learn Spanish, a lofty goal would be speaking it perfectly, which may take years. But when divided into smaller goals, like ordering your first beer successfully or reading a novel in Spanish, these smaller triumphs will help you stay focused and motivated. Our actions are the result of our conscious decisions, right? Well, not quite. Our subconscious mind wields a powerful influence over us, too, affecting our dreams, desires and needs, as well as driving our behavior. Thankfully, we can harness this subconscious power and use it to our advantage using autosuggestion. With autosuggestion, we can anchor goals and wishes to our subconscious. This, in turn, will influence our thoughts and, thus, our life. Whether it’s about health, finances or relationships, autosuggestion can help us reach any of our goals. So how do you do this? You can start by reading a sentence aloud twice a day, for instance about how much money you wish to earn this year. Your subconscious will remember this and influence your conscious mind to seek out things that will get you there, such as new work opportunities. The same method applies to adapting your mental attitude. If you tell yourself that you’ll feel happier every day, this feeling will gain momentum and, after a while, your mental attitude will show a vast improvement, and you’ll feel happier. One man named Bill McCall was a master of autosuggestion. McCall lived in Sydney, he was 21, his business had gone under and he had failed at running for Federal Congress. But instead of admitting defeat, he resolved to use the power of autosuggestion: he wrote down that, by 1960, he wanted to be a millionaire. After some years of repeating this goal to himself, McCall became not only the youngest man in history to become a member of Parliament, but also the chairman of 22 family-owned corporations – oh, and he also became a millionaire. Once you’re able to internalize your positive mental attitude in this way and can use autosuggestion effectively, you’ll be better equipped to overcome any obstacle with determination and optimism.  We’ve seen how we can have more control over our mind, but what about our behavior? Good actions are what make us good people – and improving the way we act is merely a matter of the right training. We know that our feelings influence our actions. But the converse is also true: our actions influence our feelings. So by modifying our behavior, we can influence and change our feelings. Just consider Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. Franklin worked hard at bettering himself and his behavior. He would will himself to alter his behavior for a period of time – practicing abstinence or frugality or moderation until he’d mastered that particular virtue. Once he felt competent in one virtue, he’d set about mastering the next. We should all take a leaf out of Franklin’s book. For example, if you wish to have a more moderate life, practice moderation for a few weeks. Don't overindulge in fatty foods, and don't get blind drunk if you already feel good after one glass of wine. By changing our behavior in this way, we change ourselves, too. And the more we work on these virtues, the more they become part of us. You can even train your preferences. Let’s say you want to stop eating chocolate because you know it’s unhealthy. You could start by not binge-eating two bars every time you sit on the couch to watch the news after work. This simple change will have you feeling healthier and help you pay more attention to your bodily needs. Eventually, you’ll actually prefer not eating that chocolate. You can also train yourself out of procrastination by heading straight to work instead of fussing around for hours over needless activities. Just a few weeks of doing this will start to make this new behavior part of your personality and prevent your bad habits from sabotaging your life. Oftentimes, our plans don’t quite come to fruition because one last piece of the puzzle was missing – the crowning glory that would’ve made your project a huge success. People with a PMA know that they always need to be on the lookout for this last piece. Everyone who can see their final goal on the horizon should stop and ask themselves what this last piece might be. If you let a negative attitude creep into your thinking, failure is a sure thing. But if you failed, think about it and be frank with yourself – what more could you have done? And what is that special something that could take your project even further? The Wright brothers were great at doing precisely this. They succeeded where others had failed because they possessed strong PMAs. Instead of being disheartened when their airplane designs failed, they spotted that missing piece: movable flaps mounted on the plane’s wings! These flaps enabled the pilot to place the wings in various positions and keep the plane steady. This piece would have been forever lost had the brothers had an NMA, and their dreams would have never seen the light of day. When looking for the missing piece, an unconventional approach is sometimes the best approach. When trying to brainstorm new ideas, many of us sit down with a pen and paper and expect ideas to magically descend upon us. Then, when we become distracted, our focus slips and we lose time and potentially great ideas. So why not try an unconventional route and focus your mind completely? For example, American inventor Dr. Gates used to lock himself in a small, dark, soundproof room so that he could concentrate on a solution to a problem. Only when he had an idea did he switch on the light and jot down a possible solution. When it comes to motivation, we all play two roles – we’re motivated by others and, in turn, give others motivation. First, though, you need to be able to motivate yourself. Motivation is what governs your choices; without it you won’t make any progress toward success. Therefore, it’s paramount to your journey. To ignite your motivation, list all the things you want to achieve as well as by when you want to achieve them, and then go out and change your habits. There are many ways to get motivated, but the key is simply to get moving. Don’t sit back down after reading this and tell yourself you’ll get around to it later. Get up! And while you’re at it, why not try helping someone else, too? For a wonderful example of the interplay and exchange of motivation, let’s look to parent-child relationships. As babies, children motivate their parents to take care of them and parents nurture their children by caring for and supporting them, which fosters trust. Thomas Edison, for example, was always rallied by the trust his mother instilled in him, even when he was a misbehaving, insubordinate student! She stood by her son, even when he was allegedly failing. In order to effectively motivate someone with trust, whether child or adult, you must give her active faith. That is, actually voice to the other person that you believe in them and that they have your trust and support. Simply maintaining passive trust isn’t motivating, because the person won’t be able to detect it! So, if you want an employee to know that you’re assigning them an important task, speak to them. Say that the fate of the project is in their hands because they can be trusted with it. Finally, as a bonus to motivating others, the more of your PMA you can offer to other people, the more others will reciprocate. The key message in this book: A positive mental attitude, coupled with the right habits and the right approach to your goals, will help you achieve anything you set out to do. And that’s really all there is to success! Actionable advice: Trade in your NMA for a PMA. What are you unhappy about in your life? If you think a negative mental attitude is the reason behind your dissatisfaction, why not make some small, positive changes to your thinking? You could start small, adjusting your thinking in one area of life, such as work, and build up from there! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Let’s take each word in turn. Worldliness means being concerned with ordinary life. Wisdom, on the other hand, implies knowledge of the big picture when it comes to life as a whole. But there’s more to it than that.  Simply knowing lots of isolated facts isn’t particularly useful. As the American investor Charlie Munger once put it, “If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in useable form.”  And that’s our definition: worldly wisdom is about plugging our knowledge about life into theoretical models that illuminate everyday problems. So where do you find those models?  Well, that’s exactly the question Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann set out to answer. Drawing on economics, physics, philosophy and a host of other disciplines, these blinks present a set of mental models that will help you understand the world, make better decisions and take your thinking to the next level. Along the way, you’ll learn  what a fourteenth-century philosopher can teach you about dating;  why avoiding errors is more important than being right; and  what an Israeli daycare center can teach us about reciprocity.  We make dozens of decisions every day. They aren’t all big decisions, but enough bad calls can cumulatively result in overdrawn bank accounts, unhappy marriages and dead-end jobs. That means that every decision counts.  Life, however, is full of complicated conundrums and ambiguous evidence. Making up our minds often feels less like an act of reason than a stab in the dark.  Surely there’s a better way? Well, there is – super thinking, a way of understanding the world that relies on proven cognitive blueprints to make sense of the jumble of data out there.  Let’s unpack that. Every industry has its own mental models that allow practitioners to create “mental pictures” of a problem. These aren’t one-off snapshots, but techniques that can be reapplied time and again – that’s the “model” part. Put differently, they’re recurring concepts that explain the world. Most mental models are pretty rarefied and used only by specialists. Others are much more widely applicable. These super models can help us make sense of everyday life. Take critical mass. Physicists use it to describe the minimum amount of nuclear mass needed to create a critical state that triggers a nuclear chain reaction. But it’s also a handy model in other contexts, like that of technological change.  Fax machines were invented in the 1840s, but languished in obscurity for over a century. Why? Their cost meant only a few wealthy individuals and organizations could afford to adopt the technology. That affected the perceived value of faxing: even if you bought a machine, you wouldn’t be able to communicate with anyone you knew.  As the cost came down, more people bought fax machines and more connections became possible. To put that into numbers, two devices can make one connection, five can make ten and twelve can make sixty-six. By the 1970s, faxing had reached critical mass. There were enough machines that the network itself became useful – if you had your own device, chances were you’d be able to contact anyone.  Contemporary businesses have made a killing leveraging that insight. Critical mass told ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, for example, how many drivers they needed in cities before people would begin relying on their services.  That’s not the only super model that you can use to cut through complexity. In the following blinks, we’ll be looking at a ton of shortcuts to help you boost your cognitive performance. How we look at something determines the way we think about it. Take it from nineteenth-century German mathematician Carl Jacobi. His motto? “Invert, always invert,” which means that it’s often easier to solve a problem when you approach it from the opposite or “inverse” point of view.  Investors, for instance, usually assume their aim is to make money. But Jacobi would say that it’s actually to avoid losing money. That goes for decision-making, too. Common sense says that making better calls is about being right more often; inversion tells us it’s actually about being wrong less often. That means avoiding what tennis players call unforced errors – mistakes caused by your own sloppiness rather than your opponent’s brilliance. Imagine returning a weak serve straight into the net and you get the idea.  Avoiding unforced errors involves paying attention to the way you reason things out. This is called arguing from first principles, and it’s all about thinking from the bottom up, starting with assumptions you’re sure are true. Elon Musk, the founder of the automotive and energy company Tesla, defines this as boiling things down to “fundamental truths” and going from there.  When Musk was looking into battery packs for his self-driving vehicles, for example, he was told that he’d never get the price below $600 per kilowatt-hour. He wasn’t convinced. First principles led him to pose two questions: What do you need to make battery packs, and how much do those materials cost on the stock market?  The answer was cobalt, nickel, aluminium, carbon, polymer and a seal can, each of which costs the equivalent of $80 per kilowatt-hour. Musk realized that the solution was to buy the materials directly and produce his own cells. The result? Cheaper batteries than anyone had previously thought possible.  You can also apply bottom-up reasoning to everyday decisions. Take job hunting. Lots of people waste energy applying for far too many positions, and then jump at the first opportunity that comes their way. First principles suggest a different approach.  Before sending your résumé out, sit down and define your values. Is independence, status or money most important to you? Next, lay down your red lines – how far you’re prepared to commute, say, or the least-senior position you’re willing to accept. Finally, check those values against existing positions. That’s inversion in action: you’re not asking which jobs are available, but which ones suit your needs! We’ve just seen that solid reasoning is built on fundamental truths, but how do you know those are correct? It’s an age-old question. The second-century Roman astronomer Ptolemy, for example, argued that it was a “good principle to explain phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible.” Twelve hundred years later, the English philosopher William of Ockham reached the same conclusion: when confronted with equally plausible and competing assumptions, the simpler is more likely to be true. Call it Ockham’s razor. The idea is to “shave off” unnecessarily intricate explanations. In other words, think horses, not zebras, when you hear hoofbeats.  It’s a model with plenty of useful applications. Take dating. The rise of dating apps and websites has made it easier than ever to apply highly specific filters to potential mates. To exaggerate slightly, lots of people are looking for blue-eyed Brazilians who love hot yoga and raspberry ice cream. It’s not exactly an impossible combination, but it does limit your dating pool. Ockham’s razor suggests that this is overcomplicating things. We all know from past experience that it’s possible to get along with someone even if they prefer chocolate to raspberry and have brown rather than blue eyes. If they’re not funny, attractive or interesting, on the other hand, it’s hardly likely to work out. And even if not loving hot yoga is a deal breaker, it still makes more sense to add that filter back in later on; in the beginning, stick to the basics.  That’s also a great way of beating common logical traps. In 1983, the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman presented a now-famous thought experiment that considered the following: Linda is 31, single, outspoken and clever. She studied philosophy and attended demonstrations at university. Which is more likely: that Linda is a bank teller or that Linda is a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement?  Most people plump for the second option. That’s an example of the conjunction fallacy in action. This states that the probability of two events occurring in “conjunction” is always less than or equal to the probability of one event occurring alone. Remember: not all bank tellers are feminists. To go back to dating, what’s more likely – finding a mate who makes you laugh or finding someone who is funny and shares your exact cultural preferences, down to ice cream flavors? The answer tells you why it pays to simplify assumptions! Working out other people’s motivations is tricky, especially when they’re strangers. The upshot? We jump to unfair conclusions. If a colleague sends us a curt one-line email, we think he’s being dismissive and discount the idea that he might just be in a rush.  Psychologists call that a fundamental attribution error: While we explain our own behavior by looking to our intentions and external circumstances, we ascribe other people’s actions to essential characteristics. If you run a red light, it’s because you need to get to the hospital; if another driver does it, it’s because she’s inherently reckless.  That’s why it’s a good idea to rethink your assumptions, which is where Hanlon’s razor comes in. This model states that you should never attribute to malice what can be more easily explained by carelessness. Is your neighbor playing loud music to annoy you? Unlikely – he’s probably just forgotten how thin the walls are. If you want to go a step farther and think more objectively, you can use the veil of ignorance. That’s the name of a model developed by the American philosopher John Rawls in his 1971 book A Theory of Justice. Here’s how it works: Birth is a lottery. Some people luck out and are blessed with a wealth of opportunities; others go empty-handed. That doesn’t stop us believing that our own privileges and others’ disadvantages are deserved. This, Rawls argued, distorts our understanding of fairness.  But imagine you had to design a fair society without knowing where you’d end up in it. Rawls concluded that if you couldn’t be sure whether you’d be born a slave or a free person, you’d decide that slavery itself was unfair. Put differently, you’d take the feelings and interests of everyone affected by a decision into account – not just your own.  It’s a useful model to apply to your own decision-making. So say you’re a manager in a company that’s thinking about abolishing an established policy that allows employees to work remotely. As you see it, there are a lot of good reasons for doing that. But what if you put yourself behind the veil of ignorance – would you advocate against the policy no matter who you were? What if you were an employee caring for an elderly relative, or a single parent?  Even if you end up sticking to your guns, it’s a worthwhile experiment, as it will help you appreciate other people’s perspectives and challenges. The peppered moth is a night-active species native to temperate climates, and a familiar sight across Britain. Before the Industrial Revolution, most peppered moths in northwestern England were light-colored, a trait that helped them camouflage themselves on light tree bark. But between 1811 and 1895, the percentage of dark peppered moths rose from 0.01 percent to 98 percent. What happened?  It’s a classic example of Darwin’s theory of the “survival of the fittest.” Pollution from coal mines covered trees in a thick layer of soot. Lighter moths then became easy prey for predators, while their darker counterparts remained hidden – and thrived.  As the American scientist Leon Megginson pointed out, people sometimes confuse “the fittest” with strength or intellect or superior genes. The key, however, is adaptability – adjusting to a changing environment. And that’s the lesson the story of the dark peppered moth teaches us. Society also evolves over time. If you want to thrive in your social environment, you also need to become adaptable. So how do you that?  One great way is by adopting an experimental mind-set. That’s a cycle of making scientific observations, developing hypotheses, testing them, analyzing data and formulating new theories. The most successful people and organizations adopt precisely that mind-set. They’re constantly on the lookout for new tools to boost their productivity, well-being and fitness.  Take your health, for example. There’s an overwhelming mass of data out there suggesting that this or that diet is the best thing you can do for your body. Should you go vegan or paleo, or is fasting a better option? The only way to find out is to experiment. That’s more than just randomly trying different things, though. It means adopting a rigorous trial-and-error approach, trying different diets one by one and analyzing the results to figure out which works for you.  The same goes for your “intellectual diet.” If you aren’t experimenting with new ideas, you’re probably stuck with old, out-of-date ones. Notions change all the time, after all. You were probably taught that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs and that Tyrannosaurus rex were smooth-skinned reptilians. Well, today, a lot of experts have come to view that theory as outdated, while most paleontologists believe the T. rex was partly covered in feathers! Stick with old ideas, and your thinking will end up just as obsolete as those light-colored moths clinging to sooty trees. We live in a data-driven world. Quantification, once the preserve of scientists and engineers, shapes the way we understand everything from climate change to our personal lives. You might even be using apps that tally up your daily movements and tell you how much sleep you’re getting.  That’s good, right? Well, yes and no. As the American writer Mark Twain liked to point out, there are “Lies, damned lies and statistics.” Numbers, in other words, can mislead as easily as they can inform. And that’s why it’s so important to avoid statistical stumbles. After all, whether it’s nutrition or government policy, there are people everywhere claiming that the numbers are on their side. Even if they’re not trying to mislead you deliberately, there’s a good chance their “evidence” has been misinterpreted or overhyped.  The most common cause of error is relying on anecdotal evidence. That’s basically hearsay and personal experience. Evolutionarily, trusting such partial data makes a lot of sense. If you’ve seen someone eat a berry and get sick, you simply avoid the shrub in question rather than conducting a controlled berry-eating experiment. In other contexts, however, it’s a source of confusion.  Think of the stories people tell about, say, their grandfather who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and lived to the age of 90. These are out-of-the-ordinary cases that tell us nothing about average experiences. It’s a bit like going to a restaurant: you’re more likely to tell friends about your meal if it was outrageously good or bad than if it was merely mediocre. Smoking might not cause lung cancer in every case, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t significantly increase the average risk.  Then there’s the mistaken idea that correlation implies causation – that is, if two events occur consecutively, one must have caused the other. You can see this fallacy in effect every year around the time people get their flu vaccinations. Inevitably, someone will get a cold at the same time, mistake it for the flu and attribute it to the shot they just got.  What’s missing in this account is the confounding factor, an often less obvious but correct explanation – namely, that people are vaccinated largely when more people get sick than usual. A common cold, against which a flu shot doesn’t provide immunity, ends up being misidentified, and the vaccination gets blamed for causing the very thing it prevented! And that’s the trouble with data – it helps us understand the world, but sometimes it helps us misunderstand it, too. Let’s face it: life is full of conflict. In economics, these adversarial situations are sometimes described as “social games” pitting self-interested “players” against one another. Most conventional games are zero-sum: if you win, I lose. Unlike chess, however, real life isn’t black-and-white. Sometimes everyone can win.  Take a study of tipping discussed in American psychologist Robert Cialdini’s 1984 book Influence. It found that waiters who give their customers small gifts increase their tips. An after-dinner mint equalled a three percent rise. Two mints took that to 14 percent, while two mints and a line like, “And for you nice folks, an extra mint” pushed it to 23 percent.  That’s a great example of reciprocity, the perceived obligation to return favors. It’s a pretty universal cultural concept. The Romans called it quid pro quo or “something for something.” In modern English, we rephrase that as, “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine.”  Reciprocity is a social norm, a recognized if unwritten rule regulating social life. Obviously, we don’t always behave reciprocally. Sometimes it’s more appropriate to follow market norms. When you look at something from a “market perspective,” you think of it in terms of your personal interests. A “social perspective,” by contrast, asks if it’s the right thing to do. It’s the difference between asking, “Is this $60 babysitting job worth my time?” and “Should I help my friend out by looking after his kids for four hours?”  They’re both valuable perspectives. Things get messy, however, when they’re confused. Take the case of an Israeli kindergarten cited in economist Dan Ariely’s 2008 book Predictable Irrationality. Parents were often late when they picked their kids up, and the school decided to introduce fines for tardiness. The policy had the opposite effect: parents were late even more frequently!  Here’s why. Before the fines, latecomers felt guilty and made an effort to be more punctual. The introduction of a market norm undermined their sense that they owed the kindergarten teachers something – after all, they were paying, so there was no reason to feel bad. Interestingly, when the kindergarten abolished the fines, parents didn’t return to their old behavior – the experiment had undermined both types of norms. That just goes to show how important it is to apply the right conceptual models to situations. As the example of that Israeli daycare center shows, it pays to make sure you’re framing things in the right way! The key message in these blinks: Super thinking leverages tried-and-true conceptual models to improve your decision-making and help you avoid common logical pitfalls. Gleaned from disciplines as diverse as physics, economics and philosophy, these “super models” cut through the complexity and shed light on the thorniest conundrums. Whether you’re using Ockham’s razor to select potential mates, applying critical mass to understand an emerging market or using the veil of ignorance to put yourself in people’s shoes, these ultra-adaptable tools are guaranteed to up your cognitive game.  Actionable advice: Weigh your decisions with a numbered pro-con list.  The simplest way of approaching a big question is to draw up a list of pros and cons – arguments for and against a decision. Chances are, however, that you’ll attach different value to different factors. That’s where numbered pro-con lists come in. Here you’ll be valuing each factor on a scale ranging from minus ten to zero for negatives and zero to ten for positives, thus giving you an insight into the relative value of each item. So say you’ve been offered a job, but taking it involves moving to a new city. What gets a higher score – the location or the improved salary offer? As simple as it sounds, this is a powerful mental model that will help you conduct a systematic cost-benefit analysis before taking the plunge.  Got feedback?

What to read next: Thinking in Bets, by Annie Duke The mental models we’ve explored in these blinks will help you understand the world and make better decisions. But life is unpredictable and messy. Even the best decisions fail to bring about the outcomes we’d hoped for while seemingly disastrous miscalculations result in unexpected boons. Sometimes all we can do is roll the die and take a gamble.  That isn’t about blind luck, however. Take it from Annie Duke, a poker champion and business consultant who literally wrote the book on smart betting. The key, she claims, is to wean ourselves off our addiction to outcome-based thinking.

Well, it might be time to redefine that dream. Over the course of the past few decades, both work and career paths have changed dramatically. Unlike earlier generations, we will change jobs many times, and most people will change industries as well. We need to rethink our work lives and transform our careers. In these blinks we will go on an in-depth journey through all aspects of career reinvention and look at the different laws that govern the ways we should act, think and understand these new challenges. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you should have the equivalent of a board of directors for finding a new career; how to identify the three excuses that keep you from success; and why understanding an alternative meaning of the word “agent” can be crucial. What would you do if you didn’t have to worry about money? In all likelihood, your current job is a far cry from what you would like to do. But it’s equally likely that there’s a job out there that more closely resembles your vision. This should be the starting point for your career reinvention. Your career is an important tool in developing the life you want to live. For example, if you have two young children you want to spend more time with, then a research position that forces you to stay in the Antarctic for half a year probably isn’t for you. If you want to reinvent your career, you need to closely examine how you want to live. One good way to figure this out is through an exercise in which you imagine your ideal working day in as much detail as possible: Do you wake up at the crack of dawn? Is your office at home, or somewhere downtown? What does your office look like? Are you a lone wolf, or do you work with a team? Continue with these questions until you’ve fleshed out your ideal working day from beginning to end. Dare to dream big. Your ideal working day should really resonate with you. However, though you should dream big, you shouldn’t let your vision become infected by myths and fantasies. In other words, don’t pursue impossible dreams. Instead, inform yourself as much as possible so you can make a smart decision. For example, if your dream is to travel and see the world, you might want to become a pilot. But while pilots do indeed travel and see lots of places, they often arrive at each destination exhausted, and have to use their short stay to rest for the next flight. In the Western world, intellect seems to have triumphed over instinct. But when it comes to career reinvention, you should consider a different approach.  Your body acts as a good guide to what you truly want, and you should listen to it when it tells you that something isn’t right for you. These gut reactions to situations are what psychologists call rapid cognition. Our subconscious can find patterns in complex situations and use them to make snap judgements. In contrast, our ability to solve complex problems through active thought is limited, as our short-term memory, on average, can only handle about seven pieces of information at any given time. Thus, it’s often better to follow your gut. Your body will also let you know when something is missing. When you are in an uncomfortable situation for too long, your body will send signals in the form of headaches, tense shoulders or interrupted sleep, to name a few. Listen to your body’s messages, and do something about the situation. If your body won’t lie to you, your intellect certainly will. For example, your intellect wants you to feel good about yourself, and will motivate you to keep trying at things that you’ve already failed at several times. Think about your New Year’s resolutions. Year after year we try to rid ourselves of unhealthy habits, and our intellect tells us we will succeed – no matter how miserably we failed the year before. Our intellect is just as naive when it comes to career. It’s easily swayed by things that sound impressive, regardless of whether they’re right for us. Your brain will cheer at the idea of you becoming team leader at Doctors Without Borders, even if you’d really rather start a business selling cupcakes! Fear is an ancient biochemical reaction. It’s what ensured that our ancestors would run from saber-toothed tigers and avoid risky situations whenever possible. Reinventing your career is a risky undertaking, meaning fear will be your constant companion. The important thing is to keep moving in spite of fear. We don’t like experiencing fear, and excuses provide an easy way out of risky situations. Excuses preserve self-worth by allowing you to explain for why you didn’t do something that you wanted to do but were too afraid to deal with. For example, you might tell yourself that you would be willing to make a major change in your career, if only you had the time to think it through. Alas, you just don’t have the time. It’s the perfect excuse. Fear, however, is never going away. And so, you have to learn to act in spite of it. The best way to continue in spite of fear is to realize that your excuses are just that: excuses. And excuses fall into three categories: The first is when you deny your responsibility and put the obligation to further your career on someone else. For example, you might feel that you can’t advance your career because your company “doesn’t create any new opportunities” for you. The second is when you deny your ability to influence your situation, and instead blame your circumstances. This excuse manifests when you feel you can’t apply for a job because you don’t have a college degree, for example. The final excuse is the denial of prescription clarity, meaning you didn’t understand the rules and deduced that they didn’t apply to you. For example, saying something like, “I didn’t know I was supposed to get back to them. I thought they would call me back.” Whenever you find yourself making any of these excuses, ask yourself: Is there really no way of getting around this obstacle? We can only explore far-flung and exotic travel destinations because someone was willing to imagine what was once impossible: flight. Reinventing your career is similar – you have to be willing to imagine options that you hadn’t thought of before. This “road less traveled” holds many opportunities. First, by thinking outside the box, you train your brain to come up with novel ideas. This is crucial in the process of reinvention, as you will find yourself in many situations where you need to be able to think creatively. Second, you simply have more opportunities to find the perfect job if you don’t limit yourself to what you know. Really, the “road less traveled” shouldn’t be less traveled. You should embrace the unknown! However, it is precisely this “unknown” or ambiguity that frightens us. Ambiguity and risk are similar in that the outcome of an event is uncertain. In the case of risk, however, we can discern the odds that something might happen, while with ambiguity we don’t even have a clue. Imagine that there are two finalists for a position, and you’re one of them. We could estimate that the chances of not getting the job are about 50 percent. In other words, you know the risk.  However, what if when you interviewed for the job, they only told you that they were interviewing “more candidates.” How many is “more?” Five? Ten? One hundred? In this case, you know nothing about the odds; the outcome is ambiguous. According to Dr. Gregory S. Berns, director of the Center for Neuropolicy at Emory University School for Medicine, dozens of studies have demonstrated that people have a strong aversion to ambiguity. They even prefer risky situations where the odds are strongly against them to ambiguous situations where the odds are completely unknown. Imagine you work as a lawyer, but are thinking about switching to public relations. One of the first things that will probably cross your mind is, “But I don’t know how to create a campaign. As a lawyer, I spent most of my time drafting contracts.” However, that’s not the kind of thing that matters when you switch careers. There is a huge difference between your job functions and your skills. Behind every job function (like drafting contracts) is a skill (like writing). These skills can be applied to other jobs too. Take Reggie Mebane, for example. For most of his life he worked at FedEx, but after he lost his position as COO, he found a new opportunity in a completely different sector: as a chief management officer at the Center for Disease Control.  FedEx and the CDC do completely different things, but each had positions where Mebane’s skills were needed. The CDC was looking for someone with strong corporate management skills who could motivate people, and Mebane’s experience at FedEx had equipped him for that. He was also able to put his knowledge of logistics to good use, as the CDC sends life-saving vaccines overnight to wherever they’re needed.  However, while you take your skills with you wherever you go, you’ll have to leave your old job identity behind – before you even have a new job. That’s because identifying with your old job interferes with reinvention in two important ways: First, it stops you from making progress. For example, if you still identify as a high school football hero, you’ll be both emotionally and intellectually trapped in the past. Second, it irritates people who might help you with your career reinvention. Think back to Reggie Mebane: if he had still identified with his old job, he would have been little more than that FedEx guy, making it difficult for others to see him as the perfect fit for the CDC. By this point, you should have a good idea of where you want to go. The following blinks will look at what you have to do to get there. Leading a large company is a complex task. One person can’t handle the responsibility alone – that’s why companies have a board of directors. So how can you apply this concept to the equally complex task of reinventing your career? You need to create your own reinvention board, a group of people who will support your career reinvention. You’ll need different kinds of help along the way, and so you’ll need different kinds of people with varying skills. Your reinvention board has five roles to fill: The master connector is a networking expert – someone with great connections who can put you in touch with others who may be able to help you. The clued-in colleague is someone you’ve worked with, who knows your strengths and weaknesses and can discern whether an opportunity is a good match for you and your skills. Warm ‘n’ fuzzy is a good friend who will catch you if you fall and can make you feel grounded in moments of despair. The drill sergeant helps you get over yourself when you’re paralyzed by fear. They have no patience for excuses, but are nevertheless fully supportive. The native is someone who knows the industry you are planning to enter and has important insider knowledge about the culture – knowledge you wouldn’t otherwise have. Though each of your board members has their own strengths, they all have three things in common: they wish you the best, have enough experience to offer counsel and will always give you the unadulterated truth. It’s likewise important that the people on your board have no conflicts of interest. For example, your spouse, partner and parents won’t make good board members. These people, especially your significant other, will be the most affected by your decision, and will likely also be the most disconcerted when you propose a drastic career change. If you’ve ever moved to a new country, you know that it can be tough. You encounter cultural differences and language barriers, and are unfamiliar with the way things work. The best solution to this confusion is usually to get in contact with the natives. And the same applies to your career reinvention. You need advice from natives in your new industry, as people who work in this unfamiliar landscape can offer a realistic impression of the pros and cons. For example, when Felina Rakowski-Gallagher set out to open New York’s first boutique catering to the needs of breastfeeding mothers, she didn’t know the first thing about what such a store should look like, what the best business structure would be or how to keep records.  So, she attended a conference where she met the Warburtons, a couple running a similar shop in Salt Lake City. They provided her with all the information she needed to get started and really helped her get off the ground. To get in touch with natives, you have to show commitment. While most natives are willing to help newcomers, they’re also busy. They don’t want to waste time with someone who isn’t serious. Looking back to Rakowski-Gallagher’s situation, when she set out for the conference she didn’t make any excuses – she strapped her young daughter across her chest and took the flight to the conference. This showed natives like the Warburtons that she was determined to become a native herself. People who are in the process of reinventing their careers are eager to jump in, but end up confused and disappointed when their resumés generate low response rates. The reason for potential employers’ lack of interest often lies in the fact that the job candidate didn’t bother to learn the language of their new industry. Each industry has its own language – a specific understanding of certain words and a technical jargon. In the financial sector, for example, “agents” are overseas partners who represent your products on license in their countries. Contrast this with the entertainment industry, where “agents” find jobs for their artist employers in exchange for a cut of their earnings.  In addition to the spoken word, every industry has special codes and ways of communicating nonverbally, i.e., it has its own culture. Say you’re planning to go into the golf business. Not only will you need to know what a “scratch golfer” is, you’ll also need to know that demonstrating modesty and not showing off is important in golf culture. Whether verbal or nonverbal, you need to be able to speak the language of the industry in order to be understood. You have to be able to translate your experience into language that your potential employer can understand regardless of the industry you want to work in. If you want to get into the entertainment industry but talk about agents in the financial sense, no one is going to know what you’re talking about despite your perfect resumé. What’s more, speaking the language creates trust. When you’re switching industries, you’re essentially asking others to give you a shot, while to them you’re an unknown. Speaking their language demonstrates that you understand their needs, which creates a sense of security that may encourage them to give you a chance. Imagine that it’s early 2008 and you make perfectly reasonable plans to reinvent your career in one year. And then suddenly, you’re met with the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and virtually all job openings evaporate into thin air. It doesn’t take a collapsing banking sector for your plans to crumble. Plenty of other things can throw a wrench into the cogs that are your plans. However, there are some tricks that’ll help you keep the machinery running even if things do go wrong. It all starts with ridding yourself of the illusion of control. There are some things you can control in your career reinvention, such as how well you plan and how much effort you put into it. But there are a lot of things you can’t control. For example, you can’t control how quickly people get back to you, or when they’ll have time for meetings. Often, a new job is more important for you than it is for potential employers. Waiting three weeks for a callback or a meeting is nothing unusual.  In addition, life or world events can have a huge impact on your schedule, and you can’t always predict them. An economic crisis is one thing, but what if your beloved falls ill and needs you to provide care? Or what if an urgent project suddenly pops up at your current job and hogs all your time? These things can happen, so make sure your expectations about the pace of your progress are realistic and forgiving.  When you set unrealistic expectations about how fast you’ll progress, you’ll feel like a failure when things take longer. People can be far too optimistic; it often takes six months just to create a plan for the reinvention! The self-help industry discovered long ago that if you act with confidence, people will follow. If you don’t have the confidence, you can always fake it till you make it. This is often a good tactic at the beginning, however the career reinvention process is a long one and in the end demands a deeper, truer confidence. People are attracted to those who are confident. Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that those who experience more positive emotions like satisfaction, joy and enthusiasm receive more social support from their environment.  When you’re in the process of reinventing your career, you need to get people interested in what you have to offer. And your confidence is probably the most important ingredient in that regard. But what if you aren’t naturally confident? How can you develop the confidence you need to succeed? Start by focusing on your natural talents. Figure out what you do best and let it play a bigger part in what you do. Next, realize that emotional healing is important, and take your time during the process. We all suffer defeats and humiliation at one point or another. Find a safe space to talk about these experiences and allow time for them to heal. In addition, get positive emotional feedback from others. Meet with your reinvention board of directors regularly, as having this emotional support on a consistent basis is especially important when times are tough. Finally, don’t mistake pessimism for realism. Those who are pessimistic about the chances of success often claim that they’re only being “realistic.” However, they usually just haven’t tried hard enough. Ask yourself if you’ve really tried everything in your power to make it work, or if there is actually something else that you could still do. The key message in this book: Many people feel locked into careers that they desperately want to escape. Luckily, switching careers isn’t rocket science. It’s a path that anyone can follow as long as they’re aware of the pitfalls along the way and are willing to apply the tricks gathered by those who’ve made the trek before them. Actionable advice: Turn your words into actions. Make a list of five things you’ve wanted to do for a long time, but haven’t yet done. These are what your mouth says you want. Then, for each of these items write down the actions you took, or didn’t take, to make them happen. That is what your actions say you want. How can you resolve this discrepancy and turn your words into actions?  Suggested further reading: Smartcuts by Shane Snow Smartcuts shows you how to challenge conventions and build an innovative business with long-lasting success.

Over the years, many people have tried to distil the essence of success into easy catchphrases or simple mottos, but most of these have failed. Let’s face it, most lifestyle gurus are little more than salesmen for grandiose and dubious ideas; they know all the cliches and slogans, but they have no idea how to really lead people toward success. These blinks present a real method to success, the 10X Rule. Based on the experiences of a top sales trainer and business owner, they explain how anybody can apply one simple rule to set themselves up for the lasting successes and ambitious achievements that once seemed out of reach. In these blinks, you’ll find out why we should emulate children when it comes to decision making; why you need to go “all-in” in life; and why you shouldn’t really concern yourself with customer satisfaction. Perusing the shelves of your average bookstore, you’re bound to find a plethora of titles that promise you the secrets to a successful life. But with so many options, it can be hard to know which is the best one. So, before you get sucked into another questionable formula for success, consider the 10X rule – a surefire way to succeed at whatever you want. The 10X rule is based on the knowledge that success always requires more effort than you originally thought. You can look back on your life and easily see that your endeavors always demanded ten times more effort than you thought they would. Success in business pursuits always came when you invested ten times more than your competitors. So, if you want to sell a product and think making ten phone calls a day will help you do so, you should probably aim for closer to 100 phone calls per day. But putting in this added effort won’t just help you achieve your daily goals; the 10X rule will help you accomplish a whole lot more. This brings us to the second half of the 10X rule: all your goals should be ten times bigger than what’s considered realistic. In other words, reach for the heavens and pick a goal that’s beyond your wildest dreams. It might seem silly, but if you aim too low you’ll still be disappointed when you achieve your goal, and feel crushed if you fail. It’s much more desirable to fail to meet an incredibly high expectation than to attain a mediocre goal. For instance, say your dream is to be an author. Writing a novel should be your goal, not writing a two-page short story. Even if you successfully accomplish the latter, you still won’t consider yourself a writer. In this way, the 10X rule is about trying harder and dreaming bigger. History has shown time and time again that merely having the best product isn’t enough to make you a success. Real market success is a product of the right attitude and the readiness to handle unexpected issues. That’s why the 10X rule is also about being ready to confront unforeseen challenges. By aiming as high as the 10X rule tells you to, you’ll be working hard enough to deal with anything that comes your way. Imagine you aim to sell 100,000 items in your product line when most people would shoot for just 10,000. This gargantuan goal means that if you, say, experience a huge influx of orders, you’ll succeed where others will fail because you’ve developed the capacity to handle a bigger operation. But the 10X rule also offers some clear guidelines for success. The first has to do with the fact that people often think of success as something for others, but not for themselves. It’s essential to disabuse yourself of this belief and remember that success has no restrictions. No matter what other people say, success isn’t a zero-sum game and there’s plenty to go around. Anyone with a 10X mindset can achieve success, and it doesn’t have to come at someone else’s expense. For example, if you succeed at bringing an improved cell phone to market, you’ll have offered a positive contribution, making it a success that benefits everyone. Even if other businesses look on with envy at first, others will learn from your contribution and attitude to find their own success. In this way, the 10X rule, by pushing you to achieve all you can, is a tool for reaching your true potential. Just consider the author. Until the age of 25, his life was all about alcohol and drugs. At a certain point, he realized he wasn’t living a fulfilling life whatsoever and had no will to achieve anything at all. So, he transformed his mindset and pushed himself to levels of achievement he could never have imagined. Next up, you’ll learn how you can do the same by applying the 10X rule to your life. Have you heard about the four degrees of action? It’s a pretty simple concept that states that, when confronted with a situation, you can respond in one of four ways. You can either do nothing, retreat, take normal action or take massive action, and it’s the last of these that is the key to success. To see this principle in action, look no further than children. When they’re faced with a challenge, they simply give it everything they’ve got; they don’t pause to calculate or budget their effort. So follow their lead. Instead of determining how many hours you’ll need to devote, just make massive action your natural habit. Say you need to sell your product to a market influencer. Instead of skimping on budget or keeping your efforts measured, go all out to convince him. Do all the research you can, spare no expense and don’t let up until he’s sold. However, following this route means taking responsibility. Remember, success isn’t something that happens to you – it’s something that happens because of you. As such, it’s key to avoid thinking of yourself as a victim, or someone who can be acted upon, and start thinking of yourself as an actor. Embrace challenges and see opportunities instead of risks and dangers. Keep in mind that the word “average” by definition means less than extraordinary; it’s your task to push beyond this boundary. The fact is, the world is full of average everything. Just consider how most people aim to be middle class. Wanting to be average means thinking only about getting by, perhaps thinking about tomorrow or the day after, but not any further. The danger here is that average can sink to below average very quickly. The 2008 financial crisis is a great example, as it hit the middle class hardest, forcing many into poverty. It just goes to show that aiming for average isn’t enough. Define what average means in your context, but only to shoot for ten times above it – doing so will make you a success for years to come. Anyone who has been around a card table knows that going “all-in” in a game of poker is a risky move. You might win the round and take home the pot, but you could also lose everything you have. Luckily, going all-in in life is a little bit less risky. When applying the 10X rule, going all-in just means investing effort, energy and ideas to reach your goal. First, you need to identify goals that are big enough for you to be motivated to achieve them. To do so, begin by picking objectives that are out of your reach and go all-in to realize them. But going all-in also means thinking outside the box to come up with solutions. After all, if you’ve chosen appropriate goals, the problems you’ll face will be immense. Problems of this magnitude often crush other people who try to overcome them. You’ll need to be clever, using every last drop of your effort and energy, to succeed. Whatever you do, don’t follow in the footsteps of those who have failed. To succeed against such odds, you have to be obsessed with your goals; they have to dominate your thoughts and become your mission. This is another context in which kids can be great role models. Children are obsessed with every new thing they encounter, devoting their full energy to their new object or activity of interest. To succeed, you’ll need to do the same thing. When others see how obsessed you are, they’ll be prepared to follow you on your journey to realize your wildly ambitious goals. On the other hand, if you fail to show this devotion, they’ll be unlikely to believe in your optimism. So, obsession with your goals is a crucial factor, but it’s just as important to avoid obsessing over failures and to shy away from excuses. That is to say, you should only be obsessed with doing things right and not worry about when they go wrong. Living by the 10X rule means remembering that you always have to keep growing. After all, the road to success is paved with growth and it’s better to fail while fighting than while retreating. So, to keep your eyes on the prize, it’s important to shake off outside influences that seek to control your actions; instead, keep pushing for the goals you want to attain. For instance, in failing economies, people tend to panic and scramble to move their assets to safe havens. But you don’t have to worry about what other people are experiencing, just about achieving your own goals. Another important thing to keep in mind is that overexposure is nothing to fear. You might be worried that pushing ahead time after time will bore people or make them feel annoyed by you and your company. But the simple truth is that overexposure is far better than obscurity. Just consider Coca-Cola or Facebook – has overexposure hurt them? And finally, to truly be successful, you need to seize control of your workday and your feelings. Many people have concerns about time management and time, of course, is limited. However, the real question isn’t which one of any two given options you can accomplish, but rather how you can foster a mindset that makes everything possible. The only workable strategy here is to strive to accomplish more in less time. Keep a close eye on how much time you have, then work harder and budget your time more effectively. We can again look to the author for a good example. After his daughter was born, he started waking up one hour earlier to spend quality time with her and let his wife sleep in, all while doing the same amount of work as he was doing before. In this way, the structure of your workday is critical, but so are your feelings. Emotions like fear and pride can hold you back; being scared of risk can prevent you from reaching your goals and too much pride can make you averse to constructive feedback. So, when faced with such feelings, remember that it’s your job to remain in control and keep marching toward your goal. Now you know just about everything you need to apply the 10X rule to your life. There’s just one last thing to figure out: how will you choose your goal? Well, what you definitely shouldn’t do is follow in the footsteps of others who simply adopt the targets imposed upon them by their social context. Take the concept of customer satisfaction as an example. Even though people are constantly told that satisfied customers are of the utmost importance, most companies don’t have enough customers in the first place; their real target should be to increase their customer base. Not only that, but with the 10X mindset, you don’t need to live in fear of poor customer satisfaction because you’ll always deliver above and beyond people’s expectations. As a result, you can focus your energy on finding new customers. In fact, truly successful brands like Google and Apple always put customer acquisition before customer satisfaction. They know that the more people they get talking about their brand, the further they’ll reach. And keep in mind that feedback from a customer, even if negative, is always valuable, as it shows you how you can improve. Another target that’s good to keep in focus is name recognition. You should consider your name your most valuable asset and make it synonymous with what you stand for. For instance, when people think of mp3 players, they think of Apple; when they think of app-based mobility services, they think of Uber. So, do as these successful companies have done and proudly advertise what you have to offer. Then, once you’ve set your sights, jump into action. Simply list your goals, outline what you need to do next and give it everything you’ve got. If your goal is to sell 100,000 units of your product, you should consider exactly how to get there. Do you need to increase your marketing budget, or should you develop a great advertising strategy? After you write this list, you can keep checking on it and adapting it based on what works and what doesn’t. The key message in this book: The 10X rule is about shifting your goals and your focus to reach beyond what you thought possible and accomplish much more. With a 10X mindset, you’ll think bigger, work harder, show greater commitment and be more inspired to reach targets that once seemed unthinkable.    What to read next: Great by Choice, by Jim Collins & Morten T.

He’d reached the true elite, achieving epic results in both professional and personal spheres. He was a man who would leave a legacy for the world. But the secret to his success was a surprising one. He attributed his success not to his natural talents, nor to the hours he had invested in his work. He attributed it to a revolutionary morning routine, built around rising at 5 a.m. and following a little known formula designed to turbocharge his mental focus, build his physical fitness and encourage him to be his best self day in and day out. With these blinks, you too can join the 5am club. You can learn how to rise each day and embrace the solitude, silence and lack of distraction the early hours of the morning can offer. Read on, and you’ll learn how true elite performers in all walks of life get ahead by making the most of a time of day that others use to sleep, waste time watching the news, or browse social media. In these blinks, you’ll learn: why freedom from distraction helps you to achieve better results; why slowing down your brain through transient hypofrontality is so important; and how to build the routine of an elite performer. This is the fictitious tale of a curious group of people: A depressed entrepreneur, in need of revitalization; a frustrated artist, trying to refuel his creativity and develop a legacy; and a billionaire with a string of successes behind him and a desire to pass on the knowledge of how to live an extraordinary life. The three met at a personal optimization conference addressed by a legendary business guru, the Spellbinder, someone renowned for his ability to weave magic and captivate his audience with the power of his insights. The billionaire approached the entrepreneur and the artist after the Spellbinder’s speech had finished but they didn’t know that he was a billionaire. The billionaire was disguised as a poor man, a habit he had developed to remind himself that money isn’t everything. The only clue to his actual wealth was his expensive watch. The impoverished-looking billionaire told the two that he’d made a fortune thanks to the Spellbinder, who’d taught him that while many people wish that extraordinary things will happen to them, truly elite performers learn that they can make extraordinary things happen themselves. The entrepreneur and the artist became more and more curious about this mysterious man who talked like he was a guru himself. They listened as the billionaire explained how the Spellbinder – who, in fact, was the billionaire’s personal mentor – had taught him one thing that was more important than anything else. What was it? That the most reliable way to generate the best results in your personal and professional life is to build a world-beating morning routine. Being a generous man, the billionaire made an incredible offer. If the entrepreneur and artist wanted to come hang with him at his beach house in Mauritius, he would teach them the secrets of a world-class morning routine. All they needed to do was meet the next morning at 5 a.m.. The entrepreneur and the artist were a little skeptical the next morning, but it started to soften when a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce collected them and delivered them to a hangar containing a sleek, ivory-colored private jet, which bore the logo: “5AC.” The entrepreneur asked the chauffeur what the logo meant, and he explained that it stood for “The 5am Club.” And so began their journey toward understanding a revolutionary morning routine and a whole new outlook on life with the potential to transform everything for the better. Early the next morning, the billionaire told the entrepreneur and artist how getting up at 5 a.m. was the way he had learned to escape mediocrity and achieve greatness. Getting up at 5 a.m. had promoted his creativity, doubled his energy, and tripled his productivity. How? Well, the billionaire told them, many true greats throughout history, from novelist John Grisham to composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have understood that the isolation that comes from getting up at 5 a.m. has a multiplying effect. All of us have limited mental capacity or cognitive bandwidth. And throughout the day, our attention is given to more and more things: work, the news, interaction with others and social media. Our bandwidth gets used up by all of these so, by lunchtime, we can’t really concentrate on anything at all. By constantly shifting our focus from one thing to another, we give nothing enough attention. But if you get up at 5 a.m., you have a golden opportunity to focus on one high-value activity without your brain getting distracted. This focus is further enhanced by the concept of transient hypofrontality, which means, in a nutshell, that at 5 a.m., you are well placed to achieve a state of flow in your thinking. That’s because, the billionaire explained, when you are enjoying a peaceful 5 a.m. start, the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which handles rational thought, temporarily shuts down. So your tendency to analyze, stress and worry about things is impaired. At the same time, the peace of daybreak stimulates the production of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. The result? You naturally enter a state of flow: of being fully energized, focused and in the zone. Flow is the elite mind-set that all top performers, from violinists to scientists, inhabit in their finest moments. So you’ll find that if you get up at 5 a.m., you’ll be more focused and more productive for the entire day. If you want another reason why joining the 5am club is a good idea, consider this: to get the results of the top 5 percent of elite performers, you need to do what 95 percent of entrepreneurs, artists and other people are unwilling to do. Most people aren’t willing to get up at 5 a.m. so if you are, you have a huge competitive advantage. Now let’s take a look at how to not just achieve great things, but to become a true historymaker, a person whose achievements change the world. On a dazzling morning in Mauritius, the entrepreneur, the artist, and the billionaire gathered by the sea. A school of squirrelfish swam through the crystal clear waters. In this beautiful setting, the billionaire recounted the four focuses of the great historymakers. Firstly, he said, the greatest people are defined not by their natural talent, but by the extent to which they capitalize. According to the billionaire, self-discipline and perseverance always trump talent and giftedness. So rather than thinking you don’t have what it takes, capitalize on the gifts you’ve got to make a difference. Secondly, the billionaire explained, freedom from distraction is key. Too many people today waste hours on addictive but hollow technology and social media. If you want to win, you need to focus, simplify, and concentrate. That means becoming a purist, concentrating on a few amazing work projects rather than many good ones. And in day-to-day life, it means stripping out everything that distracts you from a relentless focus on what’s most important. So turn off your notifications and cancel pointless meetings that are taking you away from activities that really add value. Gain a distraction-free hour each morning to focus on what’s important by joining the 5am club. Thirdly, the truly great understand the power of day-stacking. That means that small things done daily are way more important than big things done once in a while. Consider enhancing one ability or skill by just one percent every day. It’s a small change, but over a year it amounts to a 365 percent improvement! Finally, the billionaire shared the final focus of historymakers: personal mastery practice. According to psychologist Anders Ericsson, a person must invest at least 2.75 hours of daily practice in a skill for ten years for the first signs of an elite-level of mastery to appear. So if you want to master yourself, you should spend your first hour each morning working deeply on you, your mind-set and also your approach to health, spirituality and love. The entrepreneur and artist now understood much more clearly how the truly elite stay ahead, so the billionaire said it was time to take things to the next level: It was time for them to understand how to cultivate their best selves. How often, asked the billionaire, have you heard a guru talk about improving your mind-set? We hear it all the time – think optimistic thoughts, and you’ll improve your life. But, said the billionaire, strolling along a white sand beach with his pupils, what these gurus don’t tell you is that your Mindset is just one of four “interior empires.” If you’re only working on your Mindset, you’re ignoring your Healthset, your Heartset, and your Soulset. That’s like only polishing 25 percent of a picture! Your Heartset is your emotional life and well-being. It’s important because, even with a world-class Mindset, you can’t deliver intellectually if your emotional life is a mess. As Sigmund Freud noted, “unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and they will come forth later in uglier ways.” So focus on a healthy Heartset and you’ll soon feel the difference. Next, give your Healthset – your physical health – some attention. One of the key ways to get ahead in life is longevity. As the billionaire jokingly pointed out, you can’t be a titan of industry if you’re dead. Committing to optimal fitness allows you a couple of extra ultra-healthy and productive decades to build a greater legacy. What’s more, elite performers realize that every day becomes far better with exercise. It ignites your energy, dissolves your stress and expands your joy. But even that isn’t enough, as there’s another interior empire to cultivate. Your Soulset, the billionaire explained, is your spirituality. Too often, everyday life pulls us toward the superficial and the material. So take some time in the quiet moments of the early morning to remember who you truly are. Bond with the hero inside of you. In the silence of the dawn, meditate on what you have to offer the world. Focus on your Soulset, and you’ll reconnect with the very best part of yourself. The entrepreneur remarked that this framework really changed his perception of himself, leading him to ask how he could use the first hour of the day to effectively apply it. The billionaire replied, telling him that he was ready to hear about the 20/20/20 formula, but not in Mauritius, but in The Eternal City – Rome. It was time to be inspired by the passion of the Roman people, the city’s architecture, and its divine food. Standing in the square at the bottom of Rome’s famous Spanish Steps, the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist took in their surroundings. It’s time, the billionaire said, to learn how you can transform your creativity, performance, utility, wealth and productivity. Just rising at 5 a.m. alone won’t do it. You could rise at 5 a.m. and waste an hour scanning social media and checking messages, but that won’t optimize your day. What will is the 20/20/20 formula that says you use 20 minutes to move, 20 minutes to reflect and 20 minutes to grow. The first step is to move – to perform vigorous exercise for 20 minutes. What’s really important is to make yourself sweat. That’s because sweat gets rid of cortisol, the hormone of fear. Sweat generates the protein BDNF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which repairs brain cells and accelerates the formation of new neural connections. So by sweating for 20 minutes, it literally means you’ll think faster! Then, make 5.20-5.40 a.m. a time for reflection with a period of deep peace and solitude. Before the complexity of the day emerges, reflect on what is most important to you. In an age of distraction, of constant notifications and messages, you’ll be amazed what visions, dreams and inspiration drift into your mind when you have a few moments of silence to yourself. Write these thoughts in a journal. Commit your current ambitions, the things you’re grateful for in your life, and your frustrations and disappointments to paper. Doing so will help you understand your vision and let go of toxic, negative energies. Take a few minutes to meditate. Research shows that meditation helps lower cortisol, reducing your stress. It’s a proven way to stay calm, and the great performers of the world are always calm! Now it’s time for the last 20 minutes of your first hour. Here, you need to grow, so take 20 minutes to learn. Study the lives of great achievers by reading their biographies. Learn about human psychology. Watch documentaries on innovation, or listen to audiobooks about business building. One thing every billionaire has in common is a love of learning. So there you have it. A perfect morning routine, to make the hour your own and become a true member of the 5am club. As the city of Rome slowly came to life, the billionaire, entrepreneur and artist ventured down into the depths of the city. As they descended down a dark and dusty tunnel, the billionaire announced that they were in the catacombs – underground passages used as burial grounds by the ancient Romans. The artist asked why they were there and the billionaire explained that they were surrounded by people in a centuries-old-slumber, so it was an appropriate place to discuss the importance of deep sleep. Research has shown that sleep is one of the key factors in predicting life expectancy. How you spend the last hour of your day is almost as important to peak performance as how you spend the first. Too many people today are in a state of sleep deprivation, driven by technology. Research shows that the blue light emitted by our devices reduces levels of melatonin – the chemical that induces sleep. Being in front of a screen before sleep will prevent you from sleeping properly, so turn off your technology no later than 8 p.m. Spend the rest of the evening talking with loved ones, meditating, having a relaxing bath or reading and go to bed no later than 10 p.m. That way, you can truly maximize the value of your 5 a.m. time. Sleeping isn’t the only important way to rejuvenate yourself. In fact, a key to top performance over time is to oscillate between periods of passionate, focused work at the highest levels and periods of time for deep refueling through relaxation, recovery and fun. It’s a process that the billionaire calls the twin-cycle of elite performance. Growth happens not just in the performance phase, but also in the recovery phase. If you want to understand why, said the billionaire, talk to a farmer. He’ll tell you that there is always an intense period of tilling soil, planting crops and serious work. But after that, is the fallow season. The fallow season might look like a period of rest. It looks like nothing’s happening. But really, it’s the fallow season, in which the soil is resting and replenishing its nutrients, that predicts how well crops are really going to blossom. Some of us don’t like to embrace the rest part of the twin-cycle. The entrepreneur recognized this, saying that if he isn’t working, he feels guilty. But, as the billionaire replied, balance is important. So don’t just work. Embrace rest, relaxation and fun, safe in the knowledge that it’s a key part of elite performance. The key message in these blinks: The first hours of the day are where heroes are made. If you want to master your life, start by owning the mornings. Freedom from distraction at 5 a.m. will allow you to build your creativity, maximize your fitness and protect your serenity in an age of complexity.  Actionable advice: Set your alarm clock half an hour fast and trick yourself into getting up at 5 a.m.  Firstly, buy an alarm clock. Technology is distracting and should never be in the bedroom. Once you’ve got a nice old fashioned clock, set it half an hour fast. Set yourself an alarm for 5.30 a.m. That way, when you wake up the next morning, you’re tricking yourself into thinking you are getting up later. When the alarm goes off, jump out of bed immediately, before the weaker part of your character can come up with reasons to stay under the duvet. Got feedback?

Covey","summary":"Consider your own voice. Not your singing voice or your speaking voice, but your voice – the significance, the endless potential and greatness of you. Have you found it? Finding your voice at work, whether you’re a regular employee or a top leader, is not necessarily easy. And if you’ve already managed to find it, there’s still no guarantee that you’ve managed to consistently use it. In The 8th Habit, the author gently pushes you to find your voice. He fills you in on how to take action and find it, and, importantly, how to inspire the people around you to find their voices as well. In these blinks, you’ll discover how to develop the four intelligences that’ll help you find your voice; that freedom of choice allows you to unfold your true potential; and the key to building mutual trust. Ever feel like you don’t make much of a difference? Or that what you do doesn’t really matter? Many people seem to feel this way. But why? Well, many organizations can’t keep up with the constant changes of our modern world. And therein lies the problem. We currently live in the Information/Knowledge Worker Age, the successor of the Industrial Age. Many organizations find it difficult to accommodate the shifting approaches to work that this new era gave rise to, and they still operate with an Industrial Age mindset, governed by a domineering top-down style. This kind of control functions poorly in the current age, which is all about unleashing the potential of our workers. Consider the value of quality in today’s IT industry. An outstanding programer, for instance, is 1000 times more productive than an average programer. During the Industrial Age, such disparities between individual levels of productivity were impossible. It’s therefore necessary to abolish the controlling top-down approach, as it limits employee potential. We must produce the kind of quality we expect of today’s businesses.  Most importantly, employees should be encouraged to find their own voice.  Everyone wants to be great at their job, but only those who find their voice and make a habit of using their strengths can enjoy true success. Finding that inner voice is known as the 8th habit. So how do you do it? It starts with treating employees respectfully so that they can make their own choices, use their creativity and feel significant in their workplace. Everyone must be able to find their own voice and, in turn, inspire others to find theirs. Did it ever occur to you that your greatest gift is your freedom of choice? Each of us is born with this freedom, along with the gifts of intelligence. The combination of these gifts equips us to find our own voice. Freedom to choose is precious. While we can’t always control what happens to us, we can always choose how we react to life’s challenges. When used wisely, you can use it to broaden your horizons and regain control of your life. The principle of freedom is applicable to every part of your life, including your work. For example, if your boss is treating you like a doormat, do something about it! It’s easy to forget that you have the power to choose how you react – but you do. So, why not choose to talk to your boss directly about it? Now let’s look at the gifts of intelligence. There are four kinds of intelligence, each of which we can improve and cultivate. By working on your intelligence, you’ll discover your strengths, and that discovery will guide you to your voice. Physical intelligence allows our body to function and regulate itself without our conscious input. An example of this would be our heartbeat. Mental intelligence is our ability to think abstractly and analyze things, people and situations. Emotional intelligence enables us to empathize, so that we can communicate with and relate to others in an effective, friendly way. Finally, spiritual intelligence is something most people don’t spend much time thinking about, but is of great value nonetheless. In fact, it’s the very basis of the other forms of intelligence; it’s the true north of our moral compass, the imperative that drives us to seek meaning in life. Think about the leaders and managers in your organization. Are they effective? Are you yourself a good leader? Every organization has leaders – and yet, as we all know, some are far better than others. What exactly is it, then, that makes a good leader? A good leader is able to play not one but four leadership roles. If you’re a leader who wants to help others find their voice and recognize their own potential, you must lead your employees, rather than managing and controlling them. Doing this is central to any leader’s purpose. Filling the four roles listed below will get you well on your way. First, you’ll need a vision and strategy that establishes a direction for your employees. Second, you’ll need to set an example by executing your own ideas in a disciplined fashion. Third, be passionate about what you do so that through your enthusiasm you can establish a shared organizational culture. Finally, you should be able to manage and maintain structures inside your organization. Now you’ve started down the path of leadership, but to become a truly great leader, you must also enlist your four intelligences. We employ our intelligences in order to achieve individual greatness; a leader should apply the same paradigm to her company, a tactic that will make many common problems disappear. Think of the four intelligences as body parts of the company: if one is missing or neglected, it will undermine the structure as a whole. Imagine a company that ignores the need for spirit – something like a shared organizational culture, for example. A dearth of communal spirit could lead to a lack of trust, which in turn could mean that some employees feel totally excluded and alone. Do you ever think, “I’m sure things will get better soon. I’ll just have to wait and see”? If so, you’re not the only one. It’s not uncommon for us to sit around and wait for change. But things rarely change in this way. And as you have the freedom to choose, you’re in the perfect position to rectify your attitude! In order to discover your voice, you must choose to change your motto so that “wait and see” becomes “take action.”  Picture, for instance, that you despise your job because your boss is a total control freak and rejects all the ideas you have. You consider quitting; however, you can’t afford to lose your job. So you decide to just grin and bear it from Monday to Friday. But there is another way.  You could acknowledge that you’re not a victim. You have a choice. The vast majority of the time, you can choose to change something about your situation. All it takes is some initiative and responsibility. When you adopt this mindset and start using your voice, you’ll see that even if your boss is your leader in a formal sense, you still have the power to make a real difference in your own job. If something is really out of your hands, though, you can decide how to react to the situation. Sure, there are certain external things that you just can’t control or influence. Say, for example, that your boss wants to hire someone who rubs you the wrong way, but your job position doesn’t allow you to interfere with hiring decisions. Even in cases like these, you can still choose not to let it bring you down. And if there in fact is something you would like to change and that clearly is part of your role, then take the reins and do it! You’ve heard it before – but for good reason: if you want to be successful, it’s not only about having talent and drive but about who you are as a person. And a large part of how you measure up as a person is your ability to inspire trust in others.  But how do you ensure that people trust you professionally and personally? By sticking to your word, being friendly and knowing when to say sorry. The following simple rules will help you do these things. Once you start doing them consistently, you’ll soon see what a positive impact they have. First, be sure to always make good on your promises. If you are not 100 percent sure you can deliver, don’t make a promise! Failing to follow through is the quickest way to lose other people’s trust. Next, being kind and friendly to others – simply saying “thank you,” “please” and asking, “can I help?” – can make all the difference. Also, watch your words about people who are not in the vicinity, as gossiping is toxic and detrimental to instilling trust. Instead, use warm and friendly words. It will go a long way. Furthermore, being able to say sorry is also incredibly impactful; a genuine apology can earn you back whatever trust you’ve lost in your less-than-admirable moments. Remember, though, that trust is not a one-way street. Sometimes all you need to do is trust another person. In fact, the verb to trust nicely sums up what you’re trying to do when you attempt to help others find their voice. If you genuinely trust someone, you show them that you notice their potential and their value. Granting them this trust will show them their own potential, too. Building a foundation of trust and trusting others in your work and personal life will improve all of your relationships. And the great thing is, it’s not hard: it just takes a bit of effort. Think of the last time you tried to resolve a conflict with someone. How did it go? Did you talk incessantly at each other or did you try to understand your interlocutor’s perspective first? It’s sometimes easier said than done, but the best way to quell a conflict is to truly listen to the other person. Most of us think we’re already pretty good at listening because it feels like we do it all the time. However, there is a big difference between listening as we usually do and empathetic listening. Say you’re trying to decide on a logo for your project and your colleague is presenting their point of view. In order to really listen, try to see what your colleague is seeing and why they are seeing it that way. Try to perceive it from within your colleague’s frame of reference. It’s useful to bear in mind that conflict and misunderstandings are often caused by differences in semantics. All of us have our own way of using words and even a single word can hold different meanings and connotations for different people. Therefore, to better hear and understand your colleague, try to grasp what they mean when they use particular words. After you’ve truly listened to your colleagues’ idea, you can begin explaining your point of view and looking for a third alternative that fits for both of you. After both parties have offered their view, an ideal solution might simply crop up, as the conflict may have only arose because you didn’t understand the other person properly. Sometimes, however, a compromise is necessary. This doesn’t mean that one side loses; rather, there should be mutual understanding and open-mindedness, the natural result of talking to one another and understanding differing opinions. This will make a third alternative far more palatable – maybe even make it the best solution from all perspectives. What’s it like in your company? Do all the workers know the core values of the organization? Are they aligned with them? If you’re a leader and can’t answer yes to these questions, your company might be suffering. If your employees aren’t familiar with the organization’s core values, it’s very likely that the business itself stands on a shaky foundation. For example, imagine asking the CEO of a company about the values of her organization. She might mention that cooperation is a key tenet. Maybe there was even a company training that aimed to help employees cooperate more frequently and in a better way. But workers within the company don’t seem to cooperate all that well. Upon closer inspection of the issue, you may discern that although the company’s core value is cooperation, there’s also a great deal of competitiveness, caused by a reward system for top performing employees. And these two values work against each other. This kind of approach makes for serious misalignment and confuses employees. Some employees might opt for cooperation because it makes them happier and more efficient; others may choose to be competitive because it pushes them to achieve better results and promises rewards. So how do you deal with this as a leader? Start giving feedback to ensure that your employees are aligned with the company’s values. Not a single person or organization is on track all the time, so don’t fret. Don’t punish your employees for this, but provide feedback that helps them get back on target and achieve the desired goal. For instance, how about arranging a monthly team meeting? This would give you an opportunity to let your employees know what you appreciated that month, as well as what could be improved. It will give your employees the chance to offer feedback, too. Who controls the planning and evaluation of tasks in organizations? The leaders, right? This is often the case. But if leaders run an overly tight ship, they often do more harm than good, both to the staff and to the company itself. Many workers aren’t really passionate about their jobs, which usually leads to sloppy results. Employees lose motivation when they don’t have enough freedom or responsibility. Usually the manager takes care of all the planning and evaluating; the workers are expected to do as they’re told. If, however, workers share responsibility and control with their leader, they’ll start to feel more motivated and, as their full potential and talents start to bloom, eventually find their voices. When a leader cedes a little control, workers are empowered and supported, because they feel trusted. Consider a cleaning company with a lot of unmotivated workers whose only task is to clean a large building daily. How could they be motivated? A simple idea to motivate them and help them find their voice is to allow them to make some important decisions – and then evaluate their success. Staff might try out different products, for example, such as different vacuum cleaners, and then evaluate which ones work the best. Having a slightly more hands-off approach may not feel like the right thing to do, as leaders are traditionally the ones who hold the power. But the most important thing is to do the best work possible and inspire the workers to find their own voices in the organization. If you can do this, you, your employees and your company will all reap the rewards. The key message in this book: If you want to thrive in any part of your life, you must find your voice and inspire others to find theirs. Leaders in business are in a prime position to do this, and by instilling trust, communicating effectively and relinquishing some control, they can benefit the entire company. Actionable advice:  Don’t be afraid to give up some power. As a leader, try handing over some responsibility and control to your staff. When employees are empowered, have more say in their tasks and are allowed to make their own decisions, they grow both personally and professionally, which makes the company as a whole more effective.

What is their secret? Are they aliens? Nope, and they don’t have achievement written in their genes, either. Anyone can learn to be an achiever. These blinks are about learning to see that the obstacles to achievement are often just excuses and reasons we make up in our heads. These reasons and excuses get in the way of changing the actual problem: our behavior. As a result we end up making the same mistakes over and over again. Luckily, as these blinks will show you, by learning to see these reasons for the illusions they really are, you can truly start changing your behavior and take the first step to becoming an achiever. But what are the next steps? These blinks will show you. In these blinks, you’ll learn what Oprah learned from losing her first job; that failure is just a word; and why networking is overrated. Anyone can become an achiever. But first, you have to learn how to just do things.  Think about how many people dream of starting their own company, but end up working for someone else. Well, you can learn to close the gap between what you want to do and what actually gets done.  Look at it this way: there’s a fundamental difference between trying and doing.  Imagine you want to take something from someone’s hand: merely trying gets you bupkis – the other person sees you reaching and strengthens their grip. In this case, you didn’t use enough force and you didn’t act quickly. If, instead of trying, you had simply done, the other person wouldn’t have had the time to resist you.  The point is, the only obstacle is you. Everything else is just an excuse or a mental limit. If you’re not happy with some aspect of your life, you can change it.  Because here’s the thing: life is basically an exercise in problem-solving – and that’s not a bad thing. Problems are opportunities to learn and move forward. And learning how to use problems to your advantage is exactly what the Achievement Habit is all about.  One important aspect of the Achievement Habit comes from Design Thinking, a set of practices designers often use in their work, namely an openness to failure. Failure defines pretty much every success story. Even Oprah was fired from her first job as a television anchor. But failure didn’t stop her, it motivated her!  Of course for most of us, motivation is the hard part. School trains us to work in order to earn high grades and degrees, but there are no report cards in life. So in adulthood, most of us have to train ourselves to be self-motivated. We assign meaning to everything. Whether we’re thinking about an incompetent boss or home ownership, we tend to forget the fact that our perception is subjective. Meaning isn’t fixed; it’s a matter of perspective. For instance, your incompetent boss might wow you tomorrow with some breakthrough idea. And you yourself are similarly capable of reinvention. You might want to say it out loud: no one is just one thing, not you, your boss, your spouse, your children or your parents.  And if you can get over the impulse to assign a fixed meaning to everything, you can start to channel failure more productively. Because failure is only a catastrophe if that’s what you call it. No one’s keeping a scorecard of your failures and successes – only you can give your life meaning. It’s an empowering truth: you have control over your own experience.  The author realized this fact when two family friends were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. The family of the first patient tried to stay positive and have fun despite the disease; they always looked forward to visiting their relative. The other family positioned themselves as victims of a horrible fate and were consumed by loss; visiting their loved one was always painful and uncomfortable.  As you can see, the meaning these two families assigned to the disease had a huge impact on their experience of it. You can become an achiever by using this insight to stop labeling the world. After all, since labels are fixed, they just stand in the way of achievement.  Imagine losing your job. Calling yourself a “loser” would be pointless, since that’s just a meaningless label and one that prevents you from moving past the setback. We always seem to have reasons for everything. Imagine you held the door open for an old lady in the morning. Then later in the day, you win the lottery. You might tell yourself that you were rewarded for doing a good deed. But really, your behavior had nothing to do with it. The relationship between those two incidents is correlative, not causal.  You might understand that fact on a rational level. And yet, chances are, whenever you’re late to a meeting, you probably hunt for some external reason – like traffic on the interstate. But in reality, you knew there would be heavy traffic on your route. You’re late simply because you didn’t make the meeting a priority.  The problem is, blaming external factors prevents you from actively making decisions and changing your behavior. Making decisions is tough, but can be easier thanks to a method called the Gun Test.  Whenever a big decision comes up in the workplace, for example, start by laying out the pros and cons for each option. Then point your finger at whoever has to decide and give them 15 seconds. This rapid-fire approach works because chances are, they’ve already decided – they’re just reluctant to commit. But additional reasoning probably won’t change the outcome or lead to a better decision, so it’s better to just make the decision and move forward. After all, if you lay out the typical “life journey” – asking what will happen as a result of a decision – you’ll realize that pretty much all roads lead in the same direction: children, house, death. But you can’t possibly predict all the other things that’ll come your way. That’s why you should adopt a bias toward actions and a tolerance for failure.  We often think the road toward some desirable destination is blocked by lack of money, other people, or something else. But as we’ve suggested, the best way to overcome a perceived obstacle is by reframing our perspective on it.  Of course, for this to work, you have to be dealing with the actual problem and not something else. Let’s say you think you’re looking for a spouse. But is it possible that what you’re actually looking for is companionship, and that finding a spouse seems like the easiest way? So, once you’ve determined the true nature of your problem, searching for a solution might seem like the natural next step. But before you do that, try reframing the problem. For example, a friend of the author complained that he couldn’t sleep because his bed was broken. He tried solving the problem by fixing the bed one way after another, but each failed. That’s when he asked himself, “What do I actually want? To repair this bed or to have a good night’s sleep in any bed?” That’s when he realized that his problem had nothing to do with the old broken bed. Since he wanted to sleep well, he just went ahead and bought himself a new one.  Similarly, sometimes obstacles are just a matter of language. If you change the way you describe something, it might cease to be an obstacle. This method is as simple as swapping out the word “but” for “and.” If you say, “I want to go to the movies, but I have to work,” you’ve created a conflict that may not necessarily exist. Instead, you can phrase it thusly: “I want to go to the movies and I have to work.” Along the same lines, saying that you “want to” do something will motivate you much more than saying that you “have to” do something. Chances are you won’t be able to achieve anything on your own. You’ll need help, so seek out people whose accomplishments match your goals.  You don’t have to follow their path, but you can learn from them. And don’t just focus on the positive attributes: paying attention to negative qualities is also productive.  To that end, consider Gandhi: he was an awe-inspiring teacher, but a bad father. His wife and sons reportedly felt that he never really cared for them. So you can view Gandhi as a role model teacher, but take his personal life as an example of something you don’t want for yourself.  Taking a step back, when we talk about learning from others, it’s easy to slip into networking mode. But instead of keeping everything on the professional surface, you’d be better off sharing your ideas earnestly and looking for true friendship.  The point is, if you want to have a fulfilling life, seek out genuine human relationships instead of using others to climb the ladder. Get to know the people around you. Also, there’s no reason to fiercely guard your ideas and resources – share your knowledge with others!  Unfortunately the working world is often at odds with true cooperation and creativity. But you can overcome those norms by changing the physical conditions around you, like having people sit in circles during meetings. Start moving toward a flat hierarchy to facilitate open and creative exchange. Create space for play, even during a serious conference. Taking these steps will make the final outcome better for all involved.  You can also establish a positive group feedback and discussion system using a 1) “I like,” 2) “I like,” 3) “I wish,” structure. This means that each person notes two things they really appreciated about someone’s performance and then adds (without a “but”) one point of constructive feedback. What do you think of yourself? Are you an achiever? Well, you should start calling yourself one. Because ultimately, achievement is a matter of self-image. Meaning, if you start identifying as an achiever, chances are you’ll start achieving great things pronto.  As children, we construct our self-image based on what our parents and teachers tell us. But as adults, it’s important for us to truly own our self-image.  To understand the difference between how you see yourself and how others perceive you, ask five friends to jot down five characteristics of your personality. Compare their responses to your own list: you’ll see some variety but also a lot of overlap. That overlap will include some characteristics you’ll want to retain and others you’ll want to change.  It’s also important to understand your intentions. What do you want to achieve? Ask yourself what you would do if you only had ten minutes, ten hours, and so on. That way, you’ll be clear on what you really want.  Identifying your life goals is trickier. Because although you need a general sense of what you want out of life, you shouldn’t be too rigid about your path.  For instance, you don’t have to stay within the prescribed bounds of your profession. It won’t be easy to take an untraveled route – especially when family and society expects something else of you – but that needn’t deter you. There’ll be failure on any path you take, so don’t let that get in your way. It’s worth noting that you can always leave the path you’re currently traveling on if it stops making sense. To make sure you’re on the right track, just keep asking yourself, Who am I? and What do I really want? There you have it! Now you’re ready to take control of your life and start achieving your goals. The key message: There are no “losers” or “lucky people.” Achievement can be learned when fixed labels are the only thing holding you back. So to start getting what you want, rethink your goals and the obstacles in your path. And then start doing something about it! Actionable advice: Stop thinking about who’s wrong and who’s right. Playing the right-and-wrong game is a waste of time. It just makes us angry and it doesn’t produce anything useful. Since “right” and “wrong” are just a matter of perspective, you lose from the moment you start playing the game. So instead of clinging to false certainty, accept the fact that different people can have different opinions. Suggested further reading: Creative Confidence by Tom and David Kelley Creative Confidence shows us the amazing value and impact that creativity has in our everyday lives. In fact, being able to think creatively can increase your happiness and success in both your professional and personal spheres. Luckily, artists and musicians don’t have a monopoly on creativity.

Do you struggle to get out of bed and dread yet another unhappy day at work? If so, don’t worry! Many of us feel this way, because many of us haven’t yet found our calling. Your calling is the reason you get up in the morning, the reason you strive to achieve. When you find yours, you’ll be bounding out of bed everyday, ready to make a difference in the world. These blinks lay out the benefits of finding your calling, and give clear guidelines on how to find it. In these blinks, you’ll discover how having a calling can help you live on after death; why failure can make you a better person; and why there is no such thing as a self-made man. Do you dislike your job? Well, you’re not alone. Only 13 percent of the world’s population actually enjoy their work. So how can we go about changing that statistic? Perhaps by searching for work that makes you happy and refusing to do anything else? Not exactly. The best way to achieve happiness in the workplace is to find your calling – a force larger than yourself that drives your every action. And to do that, you can’t think only in terms of happiness and pain. Humans shouldn't be mere pleasure seekers or discomfort avoiders; instead, they should strive to imbue their lives with meaning. If you’re busy steering clear of pain and failure, you'll never find your calling. Inevitably, you'll face challenges along the way to achieving your dreams, and accepting these difficulties as a natural part of discovering what you really love is part of maintaining forward movement. Viktor Frankl, the renowned psychologist and Holocaust survivor, knew this well. He wrote that everyone needs a reason to keep living, a cause to push them forward. But how do you find this cause? That's where awareness comes in. Awareness helps you recognize your calling when you come across it. People discover their callings when some event or feeling triggers their awareness of it. For instance, Luke Skywalker knew he wanted to be a Jedi after Obi-Wan Kenobi introduced him to the art. So, though it can be difficult, you need to keep an eye out for this event. Awareness is being ready for the moment so you can seize it when it comes. Another good way to find your calling is to make a list of all the major events in your life, even the ones that might not seem like the most important. When did you feel the most fulfilled, happy or accomplished? Look for similarities between these moments – your calling might be something that ties them all together. Finding and following your calling is a personal journey, but that doesn't mean you should do it alone. Getting support from others is a very important part of it! It's tempting to view successful people as self-made; in reality, however, almost no one achieves success alone. In fact, the most successful people are those who know how to find good coaches and mentors. Mentors guide them as they get closer to their calling. Every person you meet and every experience you have is a chance to learn something about yourself. Life is your school. Just think about Steve Jobs: He left college to pursue his dream and sneaked into college classes he found interesting or valuable. The rest he learned by working with people in the outside world. Once you've found the people who can help you move toward your goal, it's time to get to work. You can only master your calling by practicing it. And the best way to practice is to never stop striving toward knowledge and self-improvement. That means you have to accustom yourself to failure. Practice isn't about doing the same simple task over and over again. It's about pushing yourself into new frontiers – making mistakes and learning from them. Think of practicing as muscle building. Muscles grow when you regularly push them a little too far, which causes them to tear and then rebuild themselves. It’s important to note, though, that you can't will yourself to achieve everything. There are some things that some of us just can't do, and that's all right. So if you find you can't make any progress, maybe you haven't found the right calling yet. So what do you do once you know where you're headed? Sit back and see where things take you? Far from it. Your journey is a flight of stairs – not an escalator. Keep taking steps until you reach the top. Say your calling is teaching, for instance. You shouldn’t stop working toward your goal: keep teaching classes, watch other teachers work and study techniques in the library. If you stop for even a short period, it might be difficult to start again. Always keep improving yourself! But don’t worry about making a few missteps. Failure doesn't take you away from success – it leads you there! Everyone who pursues their dream experiences setbacks at some point. Accept these hardships as opportunities to learn and better yourself. This is exactly what happened to Steve Jobs when he was kicked out of Apple, his very own company. Instead of dwelling on his misfortune, he got involved with Pixar. He learned from his mistakes at Apple and turned Pixar into a highly profitable business; eventually, he returned to Apple and turned it into one of the biggest companies in the world. A good way to think about your mistakes is to use the pivot foot. In basketball, when you take two steps without dribbling, the foot you land on becomes your pivot foot, meaning you can't take it off the floor. But you can move your body around it, looking for chances to pass or shoot. In other words, you can still act even when you think you've come to a stopping point. No roadblock is the end. You've got to be the one to take yourself where you want to go. Have you ever heard the term portfolio life? Probably not. But you might already be living one! In a portfolio life, your identity is based on a wide range of things, not just one. The author, for example, isn't only a writer – he's a father and husband, too. There are four main areas in a portfolio life: work, home, play and purpose. Work doesn't have to refer only to your main job; it can include other projects you work on as well. Home is all about your family and friends – that's where much of the meaning in your life comes from. When you do things just for the joy of it, that's your play. Finally, your purpose is the main goal of your life – what you're prepared to take risks for. The growing number of freelancers illustrates the popularity of the portfolio life. By 2020, between 40 and 50 percent of the American workforce will be freelancers, and by 2030, they'll comprise the majority. Why do people like freelancing so much? Because humans aren't robots programed to do a single thing. Our interests are myriad and we feel better when we can allot time to them all. Variety is part of a meaningful life. Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, a psychologist, argues that we should all aim for a mental state called flow. Your flow lies at the intersection of what you're good at and what challenges you. A task isn't interesting if it's too easy, and if it's too difficult, you'll get anxious. Flow is about finding that spot in the middle. So seek out different sorts of challenges that will bring variety to your portfolio life, because living a portfolio life means living for your calling. Your calling is a lot bigger than doing something like writing a novel, because it isn't just about you! Your calling is more than a personal goal – it’s your legacy, the work that will continue to inspire others long after you're finished with it. If you're doing something for yourself alone, that's not your calling. So don't aim to produce one masterpiece – your calling is more like a magnum opus. It's your entire body of work. When you think of Mozart, for example, you might think of The Magic Flute or some particular sonata. But naming one piece of music doesn’t capture Mozart's artistry; it’s his life's work that has influenced people and inspired them for centuries. To understand your calling you must acknowledge death, because a calling is also a legacy. You'll never finish with your calling, no matter how hard you try. And a fear of death can in fact be useful – it drives many to keep creating until the end. While on his deathbed, Einstein even asked for his glasses because he was so desperate to finish his work in time. Unfortunately, you can't stop death. You have to accept that you'll probably never finish everything. But even after you're gone, your legacy will live on through your work. Albert Uderzo, the creator of the comic Asterix, understood this well. He was the only person who made Asterix, and yet he wanted his comic to outlive him, so he passed the series to a new author, Jean-Yves Ferri. That was difficult for him, but it ensured his legacy would live on. Living for your calling isn't just about mastering the art of work. It's also about the art of living and dying in peace. The key message in this book: Everyone has a calling – an idea that imbues their life with meaning and pushes them forward. So develop the awareness to find yours and strive to live a portfolio life that will give you the happiness and balance you need. When you live for your calling, you won't just produce work you'll be proud of – you'll feel more fulfilled and leave behind a legacy that will continue to inspire others even after you've passed on. Actionable advice: Take risks and make mistakes. It's good when something challenges you – that's how you grow. So don't be afraid to embrace new things, and if you make any mistakes, take advantage of them. Use them as learning opportunities that can bring you closer to your goal. Following your calling is all about leaving your comfort zone and exploring the unknown.

If you do, then you may be in the minority. According to one study, 84 percent of all US workers feel disengaged, and that percentage has stayed more or less the same since 2002. Many companies don’t seem to be doing anything about this. Very few seriously consider ways to improve their working environment. They should. It is clear that a happy and more enthusiastic workforce will perform better, and customers will be happier as a result. These blinks help explain how businesses – both large and small – can make the positive changes to their environments, allowing staff to break the trend and start enjoying work. In these blinks you’ll discover how to exploit the power of napping; why staff hate sitting with their back to the room; and why winning an Oscar can prolong your life. What’s the best way for you as a workplace leader to manage the productivity of your staff? According to traditional thinking, productivity is best achieved when employees spend nearly all their time working as hard as possible. But although this old-fashioned approach was well-suited to the mechanical work that proliferated during the Industrial Revolution, today it’s seriously outdated. Instead, modern society’s most successful managers eschew the rigid nine-to-five formula, encouraging staff to carve out flexible work schedules. In other words, they let employees work when and where they feel most comfortable. For instance, old-fashioned managers might view napping as a waste of time. But in fact, napping is a great way for staff to keep their energy levels up for longer. (Of course, we’re talking about a 20-minute power-nap – not a long, deep sleep.) So to that end, a manager wanting to promote productivity might skip the new espresso machine and buy a cozy futon instead. Similarly, managers should create firm boundaries between work and home life. For example, Volkswagen and Daimler cut off e-mail access after business hours, allowing employees to recharge at night and be more productive during the day. Practices like these are sure to boost productivity, but if you really want to ensure that your employees achieve at the highest level, you also have to embrace failure. After all, no one can work at their full potential if they feel pressured to produce flawless work hour after hour. That’s simply too much stress! A stress-free environment isn’t the only advantage of embracing failure: This attitude will also promote experimentation, leading to a culture of innovation. To really understand the link between failure and innovation, consider this: The greatest inventions in human history followed repeated failure. Edison, for example, spent years trying and failing before he finally managed to invent the lightbulb. Imagine this scenario: Your boss expects you to come up with a creative solution by the end of the day. Working under pressure, you try as hard as you can, and yet the solution you’re looking for couldn’t be farther away. Unfortunately, this is an all-too-common workplace dilemma. Because after all, it’s hard to be creative when you’re under pressure. That’s why as a manager you should establish an environment that promotes play; this will take the pressure off and relax your staff, ultimately encouraging creativity. What’s the best way to do this? Well, you can start by freeing up your staff’s timetables and carving out space for games and athletic activity: For instance, your company can organize a running club or a football team. You can install some game consoles or simply buy a few board games. Although there are benefits to bringing actual games into the office, it’s also advantageous to incorporate the logic of play into your working processes. Think about it like this: One big reason games are so compelling is that they provide instant feedback. For instance, when you successfully play a video game, you’re instantly rewarded: You pass to ever-more advanced levels and secure high scores. Everyone likes this kind of recognition because, simply put, it makes us feel good about ourselves. And in fact, it can even make us healthier. Because believe it or not, studies have shown that Oscar-winning actors outlive mere nominees by an average of four years! Bearing that in mind, make sure that your staff’s hard work is noticed and recognized. And don’t rely on that old standby, the Employee of the Month Award, because recognizing one person at a time is too limited. Instead, take advantage of social media to call out great work and recognize each and every success, whenever it happens! Try to recall a childhood experience you loved wholeheartedly. Maybe it was a vacation at the beach, maybe it was a sporting event. Whatever it was, you probably get a warm feeling when you remember it. And it probably makes you feel more energetic. Well, companies should promote these kinds of positive emotions in their staff, as that will lead to increased productivity. There are many ways to do this: You can hold office events during holidays like Easter or Halloween, or you can organize sports teams and book clubs. These events needn’t be costly or grandiose. In fact, instead of focusing on extravagance, simply focus on frequency. That way, you can provide staff with many positive emotions and memories, large or small – ultimately creating a positive environment. Think it’s impossible to create a pleasant atmosphere at a boring old office? Well, think again: Any environment can be a positive one with just a few simple tweaks. For example, casinos are depressing because they aim to enable patrons to lose as much money as possible. However, if you swap out money for valueless plastic chips and offer free drinks, a casino becomes a fun, pleasant place. Of course, people can’t be happy all the time, because we all have a dark side. But that’s not a bad thing – embrace it! Think about it like this: When positive emotions are overly emphasized and negative emotions are disregarded, people stop thinking critically and become less receptive to substantive feedback. As a result, the whole company becomes more error-prone. It’s also worth noting that not every department requires the same level of positivity to promote good results. Because although an uplifting atmosphere benefits salespeople – who need positive energy to build successful relationships with clients – it would not necessarily benefit accountants, who need to be more meticulous with their work. Although it’s common knowledge that effective teamwork is an essential component of any company’s success, many managers mistakenly believe that friendship isn’t necessarily conducive to this kind of collaboration. But in fact, truly high-performing teams are made up of friends, not mere acquaintances. And there are many reasons that’s true. Friends are far less likely to let each other down, which means they support each other and deliver on their promises. From a business perspective, that means friendship-centric teams are less likely to fail. Friendship also negates loneliness. This is not a trivial point, as loneliness can have devastating effects on your body and your work. But unfortunately, loneliness is too common in many offices when employees feel alienated from their colleagues – the emotional equivalent of working in a cubicle. It does not promote happiness and productivity among staff. So what can you do to mitigate the negative effects of loneliness and cultivate friendship among your employees? Well, it helps to understand how people become friends in the first place, and that is through physical proximity, familiarity and by reaffirming similarity. In other words, people become friends when they work together on the same tasks again and again. You can make sure your workplace is conducive to this process by eliminating cubicles and any other barriers. Additionally, you can organize group activities like obstacle races or running competitions. Physical activities like these promote friendship by producing a rush of adrenaline, a powerful hormone that makes it easier to connect with those around you. Ultimately, an environment that supports friendship will help generate a communal feeling of pride in the organization itself. And when your team is proud of the work they do, they’ll be motivated to produce better work. Although looks aren’t everything, humans are visual creatures. So to that end, what does your workplace look like? Do you feel happy when you look around? Or do you feel depressed every time you step into the office? These are important questions to ask, but few companies bother. Most managers assume that a good employee can do the same good work anywhere. But this kind of thinking is seriously misguided. After all, just think how much more inspired you’d feel at the Sistine Chapel – with its majestic frescos and high ceilings – than in an office cubicle, with its dark, oppressive barriers. But unfortunately, too many offices are negligent on this point, settling for drab, badly designed spaces that depress workers and damage productivity. However, there are a few easy guidelines you can follow to improve your office space for the benefit of your employees. First, allow human evolution to guide your design process. So for instance, today we don’t like exposing our backs because the same position would have left our distant ancestors vulnerable to a predator attack. Therefore, to make your staff more comfortable, don’t make them sit with the back of their chairs facing the open room. Also, humans have an deep-seated love of nature, so make sure your office has lots of windows and that your staff can see outside. It’s also worth noting that no matter how well you design your office, the best way to make your staff comfortable is by letting them choose their own workplace. Optimally, employees should have a choice of working in three different rooms, as well as the option to work from home. In other words, create lots of alternatives and cede control to your employees. After all, creating a comfortable, pleasant environment will boost workplace productivity – so do your best to create an office people love. No matter how decisive and visionary you are as a leader, you also need to be a good communicator if you want to carry out your plans and ensure that your workplace operates smoothly. So how do you ensure that you’re a good communicator? The key is to listen and be nonjudgmental. And when it comes to listening, you need to be an active listener, which is all about showing the other person that you’re listening carefully, in order to build trust. To achieve this, maintain direct eye contact and make sure that your body language shows that you’re paying attention. Also, make sure you only speak half as much as the other person. And to stay nonjudgmental, keep your emotions in check. That way, any feedback you give won’t be taken personally. Being an active, nonjudgmental listener is an important part of being an effective leader, but it’s not the only thing: You also have to set a good example for your employees. After all, people naturally mimic their superiors. When we see success in other people, we automatically try to emulate it in order to become more successful ourselves. In other words, the way you conduct yourself as a leader will trickle down to employees. And in fact, studies have shown that CEOs who are naturally warm lead more cohesive teams; similarly, curious-minded CEOs tend to have flexible and risk-tolerant teams. This means you should take steps to ensure that you’re promoting good behavior. For example, behave calmly and never get angry, even when confronted with frustrating challenges. This will create an environment of trust, leading to a calm and happy staff. So now that we’ve discussed all the factors that make a workplace great, let’s talk about what you need to do to find the right people. How would you hire a new employee? Well, most of us create a job ad, wait for applications and then interview the candidates who have the best technical skills and experience. That’s the traditional recruiting process, and it’s pretty popular. However, it’s hardly ideal. After all, this process only targets job-seekers, narrowing your search to candidates who are unemployed or unhappy with their current jobs. Another problem with the traditional recruiting process is that it’s hard to get an accurate sense of candidates’ actual technical expertise from the interview alone. Because believe it or not, studies show that 81 percent of interviewees lie. Furthermore, it’s difficult to accurately gauge expertise because you, the interviewer, are probably biased. Even when you focus on evaluating technical skills, subconsciously you’re making your decision according to other factors. For instance, people who are tall and have deep voices are more likely to get hired, because interviewers connect these qualities with good health. Since there are many problems with the traditional recruiting process, you need to change your approach. We recommend getting creative with interviews and also giving your employees a larger role in the process. So when you need to make a new hire, rally your employees. Let them ask around and tap their own networks. This way, you stand a better chance of finding great employees outside the basic applicant pool. And then, once you have your candidates, introduce creativity into the interview process. To avoid the lies, avoid questions relating to technical expertise. Instead, ask questions to determine whether candidates would fit in with your team. For example, while interviewed for a job, the author’s wife had to answer the question, “If you could be any fabric, what fabric would you be?” She answered velvet, because that fabric is warm on the inside and smooth on the outside. Ultimately, this answer showed her interviewer that she was a team player – and she got the job! The key message in this book: Every workplace can improve – and as a leader, you can change yours for the better. All it takes is a willingness to prioritize your employees’ happiness and well-being. You have to be seriously committed in order to create a more positive environment, but it will be well worth it, leading to increased productivity and better results.  Actionable advice: Encourage your staff to take breaks, naps and sometimes work from home.  Although some people fear that these practices only waste time, creating a more flexible approach to scheduling and workspace will lead to better productivity.

You probably saw them and thought, no way I’ll ever do that! Yet people are taking similar leaps every day and making the most out of life, while those who give into fear remain stuck complaining about being in the same rut, day after day. It’s time to take control of your life and be done with the excuses once and for all. And the great thing is, it doesn’t involve any death-defying plunges from a hundred-foot cliff. All it takes is some confidence and a willingness to put an end to bad habits. In these blinks, you’ll learn how some deep breaths can set you on the right path; why worrying is a sign of self-sabotage; and how you might need to put your workplace on a complaining diet. No one said life would be easy, and sometimes it can really feel like an endless swamp of problems, but ask yourself this: Are you really prepared for a life of happiness? Can you even imagine an entire day without having something to complain about? Everyone has their own inner resistance to happiness, an oddly human trait that deserves some close scrutiny. Despite spending a lot of time and energy striving for happiness, human beings aren’t especially comfortable or skilled at feeling good or being at peace. School teaches us a lot of things, but there are no high school classes on how to deal with success and happiness. If you were to take the time to look within and uncover why you resist happiness, the answer would likely be related to fear – a fear of achieving your full potential. Because here’s the thing: when you become the best you can be, that means there’s no more excuse for why you aren’t making your dreams come true. This is a fear that must be conquered if you truly want success and happiness. Taking the big leap into a life of happiness requires a great deal of confidence. So let’s explore the ways you can learn to overcome this fear and start taking the right kinds of risks. The first technique for breaking the fear barrier is breathing. Back in the mid-1900s, psychiatrist Fritz Perls developed Gestalt therapy, which recognized that fear is, essentially, a sort of breathless excitement. With some focused breathing, you can transform that fear into a positive and powerful excitement that can be used to make great things happen. Let’s say you’re about to take the stage for a performance or to give a speech. The common reaction to a scary situation like this is for our breath to become constricted, which only makes the fear stronger. But if you take a moment to breathe deeply, you can take control and transform the fear into the powerful energy that lets you take the stage and captivate your audience. You probably have some dreams that you keep to yourself because you think they’re impractical or out of reach. This common feeling is called an upper-limit mindset, and it’s the next hurdle to overcome. An upper-limit mindset is a lot like having a warning system that tells us that we can only achieve a certain amount of happiness and nothing more. With this mindset in place, you might be experiencing a period of success where everything is going well, but some part of you will begin to feel uncomfortable with this winning streak. So, in order to get things back to “normal,” you start to create needless obstacles and drama in your life. This is a routine form of self-sabotage, and the problems tend to be created in areas of life separate from where we’ve been experiencing success. For example, if your love life's going great then you might decide to make a risky investment that puts your financial life in crisis. But this doesn’t have to happen. Generally, the upper-limit problem will only appear if you let your guard down after a great achievement. Take a client of the author’s named Lois. She was in her fifties and had a successful business, but she wasn’t doing so well in the relationship department. Lois had come to believe that love simply wasn’t something she could “do.” But after a few therapy sessions with the author, Lois decided to give it one more shot. Sure enough, a loving relationship did enter her life. But then, as Lois was pleased with both her romantic and professional life, she decided to let her guard down and stop her therapy sessions. Thinking she’d had the breakthrough she was after, Lois felt she didn’t need any more help. In a mere six months, her relationship was on the verge of falling apart. Fortunately, Lois resumed therapy and managed to save the relationship. It was at this point that she began to believe that she deserved to have both love and success, and became willing to work hard at both of these parts of her life. These days we have more than our fair share of distractions, which is why it’s perhaps more important than ever to pay attention to where we’re going. And this is about more than keeping our eyes on the road when we’re driving. As we move along the road of life, we need to be aware of how often we’re getting in our own way. A great way to recognize when an upper-limit mindset is trying to sabotage your progress is to catch yourself when you start worrying – and then to question the source of the worry. The next time you’re worrying, ask yourself: Is this an issue I have control over? More often than not, our worries are pointless, since they’re about something we simply can’t control. In the event that you do have control over the issue, don’t prolong the worry any more than is absolutely necessary. Instead, take action and put that worry to rest! When you start to question your worries, you’ll quickly see that most of them aren’t about real problems. For example, the author had a billionaire client who was always stressed about money and minute things like the price of toilet paper. Even though he could have lived a lavish lifestyle, something within the man wouldn’t allow him to enjoy the money. Instead, the billions of dollars were a constant source of worry and misery. This is a textbook example of upper-limit syndrome. Whatever success we may find in life, it won’t change the deeper problems that may lurk within and continue to go unresolved. For the billionaire in question, he was dealing with issues that stemmed from his parents, who routinely fought with each other over money even though the family was extremely wealthy. As a result, he not only felt like he didn’t deserve his inherited riches; he was constantly criticizing his wife’s spending and putting an unhealthy strain on their relationship, too. During a session, the billionaire was asked to refrain from criticizing his wife for a week, to see what would happen. When the following week’s session began, he looked ten years younger. Not only was his marriage in better shape; he was making considerable progress toward accepting his wealth, too. When was the last time that you got so immersed in something and were so “in the zone” that you lost track of time? However long ago it was, you’d probably like to spend more time enjoying that state of flow. For this to happen, and for your big leap to really take off, you need to commit yourself to working in your Zone of Genius, otherwise known as the job you’re perfectly suited for. Finding such a job can feel frightening because then you’d really have no excuse not to be your best at work. To help you overcome this fear, here’s a helpful affirmation that you can repeat to gain some extra inspiration and strength: “I commit to dedicating all my purpose and energy to my personal Zone of Genius, in which I can contribute the most to the world.” You can first repeat this affirmation softly to yourself, and then repeat it loudly and confidently, as if you were letting the universe know your intentions. By doing this, you may soon find things falling into place for you, almost as if by magic. Even if you’re not sure what you’re meant to do in life, stay true to your Zone of Genius and you’ll be sure to find clarity. Maybe you’re torn between medicine, psychiatry and engineering. Well, if you pay attention to your studies, you’re sure to notice which subject brings you to that state of effortless flow. And the more time you spend in that field, the closer you’ll get to the actual job you’re meant to do. Once you discover what it is that you love to do the most, you’ll also discover how easy it is to be engaged with your work – so much so that it won’t even feel like work anymore! That’s the Zone of Genius. The author is most in the Zone when taking meaningful and transformational ideas on life and making them accessible to everyone. For others, it might be finding ways to make meetings more fun or simply fully committing to practicing the piano and turning it into a career. The possibilities are endless. No one enjoys the feeling of confinement. It’s much better to break free and start ascending a never-ending ladder of success. When you find your Zone of Genius, this is closer to what life is like. And to keep you moving onward and upward, it helps to have a mantra for success. Repeating a mantra is a simple form of meditation. As you repeat the words, you’ll begin to focus your attention, energy and entire mind and body on what you’re saying – all while visualizing the message and its intention. You can think of a mantra like a unique software program that you are downloading to your mind’s hard drive. If you want to get really serious and achieve the best results possible, you could meditate for multiple hours every day. But you’ll see positive results even if you only put in 30 minutes in the morning and the evening. So, you’re probably wondering, what exactly is this success mantra that will help me fulfill my dreams? Just take a deep breath and repeat the following: “I expand in abundance, success and love every day, as I inspire those around me to do the same.” After memorizing this mantra, you can then go a step further by practicing the Enlightened No, which is a useful method for avoiding things that aren’t in alignment with your Zone of Genius. For example, imagine a colleague approaches you with an investment opportunity. For a reasonable price that lies within your budget, you could stand to earn back $50,000 through a new product that has the potential to do a lot of good. Let’s say the product is a new biofeedback machine that will help people who’ve been paralyzed. The Enlightened No is a way of staying focused by asking yourself: Does this opportunity align with my Zone of Genius? If your Zone is neuroscience, then yes, but if you’re Zone is making music, then you should politely decline. This way, you won’t get sidetracked and end up involved in something that distracts you from your goals. Back at the start of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein made history with his theory of relativity, which explained how time and space relate to one another. Well, you don’t need to know all the details of Einstein’s laws in order to put them to use and become a master of time. That’s right, rather than being at the mercy of time, you can take control of it. And it all starts with taking responsibility and acknowledging that you are in charge. Remember the advice about worrying, and letting go of things that are out of your control? At its core, this advice is about being honest with yourself and your responsibilities and taking control of aspects of your life that you may have a history of avoiding. When you avoid your responsibilities, what may have started out as small problems will only get worse. As time progresses, the stress over these issues will only increase. The trick is to reverse all of this. Let’s say your child has a drinking problem. You may ignore this, thinking they’ll outgrow it. But the longer you avoid dealing with the issue, the bigger it’ll grow. Not only will your child suffer for a longer period but you yourself will also likely need to spend much more time dealing with the issue in the future. The minute you take control and begin dealing with the problem is the moment it will begin to shrink, and you’ll instantly be giving yourself more time in the future. Another way to take control of your time is to enforce a complaint diet. Think about it: how much time is wasted every day complaining about this, that and the other? To realize the real extent, take a week to observe your colleagues’ conversations and notice how much of it revolves around complaining – whether it’s about a client, a coworker or lack of sleep. When you hear your coworkers complaining, point it out to them and explain that it doesn’t solve anything. It’s much more constructive to take responsibility for the problem and fix it. But don’t forget to also be on the lookout for when you complain yourself. A classic complaint that should be immediately prohibited is saying you don’t have enough time to do something. Not only do you have the time, but if you do it now, rather than putting it off, you’ll save time. Generally speaking, the more we put things off, the more time they’ll end up taking. When you find yourself in a loving relationship, you may think to yourself, “This is too good to be true!” But some people will act as though it really is too good to be true and start doubting the value of their relationship and mess it up. Whether you’re successful in other areas of your life or not, relationship challenges are common. Statistics show that financial success can put a major strain on love. Around 20 years ago, researchers John Cuber and Peggy Harroff conducted an influential study that showed how 80 percent of highly successful people were unhappy in their relationships. Many couples were still living together even though the love was no longer there, while others had never really been in love in the first place, and felt their partnership was more of a business arrangement than a romantic one. The rest had relationships that could best be described as being in constant conflict. Though this study is decades old, there’s little reason to believe much has changed. Highly successful people still feel like they must choose between work and love, and work usually wins out. But for those willing to work on a balanced life, there is hope. One significant way to improve relationships is to avoid projecting your problems onto others. Projection occurs when you avoid responsibility and blame others for your personal issues. For example, a woman might blame her unhappiness on her husband’s passivity. But a closer look might reveal that she actually enjoys being the dominant personality in her relationships and has always ended up with passive men. On the other hand, a man might complain that his domineering wife prevents him from expressing himself. But if he were honest about this projection, he would realize that he has trouble accepting his responsibility for ultimately being in control of his own life. For a relationship to flourish, each partner needs to take full responsibility for their lives and not blame the other for whatever shortcomings they may have. Ultimately, life’s too short for such petty disputes. We need to stay focused on supporting each other in doing what we love and flourishing as best we can. The key message in this book: Most people go through life believing that they’re only allowed a limited amount of happiness and success. This isn’t true. When you take the big leap to fulfill your full potential, you’ll discover that there are no limits and there’s an unlimited supply of happiness and success for each and every person willing to overcome their fears. Actionable advice: Discard the personas that are standing in the way of your success. Often, adults believe that a certain trait is an inherent part of their personality. For example, if your were shy in school, you may continue to carry that shyness far into adulthood. But remember, you are 100 percent in charge of who you choose to be. You can discard this shy persona and allow yourself to be outgoing, charismatic and extroverted if that is what you want and need for success. Got feedback?

Citrin","summary":"You’re just out of college and you’re ready to make a start in the world of work. Work is your oyster, and you dream of a job that aligns with your passions and career choices – and that starts you off at a healthy salary to boot. And yet, if this is your dream, you’re likely to be disappointed, at least at first. Almost everyone is initially met with disappointment, including all those executive managers whose positions you want so badly. In these blinks, you’ll learn why. You’ll learn that everyone’s career path differs, and how you can make the smartest (but maybe not the most immediately rewarding) career moves as a young professional wishing to get ahead in your work life. In these blinks, you’ll discover what John F. Kennedy has to do with your career path; why you shouldn’t say “you know” in a job interview; and how to get a job that requires job experience that you don’t have. The Bermuda Triangle, an expanse in the Atlantic covering one million square miles, has enveloped wayward ships and planes for centuries. The Career Triangle might seem less dangerous, but it can be just as challenging to navigate. Why? Because in the early stages of your career, you have to struggle to balance your job satisfaction, lifestyle and compensation. It’s very unlikely that you’ll have the freedom to explore and discover yourself during the first few years of your career. You'll probably have to choose between making money and pursuing your own ideas, and the best-paying options probably won't be the most fulfilling. So don't expect to maximize your income and secure your dream job right away; in the beginning, you'll have to trade your job satisfaction and lifestyle for higher compensation. When faced with this prospect, you might be tempted to pursue your passion and abandon everything else. However, that's not such a good career strategy. In Psychology Today, Marty Nemko, a prominent career coach, explained the risks of chasing your dreams. Nemko writes that most people's passions center around travel, entertainment, fashion or political causes, like education or environmentalism – making jobs in those fields hypercompetitive. That means employers in such fields usually pay below the market-compensation standard, because they have access to so many candidates who are willing to work either for free or for very little. If you dream of entering the fashion industry, for instance, you better plan on competing with droves of others for basic entry-level positions or internships. That means planning to be undercompensated. Why do some people secure top positions in their organizations, even when they're not particularly skilled? Chances are, they've built and put to use a powerful network. In his survey, over half of the author's respondents reported securing their jobs through networking – by being recruited by someone they knew or getting a job recommendation from a colleague. But when you're looking for a new job, don't just seek out information from your closest contacts; your most useful connections might not be the people you see everyday. Friends you fell out of touch with years ago are often more helpful than your current friends. Adam Grant of the Wharton School of Business calls these connections weak ties. Your weak ties are often more beneficial because they move in different circles than you, so they provide access to a broader range of information. So develop your connections by helping as many people as you can. When you help someone out, they'll want do the same for you in the future. That's why John F. Kennedy once said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” The same holds true for your colleagues. If you recommend your friend for a good job offer, they'll be motivated to do the same for you in the future. But be sure to seek out people who are willing to help others, otherwise your network won't do you much good. One way to do that is by focusing on super-connectors – people who've provided you with more opportunities than usual. Try making a list of your contacts and tracing how you met all of them. If the same name keeps popping up, that's definitely a person to whom you’ll want to stay close. Consider the career paths of a doctor and a mechanical engineer. They're certainly different, but they both pass through the same three phases: the Aspiration Phase, the Promise Phase and the Momentum Phase. The Aspiration Phase starts in your college years and continues into your first few years in the workplace. This period is about discovery, introspection and getting to know yourself. Remember: your value in the career market is almost entirely determined by your potential. In the Aspiration Phase, it's important to try out as many different tasks and jobs as possible. That's how you'll discover your strengths, weaknesses and interests and acquire your marketable skills. A mechanical engineer, for instance, might experiment with different internships and apprenticeships to figure out whether she’s most interested in developing products or in helping the team as a project manager. The Promise Phase begins with your first or second job. You'll continue to build your strengths in the Promise Phase, but you'll also start developing specific professional skills and making meaningful contributions to your organization. So a mechanical engineer who's interested in development might specialize in working on the company's combustion engines. The Promise Phase is when you start living up to your initial potential. The Momentum Phase runs through your early thirties to early or mid-forties. That's when, thanks to the skills and connections you’ve gained in the previous phases, you get better at overcoming tough obstacles. You'll become a much more valuable asset in your industry and be able to work across multiple sectors. So a mechanical engineer who has developed her skills with combustion engines might try working with turbines in the aeronautics industry when she’s in the Momentum Phase. Once you know how you want to balance your Career Triangle, the next step is figuring out how. The first step is to get yourself noticed in your field. A lot of people start by developing their LinkedIn profile – but how do you make yourself stand out? There are several tips for managing your LinkedIn profile. First off, remember that the number of connections you have doesn’t signify status. It's actually usually best only to add people you know personally. So strive to make LinkedIn connections only with people you've had memorable conversations with. The only exceptions to this rule are people who know someone else you're certain you want to connect with. One study of LinkedIn found that over 40 percent of people who succeeded in making connections did so through a person whom they already knew. So after you've connected with that hiring manager, aim to make the best impression you can by showcasing your qualifications and skills. You also need to create a clear and straightforward resume. Keep it sharp and pleasing to the eye. Don't go overboard with flashy designs; artsy flourishes tend to distract the reader from the actual content. Remember that HR only has a limited amount of time to look over resumes, so it's important to be as concise as possible when you outline your skills and job experience. Include two or three bullet points for each of the jobs you list. Be specific about your accomplishments and the responsibilities you had. Describe things with precise numbers whenever possible. Numbers are clearer than lengthy sentences. What's the first barrier you face when looking for your first job? For most, it's all those job postings that require prior experience. How are you supposed to get experience if you can't get a job? This is called the permission paradox, and there are a few ways to overcome it. One way is to build your credentials. Do a program that earns you a professional certification or take an online course that teaches you a marketable skill. There are plenty of free online courses available through websites like Coursera and Khan Academy. You can also learn valuable skills in your spare time. Many colleges offer six-week summer courses in business and finance, or in other fields, like healthcare or aviation. Sometimes you don't even have to build your credentials! You might already have credentials you aren't aware of, because they're hidden in your past experiences. That's why another method for overcoming the permission paradox is to make the most of your current experiences. James, a graduate with a BA in geography, did this when he wanted an entry-level position at a food company. James didn't have professional experience in project management – one of the job requirements – but he realized he had a different kind of valuable experience. He'd planned a three-week trek across Eastern Europe for himself and his friends! He did have the experience necessary, because he'd worked with a group of friends to project manage their trip. So James put this task in his cover letter, and described the actions he took to research their itinerary and find the lowest fares. He demonstrated that he did have management experience – and he landed the job! How do you feel about job interviews? If they make you anxious, you certainly aren't alone. Most of us feel uncomfortable with this part of the job-application process. But don't worry – there's a simple way to present yourself in interviews as a strong candidate. An important strategy in interviews is to communicate in an open and equal way with your interviewer. Speak as if you're on common ground – not as if you're the interviewer's subordinate. Some people are great at communicating with their friends, but freeze up in interviews. They make mistakes, like avoiding eye contact, tapping their feet or using too many vocal tics, like “you know” or “I mean.” You can overcome these bad habits by asking a friend to conduct a mock interview with you. Filming this interview, and then study the footage. Does your body language match your words? Are you fidgeting or looking down? The more you practice with friends, the more comfortable you'll become during interviews in real life. Also, aim to tell a narrative story about yourself instead of just answering questions. Stories are much more memorable – and you want to be remembered! A lot of people make the mistake of assuming that interviewees are supposed to listen quietly to each question and respond accordingly with a thorough reply. Most interviews are structured in a question and answer format, which can make the interview seem like a test. But it's actually better to connect your answers together, presenting the interviewer with a three-dimensional view of who you are. Present yourself as a whole – tell your story in a meaningful way. After all, you're more than just a bullet list of attributes! Imagine that you're meeting a friend's friend for the first time. You try to break the ice by making a risqué joke, but it doesn't go over well. It wouldn't be surprising if that person avoided you in the future; first impressions have a big impact! So how can you make the best first impression? One important strategy is to always maintain a positive and enthusiastic attitude. Most successful executives are nostalgic for those youthful days when they had the energy to work and play hard, and if you display the same attitude, they'll feel a deeper connection with you. Your colleagues and supervisors will also enjoy being around you more when you're in a good mood. Don't stop looking for opportunities to learn, either. Whenever you take on a new task or role, use it to learn a new skill. You'll gain a reputation for your desire to grow and improve yourself, which will get you a lot of positive attention from your supervisors. That first impression is also based largely on the way you communicate. Good communication skills are critical for advancing your career! So avoid using verbal crutches like “um, like...” or “I mean.” Those fillers can make you sound less confident or intelligent. Don't raise your voice at the end of your sentences, either. That makes you sound insecure about what you're saying. Experts have found that even non-verbal communication has a big influence on your first impression. So watch your posture and facial expressions. Sit or stand upright and always maintain eye contact when speaking to others. Make that first impression a good one and it will take you a long way. How do you think people become top CEOs? Most people assume that CEOs climb the career ladder one step at time, going from junior management to middle management to upper management, building their skills along the way. In reality, however, it's not that simple. Most successful people get to the top with a bit of lateral maneuvering. They don't slowly climb a single ladder – they hop between multiple ladders, and each step isn't necessarily higher than the last! So if you're working in junior management at HR, moving to a junior management position in marketing or finance might be more valuable than aiming for middle management in the same department. Why? Because exploring different fields and departments gives you a broader range of skills and experience. And that's what makes you stand out when you're looking for a top executive job. Jumping between ladders doesn’t just mean exploring different departments, though. It also means working with a variety of organizations. You might think moving from a big firm to a start-up would be a downgrade, but such a move could actually provide you with a lot of new learning opportunities. You might earn less, but it might be better for your career in the long-term. The progression of your career still has to make sense, however. You should still be able to explain it in a coherent narrative. If you can't, people won't be sure if the experience you've acquired is actually valuable. So don't fall into the trap of staying on just one path. Explore different areas and build a range of skills; but make sure that the experiences you're acquiring are relevant to your overall career. The key message in this book: You don't have to be a graduate of some Ivy League school to build a solid career for yourself. If you follow your core principles by making sound decisions, working hard and building meaningful relationships, you'll find your way to success. So stay dedicated, present your skills and experience clearly and always be sure to make a good first impression – both in and out of interviews. Actionable advice: Take your contacts seriously. If someone introduces you to a new contact, be sure to follow up immediately. Send thank you emails as soon as you finish any meetings. Don't be afraid of being too forward – you're not on a date! And even if an executive takes a few days to respond, they'll probably still be impressed if you respond immediately. Suggested further reading: The Defining Decade by Meg Jay Drawing on a wealth of personal stories and fascinating facts, The Defining Decade argues that, contrary to popular belief, 30 is not the new 20. Author Meg Jay uses her vast experience as a professional psychologist to advise twentysomethings on such issues as choosing a partner, starting a family, picking a career, and generally making the most of one’s 20s. Jay also argues that the years between 20 and 30 are the time to establish serious goals and, because the adult brain is at its most pliable then, to begin to take steps toward reaching them.

Helping clients overcome career hurdles, restore balance to their family lives or regain control of their emotions can feel more rewarding than any paycheck. But like any job, coaching also comes with a unique set of challenges for its practitioners. Establishing the right relationship with your clients can be difficult – whether you’re just starting out as a professional coach or already have years of experience. Perhaps you’ve experienced the awkward situation of a client calling you at all hours, or you’ve wondered how to proceed when someone cries in your office. Alternatively, maybe you’ve found that interacting with your clients is smooth sailing but that winning them in the first place is an uphill climb.  If any of these difficulties sound familiar, don’t worry: Kim Morgan is here to help. Drawing on real-life case studies and decades of experience as a professional coach, she’ll show you the way out of the stickiest coaching situations. From managing your clients’ expectations to handling conflicts of interests, these blinks provide practical tips and tricks that will help you build your career as a respected coach in any area.  Along the way, you’ll learn  why you and your client need a contract; when to disclose personal information; and how you can regain a work-life balance. Leaving your old career and becoming a coach is an exciting transition. Take Simon, who previously worked in local government as a senior manager. Attracted by the high hourly rates he’d heard executive coaches command, he set his sights on coaching senior managers in corporate companies. But after completing his accreditation course, Simon hit a roadblock. Although he’d wanted to leave his old world behind, he found that the only coaching offers he received came from local government agencies. Why couldn’t he accelerate into the corporate fast lane as he’d planned?  The problem was that he lacked credibility.  Credibility can be an issue if you want to coach in an industry or sector you have not previously worked in yourself. After all, clients usually want coaches with professional knowledge of their particular area. However, with time and commitment, there are ways to boost your credibility in the line of work you’re interested in – even without prior experience.  How can you go about this?  Well, as part of your training to become a coach, you’ll probably be asked to conduct pro bono coaching sessions with clients. Unpaid work like this is a great way to start positioning yourself as a coach in your target area, and an opportunity to gain experience with the type of clients you aim to work with. Simon, for example, could offer voluntary coaching work to corporate managers in return for testimonials for his marketing materials. Alternatively, he could ask these non-paying clients for referrals to other potential customers in the corporate world.  You can also build your credibility by positioning yourself as an expert by way of personal rather than professional knowledge. Although Doreen planned to work as a Higher Education coach, she quickly realized that her experiences of later-life divorce, and subsequent online dating and remarriage, had inadvertently made her an expert on love too. Within her network of friends, her name was associated with relationships. People were already turning to her for advice. These days, Doreen is a practicing relationship coach and a great example of how personal experience can give a coach just as much credibility as professional know-how.  So, if you’re looking to build a credible coaching niche, take a look at your own biography for inspiration. What personal challenges stand out as things you can talk about with authority, or have helped you grow as a person? You just might be a credible coach in waiting. Sometimes it’s hard to know where the boundaries lie. Rachel is a warm and supportive coach, but there have been times when she’s overstepped the mark. In one session, for example, a client opened up about her miscarriage. As Rachel had also suffered a miscarriage, she promptly told the client this. Unfortunately, she could tell from the look on the other woman’s face that this information was unwelcome. This scenario begs the question: How much should coaches disclose about themselves during sessions? When it comes to self-disclosure, a good rule of thumb is to only share information for the benefit of your client, rather than for yourself. Humanist therapists, for example, believe that some self-disclosure is helpful. Why? Because by revealing that she too can be vulnerable and have unresolved problems, the therapist helps her clients realize that nobody’s perfect and that their shortcomings are nothing to be ashamed of. As a coach, you might say to a client that berates himself for getting anxious before public speaking that he shouldn’t be too hard on himself, and that you also get nervous when speaking publicly. By contrast, Rachel’s sharing of her miscarriage is a good example of unplanned self-disclosure which has little benefit for the client. In this case, the coach made a spontaneous admission when her client’s comments reminded her of a painful experience in her own past. Though this sort of disclosure may feel natural, it can easily set your coaching relationship off-balance. Not only does it remove focus from the client’s issues, but it can make your client feel as if she needs to start looking after you instead of vice versa.  Another issue related to boundaries is the question of what to do if your client starts crying in your session. Importantly, there’s a right and a wrong way to handle this.  Rachel handled it the wrong way. When a client began crying, Rachel stood up and embraced her in a hug. This wasn’t welcome. Instead of invading her client’s personal space, a better approach would have been to remain still, keep listening, and calmly wait for the client to proceed. It’s not unusual for coaching sessions to release pent-up emotions that cause tears. It’s your job to show your clients that they’re in a safe environment, where they can express strong emotions without interference. The author believes Lauren is a competent coach who always helps clients tackle their challenges. Unfortunately, Lauren doesn’t agree with this assessment. In fact, although she’s been qualified for three years, she has only had a handful of paying clients. Why? It’s because whenever someone tries to engage her services, Lauren redirects them to another coach in her network – to someone she believes would be more qualified to meet their needs. If you haven’t guessed by now, Lauren suffers from imposter syndrome.  This involves feeling like an unworthy imposter in one’s profession, and it might make Lauren feel better to know she’s far from the only one suffering from this debilitating condition.  The phenomenon was first outlined by clinical psychologists in the 1970s to describe feelings that were prevalent in professional women. In recent decades, however, it’s been estimated that around 70 percent of women and men will experience imposter syndrome during their professional lives. Those suffering from it often put a huge amount of effort into their work to make up for their own sense of inadequacy. Ironically, this often results in greater success, which then leads to even stronger feelings of being a fraud.  If you’re a coach suffering from imposter syndrome, you may live in constant fear that others are going to find out how incompetent you are. You might believe your success is due to good luck and, like Lauren, think your clients would be better off with another coach instead.  So, how can you combat these feelings of inadequacy? You can start by asking yourself where these feelings are really coming from. If you’ve struggled with feelings of low self-worth throughout your life, then your imposter syndrome may have its roots in your childhood experiences. In this case, it’s worth seeking professional help, either from a therapist or your coaching supervisor. Alternatively, if your sense of incompetence is limited to your new career as a coach, then it might help to remember that these feelings are common for people in your position. Consider the fact that many new coaches have previously worked in fields such as law, medicine or senior management. Professions like these require years of training and study to progress. If you’ve had a career like this, it can feel unsettling to make the jump into coaching, which requires far less prior training. The apparent ease of your transition can trigger feelings of being a fraud.  Just remember that it's not simply your accreditation course that makes you a coach. In fact, any experience you gather in your area of expertise adds to your competence. Luke was a freshly qualified coach excited to launch his new coaching business. Using his hard-earned savings, he splashed out on a slick website and took months designing his new branding. Upon completion, Luke got active on social media and spent the next year blogging about coaching and connecting with people on Twitter. Unfortunately, whilst Luke was making friends in the online world, his real-world business was suffering; during his first year, he won just two paying clients.  Where did Luke go wrong?  Like many new coaches, he mistakenly thought he could build his coaching business using online communication alone. The author has met many new coaches who, like Luke, focus entirely on slick branding and enticing social media profiles. But beware – this type of marketing tunnel vision is a risky approach. Although an online presence might make it seem as if you have a coaching business, the reality is that without customers, you don’t have any sort of business at all. Whilst there are successful businesses whose main marketing source is social media, they tend to have a highly targeted approach that focuses on converting people into customers. In contrast, coaches like Luke often focus on how many ‘likes’ their latest blog post or tweet has received, or how many times it’s been shared. Chasing likes and shares won’t help you become a better or more successful coach. So what should Luke have done differently? Well, despite advances in technology, there’s often no substitute for getting out into the real world and meeting potential clients.  If you’re new to the coaching business, it’s a good idea to get involved with networking groups, set up meetings with individuals or businesses who may become your clients, or arrange to give presentations to audiences that might contain potential customers. As you might have gathered, all these activities mean actually speaking to others about your coaching – something you can’t afford to avoid. Although it’s quite normal to find the idea of ‘selling’ your coaching uncomfortable, this discomfort is something you’ll need to deal with if you’re to become successful. So when it comes to developing your coaching business, be persistent – and don’t be afraid of the offline world. Hailey encountered some tricky situations during her first two years of coaching. First, there was the client who wouldn’t stop calling her for advice between sessions. Then there was the client who kept missing his appointments but seemed surprised that he’d still have to pay if he didn’t show up. Why, Hailey wondered, did things keep going wrong? The answer was simple: she hadn’t set up a contract with her clients.  Before you begin coaching a client, it’s crucial to discuss and sign a contract with her.  The International Coach Federation, for example, includes contracting as a key competency for coaches, and their members are obligated to give clients written contracts. Signing a contract with your client lays the foundation of your future relationship and clarifies what you expect from one another. A typical contract should cover issues like fees and cancellations, as well as contact outside of sessions. If Hailey had put contracts in place, then her first client wouldn’t have assumed she could call her whenever she wanted and her second client would’ve expected to pay for sessions that he failed to attend. Other aspects of the coach-client relationship covered by the contract are topics like confidentiality, potential conflicts of interest and the outcomes the client expects from the coaching.  Although this all might seem simple enough, many coaches don’t feel comfortable drawing up contracts with their clients. Hailey thought that beginning the coaching relationship on such a formal note would damage the warm rapport she’d already developed with her clients. She also worried that a written contract might undermine the spirit of trust in the sessions.  But in fact, a contract is the key to a great relationship with your clients. Not convinced? Then just consider that some of your clients might be new to coaching, and may not know much about how it works. This lack of knowledge can leave them feeling vulnerable and uncertain about your sessions together. Therefore, having a contract in place, with a clear outline of the coaching process, can manage their expectations while giving them some much-needed emotional security. As a coach, it can be hard to know where your loyalties should lie. Jason was being paid by a corporate company to coach a member of staff. Unfortunately, as their coaching sessions went on it became clear to Jason that the company was trying to get rid of this employee. Not only did the person report that he had been demoted, but most of his work had been taken away from him and his desk had been moved away from other employees. More worrying still, the employee seemed oblivious to his worsening situation.  What should Jason do?  His scenario describes a typical dilemma that many coaches face: If you’re being paid by a company to coach one of their people, then who is your client? The individual or the wider organization?  Unfortunately for Jason, there are no easy answers. The author believes that both of these parties are clients and that a good coach will do his best for both the individual and the company. After all, while Jason might have a personal connection with the person he’s coaching, he also has a business relationship with the organization.  This joint commitment to both parties shouldn’t be an issue, until you stumble into a conflict of interest, as Jason has. In this situation, a problem has arisen because the organization and the employee seem to want different outcomes from his coaching. As Jason sees it, the employee wants to use the sessions to build his confidence and gain more recognition in his workplace, whereas the company is hoping the employee will realize he should look for another job.  If you find yourself in Jason’s situation, you have two options.  Firstly, you could continue to coach the employee, but with the goal of raising his awareness of what’s really going on. You can do this by asking the right questions and undertaking exercises that shift his perspective on the situation. You could, for instance, ask what he thinks his boss’s opinion of him is. Alternatively, you could take a more passive approach by ignoring your hunch and continuing the sessions as before. After all, you’re not the client’s personal advisor and neither are you responsible for his employment status. If you’re leaning towards the latter approach, though, it’s a good idea to check in with your coaching supervisor for advice and to read up on your code of conduct for further guidance. Coaching can take over your life. Sam is a successful coach who specializes in helping unemployed women find new careers. Moreover, she’s so beloved by her clients that years after their coaching sessions have ended, they still email and phone to let her know how they’re getting on. Sadly, there’s a downside to Sam’s success story; these days, she’s spending so long keeping in touch with old clients that her life outside of work is disintegrating.  Sam is failing to look after herself. And she’s not the only one. Like many people who work in the ‘caring’ professions, coaches are often so focused on the needs of their clients that they neglect to look after their own wellbeing. The author, for example, has worked with coaches who spend entire coaching sessions in discomfort, simply because they need to go to the bathroom. Instead of excusing themselves, they remain in their chairs, unwilling to prioritize their own needs for even a brief moment. Unfortunately, constantly subordinating your needs to those of your clients is unlikely to do either of you any favors in the long run. Sam, for example, has begun resenting her old clients due to the amount of time she spends staying in touch with them. And once resentment creeps in, it’s only a matter of time before doubt sets in too. Just look at Diana – another successful coach who works with senior executives. Recently, she’s taken on more clients and begun working very long days. Overburdened and stressed, she’s started to view her clients as privileged people who complain about small things. Unsurprisingly, she’s beginning to wonder whether her future lies in coaching.  So, how can you keep your work-life balance on track and ensure you don’t fall into Sam and Diana’s pattern of overwork and resentment?  Interestingly, the answer may lie in your self-esteem. One of the reasons people end up working so hard is because they derive all their self-esteem from their professional successes. This can become so extreme that they feel useless when they’re not at work. As a result, they put in more hours, eventually ending up in situations like Diana. If you find yourself feeling like this, the solution is to explore other activities that boost your self-worth. You could focus on developing hobbies you’re proud of, for example, or concentrate on broadening your social circle and making new friends.  It’s important that coaching remains a significant part of your life instead of your whole life. By maintaining a work-life balance you can build better relationships with your clients – on your own terms. The key message in these blinks: New coaches face many challenges, from imposter syndrome to burn out, but most of these can be overcome with the right attitude. From conflicts of interest to setting appropriate client boundaries, an approach that emphasizes clear expectations and self-care can help you succeed in your new career. It’s not easy, but the rewards of becoming a successful coach, and helping your clients are huge.  Actionable advice: Motivate yourself to get fit.  It’s particularly important for coaches to look after their physical health. Why? Because coaching is, for the vast majority of us, a very sedentary job. When you’re not sitting and talking to a client, you’ll likely be at your desk hunched over a computer screen or driving to your next session. If you’d like to take better care of your body but are struggling to find the motivation, then simply reflect on how you might look and feel in several years if you fail to make the necessary changes.

It’s a vast source of cognition and reason that allows us to recall vivid memories, perceive what’s going on around us and cast judgments on our own and other people’s actions. Even so, the mind is not necessarily programmed to maximize our happiness or contentedness in life. Rather, it can make us follow hopelessly old-fashioned rules and beliefs that are passed down from generation to generation. But what if you could remove these restrictions and start fresh? These blinks provide a thorough guide on how to avoid the pitfalls of your own mind. They use a framework based on the ten laws of extraordinary living, separated into four stages. The first two rules focus on discovering how we are shaped by the world around us, while the next three help us understand how we can change our perception of the world. Laws six, seven and eight explain how we can create stronger mindsets, and the final two show us how we can employ these mindsets to change the world. Altogether, these laws take into account the complex code of the human mind and will guide you toward a more extraordinary life. In these blinks, you’ll discover what bullshit rules are, and why you should question them; why someone can have an embarrassing past of wearing thick, ugly glasses and still be attractive; and what it means to be unfuckwithable. As we move through life, we’re constantly told what we should do or how we should live. Our culture contains a number of outdated beliefs that dictate what kind of job and education we should have and how we should dress and look. Taken together, these beliefs make up today’s culturescape – a set of rules and norms on how to love, eat, marry and make a living. But if you want to be extraordinary, the first law for an extraordinary life is to transcend your culturescape. This is what the author realized he had to do. Until the age of 19, Vishen Lakhani lived in Malaysia, where it was the norm for families and teachers to push kids into becoming an engineer, a lawyer or a doctor. And since he was a smart student, he was told that these were the rules he needed to follow in order to succeed. So, he went along with these expectations, giving up his hobbies of photography and performing arts to become a computer programmer. However, when he “succeeded” by landing a top job at Microsoft, he realized this wasn’t the life he was meant to lead – and he quit. To stand out and become extraordinary, Lakhiani realized he needed to transcend his culturescape and selectively choose which rules to follow and which ones to ignore. This leads us to the second law for an extraordinary life: question the bullshit rules. A bullshit rule, or, to use the author’s terminology, a Brule, is an outdated rule from the culturescape that we blindly follow, even though it can hold us back from pursuing our dreams. Take the College Brule, for example. Society tells us we need a college degree to guarantee success; but not only does a degree not guarantee us anything, it can actually hinder your success by weighing you down with massive student debts. Steve Jobs questioned this Brule by dropping out of college and going on to become an extraordinary man. He didn’t need a degree to be a radical innovator, invent the smartphone and revolutionize multiple industries. What are the chances you still use a computer that runs Windows 95? Pretty small. You almost certainly care about your computer running efficiently, so you make sure to update the operating system every few years. Well, this is the same kind of care that you should put into your mind as well. Updating your mind’s hardware and software is what the author calls consciousness engineering. It’s the third law for an extraordinary life. Just like your computer, your mind contains both hardware and software. The hardware contains your model of reality. This is where you hold your beliefs about the world, whether they’re about politics, economics, marriage or schooling. Meanwhile, the software contains your systems for living. These are your daily habits and they determine how you utilize the hardware. For example, say your hardware and model of reality hold that it’s wrong to kill animals for food. In turn, your software and system of living would tell you to buy and eat as a vegan would. Now, consciousness engineering is a way of understanding that personal growth depends on your ability to carefully choose – and frequently update – your hardware and software. We can update our hardware by following the fourth law for an extraordinary life: rewrite your models of reality. Extraordinary people do this by embracing a mindset that helps them achieve their goals and create positive self-esteem. The author didn’t always feel good about himself. As a child, Lakhiani wore thick glasses and suffered from terrible acne, which led to low self-esteem due to his appearance. But that all changed during college. At a party, Lakhiani found himself talking to the prettiest girl in the room, and she told him that he was one hot dude. This experience allowed Lakhiani to update his hardware. He built a new and encouraging model of reality that told him he was now an attractive man, and his dating life took off. In the next blink, we’ll move on and look at how to update your software and your systems for living. Naturally, when you revise your hardware’s model of reality, it means your software, as well as your actions based on these beliefs, must also be revised. This leads us to the fifth law for an extraordinary life: upgrade your systems for living with a three-step approach of discovering, refreshing and measuring. Extraordinary minds continuously optimize their systems for living in order to achieve their goals. Think of it this way: your systems for living are like apps that are designed to reach goals in your life or solve specific problems. If one app doesn’t work or becomes outdated, you either upgrade the app or replace it with a better one. So the first step to upgrading is to discover. You can do this by reading books, talking to people and exploring the world around you for inspiration. Think of it like browsing the App Store. Second, refresh your systems regularly. For example, every year the author refreshes his system for exercise and fitness; one year he tried Christine Bullock's Total Transformation program, and the next he moved on to kettlebells. Third, measure how effective your systems are. The author measures the effectiveness of his updated fitness systems simply by keeping track of which notches he’s using on his favorite belt. With your updated software and systems of living, you can get started on re-coding your mindset. This involves the sixth and seventh laws for living an extraordinary life. Let’s start with law number six, the ability to bend reality. Now, this isn’t a magic trick; it’s a new system for living that will dramatically increase your happiness. Being able to bend reality means that you can hold onto your exciting goals for the future while making sure that your happiness is firmly rooted in the present. The author realized the importance of having this frame of mind while building his own company. Rather than being happy or excited about his venture, Lakhiani was constantly stressed about whether or not he’d reach certain revenue goals. So he bent his reality by focusing on the here and now. He decided to make fun and happiness a key part of his daily life. Soon thereafter, his company’s revenues went through the roof. Everyone knows the feeling of bliss that accompanies happiness – but chances are you also know how short-lived this feeling can be. Luckily, with an extraordinary mind comes the ability to experience bliss for longer periods of time. But how can you achieve this? You’ll need to focus on the seventh law of extraordinary living by practicing blissipline, or the discipline of regular and prolonged bliss. Blissipline starts with gratitude. It has been scientifically proven that people have more energy and experience less depression when they practice gratitude. You can do this by embracing an idea from entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan, who suggests that you switch to your reverse gap. What does he mean by this? Well, most of us are trained to see the gap between our present selves and who we want to be; this is called the forward gap. But the problem with focusing on the forward gap is that we’re always keeping happiness out of our reach and in the future. Instead, we should reverse the gap and look to our past to appreciate and be grateful for what we’ve achieved so far. This allows us to practice blissipline and experience gratitude on a daily basis. With our blissipline in place, it’s time to focus on the final three laws that will help you change the world. Let’s start with the eighth law for an extraordinary life: craft a vision for your future that corresponds with your happiness. Creating a future vision is all about setting goals. However, these goals can be dangerous if you confuse means goals with end goals. Means goals are the ones society tells us we need to have in order to be happy, such as a college degree and a safe job. But means goals rarely make us happy. End goals, on the other hand, are a great source of happiness. These are the goals that bring us joy in and of themselves, and not because they adhere to the culturescape. A great example of this could be the unrivalled joy of seeing your child succeed at school, dance or sports. Think about what you really want to do, whether it’s a visit to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro or writing the next great novel. All extraordinary people have goals. But their motivation for reaching them comes from within; they don’t seek validation from outside opinion, and their sense of self-worth and happiness are not attached to outside values. This is the essence of the ninth law for an extraordinary life: be unfuckwithable. This means realizing that you depend only on yourself and that nothing anyone says or does can stop you from achieving your goals. Being unfuckwithable consists of two components: The first is to have self-fueled goals that aren’t dependent upon others. Say you decide on a goal of being closer to your children; what happens when your children naturally desire to be more independent? The success of this goal depends on their cooperation. A better goal is simply to try and be the best parent possible. Since this is a self-fueled goal, nobody can stop you from achieving it. The second component is to realize that only you have what it takes to be happy and successful. This means that you need to resist the temptation to blame outside circumstances for what happens in your life. Don’t spend the day in bed depressed because someone forgot your birthday; instead, learn to let it go. After all, you can’t control the actions of others. Finally, the tenth law for an extraordinary life is to embrace your quest. Extraordinary people usually have a calling – a quest to create positive change and make a meaningful contribution to the world. This means that extraordinary people don’t view work as something that keeps them from pursuing their dreams; in fact, it’s quite the opposite. Richard Branson, a great entrepreneur and a perfect example of an extraordinary individual, was asked how he kept his work-life balance in place. He replied that work and life are the same thing – both are part of living. Branson found work that was completely in line with his calling and created a life that he could embrace completely. So, now that you know the ten laws of an extraordinary life, it’s your turn to embrace it. The key message in this book: Anyone can live an extraordinary life. You can get started on this path by following the ten laws of an extraordinary life and transforming your existence. A meaningful life of true happiness is possible for us all. Actionable advice: Practice daily gratitude. In the seventh law, you learned about switching to your reverse gap and practicing gratitude by looking backward and appreciating what you’ve achieved so far. Here’s an exercise to help: each day, take a few minutes to think about three to five things you’re grateful for in your personal life, and three to five things you’re grateful for in your work life. But be careful; a lot of people turn this into a mechanical list-making exercise. Instead, focus on your true feelings and consider what makes you happy, optimistic, comforted, confident or proud.

Despite their many differences, they all share this one habit in common: as soon as they wake up, they sit down for a cup of coffee.  Caffeine jolts the brain back into full consciousness while the evocative fragrance and taste of the beverage help people greet the day. This is the well-known power of coffee – and it’s all thanks to the humble little bean from which the drink is made.  But there’s a much more powerful, less widely known lesson hidden inside the coffee bean. The following story is a fable that conveys that lesson through vivid imagery, memorable metaphors and a story to which everyone can relate.  In these blinks, you’ll learn  how to escape feelings of hopelessness and resignation;  how to avoid becoming bitter and heartless; and  how to stay positive and overcome any form of adversity – all by harnessing the power of the coffee bean! The main character of our story is an adolescent named Abraham – or Abe, as people usually called him. Abe was your archetypical American teenage boy, right down to being a star player on the high school football team. He was in his senior year, with graduation beckoning on the horizon. His dream was to play football in college.  But Abe wasn’t just a jock; he also liked the academic side of school, especially science class, which was taught by his favorite teacher, Mr. Jackson.  From the outside, it seemed like everything was going alright for Abe. But one day, he came into his science class in a pretty foul mood, feeling hatred toward everything around him. Mr. Jackson noticed something was wrong and wanted to find out what was going on, so he asked Abe to stay after class.  In the private, heart-to-heart conversation that followed, Abe opened up to Mr. Jackson and let it all spill out. He was feeling a lot of stress and anxiety in both of the main areas of his life. At home, his parents were fighting, and the word “divorce” had even come up. At school, there were some upcoming exams, an essay assignment and a big Friday night football game looming over him.  The game was a particular point of pressure. Not only could a victory bring his team one step closer to reaching the state championship, but there would also be college scouts watching from the bleachers.  And then, on top of all that, there was the weight of other people’s expectations for a star player on the football team. If he played well, he felt under pressure to continue making people happy. If he didn’t play well, he felt the sting of their disappointment.  Do any of these things sound familiar? You don’t have to be an American high-school football player to relate to this story. Like Abe, you’ve probably encountered your fair share of family troubles and the equivalents of big games in your life, such as important presentations, meetings and interviews. At times, you’ve also probably found yourself feeling under too much pressure from too many sides at once – especially if you feel the weight of expectations that come with trying to be an exceptional parent, manager, coach or whatever role you might play in life.  How can we get through these challenging times and overcome these sources of stress? Well, Mr. Jackson has some surprising advice – not just for Abe but for all of us. After listening to Abe pour out his woes, Mr. Jackson simply nodded and said, “I know how you feel.” Then, he did something you might not expect. He didn’t dispense any words of wisdom or guidance. Instead, he gave Abe a homework assignment – and a rather random-seeming one at that: boil a carrot in a pot of water, observe it for a while, come back tomorrow and report what happened.  That night, Abe carried out the assignment, and the next day, he met with Mr. Jackson after class to share his observations. He’d found that after about ten minutes of being submerged in the boiling water, the carrot got soft.  Mr. Jackson then revealed the point of the assignment. The carrot, he explained, didn’t just get soft; it was softened by the boiling water, which was the environment in which Abe had put it. The water was a harsh environment, and it essentially weakened the carrot by putting it under stressful circumstances.  As Mr. Jackson went on to explain, the same thing can happen to all of us. When life gets difficult, we too find ourselves in hot water, so to speak. Applying this lesson to our own lives, we can see how our homes and workplaces can also turn into harsh environments, and our relationships and careers can put us under stressful circumstances of their own. If we let them overwhelm us with negative emotions like fear and hopelessness, we end up like the carrot – soft and weak.  Eventually, we may grow so exhausted and despondent that we want to give up on our struggles. For example, we might contemplate quitting a job that’s challenging us or running away from a relationship that’s on the rocks. Or we might become dispirited and withdrawn – no longer enjoying the things in which we used to take pleasure, or even shutting ourselves away from them. For instance, in the face of professional and financial setbacks, a dejected husband might lose his appreciation for his wife and children and might stop spending time with them.  According to Mr. Jackson, this carrot-like response to adversity isn’t the natural consequence of being overpowered by external forces. Instead, it’s the result of the misguided belief that those forces are more powerful than us.  To overcome our challenges, we have to change our mind-set – and that’s precisely what Mr. Jackson tried to get Abe to do with his next two lessons. So what’s the alternative to being a carrot? Just act tough and grit your teeth as the water boils you alive? Well, that’s not what Mr. Jackson would advise. On the contrary, his next lesson pointed out the fallacy of this approach to life. Once he got Abe to understand the moral of the carrot assignment and to see how it applied to his own troubles, Mr. Jackson asked a follow-up question: What would happen if you boiled an egg instead of a carrot?  Abe already knew the answer to this one, so he didn’t need to go home to find out: you’d end up with a hard-boiled egg. Mr. Jackson then elaborated his point. Even though they’re put in the same harsh environment and circumstances (boiling water), the carrot and the egg end up responding to it in opposite ways. The carrot gets soft; the egg gets hard.  As you may have suspected, this is yet another metaphor with a moral tucked inside of it. Like the egg, we too can harden when our environments and circumstances put us under stress. Indeed, there’s even a word for the emotional state that results from this process: “hard-hearted.” In this state, it’s as if our hearts have grown solid, no longer capable of letting love flow in or out. Instead, we start seething with anger and hatred toward the people in our lives.  In becoming like a hard-boiled egg, we’re essentially internalizing all the negativity we perceive in the world around us. It’s like we’re saying to everyone and everything around us, “Alright, so you’re going to be cold and mean to me? Then I’ll be cold and mean right back!”  Of course, in today’s world, there’s no shortage of negativity. Abe could attest to this. Like many of us, he tried to escape his troubles by scrolling through social media feeds and watching videos online. But there he found more negativity. If you’ve been online yourself recently, then you can easily imagine what he might have encountered: nasty comments, distressing news stories and hate-filled diatribes.  But Mr. Jackson would caution us from blaming the internet, adversity or any other external force for hardening us. It’s not really the forces themselves that harden us, he would argue; it’s our belief that they can harden us. Once again, what’s needed is a change of mind-set – and that was the subject of his next lesson to Abe. By the end of his second conversation with Mr. Jackson, Abe had learned two lessons: he didn’t want to be the carrot, and he didn’t want to be the egg – but what could he be instead?  Well, if you remember the title or introduction to these blinks, you already know the answer, so there’s no use trying to maintain the suspense: the answer is the coffee bean.  To help Abe understand the powerful alternative represented by this humble little bean, Mr. Jackson gave him another homework assignment: boil some coffee beans for about an hour, see what happens and report back tomorrow.  The next day, Abe was pretty excited to share his discovery with Mr. Jackson. It definitely took him by surprise. Perhaps it will be a revelation to you as well.  It turns out that if you boil some coffee beans for an hour, you end up with a pot full of coffee! Yes, coffee – as in the beverage you get when you run hot water through ground-up coffee beans in a coffee-maker. Whole beans flavor the water in the same way as ground-up beans; it just takes them a longer time to work their magic.  The contrast with the carrot and the egg could hardly be stronger. As we know, when a carrot and an egg are placed in the harsh environment of boiling water, they react in opposite ways – the carrot getting soft, the egg getting hard. But while they react in opposite ways, there’s an underlying similarity between them: they both end up getting transformed by their environment.  But with coffee beans, the transformation goes the other way around; the environment ends up getting transformed by the beans! One moment, it’s water. An hour later, it’s coffee.  Of course, the lesson here isn’t really about coffee beans; it’s about us. We too have the ability to transform the environments and circumstances around us. In exercising this ability, we demonstrate that the power inside of us is greater than the power of the forces outside of us. And to tap into this power, Mr. Jackson would argue, we just have to know that we have it. His wisdom here could be boiled down into a single sentence: Know yourself as a coffee bean, and you too can transform the environment around you.  But what does that look like in practice? Well, Abe’s about to show us! After he finished his third conversation with Mr. Jackson, Abe was so inspired by the lesson of the coffee bean that he shared it with all of his football teammates. They were pretty jazzed too and went on to win the big game and reach the state championship.  They ended up winning that game as well – but Abe injured his knee after he fell to the ground while making a play that helped ensure the team’s victory. It was a serious injury, putting him on crutches and requiring surgery. For all he knew, his dream of playing college football might be dashed.  But, remembering the lesson of the coffee bean, Abe didn’t let that depress him. Instead, he used his downtime as an opportunity to put that lesson into action. With some other students at his school, he started a coffee bean club. Their mission? To transform the social environment of the school and the surrounding community.  How? Through good deeds and random acts of kindness, like reading books to young children, posting positive comments on social media and writing encouraging notes to students going through difficult times. By the end of the school year, the environment of the school was transformed. Negativity was no longer considered cool; everyone wanted to be a coffee bean now.  From here, we’ll fast-forward a bit through the next parts of Abe’s story: his injury healed, he graduated from high school and went on to realize his dream of playing college football – at a military academy. Upon graduating from the academy, he became an army officer who would go on to lead multiple platoons in war zones. After five years of service, he retired from the military and returned to his home town, where he married his high school sweetheart, had three kids, became a volunteer coach for his alma mater’s football team and got an office job in sales.  Wherever he went, Abe carried coffee beans with him and shared Mr. Jackson’s lesson with everyone he encountered. Cadets, soldiers, high-school football players and white-collar office workers alike were inspired by its message. The message certainly had a broad appeal; after all, it told people that everyone has the power to transform any environment or circumstance around them.  But wait – any environment or circumstance? What about those involving really large forces beyond our control? At his sales job, Abe would be confronted by this ultimate question. Abe worked as hard as he could at his sales job, but it seemed to be no use. No matter how much he poured himself into it, his sales numbers kept going down.  But it wasn’t just Abe who was floundering. His coworkers and his company as a whole were in the same trouble. Week after week, they kept failing to reach their sales goals and revenue targets. The market was tough, and there were major macroeconomic and technological changes happening in their industry. As a result, they were being squeezed by external forces beyond their control.  With his job in jeopardy, a wife and three kids to support, and a mortgage, two cars, healthcare bills and credit card debts to pay off, Abe was getting increasingly anxious and stressed about his ability to make ends meet.  Festering with these negative emotions, he started seeing his wife and children more as burdens than gifts, and he began to withdraw from his partner. When she tried to talk to him about his difficulties, he’d walk out of the room. In other words, part of him was turning into an egg.  He also started thinking about giving up. He contemplated quitting his job and finding a new one, rejoining the military or even running away from his life and starting all over again. Another part of him was turning into a carrot.  But then, one cold winter day, while he was drinking his morning coffee and thinking these carrot-like thoughts, he looked down into his mug and felt the warmth of the hot beverage below. At that moment, he remembered Mr. Jackson’s lesson of the coffee bean, which he’d forgotten about amid all the stress in his life.  Inspired by the lesson all over again, Abe went back to work and rolled up his sleeves. Rather than feeling sorry for himself, he focused on developing new relationships and opportunities for his company. His sales numbers turned around, and he got promoted all the way up to head of sales and marketing.  Under Abe’s leadership, the company regained its footing by streamlining its operations, adopting innovative ideas and technologies, and adding new products and services to its lineup. The surrounding economic conditions remained challenging – but instead of viewing them with fear, regret or resignation, the company embraced them as an opportunity to evolve.  Here, we’ll leave Abe in his moment of triumph and draw two final lessons from his story. As a high school senior, Abe was a mixture of a carrot and an egg who became a coffee bean, metaphorically speaking. But then, at his sales job, he reversed back into his carrot and egg-like ways. Fortunately, he was then able to transform himself into a coffee bean once again, saving his company and becoming head of sales and marketing in the process.  There’s an important lesson to be learned from all of these reversals: the choice between being a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean isn’t something we do once and then are done with it – locked into our choice forever, for better or worse. No – we make the choice over and over again with each new situation we face.  This fact should fill us with caution because it means we can stop being a coffee bean if we forget to make the choice to be one. But it should also make us hopeful because it means we can become a coffee bean again, even if we’ve chosen to be a carrot or an egg. The power to be a coffee bean always remains inside of us; we have to remember that we have it!  There’s one more lesson to be learned from Abe’s transformation into a coffee bean. To see it, remember two of the main episodes in which he pulled it off: as leader of the coffee bean club in high school and as head of sales and marketing at his company. In both cases, Abe didn’t become a coffee bean by himself; he inspired others to join him, and they worked together to transform their environments.  In other words, it’s not just individuals who can be carrots, eggs or coffee beans in the face of difficulties. Entire organizations make the same choice as they navigate the broader challenges of the world. Indeed, the same could be said of society as a whole. We can imagine an ideal world in which everyone worked together to transform their environment and circumstances for the better. Maybe that’s what Abe had in mind in the final chapter of his story. After helping to rescue his company, he decided that his mission in life was to spread the message of the coffee bean lesson to as many people as possible. To that end, he traveled the world, giving motivational speeches in a wide range of settings – from schools and hospitals to businesses and nonprofits.  Stories of transformation followed in his wake, as people realized their inner potential to change their environments.  Perhaps the next story of transformation will be a story about you! The key message in these blinks: There are three basic responses in the face of adversity. We can represent each of them with the way an object reacts to being placed in boiling water, which is a metaphor for being surrounded by difficult environments or circumstances. The first response is to act like a carrot – growing soft and weak with emotions like fear and hopelessness. The second is to act like an egg – growing hard-hearted. The third is to act like a coffee bean – transforming the environment or circumstances around us and making the most of them.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

We’re going to lose that extra weight, get that promotion, and finally realize our dreams. And then we wake up the next day and say, “Meh, maybe next week.” But the problem isn’t our goals or ourselves, or even our attitude. The problem is our approach. Why do we think we can just wake up and snap our fingers and change everything? Not only is it unlikely to happen, it’s also potentially dangerous. The Compound Effect offers another path. Build up momentum, make a plan, slowly change our bad habits into good ones, and tackle our personal limits. From the publisher of Success magazine, The Compound Effect represents a concrete how-to guide for reaching your goals and becoming successful. After reading these blinks, you’ll learn what Arnold Schwarzenegger’s weight-lifting technique can teach you about success; how to build up momentum like Michael Phelps; and why aiming for the quickest possible successes can damage your health. Fast money and fast promotions: we’re all looking for immediate results these days. But really, it’s long-term changes that produce positive differences and are far more rewarding. In this age of “now, now, now!” we eat fast food because cooking takes too long, we go on quick-fix diet plans to drop 20 pounds in a week, and become restless if we’re not promoted within a year. However, the more quickly we reach a goal, the bigger the consequences can be. It’s not healthy to expect instantaneous results. When you don’t lose those 20 pounds in seven days, you might become disillusioned and think you never deserved a better life anyway. What you need to do is take little steps, because daily, small, positive actions are the secret to long-term success. Take Scott, for example. Instead of trying to shed 20 pounds in a week, he cut 125 calories from his daily diet, listened to self-improvement recordings as he commuted to work, and walked a little extra each day. The result? In 31 months, he lost 15 kilos, and even got a promotion and pay rise at work. Using the Compound Effect means knowing that every decision you make creates your destiny, and that you must work consistently before you can experience success. Then, when you reach your goals, you have to maintain discipline if you wish to build on them, or your hard work will be for nothing. Think of those restaurants that become so popular that you have to wait ages to get a table. They take their success for granted and stop doing what got them there in the first place. Then, suddenly, the service and menus become lackluster, and no one goes there anymore. It’s crucial to avoid becoming dismayed when you don’t see immediate effects, and to ensure you keep generating good results. So what are the keys to consistent success? Sometimes we don’t want to admit it, but our choices are what shape our destiny and we are responsible for what we do or don’t do. Sometimes it’s the seemingly insignificant decisions that prevent us from being successful. For instance, no one wants to become obese, or declare bankruptcy, but these are the consequences of multiple poor – but small – choices. You’re probably familiar with the situation where you find yourself scoffing a bag of chips and after you’ve finished the bag, you realize you’ve ruined a day of healthy eating. It’s hard to admit that you alone are responsible for your actions. Maybe you think it’s bad luck, but that’s just an excuse for your poor choices. We can all be lucky. In order to “be lucky,” you just need to know how to spot good opportunities. You need to connect your decisions with the right motivation and clear goals, because when you have defined goals, you can focus on them far more effectively. Your mind will start to see the opportunities in front of you and you’ll start reaching them. Remember the Law of Attraction – “like attracts like.” Thinking about positive actions will draw positive things toward you. So, what are your goals? What makes you happy? Consider the areas of business, health, spirituality, family and lifestyle and note down all the attributes, behaviors and characteristics you need to reach those goals, and try to apply them to your everyday life. This means cutting out old habits. List your bad habits so you can see when and where you act in a way that isn’t good for you. For example, if you must eat something sweet after a meal, have some fruit or honey nearby for a healthier treat. It also helps if you’re surrounded by people with similar goals to you, and if you have patience with yourself. So we’ve learned that you take the first step to kickstarting your success when you make the right decisions. But how do you maintain that habit? You use The Big Mo. If you keep your healthy behavior up for a long enough time, you’ll fall into a natural, consistent rhythm. As you keep that pace, you’ll keep making the right decisions, and start feeling unstoppable! That’s the power of The Big Mo – the big momentum. It’s the most powerful driving force for success. Take swimmer Michael Phelps. His coach only let him finish training early once in 12 years, when he was allowed 15 minutes off so he could attend a school dance. But all that practice led to Big Mo, culminating in eight gold Olympic medals. To keep momentum rolling, your healthy behavior has to be built into your daily routine, so you’ll need a plan. Remember to be realistic and don’t try to do everything in a short period of time. Instead, create a routine that enables you to ease into your new life. So scrap the idea of hitting the gym for two hours every day! Going three days a week for one hour, and sticking to it, is far better. When building momentum, the length of time you work out isn’t that important. What matters is that you keep showing up. Next, eliminate situations that cause you to stray from your goals. The media, for example, can have a negative effect on your energy without you even noticing. Commercials, news about war, and so on, can wreak havoc on your attitude and expectations. Instead of tuning in to the news, why not listen to an inspirational CD or chat with someone you love? Finally, be aware of your environment. Sometimes you have to change it in order to fulfill your dreams. People, too, influence you significantly, so keep supportive folks around you to keep your momentum going. As you progress, you’re bound to hit some personal limits. The question is, will you stop pushing, or will you break through the wall? The wall of your discipline and routines represents the gap between your old self and your improved, stronger self. You’ll find your new habits will compound and you’ll change into a more successful person. So when you come to the limit of what you think you can achieve, push through that limit to get quicker results and multiply your success. Remember Arnold Schwarzenegger’s famous Cheating Principle for weight training? When you’ve reached the maximum number of lifts you can manage, lean back to access other muscle groups to support the working muscles. Doing this enables you to add five or six more reps to your set. Similarly, pushing through your personal limits will only make you stronger. Picture a scenario in which you’ve come within five pounds of your weight-loss goal, then hit a wall because of work stress. Remember, you already know how to be disciplined, make good choices, and build momentum without your old self-destructive behavior. So choose to push through, and you’ll find you won’t just achieve your goal, you’ll also be even stronger. It’s always to your own benefit to push yourself a little more, go for a little longer and prepare a little better. That’s why the author invests a great deal of time researching all he can about the companies to whom he gives keynote speeches. The extra work he puts in is more than what’s expected of him, and this makes his speeches extremely popular. So if you want to put yourself ahead of others and your old self, you need to break through your limits. The key message in this book: The keys to success are realizing that you’re responsible for your life, forming healthy daily habits, cultivating discipline and pushing past your comfort zone. Getting to your goals at lightning speed can sometimes be detrimental and is often not possible. Instead, steady progress and patience will get you where you really want to be. Actionable advice: Prove you’re the boss To prove to yourself that you’re really in control of your behavior and decisions, for 30 days abstain from smoking, quit drinking your favorite wine or eat one healthy meal per day. Completing this goal will help convince you that you really are the boss of your own life.

A high-impact service delivered across a wide variety of specialist domains. But all consultants have a common interest: To leverage their skills, knowledge and experience to get the best for their clients. This is something that countless people, from management consultants to software developers and even travel agents do almost every day. And there’s a common set of principles that can help you to do that. After all, if you want to make it big, you’ll have to satisfy your customers, learn to fight your corner, take the views and expertise of others on board and structure interactions with clients as efficiently as possible. With more than 25 years of professional experience directing consulting engagements across the globe, Samir Parikh has distilled these principles into The Consultant’s Handbook. Packed with practical advice and engaging, real-world examples, it provides the ultimate crash course in delivering high-performance results in a competitive marketplace. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how to make a good first impression and establish your credibility with clients; when to argue your case and when to defer to your client’s own expertise; and how to structure a killer project proposal. Consultancy is a term that’s become grossly inflated in recent years. Today, it’s hard to get a handle on what it really means. So let’s start with a definition. Consultancy means using two ingredients – your expertise and experience – to help your clients realize their goals. These pillars can support a basic consulting proposition. You can see how this works by imagining an architect who’s been commissioned to design a house. The architect uses two things to fulfill his client’s brief: his architectural knowledge and his experience building similar houses. Whether you lean more heavily on expertise or experience varies from situation to situation. If the architect is fresh out of school, he won’t have much hands-on practice behind him and will emphasize the things he learned during his studies. On the other hand, someone with 20 years in the industry is likely to lean on a wealth of experience from past projects. But there’s also another aspect to consultancy – harnessing the collective efforts of your organization to act in your client’s best interests. This is especially true of bigger consultancy firms. An essential part of their brief is deploying their networks and resources as efficiently as possible to address a client’s needs. They achieve this by cultivating a knowledge-sharing culture. Databases and networking help pool information about previous cases and make it available to those who need it. Finally, there’s the question of how interests align. The consulting company’s interest may be to sell the client additional services, but this may not be what the client needs. As a consultant, it always best to act in your client’s best interests. Focusing on short-term gains will end up annoying clients and undermining their trust in you. That means jeopardizing future collaborations. Most importantly, acting in their interests preserves your consultancy firm’s credibility. That’s not as gratifying as instant profits, but it’s integral to your company’s long-term success. Say you’re the manager of a company that’s deciding which consultancy firm to hire. How would you feel if the consultants you’d invited for a preliminary meeting turned up not knowing any of the basic information about your company? Not great, right? That’s why any consulting assignment should always start with thorough preparation. Of course, getting to grips with the nitty-gritty takes time. How deep you dive into the details depends on various constraints and the nature of your first meeting. So if you’re short on time, aim to research your client’s company, their key issues and some possible solutions – call it basic preparation. That’s usually a matter of no more than two hours. Here are the things you’ll want to take into account. First off, the company’s locations and the industry and market in which it’s active. Next up: basic financial information like revenue and profits, its business units, competitors and product palette. Finally, you’ll want to read relevant press releases and learn the names of key executives. Commit that to your memory and you’ll be well-placed to follow the conversation and understand your client’s needs in your first meeting. This makes a good impression. Knowing the basics means your client will take you seriously. Turn up underprepared, by contrast, and they’ll start wondering if they’ve made a mistake. If you’re working on a bigger project, you’ll need to delve a bit deeper and conduct a more detailed preparation, meaning basic preparation plus some extras. These include strategy, aims, notable trends in the industry, company history, sales channels, more advanced financial data and customer feedback. Lastly, there’s engagement-specific preparation. That’s a way of preparing for a meeting on a specific topic. Sometimes your client will invite you to a meeting addressing one particular issue. That could be team performance or efficiency in a certain area. In those cases, your prep work will need to go beyond familiarizing yourself with the company in general – you’ll also need to be ready to deal with the issue at hand. That doesn’t just mean research, however. A great way of preparing yourself is to think of useful questions that you’ll need to ask as well as anticipating what your client might ask you. Preparation also plays an important role in the topic we’ll be addressing in the next blink: establishing credibility. Whatever field you’re offering your consulting services in, there’s one essential thing you simply cannot do without: trust. That’s why it’s so important to position yourself as a credible source of professional advice from the get-go. So how do you that? Well, start with a well-crafted personal introduction. This doesn’t mean selling yourself and your colleagues by claiming how fantastic you are. What you should be doing is providing an objective overview of your experience and what you can bring to the project. That means making distinct claims and backing them up with evidence. Lay out how many projects you’ve completed and how long you’ve been consulting. Telling it like it is makes your introduction much more tangible. It can even pay to formulate the exact words that you’re going to use beforehand so that you’re well prepared. Make sure your introduction is also relevant and concise and you’ll be onto a winner. Your client will know you’re not wasting their time and will get a good picture of how your experience and expertise fit their needs. But it’s not just yourself you’ll be introducing – it’s also your organization. You won’t be working on your client’s project alone, so it’s a good idea to introduce your team and explain how its skills are suited to the work at hand. Include references to qualified people who will support the work behind the scenes, if needed. Or simply ask your client if they have any questions about the credentials of your organization after your brief summary. Answer these questions well and you are bound to build credibility. Consultancy involves a lot of back and forth. Addressing your client’s needs and issues requires plenty of interaction. That usually comes in the form of meetings. So it’s important to make sure you’re getting the most out of meetings. The way to do that is to have a clear structure that helps you ensure the key issues are being addressed. If you don’t have that, it’s easy to end up in endless, rambling meetings in which key points end up being left out. And don’t rely on your clients to bring a well-structured approach to the discussion. It’s up to you. The first step to boosting the efficiency of your meetings is to agree on your objectives before you start. Why are you meeting and what do you want to achieve? Agree on that with your team before your client arrives and you’re bound to have a much more productive session. That brings us to team organization. You want to avoid that awkward situation when several people try to answer the client’s question at once. Delegating responsibilities before the meeting lets you head off potential communication problems. Agree on the points that you plan to emphasize as well as any discussions that you would prefer to avoid. You’ll also want someone taking notes during the meeting to make sure everyone’s on the same page once you’re done. Finally, there’s the matter of the meeting’s structure. Begin with introductions before agreeing on the context. Next comes the body – the point at which you’ll address issues and work out solutions. Conclude with a summary and a clear list of next steps. That said, be ready for the unexpected. Your client might suddenly toss a new idea or question into the mix. If you want to deal with them without losing your balance, you’ll need to be flexible. Remember, your job is to act in your client’s best interests. To do that, you need to understand what it is that they want. And that’s something that can change. So be prepared to add new issues to the agenda when a client brings them up. Say you’re in a meeting and agreeing on the context. You specify that your aim is to present your potential solutions, but the client suddenly says he’s especially interested in product development. That’s something you should make sure you address even if it wasn’t on your agenda originally. The first step to winning an assignment is successfully positioning yourself as a credible source of authority. But you shouldn’t overlook the written proposal you’ll be submitting for your consulting services either. So what should that proposal look like? Well, the key is to keep things straightforward. The proposal should tell the client what you’re planning on doing and how you’re going to go about that. Start with an executive summary. That’s basically a couple of paragraphs in which you present the condensed version of your proposal. It’s worth paying careful attention to this as it’s often the only part a client reads! Next up is the introduction. This is your chance to outline the overall structure of the proposal. Then there’s the main body. Here you’ll want to describe the problem at hand and talk about how you’re going to tackle it, the time frame, price and the expected benefits for the client. Cite your relevant credentials and references here to add meat to the bones of your proposal. Good proposals come in different shapes and sizes, but they have one thing in common: they’re realistic and precise. That’s because overly optimistic commitments and failing to define clear terms can negatively affect your project later on. When you focus on your client’s actual needs rather than trying to offer them the world, they’re much less likely to end up feeling disappointed. Take it from a Dutch consulting firm which learned that the hard way. It was commissioned by a company in the banking sector to work on a project which the latter estimated required 20 consultants. What did the consultancy do? They prepared a highly ambitious proposal for a project to be delivered by 60 people! The client wasn’t impressed. The company wanted someone to help them with a specific task, not to turn the whole operation on its head. “We asked for an apple,” they said, “you gave us a pumpkin.” Precisely defining your terms will also save you a lot of hassle in the long run. Say you’ve been hired to deliver a risk management solution. Your definition might not match your client’s. If you don’t define what you mean by risk management, there’s every chance that your client will expect you to do more work due to their broader definition. Standing your ground when you know you’re in the right is an important and admirable trait. But you also need to know when to give way and acknowledge that your clients may know things that you don’t. As you’ve already learned, your job as a consultant is to act in your client’s best interest. That includes speaking up when you think they’re making a mistake. When that happens, you’ll need to do a couple of things. First off, be confident in your own expertise and argue your case. The best way of doing that is to offer constructive criticism. That’s all about logical reasoning. In brief, there are two kinds of arguments that you can build: deductive or inductive arguments. Deductive arguments are about arriving at a conclusion by whittling away other possibilities in an analytical manner. Say your client needs a car and has three specific requirements. A deductive argument would work like this. There are five cars on the market that fulfill the first of these requirements; three of those are also within budget, but only one of them can be delivered within your desired time frame – that’s your solution. The answer was found analytically through a process of elimination. An inductive argument follows a more persuasive logic and starts with the solution. Here you’ll present your answer to a problem and explain the reasoning supporting that conclusion. Both types of arguments can be effective depending on the situation. Sometimes, you might find it useful to use both. You can use deductive arguments, for example, to show why your solution is the perfect answer to your client’s needs and then use inductive arguments to support your case. But remember, no matter how well you can argue your case, there’ll be times when you’ll need to accept that your client might just know better than you do. Your client might have a good reason to be skeptical about your proposal. After all, they know their trade and company better than anyone else. They are also in the best position to judge whether the approach that you are proposing will be embraced by the people in their organization. That means your best bet is to combine confidence with humility. It’s worth taking a step back and asking yourself why your client has rejected a particular solution before moving on to another idea. Few things influence the way people understand the world today more than the internet. That also goes for your clients. Their satisfaction doesn’t just shape your current relationships but also the way your future clients will view you. After all, reviews of your service are only ever a few clicks away. So what’s the best way of managing client satisfaction? Well, you should start applying the “50:50” rule. That means devoting half your attention to results and the other half to your client’s experience. Let’s break that down a bit, starting with results. Your first aim is to achieve results by successfully applying your skills and expertise to a problem. That’s about adopting a roadmap that guides you through the assignment and a set of tools that help you deliver the result. Taken together, that’s your methodology. Good methodology isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution – it’s about tailoring your approach to a distinctive issue. Over time, you’ll build up invaluable experience and stock your toolkit with ever more precise gadgets that’ll help you get the job done. To effectively address your client’s problem you’ll need to agree on a time frame and a budget and stick to them. Your expertise and ability to use resources efficiently are key to achieving your goal. But results are only part of the story. It’s just as important to manage the client experience. Think of the last time you flew somewhere. What would you consider if you were asked to rate your experience – there’s more to it than whether the flight arrived on time, right? Cabin service, the quality of the food, comfort and the efficiency of the luggage delivery are all important too. The same applies to your services. That’s especially true in ultra-competitive industries in which a number of companies can successfully deliver the same results. Provide your clients with a satisfying all-round experience and you’ll set yourself apart from the crowd. Take an example from Western Europe. A consultancy firm was on track with its project. Everything was going well, and the company was convinced it was going to hit its targets. The client wasn’t so sure, however, and a worried executive called the firm several times a day to ask how things were going. The calls persisted even after she’d been reassured that everything was fine. Recognizing her worries, the consultancy firm decided to send her a status report at the end of each day. That was something the client appreciated, and soon enough, the calls stopped. That’s a good example of providing great customer service. Take the time to make sure your clients are happy, and they are bound to stay loyal to your firm. Consulting teams aren’t always welcome in the offices of the companies that have hired them. It’s easy to see why. Consultants often recommend significant changes which, if implemented, can result in layoffs. Then there’s a more primal factor – people don’t like outsiders telling them what to do. That means that anticipating potential resistance and uncooperativeness is an essential part of your work as a consultant. Dealing with resistance is a tricky balancing act. Your aim shouldn’t be merely overcoming it but also acknowledging its sources. So when you come up against opposition to your plans, ask yourself why people are resisting. Take a London-based company which hired a consultancy firm to improve its accounting system. The system had been designed and implemented years before by the in-house IT department. When the consultants arrived, they were faced with a dilemma. The staff working in the IT department were highly critical of the project, continuously raising concerns and objections. Dealing with these was not only time consuming but was blocking the progress of the work. What, the consultants asked themselves, could be done to improve the ongoing relationship? They realized that the IT department took great pride in the system it had designed. Its members were anxious about what would replace it as well as the fact that it was being implemented by outsiders. The consultants arranged a meeting with the department’s head and acknowledged the value of the existing system while highlighting the reasons a new one was needed. They then reassured him that his team would be the owners of the new system and would play an important driving role in the success of the project. It was a savvy approach – soon enough the IT department was on board, and the project was able to move forward. Flexibility is another valuable technique that’ll help you head off potential problems. It’s all about meeting your clients on their own terms. If they’re extremely professional, repay them with the same level of professionalism. If they’re down to earth and friendly, you should be too! The key message in these blinks: Whether you’re working in a consultancy or simply trying to polish up your ability to advise clients, there are a couple of basics well worth committing to memory. First off, remember that your aim is to always act in your client’s best interest. To do that you’ll need to be well-prepared, flexible and tuned into their needs. Add your expertise and experience into the mix and you’ve got a winning formula that’s guaranteed to leave your clients satisfied and looking forward to the next project with you.  Actionable advice: Use the “logic tree” approach to solve problems.  Next time you find yourself confronted with a thorny problem, draw up a logic tree. That’s essentially a graph in which you try to trace an issue back to its source. Say your client’s company isn’t profitable. That’s the problem. What’s causing it? Well, it might be low revenues or high costs (or both!). Those are your branches. Now ask why revenues might be low and costs high – those are the next branches of your “tree.” Keep going and you’ll eventually find the root cause. Got feedback?

But Americans are not the only ones who use this weighty word so lightly. Perhaps you yourself have said, “I love to write,” or “I love playing the piano.” But unless you’ve truly dedicated yourself and put yourself on the line for your so-called love, “love” might not be the right descriptor for what you’re feeling. Perhaps you admire it or wish you could do it. To truly love something, that thing must be your element. In these blinks, you’ll learn why it’s not too late to start creating or learning something totally new; how aptitude is not the same thing as passion; and why finding your “tribe” involves more than a clever Instagram caption. You’ve probably heard people talk about “being in their element” when referring to a sense of fulfillment and connection with their true identity and purpose. It sounds great, but how can you find that place for yourself? Well, the truth is there’s no single route to get there. But by learning the main characteristics that define the element, you can begin to determine what it means for you. The first of these characteristics is aptitude. Aptitude is what most people call “talent.” It’s the natural and intuitive ability to accomplish something. However, there are limits to how far aptitude can get you. For instance, you could have an aptitude for anything from software development to poetry to playing the violin. Maybe you have a voice perfectly suited for opera, or for radio – that’s aptitude. But aptitude isn’t enough. You also need passion. After all, you can do something with extreme proficiency and still not feel moved by it. Being in your element requires feeling a certain pleasure and delight in what you’re doing. This kind of passion will keep you practicing for hours and loving every minute of it. Just take Charles, the keyboard player in the author’s brother’s former band. One night after a show, the author told Charles how well he had played and how much he himself loved playing keyboard. Charles responded by saying that the author didn’t actually love it, because, if he did, he would be doing it. Charles practiced several hours a day. Not because anyone was forcing him to, but because that’s what he wanted to do. In other words, playing the keyboard was his passion. People love to classify themselves as lucky or unlucky, but when it comes to motivation, luck won’t get you very far. In fact, you’ll have a difficult time ever finding your element, if you’re not driven by the proper attitude. Just consider all the high achievers with attitudes that drive their ambition and perseverance every step of the way. John Wilson is a good example. At the age of twelve, he was blinded during a mishap in chemistry class. But the experience didn’t defeat him. He was glad to have the rest of his life in front him and jumped right into learning Braille, the writing system used by the visually impaired. He excelled at a college for the blind and later at Oxford, where he studied law alongside sighted students. From there he went on to play a role in the formation of Sight Savers International, a group that works to treat and prevent blindness among the populations of developing countries. He served as director of the organization for decades, traveling all over the world and doing incredible work. That’s the power of attitude. Of equal importance is opportunity. To understand why, just imagine being the most talented pearl diver in the world, yet you happen to live in the Sahara Desert. You’d never notice your talent, much less apply it successfully. That’s why you need the right opportunities. Opportunity can come in a variety of forms. In the author’s case, for instance, a mentor paved the way. As a child, the author contracted polio, and, due to the partial paralysis he suffered, attended a school for children with disabilities. He didn’t have the opportunity to excel until a public official visited the school and noticed how bright the author was. The official, named Mr. Stafford, had the author take a special test, which ensured him acceptance to a good college and, from then on, Mr. Stafford became a mentor and good friend. Most people have a relatively limited perception of intelligence. They think of it as a score on a test, a grade in school or a knack for words and numbers. But, actually, a totally different perspective is required. If you fail to recognize the nuances by which people navigate the world, you’ll dramatically limit your chances of finding your element. More specifically, when seeking your element, it’s essential to recognize the manifold forms that intelligence takes. Just consider Gordon Parks. He barely got any high school education and probably would have bombed the standardized tests of today. But he taught himself to play piano, take photos, write and master a variety of other skills, molding himself into a renowned American photographer, filmmaker, author and composer. Intelligence needn’t be limited by standard definitions. It’s a dynamic force. Like the human brain, it never settles into a single fixed state, and it can be developed by forming connections in a variety of ways. Consider Albert Einstein, widely known as an incredible scientist and brilliant mathematician. He is a great example of the benefits different forms of thinking can offer. For instance, when Einstein faced difficult mathematical problems, he’d play his violin. This change of pace would foster new connections in his mind and produce solutions that would have otherwise been inaccessible. And finally, it’s important to remember that every single person has a unique intelligence, like a fingerprint. That means there are no two people who use their intelligence in precisely the same way. For example, some people study math and engineering at top universities to become amazing architects, while others travel the world, observing structures and shapes to help them reach the exact same goal. Have you ever passionately described your dreams to another person and been met with nothing but an uncomprehending stare? Well, you’re not the only one, and this poses problems since finding your element requires other people. Indeed, finding your element is much easier if you first find your tribe. This group could consist of just about anybody. It might be people you work with or even your competitors. What makes your tribe unique is a commitment to doing what feels most natural to you. Consider the American actress Meg Ryan. She did excellently in school, was a brilliant writer and a talented academic. But despite all these other talents, it was on film sets that she met her tribe. These people – actors, cameramen and directors – shared her view of the world. And that’s exactly what you need a tribe to do. So your tribe can help you find your element, but keep in mind that, once you do find your element, it might fully absorb you. You might have already experienced that certain state of mind where you totally lose track of time and space. Well, that’s a common way to experience your element. You’ll find yourself entirely absorbed, even “lost” in what you’re doing. For instance, when the great Swedish-American pool player Ewa Laurance, is shooting pool, she sometimes feels as though everything around her disappears. She can’t keep track of time and will play for nine hours straight, experiencing it like 30 minutes. But of course there are limitations to this. You can’t expect to be entirely absorbed in what you’re doing every second of your life. Sometimes the situation just isn’t right or you find your mood isn’t appropriate. You’re bound to get distracted from time to time and it’s important to accept that fact. Have you ever felt like you couldn’t do something? Whether it was running a marathon, finishing college or painting a beautiful picture, there was probably some goal that you felt you could never achieve. This is normal. Everybody is faced with self-doubt some of the time, especially when searching for your element; you’re bound to run into certain barriers, some of which will be particularly personal. A good example is the celebrated American artist Chuck Close. Facing physical problems and a learning disorder, he did poorly in school, as well as in sports. His life at home wasn’t easy, either; his dad died young and his mother had a serious illness. Nonetheless, his art kept him motivated and caused him to blossom. Even when he became paralyzed by a blood clot and lost the ability to hold a paintbrush, he refused to give up his art; he simply found a way to hold a brush with his teeth and forged ahead. So whether you suffer from a physical disability or not, a strong will is essential. Remember, even a perfectly healthy person won’t be able to complete a marathon without a good attitude. However, in other cases these barriers won’t be personal, but social. For instance, what would you do if your closest friends, or your family, disdained the life path you chose? Well, that’s precisely what happened to the world-renowned Brazilian author Paulo Coelho. He had a difficult life growing up and his parents were desperate for him to become a lawyer. As a result, when Paulo pushed ahead with his art, they had him put into a psychiatric asylum, not just once – but three times! That’s why it’s important to remember that, regardless of what the people in your life think is best for you, only you can find your element. Lots of people believe that, upon reaching a certain age, there are particular things they cannot do. But while it might feel too late, it rarely actually is. Naturally, there are limits to this and you’re probably not going to become an Olympic figure skater at the age of 90, but that doesn’t mean life is strictly linear when it comes to capacity and accomplishments. People might age in a linear fashion, but you can still reach for your dreams later in life. Just take the successful author Harriet Doerr. She wrote a bit while raising her children, but it wasn’t until the age of 65 that she finally returned to college. The writing courses she took at this late age helped her get into the creative writing program at Stanford University and she was 72 when her first novel, Stones for Ibarra, finally came out. And even if you don’t become a world-renowned author, or anything else, you can still be in your element as an amateur. In fact, to find and enjoy your element, it’s completely unnecessary to be a professional. After all, your element isn’t about getting rich or famous; it’s about living according to your talent and your passion. The academic Gabriel Trop is a good example. While pursuing his PhD in German literature at the University of California at Berkeley, he began playing cello. After just a year, he had risen to the title of lead cellist in the university orchestra. But when he had to make a choice between music and literature, he chose the latter as his profession. Both pursuits put him in his element, but a career in literature would let him pursue the cello without financial stress. If he had taken the other route, and become a professional cellist, he would have struggled to meet his basic needs, much less find time for literature. The key message in this book: Every person can find her element – that place where she feels totally absorbed and fulfilled. Age, career status and personal barriers will be no match for you if you can find the confluence of your talent and passion and commit yourself to sticking with it.  Got feedback?

A sentiment that still holds strong. But does it hold water? Given that more people than ever before have a college degree and the whole world is just a few keyboard clicks away, it might be time to reconsider this sentiment. Something has indeed changed. In our globalized modern world, a job is no longer the safest route to financial security. From outsourcing to unemployed college graduates, it looks like we are in a recession, but we could also be witnessing the limits of a decaying system and the beginning of a new one: a paradigm shift and the end of jobs as we know it. In these blinks, you’ll find out how the English King Henry VIII made capital more important than land; why great entrepreneurs think like poker players; and how population growth in the U.S. has increased unemployment. There are many variables that determine how society progresses. One variable particularly worth examining is the limit of the systems we live and work in. Software entrepreneur Eli Goldratt came up with this theory of constraints in the 1980s.  According to Goldratt, every system that has a goal also has a limit: a part of the system that restricts growth. So if your factory has two assembly lines that produce 100 units of a product and one that produces only 50, that third line would be the limit. In order to progress, then, we need to work on this limit. For example, if you have a great product but nobody’s heard of it, you won’t boost sales by improving your product. Here, the limit you need to improve on would be your marketing strategy. According to systems thinker Ron Davidson, the last three major changes in the Western economy occurred when the limits changed. Back in fourteenth-century England, the agricultural economy was based on land, and since the Catholic Church owned the lion’s share of it, they controlled the economy. Therefore, the limit was land until the sixteenth century, when Henry VIII appointed himself head of the Anglican Church and revoked Rome’s control over it.  Then, at the dawn of the industrial age in the 1700s, bankers became more powerful than kings, shifting the limit from land to capital, and forcing land-owner and Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III to ask bankers for a loan to finance his wars. Later, in the 1900s, we shifted from a capital economy into a knowledge economy. Knowledge, proliferated by technology, became the new limit, making companies like IBM extremely powerful. This was evident in 1975, when IBM successfully issued a billion dollars in bonds, despite their bankers at Morgan Stanley refusing to cooperate. Since the early 2000s, though, we’ve seen a weakening of the knowledge economy as a burgeoning entrepreneurial economy gains momentum. Read on to find out why. Jobs are becoming increasingly hard to come by and, believe it or not, those in their fifties today are partly responsible for it.  After WWII, the economic boom pushed the knowledge economy to its limit, and it began morphing into a new system. People born in the U.S. in the first two decades after WWII – the baby boomers – enjoyed a period of economic prosperity and an abundance of career options. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, jobs grew 1.7 times faster than the population between the years 1948 and 2000. This growth meant that baby boomers simply had to get a college education and the right credentials, and they’d walk straight into a job. The next generations followed suit, believing it would remain this way. But there was never any guarantee that the economy would stay the same. And it hasn’t. In fact, since 2000, the population has grown 2.4 times faster than have positions on the job market. This explains the plethora of well-educated, jobless graduates. In the U.S., over half the recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in a position that doesn’t require a degree. From this we see that knowledge in the form of credentials is no longer the limit. We’ve reached the peak of 9-to-5 jobs and we are now witnessing the beginning of entrepreneurship. Interestingly, the only jobs on the rise since the 1980s are non-routine cognitive jobs: creative, unpredictable work rather than work involving completing the same task every day. Our economy is expanding based on creativity and innovation. In other words, creativity is the new limit and the new power players are entrepreneurs who set up businesses and pursue innovative ideas. The apartment rental website AirBnB is a great example: they started out by posting apartments on Craigslist, an external site that lists apartments, as a creative way to market their own business. Aside from the dearth of jobs in the U.S., there’s another reason finding work has become so difficult: the possibility of outsourcing. Modern communication technology and increased global education has released us from our office cubicles and the number of people with university degrees has dramatically increased, making degrees less valuable. In fact, the number of college graduates in the world increased from 90 million in 2000 to 130 million in 2010. But what does this mean? Well, when we add technology like the video calls of Skype into the mix, this means that qualified talent can be hired and work from anywhere in the world. This also means companies can employ workers from countries with lower wage expectations. An English-speaking web designer in the Philippines, for example, can be employed for an annual salary ranging from $700 to $1,400. A shocking contrast to the expected salary of around $82,000 for a web designer in the U.S. Machines are increasingly replacing humans in industry, especially factory workers whose jobs are now carried out by hardware and software. But these machines have moved beyond factory tasks and can be used in knowledge-based jobs. Take Eventbrite, a company that sells tickets online which are booked and paid for entirely by software. So what can you do? Don’t wait around to be replaced by software – own it. Modern technology has made running a business financially viable for more and more people, and an entrepreneur can run a small company using an international talent pool at a relatively low cost. Such startups are often called micro-multinationals. Jesse Lawler, for example, runs Evil Genius Technologies, a Vietnam-based software company which employs workers from England, India, the Philippines, and other countries. Lawler has sales and customer service people in the U.S., while his programmers live in Vietnam. This way he cuts down drastically on his expenses: living costs alone would make it impossible for Lawler to hire more than two developers in the U.S. For an entrepreneur, modern technology presents an abundance of opportunities. The benefits of having a steady job have been drilled into our heads since we were children, but what if we were misinformed? A steady job today means exposing yourself to an insidious risk that is out of your control. In our current economy, your steady income can disappear at the drop of a hat, leaving you clueless as to how to recover. Your regular paycheck gives you a false sense of security, and you may easily be replaced by an equally talented employee in India who is willing to work for less. It’s a harsh reality but, if you’ve followed orders your entire career, you won’t have the skill set to create options for yourself. Think of this as the Turkey Problem: you’re like a turkey, relying on being fed everyday until one day you’re sent to the ax! Entrepreneurs don’t have this problem, as they deal directly with visible risks. They may not make an immediate profit, but they acquire skills and create systems and can change them if they don’t produce the desired results.  In other words, they enjoy unlimited control and unlimited variables, and the possibility for growth is vast. Most of the entrepreneurs the author talked with would actually be disappointed with a growth rate of 20 percent per annum. Much like poker players, entrepreneurs understand the concept of expected value. This is the average value in a series of repetitions of a random variable. Say you’re playing a hand in a poker game and it’ll cost you $1,000 to view the final card. You know there’s a 20 percent chance you’ll win $20,000 for the whole hand. So you’re coughing up $1,000 for an expected value of $4,000, which is 20 percent of $20,000. If you place this bet enough times, you’re guaranteed to come out on top. It’s no surprise, then, that many poker players end up being entrepreneurs. Starting a business is for highly intelligent business types with piles of cash, right? Actually, thanks to modern technology, anyone has the possibility to do anything from designing furniture to publishing a novel. Apple mogul Steve Jobs even said that entrepreneurs aren’t necessarily smarter than the average person. One thing that has changed the game of business is, of course, the internet. One way it has done so is by dramatically reducing production costs. The tools needed to create a product are more affordable and more widely available than ever before. Take Software as a Service, i.e., businesses like Adobe Creative Cloud that sell software on a subscription basis. Whereas in the past you needed to invest in pricey equipment and sign long-term contracts, now quality services can be accessed on a monthly basis. So, instead of spending hundreds of dollars on accounting software, you can now pay $9 a month for an accounting program like Xero. The internet has also lowered distribution costs. Along with accessing manufacturers in lower-cost countries, you can also reach and distribute to customers directly. The author, for example, used to work for a business that made and sold portable bars. By manufacturing in China and distributing directly to consumers, they were able to cut their costs by about 25 percent and improve the product’s quality. The internet is also constantly creating new markets, largely because location is now irrelevant. For instance, in the past you would use a law firm because it was near your office. Now, you can use a website like UpCounsel to find a vetted lawyer who specializes in your needs, regardless of your location. If you’re an entrepreneur, you can also more easily serve niche markets on the net. Firegang Dental Marketing, for example, offers digital marketing services exclusively in the niche of dentists who want to reach new customers. Prehistoric hunter-gatherers didn’t work like we do today: they worked to survive. But this changed at the beginning of the agricultural revolution. After that, work became an obligation. When we started creating farming communities, we worked to collect foods we could store or trade. Tilling the land was arduous, constant work to amass wealth rather than to survive. After the industrial revolution, factory workers viewed work and wages as a means to improve their quality of life. So they bore the obligation of routine factory tasks as they believed it would lead to a better life.  This idea probably seems very familiar to you. That’s because we still hold onto it today. However, today it’s possible to find more meaningful work. But how do we really weigh meaning versus money? Economist Dan Ariely conducted a psychological study in India to find out how powerful money was as an incentive. In Ariely’s study, a group of workers were assigned a complex task that was impossible to solve by using a formula, much like entrepreneurial work. One of the tasks, for example, was to unscramble an anagram. The first subgroup was offered a day’s wages for the task, the second two weeks’ wages, and the third five months’ wages. Surprisingly, the higher the reward, the weaker the performance. This is because meaningful work motivates us more than monetary incentives. We also saw this in 2006, when Mark Zuckerberg was offered $1 billion by Yahoo to buy out Facebook. Zuckerberg didn’t even consider selling. Why? His work meant too much to him. As of 2015, Facebook is worth $230 billion. In the end, Zuckerberg got to continue doing the work he loved and made a staggering profit to boot. This is all the more proof that starting a business that fulfills us is far more viable than we have traditionally been taught. Being an entrepreneur isn’t always a walk in the park, but it’s not as treacherous as you may think. Rob Walling, leader of three software companies, used his experience to create a useful entrepreneurial method known as the Stair Step Method. The first step involves creating and launching a single product, selling it for a one-time fee, and using just one marketing channel. By keeping things simple this way, you’ll learn some business basics without the pressure of a highly competitive environment, how to build and market a product, how to network, and how to hire and manage a small number of employees.  The next step is to launch enough one-time products to be able to quit your job, as Walling did before becoming a computer programming consultant. In 2005, he launched a few products and acquired some invoicing software still in its development stage, but he was only bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. At this point, your focus should be on generating enough income to buy back the time you put into your day job. This will also allow you to gather business experience, a network of entrepreneurs and a stable workforce. Walling was able to teach himself marketing just by building on the SEO that the previous owners of the software used. He then used the capital he gained from consulting and the SEO skills he learned to purchase and run an e-commerce website selling bath towels. After you’ve launched some products and gained some experience, it’s time to expand your business. You could launch bigger products or create a membership site, for example. After buying the towel website, Walling increased the company’s profit from zero to $2,500 per month. One key thing to remember is that no college course can make you an entrepreneur. While education used to be the ticket to financial stability, now practical experience is the way to acquire the skills you need to get meaning and income from your work. The key message in this book: The promise of a stable 9-to-5 job at the end of college has been unsustainable since the turn of the century. Our society is transitioning into an entrepreneurial economy and now, more than ever, is the time to take advantage of technology to create meaningful work that embraces risk and creativity, and offers more wealth and freedom than the broken tradition of the 9-to-5 grind. Actionable advice: Make decisions like a billionaire. When investing, diversifying is the key, right? Wrong! If you want to see real gains, look at the strategy of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger of the $300 billion Berkshire Hathaway holding company. Instead of diversifying, day trading or trying to beat the market year by year, these billionaires focus on 40-year time frames. The result? They’ve raked in $50 billion over 50 years by sticking with only four to five investments.

Sometimes those slumps can feel so deep that you wonder if you’ll ever get out of them. So imagine if you went on the bus one morning and the bus driver gave you a set of rules for escaping your slump. That’s what these blinks are about: the energy bus. Take a ride on an allegorical bus that gives you new ways to think positively and you’ll find yourself transforming both your personal and work life. Here you’ll find ten rules for giving your life an energy boost. In these blinks, you’ll find out what the formula E + P = O means and why it’s important; why you want to get rid of negative energy on your bus ride; and how CEO has a different meaning on the bus, and why you should become that CEO. For most people, “positive energy” means walking around with a pasted-on smile. However, truly positive energy runs much deeper; it’s a state of real optimism and enthusiasm that cultivates a lifestyle of trust, passion and love. It sounds great, but how can you reach that state? Well, take our fictional leading man in this story, George. His life seemed perfect; he had a house, a wife, two children, a puppy and a team to lead at the NRG Company, which manufactured light bulbs. Nevertheless, George was miserable. Every little thing seemed to go wrong for him, and he was desperate to find meaning in his life. Lots of people feel like George, trapped in the passenger seat of their own lives. After all, life is loaded with stress and impossible expectations, both personal and professional. One Monday morning, George discovered that his car had a flat tire. He was late to a meeting about the launch of a new light bulb, and his team descended into chaos. To make matters worse, that morning he’d had a vicious argument with his wife. Just one day in and he was already certain that it was going to be another terrible week. From there, it seemed like things only went downhill; George’s car also had a brake problem, and he had to take the bus to work for the next two weeks. However, when he climbed on board for the first time, he was immediately captivated by Joy the bus driver and her brimming smile. As it turned out, she had met many people like George and knew exactly what he needed. George learned from another passenger that, according to a study, Monday morning at 9 a.m. is the most common time for people to commit suicide. It’s the time when people feel they simply can’t go on with another week of their lives. George was dangerously close to this point and Joy knew she needed to intervene. So, she invited him on a once-in-a-lifetime journey: a trip to a happier life on the Energy Bus. Joy offered George an incredible opportunity, but it wasn’t until his wife and boss told him he was poised to lose everything that he was ready to accept it. Once he did, he committed to learning Joy’s ten rules for a new life. The first rule was: become the driver of your own bus and take back control. Here’s how his journey began. As George boarded the bus for another day at the office, Joy told him that people are often unhappy because they have no say in their lives. George immediately understood what she meant. After all, he felt trapped between conflicting expectations, like those of his boss and his wife. Not just that, but his life was full of events totally beyond his control, like the breakdown of his car. Joy went on to say that, according to the philosophy of the energy bus, to truly change your life, you need to take back control, decide who you want to be and how. But before you do that, you need to know where you’re going. That’s where the second rule comes in: with vision and focus, you can drive the bus in the direction you want.  To demonstrate this, Joy asked George to write down a vision for his personal life, one for his job and one for his family. George decided that he wanted to be happy again; he wanted to have a positive influence on his kids and for his wife to be happy. His primary goal at work was to have a successful product launch with his team. Now all that was left was to achieve these goals. To help, Joy told George about the law of attraction. According to this concept, all thoughts are magnetic, which means the things you think about will begin showing up in your life. Just take Olympic athletes, many of whom use the law of attraction by visualizing their best performances before entering a competition. Often this results in gold-medal wins. Realizing this powerful potential, George resolved to spend ten minutes a day thinking about his goals. Everybody knows that it can be difficult to focus on the positive, but working on your attitude and outlook on the world can make all the difference. Your perception of events is entirely within your control. Just take the formula E + P = O. It says that Events + Perception/Positive Energy = Outcome. In other words, there are lots of things you’ve got no control over, but what you do control is how you perceive those events. So, by choosing to have positive thoughts, rather than negative ones, you can achieve better results. This is key since positive energy will keep your bus moving forward. This is rule number three: positive energy is the fuel for your journey. But how can you keep that fuel tank topped up? Sometimes it just requires approaching things from a different perspective. If you have a lot of work to do, it can help to feel grateful for having a job in the first place, knowing that lots of people struggle to get work at all. Such a simple act of gratitude will release endorphins and make you feel better before you know it. George decided to try this practice out for himself by spending ten minutes walking around the office, considering all that he has to be grateful for. He realized that he’s healthy, has a loving family, a home and a job – much more than most people. After this walk he felt a newfound sense of energy and could get back to work, ready to face all the challenges of the day. You can follow George’s example. Just make these little pieces of practice part of your daily routine, offering yourself opportunities to recharge and reenergize as you do. Whether it’s at work with your colleagues or at home with your partner, happiness and success often rely on teamwork. After all, a happy family life and a successful work environment can only be achieved when everyone does their part. So, as George began to realize his vision in life, he started to get worried; if he was the only one approaching his work with passion and energy, it was unlikely that he’d be able to pull off a successful product launch or improve his marriage. Luckily, Joy was on hand with rule number four: tell others about your vision and ask them to join you. It’s simple: the more people you get on your bus, the more positive energy you’ll have to fuel your ride and the more successful your results will be. To make this a reality, Joy told George about an easy-to-use website that could help him tell other passengers about his plans. It’s called theenergybus.com, and by using it, George could print out bus tickets to give to his wife and everyone on his team at work. But a ticket isn’t much good if passengers don’t first understand where they’re going. While George was excited about the idea, he also knew from speaking with Joy that it was important to personally hand each potential passenger a ticket, but only after discussing the upcoming journey. That’s because, if people don’t know where you're headed, they won’t be so keen to hop on board. With this knowledge in mind, George met with each member of his team individually, handing out invitations to share his vision. In those meetings, he laid out his expectations for the launch and asked everyone to commit to the vision. His employees had all weekend to consider their conversations and let him know on Monday if they were going to come along for the ride. George felt energized by the prospect of adding new travel companions. But he was also nervous that they might disappoint him. To avoid this, his vision would need to have enough power to inspire others, something you’ll learn all about in the next blink. When George met with his team again, he was shocked to hear that one team member, José, didn’t want a seat on the bus. George was surprised because José was one of his best employees. This unexpected development made George question his vision; how could he succeed if others didn’t want to help him? Well, it’s actually less important than George might think. If people don’t want to get on the bus, you shouldn’t try to convince them. Just take a Gallup poll which found that there are around 22 million workers in the United States who hold a negative attitude toward work. These employees are responsible for an annual loss in productivity of around $300 billion. Naturally, being surrounded by people with such negative attitudes can fuel self-doubt and prevent you from realizing your goals. So, to handle his situation, Joy told George about rule number five: save your energy and don’t try to convince people who aren’t ready to get on board. Just remember, if they’re full of negativity, they’ll only slow you down. And if negative people do get on your bus, it’s essential to remove them as soon as you can. You might notice passengers who complain along the way. You can think of these people as vampires who suck out your positivity and vision. That’s why rule number six is to get Energy Vampires off of your bus. To put it another way, if you have negative people on your team, sit them down and have a talk. Try to determine where their negative attitude comes from and how you can work together. If they’re unwilling to change, you have to let them go. Or, in situations where you can’t get rid of problematic people, say your boss or supervisor, find ways to boost your own positive energy. If you can, you’ll outweigh the negativity they bring into your life. Have you ever known someone who gets ridiculously excited about new albums or movies? Have you noticed that seeing such an energetic person describe their passion fills you with excitement and happiness as well? It’s only a natural response. After all, the human body can sense the emotions of others. Just take a study from the Institute of HeartMath, an American research and education institution that specializes in the way the heart influences well-being. Their research found that the heart can transmit emotions through its own electromagnetic field. Not just that, but such a field can be sensed from a distance of up to ten feet! In other words, people around us can perceive the way we feel and respond to it. That’s why people can tell when someone is insincere. But it also means that when people are truly passionate about something, they share that enthusiasm and those positive emotions with others. Because of this, it’s key to energize your whole bus, but when you do so, it’s also important it’s done with true enthusiasm. This is where rule number seven comes in: enthusiasm will make more people join you and motivate them along the ride. In fact, the word “enthusiasm” comes from the Greek word entheos, meaning “inspired” or “filled with the divine.” As long as you’re excited about your work and the tasks you’re doing, everyone around you will feel the same. This is the kind of positive energy you need to fuel your ride for the long haul. Joy even has a name for it: your CEO or Chief Energy Officer. People who fill this role infect their team members, employees and even customers with powerful positive energy that inspires and propels them. You’ve probably noticed that you work harder when others recognize your efforts and care about you. It seems obvious, but it points to a deeper human need for appreciation. In other words, by loving your team members, you can make them feel good, but also motivate them to do their best work and follow you wherever you go. That’s why rule number eight is to love the passengers on your bus. Here’s how. First, be sure to take your time and listen. Remember, love and relationships need a while to develop and blossom. So, just as you need to spend time with your partner to build your relationship, you’ve got to spend time with your employees. Regular individual meetings are essential; they offer an opportunity for you to get to know your team personally. In these meetings, you should listen carefully to what the other person says and show empathy for their experience. Your employees should know that you care both about their needs and their ideas. From there, it’s also important to recognize your employees as individuals and show them how much you appreciate their work. This one is a no-brainer since people want to be seen as individuals, not robots. So, show your workers that they’re more than a cog in a machine. For instance, you should never send an electronic birthday message. Rather, write out real birthday cards for each person on your team. And finally, be sure to recognize the individual accomplishments of every employee you manage. Just take George and his employee José, who didn’t want to get on the bus. José never felt valued and, even though he regularly worked late, George never recognized it. Adding insult to injury, when José asked for a raise, George said he would think about it but never brought it up again. But that was the old George. The first thing the new George did after learning about rule number eight was to thank José for all his great work and promise him a raise. As a result, José was happy to join George on the energy bus. By implementing all the rules you’ve learned so far, George managed to get his marriage back on track and spend more time than ever with his kids. However, as his product launch approached, George wondered how he could inject another shot of energy into his team. To do so, he needed to understand that purpose makes his work easier. A story about President Johnson and a janitor at NASA offers a great example. The president was visiting the space program when he encountered a custodian enthusiastically cleaning the floors. The president told the man that he was probably the best janitor he had ever met, to which the janitor responded, “Sir, I’m not a janitor. I just helped put a man on the moon.” It just goes to show that, with a higher purpose, you can easily accomplish everyday tasks, and that’s why rule number nine is to let yourself be driven by a higher purpose. George got his team to see themselves as creators of not just light bulbs, but light – the kind of people who can illuminate the first book a child reads. Once they made this decision, they all happily worked late nights alongside George. Suddenly, the whole team was united behind their shared mission. But most importantly, purpose and fun can enable stellar performances. Another passenger on George’s morning commute told him about a study involving two teams, each of which was tasked with designing a new airplane. One of them was told that they were chosen to design the best airplane that ever existed, while the other was told to simply design components and denied any information about the mission behind the project. Unsurprisingly, the team with the mission had a better time and worked harder, completing their job in half the time. This example points to the last rule, number ten: you have got to have fun on your ride. After all, success is much easier to attain when you’re enjoying yourself, rather than stressing out. The key message in this book: The modern world is overloaded with competing pressures from the stress of work to the demands of family life and the general difficulty of paying bills, maintaining your house and holding everything together. But there’s a solution: positive energy can help you take back control and find true happiness. Actionable advice: Learn from your setbacks. Making sure your bus arrives at its destination can be hard work. To get where you want to go, you’ll need to be able to handle all the setbacks and challenges along the way. To do so, make a habit of asking yourself what you can learn from such difficulties. What opportunities do they present to you and your team? By thinking productively about all the roadblocks, the road to your vision will be all the smoother. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Just seven years later, in 2008, she was a multimillionaire who had sold her first company for $30 million. Having achieved her goals, she decided that she wanted to help other entrepreneurs achieve them as well. To that end, she became an angel investor – a person who provides investment capital to start-up companies. In the course of investing in more than 70 companies, she has observed that the crucial factor that turns entrepreneurial dreams into successful realities is the ability to execute – to carry out a plan of action. This execution factor, in turn, depends on five traits, all of which can be developed by anyone willing to put in the work such development requires. These blinks explore the five traits of execution – taking each in turn, explaining some general principles to deepen your understanding of them and then discussing some specific, practical techniques for mastering them. Along the way, you’ll learn how to refine an idea into a vision; how to take the first step toward pursuing that vision; and how to become more resilient in your pursuit of that vision. In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, the United States found itself falling behind the Soviet Union in the space race. The Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first human to reach outer space, beating the United States to that accomplishment. So to spur his country into action, President John F. Kennedy made a bold proclamation: by the end of the decade, the United States would land an American astronaut on the Moon.   In making this proclamation, Kennedy was articulating a vision – an ambitious, visualizable and inspiring aspiration for the future. Having a vision is the first trait of effective execution. In Kennedy’s case, it was a vision for an entire nation, but you, too, can have visions for yourself, your career or the company you’re working for or want to start. Bringing our analogies back down to earth, while still keeping an eye on the heavens above, you can think of your vision as being akin to the North Star that once helped sailors navigate the seas. Like that celestial body, a vision provides you with a reference point that can help you navigate life’s choppy waters and unexpected waves. Those “waves” are the events, setbacks and competing pressures that can distract you from pursuing your dreams. By keeping your mind’s eye fixed on your vision, you can stay focused on your life’s work and maintain your direction toward your desired destination, even during tough times. That destination is the future you envision for yourself. It can take many forms. It could be a purpose you give to your life, such as having a positive impact on the environment. It could be a vocation, like cooking. Or it could be a personal goal, like purchasing a home, starting a business or completing a marathon. Whatever your destination, you will likely find yourself taken in unexpected directions as you pursue your vision, especially if it involves a more general goal that can be achieved in various ways, such as financial freedom. For instance, the author’s first business was a digital-marketing company that sold a motley assortment of products – ranging from teeth whiteners to remote-control toys. Was this the precise future she envisioned for herself when she was younger? Of course not – but it was part of the path that led her to achieve financial freedom. You’ll never know exactly where your vision will take you until you get there! If you don’t already have one, how do you develop a vision for yourself? Well, most of us have ideas about things we might want to do or achieve some day. These ideas provide us with the raw material for a grand vision – but to turn those little sparks of imagination into a guiding North Star, we need to refine them. For starters, all visions have four qualities. The first quality is clarity. You should be able to clearly articulate your vision in a single sentence, and, in your mind’s eye, you should be able to clearly see it coming to fruition. If you can’t do either of these things, then go back to the drawing board and refine your vision. Now, achieving clarity might seem easy, especially if your vision involves a specific goal or vocation, such as having financial freedom or running a food truck. After all, can’t anyone picture herself flush with cash or cooking curbside?   Here’s the thing, though: to really achieve clarity, your imagination must be specific. For instance, for running a food truck, picture not just a vague, general image of wearing a chef’s hat and frying food, but a gritty, detailed image of working during mealtime hours, ordering workers around, dealing with disgruntled customers and so forth. In other words, you must ask yourself and honestly answer the question, “Could I really see myself doing this?” That brings us to the other three characteristics of a viable vision, each of which is related and has to do with whether a vision is an authentic expression of yourself. To be such an expression, a vision should be compelling, meaningful and pertinent to you – in other words, it should fit your values, preferences, desires and personality. Visions that fall short of these criteria are often expressions of other people’s visions for you. Consider Darren – a maintenance manager of a hospital who was renowned among his friends and colleagues for the chili he made. They kept telling him that he should start a food truck to profit off his chili. He wasn’t really interested, but their suggestion stuck in his head. He ended up quitting his job and starting a food truck – only to find it made him miserable. He liked cooking for friends and colleagues; he didn’t like cooking for strangers. We’ll look at how to avoid a similar fate in the next blink. How do you avoid pursuing a vision that’s at odds with who you really are? How do you make sure your vision is really your vision, and not someone else’s vision for you? One way is to test out your vision on a smaller scale, before you fully commit. For example, if you enjoy cooking for your friends and were thinking about starting a food truck, you could try participating in a cook-off contest. That way, you’d gain a relatively risk-free experience of cooking for strangers, which may feel very different than cooking for friends. You might love it, or you might hate it. If the latter turns out to be true, that might be disappointing – but better to find out by entering a one-time, no-stakes contest than by quitting your job and investing in a food truck!   Now, once you’ve determined that your vision truly is in line with who you are, the next step is to stay focused on it. The more vivid your image of the future is, the easier it will be to focus on it, so one thing to do is to visualize it in concrete, evocative detail. Here’s a trick for doing this: picture yourself having already achieved your vision. What do you see? Ask yourself specific questions to generate specific answers. For instance, if your vision is starting a business, what does your workplace look like? What kinds of people comprise your team of workers? What do you see yourself doing on a day-to-day basis? To remind yourself about your vision, write it down in a place where you’ll see it every day, such as your bathroom mirror. Then, keep it in mind as you plan your day. Make sure you’re pursuing and prioritizing tasks that provide stepping stones to achieve  your vision. After all, you can cross off every item on your to-do list, but it won’t bring you one step closer to your overarching goal if they’re not related to it! Prioritizing tasks that are related to achieving your vision may entail de-prioritizing or even outright avoiding other activities that you enjoy, especially those that are totally optional, such as watching television. After all, time is a finite resource, so to ensure you devote enough of it to working toward your vision, you have to be selective about the ways you spend it. By defining your vision, you’ve answered the question, “What do you want to execute?” Now the question becomes, “How do you execute it?” This brings us to the second trait of effective execution, which is passion. When you hear that word, the first thing that probably comes to mind is a strong, enthusiastic emotion, as in the sentence, “John has a passion for marketing.” However, that’s only one sense of the term; there’s another sense that’s also relevant here. It goes back to the etymology of “passion,” which derives from the Latin word pati, meaning “to suffer or endure.” In this sense of the term, passion is not just about doing things fervently because you love doing them; it’s about loving them so much that you’re willing to undergo hardship and make sacrifices for them. Such willingness is the true test of passion. For instance, when the author was a girl, she wanted to ride horses so badly that she agreed to clean out a horse owner’s stables in exchange for lessons. In other words, her passion for horseback riding was so strong that she was willing to scoop up horse excrement to pursue it! Why is passion in this sense so important? Well, unless you narrowly define success as just making money and you luck out by winning the lottery, there are no easy shortcuts to achieving it. There will inevitably be hard work, stressful events and inconveniences, such as taking conference calls when you’re sick, missing social engagements for business trips or putting personal finances on the line. If you want to succeed, you can’t avoid making sacrifices like these; all you can do is be willing to endure them – and that willingness comes from passion. Your passion provides you with the emotional energy you’ll need in order to power through the long workdays and sleepless nights that lie ahead of you on your journey toward success.   It’s also an important factor in finding other people to help you on your journey. By demonstrating a willingness to make sacrifices for your cause, you can position yourself as an inspiring leader to your colleagues or employees. Asking whether potential or current colleagues or employees share your passion can also help you to choose the people you associate with. In the next blink, we’ll look at ways to kindle and feed your passion. To tap into the power of passion, you first have to know what you’re passionate about. If you don’t already have a clear conception of this, ask yourself the following: What do you love so much that you’d be willing to make significant sacrifices for it? Maybe it’s a subject, such as fashion or animals. Maybe it’s a skill or activity, such as writing or painting. Or perhaps it’s a role, such as being a teacher or a caretaker. Whatever it is, here’s your next question: What are you doing on a regular basis that’s feeding your passion? If the answer is nothing, the next step is to change that!   You can start small. The idea is just to get your feet wet and do something – anything – to become more connected to your passion. For instance, if it were fashion, you wouldn’t have to go out and become a designer right away; you could just start a fashion blog! However, you won’t be able to write even a single blog post or take any other small steps toward feeding your passion if you don’t make time for it. As with your vision, you have to prioritize your passion and carve out a space for it in your schedule. And that means making trade-offs. To accomplish tasks that are related to your passion, you’ll have to sacrifice tasks that aren’t related to it. That may require declining invitations to social engagements, such as parties and dinners, which may be scheduled at times that conflict with your pursuit of your passion. To mitigate the disappointment of your friends, colleagues or family members, you should communicate to them the rationale behind your absences. You can also compensate them for those absences by offering alternatives, such as one-on-one meetings or small group get-togethers, which you can schedule around your pursuit of your passion. While you pursue it, you can further encourage your passion by celebrating your successes, both big and small. For instance, when one of the author’s companies achieved its first month of earning $1 million in revenue, she celebrated by taking her entire team to Las Vegas! That’s an example of celebrating a huge accomplishment in a big way – but small victories, such as closing a business deal, deserve small celebrations, too. Try literally feeding your passion by treating yourself or your team to a dinner! Once you’ve found your vision and your passion, you’re like a driver with a destination in your mind and a full tank of gas in your car. You’re ready to head out – but you won’t actually go anywhere until you put your foot down on the accelerator pedal. That’s the third trait of effective execution: action. Suffice it to say that no one ever accomplished anything without taking action, which, in this context, means doing something that takes you closer to following your passion and achieving your vision. Assuming you’ve been able to articulate your vision and are ready to take action, the first question you’re going to face is, “Where do I begin?” After all, there are many possible paths of action you can take. Which one do you choose? Well, don’t overthink it. Otherwise, you could find yourself stuck in analysis paralysis, which is the condition that occurs when you get so caught up in mulling over your options and all of their possible ramifications that you become overwhelmed, leading to inaction. Just do something. Move forward. You don’t need to commit to any particular path at this point; just pick one of them and take a first step. You can still reassess, change direction or even back out before you proceed further, so there’s no need to overanalyze. But that’s not to say you should act thoughtlessly. Remember, it’s just a step you’re taking here – not a leap. Don’t quit your job and put your livelihood on the line. Instead, keep your current job while turning your vision and passion into a side hustle. Consider Stacey. She worked in corporate finance, but her true passion was health and wellness. From this passion, she developed a vision: starting a juice company. But she didn’t quit her job, tap into her savings and jump straight into the high-risk enterprise of establishing a new business. Instead, she took a safer, smaller first step: selling juice at a farmer’s market on the weekends. This way, she could get a better sense of whether she enjoyed the work of selling juice and whether there was a market for her product. So that’s the first step. We’ll look at the steps that follow in the next blink. What comes after you take your first step of action toward following your passion and achieving your vision? Well, this might sound glib, but the answer is pretty simple: after your first step comes your second step – and then your third step, your fourth step and so forth! Obvious as this may be, it does bring up a less obvious consideration that’s important to bear in mind: your first step may be a great success – but to keep moving toward your vision, you have to, well, keep moving. If you just keep taking the same step over and over again, you’re not going to get anywhere. The same logic applies to the second step and every step after that. At every step along the way, you need to keep moving forward to make progress. Apple provides a vivid example of the importance of continuing to move forward. Apple is one of the top brands in the world, but its success didn’t hinge on being the first company to develop technologies such as MP3 players and smartphones. Other companies beat them to those innovations. Rather, Apple took these preexisting technologies and relentlessly innovated them. The company never rested on its laurels; it didn’t let itself get too comfortable in any particular step along the way of its journey. After developing the first iPhone and iPod, it went straight on to developing their follow-ups – and then the follow-ups to the follow-ups, and so forth. However, while moving forward is crucial to success, it’s also a double-edged sword. If you’re heading in the right direction, it will get you closer to achieving your vision – but, by the same token, if you’re heading in the wrong direction, it will take you further away. To avoid the latter prospect, it’s important to create and implement a daily review process. First, write down a list of all of the actions you took today that were related to your vision. Did they really align with your vision? Did they really take you closer to achieving it? Are they feeding your passion? What direction are they taking you – and is that in a direction you still want to go? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then it’s time to reassess what you’re doing and change your course of action! The fourth trait of effective execution involves another word with two meanings: resilience.  Here’s the first meaning: if someone or something is resilient, that means that he, she or it can withstand the turbulent winds of fate. For instance, if a building can weather the literal winds of a hurricane, it would be labeled as resilient.  But in another sense of the term, a resilient person not only withstands the winds of fate, but also harnesses them to the best of her ability – as a sailor does with her sails. She knows that while she can’t control the direction of the wind, she can control the direction in which she points her sails. The uncooperative “wind” in this metaphor stands for the challenges, crises and setbacks that the world may throw your way when you’re pursuing your vision. If you’re resilient in both senses of the word, you’ll not only take these difficulties in stride; you’ll also respond to them in ways that lead to growth. And one of the main ways that you can do that is by staying positive, as well as hopeful and hungry for new opportunities. That was one of the keys to billionaire Elon Musk’s bumpy road to success. Today, you may know him as the successful CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and a cofounder of PayPal. But before he succeeded, he faced many setbacks. His first business idea for PayPal floundered, and some of his SpaceX rockets literally went up in smoke. But he didn’t give up; he kept trying to succeed – and eventually, PayPal and his SpaceX rockets took off, literally and figuratively. That’s an example of resiliency in the sense of withstanding setbacks. But Elon Musk also provides an example of resiliency in the other sense of the term: not just withstanding setbacks, but also growing from them.   For instance, in 2017, when reports came out about the high rate of injury at his Tesla factory in Fremont, Musk made some unusual public pledges to his employees. One of them was that he would have one-on-one meetings with injured workers to learn about problems on the factory’s production line. Not only that, he would then perform their tasks himself to experience those problems firsthand. Thus, he turned the problems into a learning opportunity. We’ll look at how to cultivate your own inner Elon Musk in the next blink. So how do you become more resilient? Well, you can think of your resiliency as a mental muscle – something that, just like a physical muscle, can be developed with exercise. But first, it helps to stretch and relax the muscle. That means taking care of yourself emotionally, so you can alleviate your stress, anxiety and fear. This will allow you to be calmer in the face of adversity, which will help you make better decisions. Simple ways to do this include physical exercise, meditation, journaling, creating an action plan and talking things out with a friend or mentor. In the aftermath of situations that destabilize your mind with negative emotions, these activities can help you to restabilize. In a similar vein, you can also reconnect to aspects of your life that have a stabilizing effect on you. For example, even in the midst of professional turmoil, the author finds a sense of calm when playing with her children. So those are some ways you can stretch and relax your resiliency muscle. Now let’s look at the exercise part. One beneficial technique is to turn everyday setbacks into opportunities for exercise. For instance, the author once bought tickets to a Guns N’ Roses stadium concert for herself and a group of 20 colleagues. She thought it would be a great bonding experience. There was just one problem: it turned out that all of the seats were in different parts of the stadium! But rather than gnash her teeth at the setback, she decided to turn it into an opportunity for teamwork. She proposed that each member of the group try to trade their seats with a stranger, and then trade that new seat for another seat with a second stranger, and so forth and so on, until they were all sitting together. Not only did this gambit work, saving their concert experience; it also made that experience even richer than it would have otherwise been. Instead of just rocking out to songs like “Paradise City,” they also got to share a memorable team-building exercise and bonding experience. So next time a little adversity knocks down your building blocks, see if you can make a game out of rebuilding them into your own “Paradise City”! The fifth and final trait that leads to effective execution is the most decisive one of all. You can have the clearest, most compelling vision in the world, and you can pursue it with relentless passion, action and resilience – but you’re not going to get very far if you try to do everything alone. You need the help of other people, and that’s what the final trait is all about: relationships.   As the old saying goes, no man (or woman) is an island. All of us have limited time, energy, skills and knowledge. But by pooling these precious resources together, we can expand the range of what we can accomplish. If someone else lends you some of her time and energy, you’ll have more overall time and energy to expend on pursuing your vision. If someone lends you her skills and knowledge, you can fill in some of the gaps in your own skills and knowledge. And, of course, this goes both ways, leading to the potential for win-win relationships. The more of these relationships you establish and maintain, and the deeper those relationships become, the more you’ll be able benefit from the power of having other people in your life. It’s therefore crucial to cultivate a network of people with whom you can enjoy win-win relationships. To expand your network, look for people outside your immediate social vicinity. For example, if you work in a corporate environment, look for people not just outside your team, but also outside your company or even your industry. To deepen your relationships, take the time to show a sincere interest in getting to know these people better. Don’t just ask routine questions with yes-or-no answers, like “Did you have a good weekend?” Instead, ask deeper, open-ended questions, like “Where do you envision yourself in five years?” or “What’s your passion?” To maintain your relationships, make a habit of showing people appreciation through nice, thoughtful gestures. Emails saying “thank you” and “congratulations” are one good way of doing this – but handwritten notes are even better, since they feel more personal. And when you have spare moments, such as when you’re driving to work or riding in a taxi, you can use the time to reconnect with people by phone. However, not all relationships are worth maintaining – a topic we’ll turn to in the last blink. The ideal relationship is one that’s win-win, where both parties mutually benefit from each other. Sadly, however, many relationships are win-lose or even lose-lose. What’s more, some relationships that were once win-win descend into negative territory. In light of these facts, the author recommends conducting a periodic life audit of your relationships. Once a year, she sits down and reviews all of her relationships one-by-one, splitting them into two categories. The first category consists of positive people from whom she receives inspiration, support, energy and challenges that lead her to grow. The other category consists of negative people from whom she receives the opposite effects. It may sound cold, but she then makes a conscious decision to distance herself from the people she has placed in the second category. Moving forward, she spends less time with them or even cuts herself off from them if need be. Of course, some issues can be worked through, so she isn’t quick to write people off. She only places them in the second category if the issues seem intractable, at least for the foreseeable future. In the longer-term future, the person may change, in which case he can be welcomed back into the first category. She also recognizes that people can become temporarily negative because of difficult experiences, such as illness, the death of a loved one or a job loss. She refrains from placing these people into the negative category, since she knows they need the help of her own positivity to pull through to the other side and return to a more positive state of being. Finally, she also recognizes that in a workplace setting, you can’t just stop talking to a “coworker who has a negative effect on you.” Since you’re stuck working with them, you have to figure out a way of interacting with them to the best of your ability and minimizing the negativity as much as possible. However, with other relationships, you have more choice in the matter, and the author recommends taking advantage of that freedom. The point isn’t to eliminate all negativity from your life. That’s impossible. It’s simply to maximize the positivity and minimize the negativity, so that you can put yourself in a position to actively, resiliently and collaboratively pursue your passion and execute your vision so that it becomes a reality. The key message in these blinks: The execution factor is your ability to carry out plans of action that enable you to achieve your goals. It rests upon five traits: vision, passion, action, resilience and relationships. Each of these traits can be cultivated. Execution is therefore a skill that you can develop, enabling you to put yourself in a position to succeed.   Actionable advice: Practice applying the ideas of these blinks by conducting thought experiments. When beginning your journey toward developing the five traits described in these blinks, the author recommends starting with a simple exercise: imagine someone else who’s having a problem with one of the traits, and think about what kind of advice you would give her. For instance, imagine you have a friend who wants to quit her job and start her own company – but she just has a vague idea of what she wants to do, and she isn’t really prepared to pursue it. She doesn’t have a business plan, her savings are limited and she has a family to support. What would you advise her to do? You can do similar exercises with the other four traits. The exercises can help you to get the ball rolling with applying the ideas of these blinks to real-life scenarios, since it’s often easier to give advice to someone else than yourself. After all, to give advice, you need to be able to step back from a problem, establish some critical distance from it and then evaluate it from an outside-the-box perspective, which can be difficult to do with a personal problem that you’re psychologically tangled up with.

It’s an awful lot, so how do you take on this type of superwoman lifestyle? You prepare for a fifth trimester! Covering everything from breast pumping hacks to how to handle workplace jealousy, these blinks will give you hands-on, practical and inspirational advice on how to stay happily working while bearing the new title of “mother.” You’ll also find out how to handle your postpartum pooch; why you need to relinquish responsibility to your partner; and how not to act “mom-perior.” When the author, Lauren Smith Brody, returned to her job after having her first child, some things were going surprisingly well. She was getting her work done, earning enough money to pay the nanny, arriving home on time and getting rather efficient at using the breast pump. But when she stopped to look at herself in the mirror, it was a different story. The author found it difficult to cope with her “postpartum pooch” and the desire to get back to looking “normal.” But she also found that her worries were alleviated when she put extra effort into taking care of herself and her appearance. Research has shown that self-compassion is an important part of reducing the toxic self-critical view that new mothers often have. So the more you make sure to nurture yourself, the more confident you’ll start to feel. Perhaps, like the author’s friend, you might benefit from putting a confidence-boosting message on the top corner of your mirror so that you can read it to yourself in the morning. The right clothes can also help. Nitzia Logothetis is a psychotherapist and the founder of the Seleni Institute for Maternal Mental Health. She recommends avoiding ill-fitting outfits and wearing clothes that reflect how you want to feel. New moms will start to feel more confident and put-together when they look in the mirror and see someone who’s well dressed. You might be thinking: If only I had time to spend on choosing outfits and applying makeup! Well, believe it or not, there are ways to improve your appearance that don’t take up too much time. First of all, stay hydrated. Drinking lots of water will help diminish the dark circles under your eyes caused by lack of sleep. There are also eye creams containing algae that work wonders for those dark circles, and with a little practice you can get a quick makeup routine down to around a minute! Most new moms would love to have a partner that they can depend on – someone who’ll both be there for them and take on half of the childcare duties. However, many first-time mothers don’t trust their partner to be able to care for the new baby. In a survey of new moms, the author found that 49 percent believed their partner would need at least seven weeks before being up to the task. But she also found that these moms were underestimating their partner’s abilities. As it turned out, those partners were ready, willing and able, without delay, 76 percent of the time. So before you underestimate your mate, know that many dads are ready to quickly step up to the challenge. According to Carolyn Pirak, who studies marriage longevity as director of the Bringing Baby Home Program, many mothers doubt their partner’s abilities due to unresolved guilt about not being able to take care of everything themselves. So instead of falling into this trap, remind yourself that it’s okay to let go of some of the responsibility and trust that your partner will pick up the slack. Trusting your partner will be especially important when you’re ready to get back to work, so keep these helpful tips in mind: When learning new childcare skills, such as baby CPR, take classes with your partner. Research suggests that doing new things together strengthens the bonds of a relationship. And being next to him as the two of you master new skills together will be reassuring when the time comes for you to head back to work. It’s easy to doubt your partner’s abilities when you’re observing him and second guessing his every decision. But when you’re not around, all you can do is trust. So you might find it helpful to think of returning to work as an emergency situation, which often isn’t far from the truth. In emergencies, it’s often easier to let go and accept the fact that you won’t be in total control. When the end of your maternity leave arrives, your precious little bundle of joy will have spent much of the past months snuggled up against your chest. Separating yourself and putting your child into day care can be downright terrifying, and the only way you’ll be able to think about work is to make sure you’re dealing with a good facility. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has a helpful summary of the top three concerns for making sure a potential day-care facility will have a positive impact on your child. When a baby is between six and 18 months old, its day care should have no more than three children per adult staff member, with a maximum of six kids per group. All staff members should have a certificate in child development or a university degree in a similar field. No one’s education should be limited to a high school diploma. The staff should also demonstrate “positive caregiving,” which means having a cheerful attitude toward children and day care in general. This should involve activities like singing and reading and the use of positive words to praise and encourage good behavior. Once day care begins, it’s important to remember that feelings of jealousy about someone looking after your child are absolutely normal. You might even hear your child call the caregiver “mommy,” but there’s no need to worry. All young children have a strong tendency to seek close bonds with those caring for them and it doesn’t mean you’re being replaced. In fact, it’s important that the child have a day-care worker who’s consistently there, as opposed to a new one every week or month. Research shows that a steady presence allows children to feel calm and secure – so it’ll be best for your child, and for you, if he or she can develop a bond with a steady caregiver. If you’re anything like the author, one of your primary concerns about returning to work is breastfeeding. Statistics show that around 83 percent of working moms return to their jobs while still breastfeeding. A breast pump can solve the problem, but you’ll first have to consider what kind of equipment you’ll need and how much time and milk you’ll need to put aside. In taking a poll of new mothers who were determined to breastfeed and work at the same time, the author found that the average mom could comfortably pump milk for the first eleven months. But in order to go down this route, you’ll need the right equipment and clothes. The best setup is to get two breast pumps – one for work and one for home. You may think it’s a waste of money now, but after the first few times you forget to bring it to work, you’ll realize that two breast pumps will bring peace of mind and save you a lot of needless running around. As for extra equipment, you’ll need ice packs to keep things fresh and a good supply of backup storage bags so you’re not suddenly stuck without a place to put your milk. When you’re at work, the right clothes are important as well. Button down shirts and wrap dresses are the two easiest ways to allow for quick and easy access. The clothes to avoid are dresses that zip at the back and anything made out of silk, which is an unforgiving material for the sometimes messy business of pumping. You’ll also need a good amount of room in your freezer for your supply of breast milk, as it’s recommended to try and keep a two-day supply in there at all times. With a two-day supply always being kept frozen you won’t have to worry about common mishaps, like your daytime caregiver accidentally using up next day’s supply and giving your baby too much milk. With a two day supply in the freezer you’ll still have enough, even if this were to happen. It’s also smart to start using the bottle before you return to work, so that your child has time to get accustomed to it. Many first-time moms don’t look forward to their first day back at work. If you’re one of these, here’s a statistic you might find comforting: In 2015, a Harvard Business School study showed that children of working mothers grow up to be kinder and more ambitious. Still, even this thought might not drown out the voice in your head that’s saying how much you’d rather be with your child than stuck at work Monday through Friday. So it’s a good idea to keep in mind the benefits your job provides. The largest predictor of whether a new mom will return to her previous job after maternity leave isn’t her occupation, her seniority or how much her husband earns. It’s how rewarding she finds her job. If you’re feeling resentful toward your job, think about the reasons you started your job in the first place. Was it the work? The people? The confidence or self-esteem it provides? Whatever the reason, see if you can’t draw on it when you get the urge to quit. Another helpful piece of advice is to return to work slowly. Instead of jumping back in full-time, see if you can’t extend your maternity leave by returning part-time and easing your way back to a normal schedule over a number of weeks. This can greatly reduce your chances of quitting. Indeed, studies show that women who take shorter maternity leaves experience more “daily reentry regrets.” And the more regrets women have, the more likely they are to quit. A gradual return, on the other had, has shown to be a great help in getting new moms to refocus their attention back on their job. So once you’ve made it back to work, you can expect to pick up right where you left off, right? If only it were that simple. Even when the author polled working mothers, 30 percent admitted that, before they had their child, they resented coworkers who returned to work after having a baby. You might think it best to ignore your colleagues’ opinions of your situation, but this isn’t wise. Instead, it’s best to understand why this resentment is common and practice some give and take. New moms are often resented at work because their coworkers think they receive special treatment and can pop off whenever a baby-related situation arises. No one wants to come across as being “the needy one” on a team, so it’s best to establish your trust and strong work ethic with colleagues. One of the best ways to do this is to make sure they know you’ll be eager to repay any favors you may need to ask due to sudden family emergencies. The wrong way is to start acting superior, or “mom-perior,” by suggesting that all other jobs are child’s play compared to the job of motherhood. This will only ensure that your childless colleagues resent you. Instead, remember that others have responsibilities that are just as important to them as your new baby is to you. If you get time off due to your new child, don’t encourage any jealousy or animosity by making it seem especially important. Be transparent and honest about it, and remind them that they will get the same treatment if they need to tend to a sick family member or spend some time in the hospital. Emotional transparency is a good practice as well. Pretending like motherhood is all cute photos and giggling babies can encourage jealousy or resentment. So be sure to share the stories of sleepless nights, filthy changing stations and stained clothes, too. Equipped with these tips, you should be on your way to re-entering the workforce as smoothly as can be expected.  The key message in this book: It is absolutely normal to feel overwhelmed by the prospect of returning to work after having a baby. Many new moms find it an extremely emotional and challenging time; however, there are practical steps you can take to reduce stress and make your return as smooth as possible. Among these concerns are preparing your breast pumping routine, finding the right day care and managing your colleagues’ expectations. In addition, it’s important to give yourself time and attention to reduce postpartum depression and maintain a healthy relationship with your body, your baby and your partner.  Actionable advice: Use the 60-second escape plan. With a new baby in tow, you might have to spend a lot of time in the morning, before work, looking after it.

They live from paycheck to paycheck, hoping their credit cards don’t get refused and trying not to think too much about their overdraft. That shouldn’t come as a great surprise. Today’s aspirational society encourages consumption, while simultaneously providing next to no financial education. For many young people, the only financial advice they see are tone-deaf articles about rash millennials buying so much avocado toast that they can’t afford to buy a house (conveniently forgetting the matter of their crushing student debt in the process). If you, too, feel a bit helpless when it comes to money – budgeting, saving, investing and securing your financial future – then these blinks are for you. They will help you take small but important steps toward getting your finances in order, and will show you that being financially savvy isn’t just about boring budget spreadsheets and savings accounts – it’s also about learning to cook well, take care of yourself and nurture your career. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to make a simple budget to understand your financial income and spending; why a dollar spent and a dollar saved are not of the same value; and how to get paid what you deserve. If you’re lost at sea when it comes to money, maybe it’s best to start your financial diet nice and slow. There are four “don’t you dare” rules that we can all remember and follow; if you do so, you’ll have taken a big step toward steadying your finances. First, don’t you dare spend money on credit if you can’t pay it off within a month. Sure, credit cards have their benefits – they can help build a credit score and get you air miles. But if you have one, treat it like a debit card. The day you spend money you can’t pay back in a month is the day you sabotage your financial health, because that’s when the interest starts to accrue. Second, don’t you dare fall into the CEO lifestyle. When the author first became CEO of her own enterprise, it changed her thinking. Suddenly she would think, “I deserve this $150 facial, because a CEO’s gotta look good, right?” We all convince ourselves that we need certain things to live the lifestyle we want, whether that means an iced latte every day, or a taxi home instead of the subway. The reality is that we don’t need these things, so we should get over them. Spend according to the budget you have, not for the lifestyle you think you should be living. Third, don’t you dare go a week without checking your bank balance at least twice. Just like a reluctant dieter avoids looking at the caloric content of the cake they are devouring, lots of people in poor financial situations just can’t bring themselves to look at their account balance. You can’t get on a financial diet until you confront the reality of your income and spending, however gruesome it might look the first time you check. And finally, don’t you dare imagine that savings will just magically appear. When you are young, it’s easy to think of your current self and your future self as two completely different people, and pass the responsibility for saving on to “future me.” Many people think that merely staying out of debt is enough and they can worry about savings in the future. But the fact of the matter is, there is only one you – and you need to start saving, even if it’s just a little, right now. Follow these rules and you’ll already be avoiding a lot of common mistakes. But to really get to grips with your financial diet, you need to learn how to budget. One of the fun things about being an adult is the freedom it brings – to stay up late, or to spend your money exactly how you like. That freedom is a rush, and constructing a strict budget for yourself might feel restrictive. But without one, you will be forever financially lost. So the first, most important step in your financial diet is to establish what money is coming in and going out. There are lots of useful apps you can use to do this, like Mint or You Need a Budget, but you can also just make a simple spreadsheet. Whatever you choose, start by entering all your income after tax, like your salary or freelance earnings. Next, enter all of your expenditures. Do this for at least the last two months, and do it honestly, including all expenses – everything from your rent check to that Diet Coke you bought yesterday. And finally, add any savings you have put aside, like money going into a retirement fund. Once you’ve done this, you can start to analyze the results. How much are you spending on food each month? And how much on late-night online shopping? Could you be paying off your debt quicker? Is that $80 a month takeaway coffee habit really worth sacrificing potential savings of $960 a year? Simply analyzing your budget should lead you to some sensible conclusions about your financial behavior. But it can also be helpful to introduce a system to guide your future behavior. The 50/30/20 plan is a simple way to ensure that your spending is under control and your savings are at a sensible level. Here, 50 percent of your income should go on fixed costs, like your rent and utilities. Thirty percent should go to lifestyle or variable costs, like your groceries, travel and nights out. And finally, 20 percent should be saved. This system works well because it gives an easy-to-understand framework against which to judge your expenditures. If you see that you are spending 40 percent of your income on lifestyle expenditures, and only saving 10 percent, you know you need to make a few adjustments. Everyone’s breakdown will be a little different – some might only spend 40 percent on their fixed costs, for instance – but the crucial step is coming to grips with the basics: how much money is coming in and what it’s being spent on. Only then can you start to think about getting more value out of the money you have. Ask yourself a question: are you working for your money, or is your money working for you? If you are stuck thinking about working for your money, it’s time to become your money’s boss. Make it work for you, as soon and as much as possible, by investing it. Whether you are able to put away a dollar a day or ten, you should start doing so as soon as you can. Being young is a secret shortcut to increasing your wealth, because it means that your money has more time to multiply. To understand how this happens, you need the rule of 72. The rule of 72 shows how long it will take any investment to double in value. You just need to divide the number 72 by the annual interest rate, or return, you’ll receive on any investment or savings account. That gives you the number of years until your original money is doubled. For example, investments with a return of 7 percent will double your money in 10.28 years. So, invest $1,000 in a fund returning 7 percent a year, and in a decade you’ll have $2,000, without you needing to do any work for it. Now that you understand how your money can work for you, you realize that a dollar saved and invested is not the same as a dollar spent. Let’s say you are thinking about spending $100 on a new dress. The dress is nice, but you can now see that your choice is not between spending the $100 or saving $100; it’s between spending $100 now, or having $200 in ten years time, $400 in 20 years time and $800 in 30 years time. So if you think investing is something that only old people do, don’t be fooled. Being young gives you an advantage when it comes to investing: the sooner you start, the more time your money has to multiply. Next, let’s take a look at what you should be doing with your money in practice. For many of us, thinking about investing conjures up images of men on a trading floor, shouting into telephones as they frantically buy and sell stocks and bonds. The good news is that the reality of investing is very different and much simpler than that. But before diving in, there are two things you need to do. First, build an emergency fund. In addition to always having a little money in your standard checking account for everyday expenses, you should also have an emergency fund covering at least three months of living costs. You never know when you might get sick, have your house flooded or experience some other disaster that requires some immediate cash. Second, pay off your debt, especially if it charges more interest than you could receive by putting the money in savings or investments. If you’re earning a 3 percent return on your investments, but paying 4 percent on your credit card or student debt, that’s a net loss. Once you’ve sorted these two steps, you are set to invest. The best starting point is probably a retirement account, like a 401(k). That’s because, up to a certain amount, your employer will likely match the contributions that you make. And that means free money! If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) contributions, then you could start to look at IRAs – Individual Retirement Accounts – which allow you to invest and then deduct the investment on your taxes. More free money! Once you’ve got to grips with 401(k)s and IRAs, a whole world of investing awaits. You can, for example, invest in low-risk funds like index funds, which track overall performance of an index like the New York Stock Exchange’s Dow Jones. Or, if you feel confident enough, you could start to pick individual stocks to buy. But to start with, keep things simple and speak to your HR advisor at work about your 401(k). It’s likely they’ll be able to give one-to-one advice as to what options are available to you – and if not, there are plenty of free financial workshops out there. Before you know it, you’ll be a full-fledged investor who can sit back and relax, happy in the knowledge that your money is working for you. Setting money aside in a fund isn’t the only way to invest in your future; you can also expand your career horizons or build your skill set and experiences. A great way to do so is to find a mentor who can help you. One of the author’s early mentors was Joanne Cleaver, a journalist and entrepreneur. Cleaver argues that networking is a key to building a successful and satisfying career, because being known by the right people for the right things always pays off in the long run. One great way to network, Cleaver says, is to volunteer. Sure, working for free sounds tough. But think of it as working for yourself, with the payoff coming a little further down the road. When Cleaver worked for a city newspaper, she offered to help out with its annual charity drive. She mocked up a newspaper front page with tear-jerking stories about their city and how donations could address them. The result? The newsroom donated more cash than ever before. Weeks later, Cleaver found herself invited to the newspaper’s president’s suite. The president loved the mock-up so much that she’d printed out a bunch to share with all the other executives, establishing an instant reputation and goodwill for Cleaver. But no matter how great a networker you are, your financial health will always struggle if you don’t get appropriate compensation for your work. Negotiating your salary can be a little scary, but it’s also one of the most powerful ways to improve your financial health. Thankfully, these days it’s easy to find out a benchmark salary for any job simply by searching websites such as PayScale and Glassdoor, asking people in the relevant industry or even just going on Reddit and anonymously asking the world at large. Once you have a clear view of what you are worth, go into any compensation conversation prepared to negotiate, not accept, an opening offer. Remember that negotiation is an indicator of confident professionalism, so stay positive, always ask for time to consider an offer and never act overly impressed with what’s on the table. Get this right and you’re on track for a financially healthy work life. But there’s more to life than work, so let’s take a look at another aspect of a successful financial diet – your actual diet. Many millennials have a strange relationship with food. It’s not necessarily that they eat badly, but they are more likely to slave over a fancy recipe found on Pinterest than to rustle up something simple from leftovers in the fridge; they’re also more familiar with local takeout menus than with good, honest, everyday cooking. This approach to food can cost you. It costs you the pleasure of eating a simple home-cooked meal and, of course, it costs you financially. So if you’ve done your budget and are horrified by how much you’re spending on food, maybe you could learn a little from Italian grandmothers. The typical Italian grandmother is always whipping up something delicious, not based on what she’s just seen on Instagram, but based on what ingredients are in season, what’s in the cupboard and what’s about to go off and needs to be used. She cooks in large quantities, freezes what she can and is focused on everything in moderation rather than any dieting fad. So how can you achieve that Italian grandmother status? The most important thing is to stock your kitchen properly. It’s crucial to stop thinking of individual recipes – like what you need to recreate the Bang Bang chicken you ate in a restaurant last week – and start thinking in terms of what you need to make sure you can always cook something at home. If you’ve got good olive oil, some salt and pepper, dried chilis, spices, herbs, garlic and onions at home, then when you find yourself with nothing but a leftover eggplant and some tomatoes in the fridge, you’ll have everything you need for a delicious pasta sauce. Being able to throw something together is a great life skill that will not only enable you to eat well, all the time; it also means fewer costly trips to the grocery store for a specific set of ingredients. Oh, and one last thing: never, ever go shopping while drunk, upset or hungry – that’s a surefire recipe for abandoning your nutritional and financial diets. Think of money not as a way to buy happiness, but as a way to buy a happiness construction kit. It can’t buy you inner peace, but it can buy you the comfort and security you need to take risks and pursue your ambitions. Even then, it can be hard to maintain a sane approach to money, your future and your life fulfillment. But here’s how you can. First, don’t dream big – dream medium. Society today, and social media in particular, is relentlessly aspirational. Pinterest and Instagram posts constantly tell us, via a message written over an image of a tropical beach or a yacht in azure blue seas, that if we just work hard enough and follow our dreams, we can achieve anything. The reality is that for most of us, that simply isn’t true. Maybe the Yale-graduate trust-funder has enough cash in the bank to dream big and launch a start-up. For the single mom holding down two jobs and paying off $35,000 of student loans, things look a little different. So there’s no shame, and a lot of sense, in dreaming medium – pursuing your goals in earnest but with a touch of realism about what is and what isn’t possible at any given time. That means making conscious decisions about when and where in life you want to take risks, and when it makes sense to play it safe. When you do decide to take a risk, like moving to a new city or changing careers, try to think things through and plan in advance, both financially and logistically. Second, be open about money. It’s odd, but even in today’s era of constant communication, people simply don’t like to talk about money. The author’s friend, Anna Breslaw, has said that while she was an editor at Cosmopolitan for two years, she received hundreds of intimate questions and requests for advice from readers – but she almost never heard anything about money. People, it seems, are more comfortable talking about anal sex than their salaries. But just like your sex life probably won’t improve if you never talk about it, neither will your attitude to money. Once you feel able to talk freely and openly about money, to your friends or your partner, you’ll notice improvements. You’ll be more confident professionally, more demanding toward yourself and more attuned to what is and isn’t healthy. If you can achieve that, then the financial diet will have worked for you. The key message in these blinks: Money helps you build the life you really want to have, now and in the future. That doesn’t mean you have to obsess about it or build your life around it. But it does mean that you should make sure you understand how to manage money, make it work for you and ensure that your financial situation supports rather than prevents you from achieving your dreams.  Actionable advice: Create a home that makes you feel good.  If you feel good about your home, you’ll be more happy spending time in it, meaning more life satisfaction and less expensive nights out. Mastering some basic home skills – like changing light bulbs, assembling and revamping furniture or hanging a picture on the wall – will pay off big time, as they will lower the bar to making home improvements. The great news is there are plenty of resources online. So, the next time you need to put up some shelves, check on Youtube before you call in help. Got feedback?

Do you want to create a business or a creative enterprise, but don’t want to lose sight of your true self? Many of us are blocked by these kinds of dilemmas, but the truth is, we are blocking ourselves – because success and our values are compatible. But all great things come at a price. What you’ll need is the self-knowledge to stick to your true self and the marketing skills to make it in the big business world. You’ll need to be prepared to dive into the depths of your being, into places you’re scared to go – and you’ll need to learn how to take control of your life to achieve your peak potential. In these blinks, you will: discover the tools for success and how you can get results the fastest: by being true to yourself, learn how you can discover your true self, and how to lever your innate potential to your advantage, find practical exercises that will help you discover who you really are and how to set your creativity on fire, and find out why it’s sometimes better to ask for less money for your hard work. For many of us our day to day work is a draining necessity. Mentally, a lot of us are limping through our lives. But don’t despair; there are ways to reignite your spark. Start by discovering what lights you up – because this is usually where your true strengths lie. Think of Michael Jordan playing basketball: people just couldn’t figure out how he could be one of the best players in the world and make it look so easy and fun. Yet, although he was a brilliant sportsman, Jordan failed miserably when he decided to retire from professional basketball and play professional baseball instead. Why? Simply because baseball was not his main talent, and he didn’t particularly enjoy it. When he returned to basketball, he excelled once again, showing that when you choose the right job, it lights you up. If you want to discover your true talent, try thinking of all the things that you are good at. For example, what activities do you truly enjoy? When do you feel truly at ease with yourself? Write the answers down – and if you’re at a loss for words, try asking your best friend. You might end up with a long list of things you are good at. But if you want to be successful, you need to start picking your battles, instead of trying to be good at everything. Let’s say you are a pretty good cook, but get really stressed when preparing a meal. You might think that you can make it as a professional cook if you just practiced some more, but in fact, it’s actually more likely you’re not made for the job. Instead of mobilizing all the energy to get better at something which doesn’t flow, try cultivating another of your strengths until you find one that feels right. Most of us learn early on that we have to work our asses off to meet other peoples’ expectations. But in fact that is the Myth of Endurance that keeps us from choosing the easy, efficient and self-compassionate life. Truth is, choosing an easy route in life is more effective. Creativity coach Dyana Valentine says: “If it doesn’t feel easy and juicy, then you’re automatically dropping your operation percentage down to about 80 to 70 percent.” However, Valentine’s reasoning does not mean you should take the “cheap easy” route. Cheap easy is for example staying in a stifling relationship because it seems easier than facing the heartbreak. Instead, the easy route is about examining your best assets: which topics do you already know a lot about? For example, if you are already doing taxes for all your friends and neighbours – and you actually like doing it – why not try to incorporate your love for numbers into your everyday life? To learn more about your easy route, take out a piece of paper and write out your To-Do List for the next week. Which of these points are you good at? Which of these fill you with enthusiasm? Your easy route will also involve enthusiasm and Bright Faith. Enthusiasm means that you feel a deep enjoyment when you do what you do. When you’re enthusiastic, you’re fully present with the task at hand – anything less is not worth doing. This means choosing your projects carefully: “If it isn’t a ‘Hell yes!,’ then it’s a no!” And if you are truly enthusiastic about something, you can experience Bright Faith. When you have Bright Faith in an idea, you are certain that you are at the right place at the right time, and that life will come through for you. You’ll feel that you’re on the right track, and you’re not wasting your time on unimportant and time-consuming tasks. Are you one of those super-productive people who have to-do lists, quarterly objectives and five-year goals? If so, do these lists actually make you happy? More often than not, they don’t. Why? Because often our goal planning procedures are upside down. Instead of thinking of the results, we should try and figure out how we want to feel. While you are busy picking goals – e.g. chasing the house, the boat and the mate – you might lose sight of what you are really going for: what you hope these things will make you feel. Consider this: what would change if you first decided what you want to feel like, and then wrote your to-do-list? For example, if you want to feel affluent, then do the things that make you feel affluent: you will naturally attract more experiences that make you feel that way. So ask yourself: what can you do today, right now, to feel the way you want to feel? Say you want to feel more affluent, you could, for example, make your monthly donation for a good cause a week earlier or treat a friend to a glass of wine. However, many of us already know how we want to feel, but we think we don’t deserve to feel that way. To overcome this inner block, you’ll need to stop judging your feelings. Stop feeling guilty about your wants and needs. Instead of overanalyzing your emotions, listen to what they are telling you! For example, one of Laporte’s clients wanted to feel important, but always asked herself: “Isn’t it wrong to want to feel that way? Isn’t it arrogant?” She was judging her feelings, when instead her focus should be on what would make her feel important. In the end she followed her heart, and stopped taking on clients who made her feel small – and her business took off at the same time as her happiness. In the following blinks, you’ll find out how to get on your way to success. What do you say when you get asked the most notorious party question: “So, what do you do?” More importantly, how does your answer make you feel? In fact, a lot of people have cocktail lines that make them feel bad. Think of all the people you’ve met who answered with a monotone voice and a bored look when you asked about their work. Having a good answer to this question will not only make you feel good; it’ll also help your business: anyone you talk to will notice if you’re truly excited about your job, or if you’re just in it for the money. So instead of sounding like you’re bored with your life, your cocktail line should express what you do in a confident manner. But what does a good cocktail line sound like? Answer: be genuine, but positive. Actually it doesn’t matter what you do: if you run an ice cream truck or if you’re a primetime TV producer; when you state what you do with a sparkle in your eyes, you’ll seem authentic and at ease with yourself. Take LaPorte’s client for example, who started out by simply introducing herself as “an athletic coach.”But she wasn’t just an athletic coach! Consider her cocktail line after she had worked on it: “I have an athletic performance company called Power Racing. My coaching team and I design training programs for athletes [...] but we do take on other types of cross athletes [...]. It’s part science, part motivation.” Can you see, how she manages to convey her enthusiasm? And what’s more, she’s not exaggerating, but simply stating the facts. To create your own awesome cocktail line, here are simple questions you can ask yourself: What about your work makes you feel powerful, passionate, free and excited? How does your work make a difference to people’s lives? And how would you like to be seen, recognized, acknowledged, awarded and praised? When you’ve truly messed something up, it is easy to dwell on what you did wrong. In fact, some of us are still living our worst failures, defeats and break-ups over and over again. But how does that mindset help you? The truth is, the mishaps of the past have only one useful feature: what you can learn from them. When people are stuck in the past, they usually have a hard time envisioning a positive future. Take Jack, for example, who, after being asked to describe his “ideal relationship” went on and on about his ex wife and other failed relationships! That pattern is a sure path to remaining negative – and single. But you don’t have to stay stuck in the past: you can learn from your biggest mistakes by thinking about them and writing them down. Ask yourself what you’ve truly learned from them. Then vow to purge yourself of your negative ruminations – maybe even burn the sheet of paper you’ve written on! Purging the past in this way can also help you open yourself to new dreams. You can do this by hosting a dream funeral. Consider Alexandra’s tradition: every New Year’s Eve her family wrote down and buried beliefs, feelings, and dreams that they needed to let go, because they weren’t useful anymore! Once you’re rid of your old dreams, you’re ready to write down a new dream and visualize it. Start by getting yourself into an excited, thrilled state and write your dream list! Go for outrageous, beyond reason dreams. When you’ve got your vision, start visualizing your success and the results. Visualize how the world would feel like if you had already accomplished your dream. Have you ever had a vision of where you wanted to go, but were too afraid to make it a reality? Don’t worry, you’re not alone – and this blink will help you overcome your fear. Try and prioritize your positive feelings by imagining you are a team coach giving your emotions a pep talk before the game: “So, how is everyone feeling?” Enthusiasm will be right there: “I can’t wait to get playing.” But fear will stand up: “Are you crazy? I will never play again if I lose this game!” This is your time to step in, so the fear doesn’t take over: “All right, you have some good points and we appreciate your point of view. But let’s listen to the others: Enthusiasm, you are in front, Confidence will have your back. Fear, you will be playing from the bench.” One major fuel for fear is criticism – but there are ways to handle criticism in a constructive way: First of all, simply breathe. In order to avoid reacting rashly, it is important that your brain gets enough oxygen. Then admit that criticism hurts. When you’re honest about it – “Wow, that’s hard to hear. But I’m up for it.” – you level the playing field between yourself and the critic, and make yourself seem very mature. Next, don’t react immediately. It’s better to let it sink in and get back to the critic tomorrow. This way you can avoid saying things you don’t mean, and concentrate on the things you want to say the most. Finally, don’t take any nonsense. LaPorte once got a very bad performance review from a manager at a retail job. But she stood her ground and complained to her manager’s boss. As it turned out, she wasn’t the only one who had problems with the manager. In the end, her complaint led to a promotion – and the manager leaving the company. Other people are a blessing and a burden to us all: while some encounters can be very rewarding, others can be very stressful – especially when people try to play you. So how can we distinguish the good from the bad? More often than not, your first impression of a person is correct, which means that when you meet someone new, you should trust your gut. There’s even an old Buddhist saying that sums up this idea for LaPorte: “As in the beginning, so in the middle, so in the end.” For example, LaPorte once hired a consultant who stood her up on the first meeting. Two days later, he called to reschedule and neither apologized nor explained – but LaPorte hired him anyway, because she thought he was the only good consultant in town. However, he kept standing her up in one way or the other, and soon enough, the relationship fell apart. LaPorte knew something was wrong from the beginning, but forgot to listen to her gut. To deal with people well, we also need to know when to walk away. Sometimes we don’t walk away soon enough because we blindly stick to our principles, which can cost us money, time – and most importantly – inner peace. For example, LaPorte was tangled in a messy contract with some TV producers, which led to a lot of conflict. The disputes escalated, and because of her principles, she didn’t want to let it all go, and decided to take legal action. She didn’t care about the money – what bothered her was that they were intentionally trying to rip her off. However, her lawyer kindly reminded her that she had seen clients drag this kind of case on for months, making themselves sick, wrecking their marriages or draining their finances – just for their principles. So she gave LaPorte some great advice: “Get on with your life!” In the following blinks, you’ll learn more about creating real results. All of us have that voice hidden inside of us: the voice of our inner muse that comes alive when you listen to its call. Next time you hear it whispering, try paying close attention – and watch your creativity flow. For example, you can try doing what the author Richard Bach does, and give your muse a name: he calls his “the idea fairy.” She visits him either when he is gardening or when he is flying in a plane. That’s why he learned how to pilot his own plane – and soon he found ideas for his books amongst the clouds. You too should pay attention to when and where your inner muse strikes you the most. You can then recreate the optimal working conditions your muse needs to visit you often. Another way of helping your inner muse shine is by sharpening your brand. Sharpening your brand means making your key attributes clear, and identifying which of those attributes are most vital to your success. You can then focus on what is important to boost your creativity. For example, let’s imagine you’re a carpenter who has recently lost his or her sense of purpose. If you were to examine the driving force behind your craft, you might discover that your purpose is to make people feel comfortable in their homes. Now that you’ve sharpened the purpose behind your brand, you can use that energy to revitalize your muse and your creativity. And when your muse is shining, you’ll probably notice it by the amount of new clients you get! If the character of your inner muse and brand does not come easy to you, try interviewing a close friend and ask the following questions: What do you think is my greatest strength? What do you feel my purpose is? When have you seen me really shine? Like many others, you might have tried a plethora of time management systems over the years without finding one that fits you right. This trend is common because, although systems can be useful for running our lives, they can also enslave us. For example, obsessive time management can be like an overly strict diet that helps us lose unwanted weight, but in the long run doesn’t keep the weight off. Why? Because at first you might feel the system makes you more productive, but after a while things start falling apart, and you feel even worse than before. Or you want to rebel against your system because you’ve started to feel that your system is the boss of you – and not the other way around! There is a way, however, to become better time managers without a system. What we need is to understand our time personality – and learn how to change it. You might be a Time Cop, the kind who always counts the minutes, and is always on time. This tendency makes you very dependable, but on the other hand, it can make you feel stressed all the time. Then there’s the Time Slacker, the kind who says: “I’m only five minutes late; what’s the problem?” This tendency can make you feel less pressured, but can quickly annoy others because they are always waiting for you. To get the best of both worlds you need to learn how to change aspects of your time personality. For example, if you are a Time Cop, you can refuse to rush and still be on time: try scheduling periods of free time, which you can use to unwind; or get rid of appointments that aren’t really important and focus on those that generate value for you. What truly matters to you? Wealth, reputation, happiness? The answers vary wildly from person to person, and drive us down all kinds of paths – but when you don’t even know yourself, you can feel like you’re running in circles. To find out what truly matters, you should get an idea of what you actually need money for. If you have a clear idea of what you want from life, you will have a clear purpose for your money. For example, do you want to have a house and car? Do you crave stability? Do you want a long holiday, or do you want to be free? Try to get as clear a purpose as possible by asking yourself the following questions: What do you consider luxurious? What do you love spending money on? What do you wildly resent paying for? When, where, and how are you cheap? When, where, and how are you generous? Even though money is important to live a good life, sometimes it’s better to charge less – if that’s what feels right. Consider Violet, a friend of LaPorte, who got hired at a nonprofit company with a comfortable starting salary. Shortly afterwards, the company hired an older expert for his asking price. Although Violet was his boss, she now made 35 percent less than him – which mean the NGO felt obligated to pay Violet more. But Violet now felt she was earning too much money: she would rather have earned her raise because of her own performance, and not from something that she didn’t do herself. So she asked to go back to her old wage – and she felt a lot better for it. Do you have a group of friends or co-workers that make you feel totally at ease? Then you have already found your tribe – and you’ll know how valuable it is. If you don’t have a tribe already, try to get an idea of which kind of people inspire you. Who do you really want to work with? What do they need to believe in? For example, LaPorte once worked with a woman who believed that trust had to be earned. She wouldn’t trust people unless they’d proven themselves worthy of her trust, and therefore withheld information as a negotiation tool. This personality trait made LaPorte realize that she wanted to work with happy, trusting people instead. So she made a new rule for her friends and teammates: if you want to work with me, you’ve got to believe that a trusting heart is a strong heart. But your tribe isn’t everything in life: you also need strong personal relationships. And one time-tested way of strengthening your relationships is to start giving more freely. Most of us have already experienced how generosity can strengthen our relationships: an unexpected moment of connection with a stranger who did us a kind deed, or the smile we saw on our partner’s face when they came home to find a beautiful meal all prepared for them. Try harnessing this power to deepen your relationships. For example, next time you see your partner, bring him or her an unexpected gift. Or buy the next round of drinks next time you’re out with your pals – you’ll be surprised how grateful they’ll be! The key message in this book: You don’t have to comply with other people’s definition of success. Instead, stick to your true self and learn how to make it in the world of business. Define yourself through your strengths; embrace the future by letting go of the past; and learn how to boost your creativity by listening to your inner muse. Actionable advice: Your gut knows best. The next time you have a bad feeling about a business partner, listen to that feeling. Your gut is trying to tell you something – and more often than not, your gut knows best. Listen to your fear – then tell it you don’t care. Next time you are scared of a big project, listen to your fear and what it’s telling you. After making sure your fear has been heard, make sure you do not let it stop you. If you are really enthusiastic about something, concentrate on that project. And if you let your enthusiasm guide you, your fear will eventually lose its grip.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Burger and Michael Starbird","summary":"After reading these blinks, you’ll \nLose your fear of failure. You’ll be able to take on challenging endeavors fearlessly. In fact, you’ll embrace failure as a way of learning new things that you can then apply elsewhere too. \nBecome a more inquisitive and critical thinker. You’ll ignite your inner curiosity and learn to ask more questions - even ones that you already know the answer to - and this will deepen your understanding of the subject. \nBe able to find outside-the-box solutions to problems. You’ll learn how to look beyond the obvious, generally-accepted solutions and find completely new approaches to problems.\n What’s the best way to develop a true understanding of something? Should you learn as much as possible about a subject, for instance? Actually, no. The key to developing a true understanding of an issue is to master the basics. The basics make up the foundation of any skill or talent, the core of any expertise – just like the element Earth represents the solid ground underneath our feet. Often a person who wants to become an expert – such as a student cramming for an important exam – will attempt to master as many complex theories or facts as she possibly can at once. This isn’t the best strategy, however. True experts are instead concerned with continually and constantly perfecting the basics. Virtuoso trumpet player Tony Plog once gave a masterclass for accomplished soloists, in which he requested that they play their most challenging, virtuosic piece. As you’d expect, they all played incredibly well. In response, rather than offering advice and tips about how the performances could be improved, Plog asked the soloists to then perform a simple beginner’s exercise. While they played the exercise well, none played impressively. Once they were finished, Plog himself performed the exercise, astonishing the group as to how virtuosic this “basic” piece was played. What happened? Plog knew that mastery requires constant attention to and understanding of the basics, as it’s the basics that provide the foundation on which we can improve. So when you’re faced with a challenging task, don’t tackle it headlong immediately. First, consider the basic elements of the task, and through this, you can attack each simpler element successfully. Consider how the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) met the challenge of landing a man on the moon in the 1960s. The agency didn’t accomplish this goal by immediately shooting people into space; rather, they started with sending an unmanned rocket to the moon first. Only once NASA had accomplished this basic step did they pursue and succeed in their goal of sending a man to the moon. For years, people looked at birds, bats and insects and concluded, “All these animals flap their wings; flapping must be the secret to flight!” If you’ve flown in an airplane, you know this conclusion is clearly wrong. But when trying to understand a phenomenon, we often reach for what seems the most obvious answer. To get to the bottom of a problem, we need to uncover its essence, which is often hidden behind other, irrelevant details. Again, we are reminded of the element Earth, as a problem’s essence is its core or foundation. Let’s think about flying. Understandably, the mechanics of flapping wings distracted observers from the real reason behind how a body can fly. It was only when people studied the mechanisms of flight more closely that they were able to better understand what enabled flight: the particular curvature of a wing. Thus to find the essence of an issue or problem, we need to look at only what we can see. This means actively ignoring what we might expect to see, or have been taught to see. Often our expectations get in the way of discovering the essence of an issue or problem, as we don’t question enough what others have told us that we should be observing. For centuries, people believed Aristotle’s theory that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. It wasn’t until much later, during the seventeenth century, when curious individuals actively ignored Aristotle’s claim and examined the situation with fresh eyes – and discovered that Aristotle was wrong. There’s also another way to find the essence of problem: to focus on what’s missing. Today when we look at old photographs, we describe them as “black and white,” as those are the only colors present. Yet before the invention of color film, such monochrome photographs were simply known as photographs. At the time, people didn’t think such photos as being limited in any way. But had they added the adjective “black and white” to “photography” before colored film was invented, people would have had a better understanding of the essence of the photographs in front of them. We all have bad days. Yet what distinguishes great thinkers from the average is not the absence of bad days, it’s the way a great thinker reacts to them when they occur. This is a crucial lesson: whenever you make a mistake, make sure you take time to reflect on it. Your accomplishments are built on the lessons you’ve learned, and mistakes are the basis of your most effective lessons. Sure, we don’t like making mistakes, just like we don’t enjoy being burned. The element Fire embodies this uncomfortable truth; we must embrace our mistakes to learn better. So when you make a mistake, understand what you did wrong and then question why it was wrong. With each mistake you identify and investigate, you’ll have better insight into how to tackle future problems. Thomas Edison was someone who understood the fire element, believing that invention was “1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.” His approach was to experiment, see what went wrong, learn from the mistake, then try again. After he successfully invented the lightbulb, Edison was asked about his failed attempts. His response? “I have not failed, I have just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” Indeed, an ineffective solution to one problem could be the perfect solution to another. In 1970, for example, a scientist working for 3M Laboratories tried to create a strong adhesive. What he came up with instead was a failure: an adhesive so weak it could be peeled off any surface, leaving no trace. The project was subsequently abandoned. Three years later, another scientist at 3M was seeking to create a bookmark that wouldn’t slip out between pages easily or damage them. The solution? That same “failed” weak adhesive. The scientist’s invention went on to become one of 3M’s most successful and ubiquitous products: the Post-it note. So before you consider an idea useless or a failure, take a moment to consider whether your idea might be used in a way that you haven’t yet imagined. Many people are deathly afraid of failure. They believe that in failing, they won’t ever succeed – a perspective that stops many people from ever trying new things. To be innovative, you cannot be afraid to make mistakes. In fact, because failing can provide you with such useful information, it shouldn’t be avoided but instead welcomed. The element Fire reminds us of this; we have to make the uncomfortable comfortable to truly succeed. Although thinking like this is fairly unconventional, there are several ways to encourage it in yourself. First, commit to the idea that you’ll fail at least nine times before getting something right. Whether you’re producing a new gadget or artistic work, don’t believe that you’ll succeed on your very first attempt. By thinking in this way, you’ll feel free to simply go ahead and try new ideas without fear. So when your first attempt inevitably turns out to be a failure, you can say, “Well, that just means I’m 10 percent closer to succeeding! Let’s try again.” Second, attack your problem in a way that excludes the thought that your idea is somehow “correct.” When you write down your ideas without caring whether they’re right or wrong, your thoughts will tend to drift more easily, and they’ll be clearer too. Leave the task of distinguishing right from wrong, or good from bad, for later. Finally, exaggerate potential problems on purpose to “force” mistakes, and then fix those mistakes. Taking your ideas to the extreme can reveal inherent flaws. This is an approach that manufacturers often take: they perform “stress tests” designed to push a product to its breaking point. In doing so, they gain valuable information about the product’s strengths and weaknesses. Similarly, certain companies hire skilled hackers to attempt to break into their computer systems, so they can locate even the most difficult-to-find security holes. So the next time you’re facing a challenging task, don’t allow yourself to be paralyzed with fear. Fail! And then try again. Children ask a lot of questions. Yet as adults, we’re often distracted by our own problems and thus annoyed by this overeager inquisitiveness – especially the persistent, “why?” This response is wrongheaded. Indeed, constantly questioning is crucial to developing the most effective mind-set. But what steps should you take to achieve this ideal frame of mind? Think about the element Air – asking questions acts like a breath of fresh air, clearing the way to deeper knowledge. First, put yourself in the position of a teacher. When you have adequately grasped a specific subject or solution to a problem, consider how you would then teach the subject to someone else. For instance, you could prepare a lecture – perhaps for a colleague or friend – and, as you assemble your thoughts, try to make the subject as clear as possible. In this process, you may find yourself considering questions you might not have had before. Moreover, having to explain a subject in detail to another person can help you to identify gaps in your own knowledge. Once you’ve created your lecture, evaluate your work by making up an exam on your subject. Which questions would you ask? And more importantly, would you be able to then answer those questions accurately, based on your lecture’s contents? Second, embrace an attitude of being constantly inquisitive and critical. When you are curious about a subject, don’t bog yourself down with trying to absorb every fact you can at once. Instead, ask questions. Regularly ask yourself, “what if…?” and find an answer that satisfies your curiosity. This approach works. The book’s authors, as they gave lectures, would randomly select one student in the hall to be the “questioner.” The questioner then had to ask at least two questions during the lecture. Over the years, the authors noticed that the questioner usually would gain and retain a better understanding of a subject – because the questioner had to be inquisitive – than any other student present at the lecture. Two men are walking in the forest when suddenly an angry bear starts to chase them. Both break into a sprint. While they’re running, one asks the other if he thinks they can outrun the bear and survive. The other says, “I don't need to outrun the bear. The question is: Can I outrun you?” Coming up with good questions is an invaluable skill. But what exactly makes a good question? Questions should be effective; they should engage your mind in ways that lead to new insight and solutions. An ineffective question is one that might be obvious or vaguely formulated, one that doesn’t lead to action. A question such as, “How can I get better grades?” is too general to generate a response that would actually lead you down the path to better grades. Like the element Air, an effective question should provide clarity and focus. “How can I manage my time better?” or “How can I understand this subject more deeply?” are questions that get to the heart of the matter, where “How can I get better grades?” does not. Yet sometimes, asking the right questions means questioning your own questions. Think of the last time you were stuck in traffic. You were probably stressed, and perhaps came up with a half-dozen ways to fix the “traffic problem” in your city – by adding more lanes, as one example. The reason your solutions aren’t helpful? You’re asking the wrong question. In this situation, the right question begins with accepting the traffic you’re stuck in. So, by questioning your original question, a better question can then be formulated. For example, “Given the likelihood that I’m stuck here, is there a way for me to use this time effectively?” The final type of question is more philosophical in scope: “What’s my reason for even doing this task in the first place?” A very good question. Before you begin a project, question why you’re interested in doing it, and determine what it is that you hope to gain from it. In cartoons, a character has an idea and a light bulb switches on over their head. Although this is a popular and visual metaphor, it’s far from accurate. That’s because every idea has its own history. “New” ideas do not come from nowhere; rather, they are simply variations on existing ideas. Like the element Water, ideas flow from the past to the present. In the seventeenth century, for example, Isaac Newton and Gottfried von Leibniz independently formulated a branch of mathematics that would change the world: calculus. Yet, a closer examination of history reveals that all of the necessary elements to come up with calculus had already been conceived by other mathematicians. Even Newton himself admitted that he was able to see further than others only because he’d “stood on the shoulders of giants.” In short, Newton and Leibniz took just a small, albeit crucial step forward based on the ideas of the past. And after them, even more ideas marched on. While Leibniz’s published theory was just six pages long, current theoretical writings on calculus weigh in at 1,300 pages. In other words, after the two men came up with their theory, generations of mathematicians added their own small contributions. So what does this teach us about developing our own ideas? Whenever you’re trying to develop an idea, you should look to the past and explore the rich history of ideas. How did past thinkers develop their ideas? What do you think they were thinking at the time? In doing this, you’ll discover that great ideas seldom arrive like that cartoon light bulb but make themselves known after a long process of trial and error. Once you accept this, you’ll let your thoughts flow like water, and you’ll reach your goals sooner than you know. The American mathematician R. H. Bing once said that the time to work on a problem is after you have solved it. In other words, innovation should never come to a halt. As we saw in the previous blink, every new idea is the source of another new idea. Thus you shouldn’t stop thinking, just because you’ve reached one solution to a particular problem. Indeed, the most effective thinkers are those who continually exploit new ideas for further inspiration. The invention of the light bulb was just one solution for bringing artificial light to dark rooms. Yet this one idea sparked dozens of others: electric heaters, television, even computers. By thinking of the light bulb not as a final product but as a point of departure for new ideas, one small drip of inspiration turned into a flood of new ideas and discoveries. The element Water can be an inspiration to let your ideas flow. Never allow yourself to dam up this creative process! Instead, maintain your flow of ideas by seeing each new solution as just a waypoint to other destinations down the river, which itself flows endlessly forward. The question is not whether an idea will lead to further ideas, as all ideas do. The real question is how to find those new ideas. So keep asking yourself, “What’s next?” and then take that first step toward tackling your next challenge. What’s the definition of insanity? Someone once said it’s doing the same thing again and again, and expecting different results each time. So, if you’re not happy with how your life is progressing, change it. Earlier blinks have shown you what you can do to make a positive change. Now it’s time for you to actually do it! The first thing you must do is be willing to change. People often think of change as being too difficult, or too complicated. They think it’s better to continue along the same path, saying, “Surely if I keep at it, things will improve.” But this isn’t true. The only way to improve your life is to change it. If that sounds daunting, don’t worry. Now that you’re armed with the elements of effective thinking, you have the tools to change. All you need to bring to the table however is a willingness to change. Sure, it’s not easy to go out into the world and make mistakes on purpose; but you must accept that this is the only way to generate better ideas. So, don’t concern yourself with the risks involved – just do it! However, it’s not enough to do this just one time. To transform yourself, you must be prepared to change and evolve constantly. There is always room for improvement. This process is somewhat like renovating a city. While people usually tend to think of an ideal city as complete and perfect, by thinking effectively you will see that an entire city cannot be renovated all at once, but in incremental steps. Fixing one area takes time. And once that area is ready, the next area will also take time. This process will continue until the moment you believe you’re finished – at which point, you should begin working on the first part again! The five elements can help you on your path: the Earth centering your ideas, Fire inspiring your confidence, Air clearing your thoughts, Water helping your ideas flow from one inspiration to the next, and the final element – Change – leading you to success. The key message in this book: Extraordinary people are just ordinary people that think differently. By using the proven methods of effective thinking, that ordinary person that thinks differently could be you. Actionable advice: Fail on purpose and learn from your mistakes. Next time you’re facing a problem and you don't know what to do, rather than allowing yourself to be paralyzed with fear, try an approach you know will fail, and then learn from your mistake. Locate your weaknesses to test your mastery. To see exactly how well you’ve mastered a subject’s basics, take a blank sheet of paper and write down everything you know about it. Later, compare what you’ve written with other, more authoritative sources. In doing so, you’ll discover the weaknesses you have in your understanding of the basics. Suggested further reading: Six Thinking Hats by Edward de Bono Six Thinking Hats offers you valuable tools for group discussions and individual decision making. The book shows ways to compartmentalize different ways of thinking to help you and your group use your brains in a more detailed, cohesive and effective way.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

It may sound like an impossible dream, but it needn’t be – you can make it a reality by becoming a freelance mom. Over the last ten years, the number of mothers working for themselves has increased by a staggering 70%, and these blinks will show you how to join them. You’ll learn from the experience of successful freelance writer Annie Ridout and find out how she’s gone from being asked to work for free to commanding £1,000 a day for her services. Packed with helpful insights and practical advice, you’ll discover how the author changed up her career and made it work for her young family – and how you can too.  From figuring out childcare to blogging, and from setting rates to networking, these blinks will take you through the ins and outs of getting started as a freelancer and give you the confidence you need to strike out on your own.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why freelance moms should act like swans;  how much you should be charging as a freelancer; and  the morning routine of an extremely successful freelance mom. Being a new mom can be daunting. Your body has gone through major changes; you might look or even feel different from how you used to. But don’t lose heart. Not only are you just as competent as you once were, you’ve probably also got a lot of knowledge and experience under your belt from your previous work. Now you just have to put these skills to good use on your new freelancing journey.  Once you’ve decided to go freelance, the first step is thinking about what you want from your new career. Ask yourself: What kind of work would I enjoy doing? Do I want to work from home? Am I willing to work on weekends? Clarifying your ideal scenario, right from the start, will focus your mind on achieving it.  Francesca McConchie, for instance, was a personal assistant before becoming a mom. When she decided to go freelance, she knew her priorities were to spend more time with her young children and to do more of what she loved: baking. Francesca also decided she wasn’t prepared to pay expensive childcare fees, but she was willing to work weekends. Armed with her newfound clarity, she set about transforming her favorite pastime into her dream job. Nowadays, Francesca works from home as a freelance baker, making delicious cakes for special occasions.  Importantly, before Francesca began freelancing, she already made birthday cakes as a hobby. This meant that by the time she turned baking into a business, she already had plenty of friends and acquaintances who had tried her cakes and were interested in buying them. But for the rest of us, it can take time to get paid for our passions. With this in mind, you should be prepared to take on less exciting projects, as well as dream jobs.  Annie’s dream, for example, was to have a book published. Of course, she knew this wouldn’t happen overnight. So, in the meantime, she also freelanced as a copywriter. This wasn’t her dream, but it did teach her to express her ideas concisely – a useful skill when writing her book. If your ideal freelance work doesn’t arrive right away, don’t forget that even the freelancing you do purely for money might still help you achieve your ultimate goal. Achieving a decent fee for your freelance services isn’t always easy. As a self-employed copywriter, Annie was once approached by a women’s charity and asked to write something for them. The purpose of the piece, the charity said, was to promote female empowerment. Of course, they added, they couldn’t pay Annie for her work. Thankfully, this is an extreme case – most clients will offer to pay for your services. However, knowing how much to charge them can be tricky.  There’s one thing you can be sure of, though: When deciding on the rates for your services, it pays to do your research.  Annie found this out the hard way after starting her parenting and lifestyle blog The Early Hour and amassing an impressive number of readers. Soon, she began including sponsored posts, for which brands paid her to write about their products. Unfortunately, she was woefully undercharging for this service. Instead of taking into account her own distinctive brand and large audience, or finding out what other bloggers were earning from sponsored content, she simply charged her clients for the time it took her to write their posts. Later, she discovered that another blogger with just a tenth of her audience size was charging more than her for sponsored content. This just goes to show that you won’t know how much to charge unless you talk to other people in your industry and find out what they’re making.  When setting your rates, don’t forget to calculate how much money you actually need to make each month.  Remember that, as a freelancer, you’ll have costs that regular employees don’t. You’ll have to pay for all your equipment, your computer and perhaps your office space. You won’t get maternity pay or sick leave. Plus, although your rate might seem high, you’ll also have to pay taxes from it – not to mention childcare if you’ve got young children. Therefore, it’s important to charge enough to pay for all these hidden expenses. Freelance coach Holly June Smith, also suggests having savings to cover three months of bills. This way you can buy yourself peace of mind, knowing you’ve got a buffer to see your family through if your earnings drop.  But to build up that buffer, you’ve got to do yourself justice with your rates. Take a page from Annie; these days, she charges her clients £1,000 for each sponsored post. One of the most exhilarating things about freelancing is saying goodbye to the 9-to-5 grind. But your newfound freedom can also pose challenges. You no longer have the structured routine of a steady day job and without this, everyday life can feel chaotic – particularly with young children in the mix. So it’s up to you to take control and carve out a new routine.  As a freelance mom, you can devise an early morning routine to enhance your productivity.  For example, make it your mission to get up as early as possible. Annie used to wake up at 5:30 a.m. Although this might sound extreme, it was the only time she could focus on her work without the distraction of children. You can also boost your productivity by exercising in the morning. Whenever she’s able, Annie gets out of bed and heads straight out for a run. This early morning jog boosts her self-esteem and lets her feel that, whatever else happens, she’s already achieved something with her day. Furthermore, an early morning workout session gets lots of feel-good endorphins flowing around the body.  Another great tip is to ban screens from your bedroom. Annie used to surf the internet before bed and check her smartphone as soon as she woke up. Unfortunately, this meant that work was the first and last thing on her mind. Worse still, she often dreamed about the people she’d just seen on Instagram. But now that she’s replaced her phone with an alarm clock, she reads novels before bed and spends a few minutes thinking about the day ahead when her alarm goes off – much more relaxing.  Lastly, it might encourage you to know that many of the world’s most successful people follow a strict morning routine.  Ariana Huffington, for example, started the Huffington Post from her kitchen table in 2005. Famous for her morning routine, Ariana gets up extremely early and spends thirty minutes exercising. Then she writes down her goals for the day, along with a list of things she’s grateful for that morning. As if this wasn’t enough, she also spends thirty minutes meditating. And her mighty self-discipline has certainly paid off. In 2011, she sold the Huffington Post for a whopping $315 million! So go ahead and make your own morning routine a priority. Who knows what you’ll achieve? We’ve all heard about moms who have it all: superwomen who run around after their children while simultaneously keeping their impressive careers on track. Unfortunately, the reality of modern parenting is often rather different. In Annie’s experience, moms who care for their children single-handedly while also working full-time, are usually doomed to fail. Sadly, you really would have to be Wonder Woman to work this hard. And with this in mind, the freelance mom needs reliable childcare.  Fortunately, putting your child into a nursery can offer a handy solution.  Annie’s daughter has been at nursery part-time since she was 18 months old. Being around so many other children was daunting at first, but it wasn’t long before she made friends. In fact, attending nursery has really helped develop her social skills. As a freelancer, using a nursery is a great way to get some alone time at home, to work. In contrast, a nanny or au pair will typically look after your child in your own home, which could be distracting.  An alternative option is to use a daycare center that’s attached to a shared workspace. This relatively new childcare solution allows parents to pay by the hour. In return, you’ll get an office space to get your work done while your child plays in the same building. So, not only do you just pay for the time you actually need to complete your work, but you’ll also have peace of mind knowing that your child is nearby if she needs you.  Lastly, if you’re part of a two-parent household, don’t forget to make use of the childcare resource that’s sitting right in front of you: your partner.  That being said, if your significant other is a man, then you might find yourself fighting an uphill battle to get him involved with childcare – only 2% of UK fathers make full use of their paternity leave. However, you can help change things by letting your partner know how important he is to your children’s wellbeing.  Of course, it’s your choice how much you want to share childcare with your partner. For her babies’ first years, for example, Annie wanted to be their primary carer as she recovered from giving birth and got to grips with breastfeeding. But now that her children are older, help from her husband enables her to take those last-minute freelance jobs.  As a freelance mom, things can get very tough. But struggling doesn’t make you a failure. You might hear other freelancers say they found looking after a baby and working from home straightforward, but this isn’t everyone’s experience. Anna Jones, for example, is a food writer who bravely accepted a commission to pen a cookbook while pregnant with her son. She was optimistic about the project, especially as a fellow mom had reassured her that her new baby would sleep most of the day and that she could write the book as he napped.  Perhaps predictably, things didn’t go to plan. Instead, Anna’s baby spent most of his first six months crying and Anna spent most of her time trying to soothe him. Furthermore, her hormones were still raging, making it difficult for her to function as she once had. Anna did get that cookbook written, but looking back, she felt everything would have gone better if other moms had just been truthful about how challenging the combination of work and motherhood can be.  As a working mom, Annie also finds it difficult to cope sometimes. On occasion, she’s even cried down the phone to her own mom. However, she’s also a firm believer in faking it until you make it.  Whenever she steps out of the house, no matter how chaotic she feels, Annie always makes an effort to seem calm and unruffled – especially to her clients. Just like a swan, she appears graceful on the water, but underneath she’s paddling like crazy to stay afloat.  Appearing confident might also be crucial to your success as a freelancer. It’s certainly one of the keys to success in the world of traditional jobs. For example, in her book Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg explains that men typically have the confidence to apply for new jobs even when they don’t meet all the requirements. By contrast, women tend to focus more on all the criteria they don’t meet and often fail to put in an application.  Sadly, it’s this lack of confidence that partly explains why women occupy only 12% of jobs with a salary of over £150,000 a year. With this in mind, try to act like a confident woman – even if, underneath it all, you’re really just trying to stay afloat. Annie has always been a little ahead of the curve. As a journalism student in 2008, she was one of just two students in her class that wrote a blog. Back then, instead of using it to further her career, Annie simply wanted to write about all the things she couldn’t in her journalism day job, such as feminism and art. So she started a blog about her interests outside of work, called Annie Loves, never once thinking it could be a source of income. Now, just a decade later, blogging is so much more than a hobby – it’s a vital part of Annie’s business. These days, Annie’s online magazine The Early Hour has a large following, and she monetizes this by posting sponsored content.  And she’s not the only freelance mom making money from blogging. Emma Paton started her blog Finlay Fox after having her first baby. Initially, Emma’s blog was simply a creative outlet through which she could let the world know her thoughts on children’s fashion brands. But these days, Finlay Fox is her main income stream and has evolved into an indispensable guide for design-savvy parents looking for the best independent fashion brands for their kids. Best of all, it fits well into Emma’s family routine. Of course, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to grow a successful blog. So if you’re hoping to join the blogging revolution, try to keep the following in mind:   Firstly, make sure you think about search engine optimization (SEO). This refers to how high up the listings your site appears in Google search results. Google ranks websites according to the amount of new, relevant content that’s added to them, so get creative and post new content on a daily basis. Secondly, try to center your blog around topics you’re actually interested in. You’ll need lots of fresh ideas for new posts and, especially when you’re starting out, you probably won’t be paid for your writing. With this in mind, it’s important to focus on a subject you genuinely enjoy exploring.  Networking can be a tricky thing to master. While attending a blogging awards event, the author met a fellow blogger. After a few minutes of polite conversation, the woman announced that it had been good to meet her but that she needed to move on now and speak to other people. In other words, she needed to go and network.  At the time, Annie admired her upfront approach to networking, but looking back, she thinks this woman missed a trick. Why? Because good networking isn’t just about meeting people – it’s about building enduring relationships with them. Tellingly, Annie never had any contact with that person again. Not a great example of networking after all. This just goes to show that fleeting, one-off conversations rarely lead anywhere.  Instead, Annie’s experience as a freelance mom has shown her that the best networking contacts are often people who start out as friends.  For example, she met one of her most useful contacts at her child’s playgroup – a fellow mom who just happened to work for an online magazine. After bonding over their children’s antics, the two moms met for coffee and gradually became firm friends. Annie has been going to her for advice ever since.  Annie’s chance encounter at the playgroup shows that you never know where you’ll find your next industry contact, so it’s important to network with everyone you can. Although this might sound like a daunting prospect, it needn’t be. Oftentimes, all that’s required is to be friendly and engaged with everyone you meet. For example, always have an open mind when you start conversations with new contacts. Ask them what they do and what their interests are – you might be surprised at how much you have in common.  And when you’re done, don’t just skip off like the woman at Annie’s blogging event. Instead, ask for their social media details. Many people find it too forward to be invited for coffee the first time they’ve met you, so it’s a better idea to follow up on social media a few days later. Don’t feel too shy about doing this. Remember, they may well be looking to meet new people too.  The key message in these blinks: After the life-changing experience of motherhood, many new moms lack the confidence to dive into freelance work and charge the fees they deserve. But with a business-savvy attitude and the right childcare in place, you too can join the freelancing revolution and make your career work for your family. Actionable advice:  Figure out your story.   When starting out as a freelancer, you’ll want to spread the word about your services. One way to do this is to get media organizations, like magazines and online news sites, to give you coverage. You can attract the media by crafting your personal story and sharing it on your own platforms. Annie tells the story of how having a baby and losing her job pushed her to start her online magazine The Early Hour. This means that whenever a journalist wants to talk to a victim of maternity discrimination or a freelance mom, Annie is poised to offer her thoughts. So get working on your story – it’s an invaluable part of your brand. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It’s probably a hammer, a screwdriver or some other physical object.  But a tool can also be a verbal or mental device, such as a phrase, an idea or an analogy that helps us to think about something more effectively. These linguistic and conceptual tools can be even more useful than their physical counterparts. After all, by reshaping our thoughts, they can also help us to change our behaviors and thus our very lives!  In the following blinks, you’ll find a treasure chest full of these tools, along with some other nifty tricks and techniques that can help you boost your career and be happier in both your personal and professional lives.  In these blinks, you’ll discover  a pair of powerful metaphors that can change how you see the world;  a wide range of techniques for thinking more positively; and a versatile set of tricks for improving your communication skills. Conceptual tools come in many forms, but few of them pack such a big punch as the metaphor. We’re going to begin with one such metaphor – a simple but powerful way to reconceptualize your emotions and find more happiness in life.  To understand the metaphor, begin by imagining four houses. Each house corresponds to one of the four primary emotions from which all of our other emotions are ultimately derived: sadness, anger, gladness and fear. In each house, you’ll find a wide range of variations on the primary emotion it represents – variations such as sorrow, despair and devastation in the House of Sad; annoyance, anger and fury in the House of Mad; contentment, happiness and elation in the House of Glad; and nervousness, panic and terror in the House of Scared.  From day to day, hour to hour or even minute to minute, we tend to move from one house to the next. For example, imagine someone loses something that’s important to you – a family heirloom, let’s say. You might start off in the House of Sad, as you lament your loss. Then you might move into the House of Mad, as you get angry at the person for losing the heirloom.  But despite all this moving around, one of the houses tends to be our primary place of residence – the one where we spend most of our time. For example, if you wake up with anxiety every morning and feel nervous throughout the day, you might be living in the House of Scared.  Now, here’s the bad news: most of us tend to live in the houses of Sad, Mad or Scared. Sometimes we find ourselves in the House of Glad, but we’re more like occasional visitors than residents there. But here’s the good news: if you’re dwelling too much in one of the negative houses, there’s a simple solution: move out of it!  Of course, that’s easier said than done.  In the next blink, we’ll start looking at practical steps for moving into the House of Glad. But the point of the metaphor is simply to realize that moving is possible. If you’re feeling some variant of sad, mad or scared most of the time, the emotion isn’t a permanent condition; it’s a temporary dwelling place, which you can leave behind.  The House of Glad awaits you! So how do you make the House of Glad your primary place of residence? Well, to play on the house metaphor some more, you’ve got to pay your RENT! That’s an acronym for Rest, Exercise, Nutrition and Thoughts. To live a happy life, you’ve got to maintain healthy habits in all four of these areas. In this blink, we’ll focus on rest. Then we’ll look at the other areas.  Now, when we talk about rest, we’re not just talking about getting enough sleep. Rest is anything that helps you refresh yourself. Regardless of how much sleep you get, you could probably use some more refreshment throughout the day. Here are two quick ways to get it.  First up, take a Purple Break. To do this, set a timer for 60 seconds. Close your eyes, cover them with your hand and relax your breath. Then count backward from 15, exhaling after each number. So, “15,” exhale; “14,” exhale; “13,” exhale; and so forth.  Why is this called a purple break? Well, the author learned about it from her father, and here’s how he thought of it: when your eyes are exposed to bright light, it decomposes a protein called rhodopsin, which is also known as visual purple. This decomposition leads to fatigue. By covering your eyes, you’re giving your visual purple a break from the light, allowing it to restore itself.  The only problem with a Purple Break is that if you do it in public, people might think you’re kind of weird. Fortunately, you can practice the next technique on the sly, just about anywhere. It’s a simple but effective breathing exercise called the 4-4-6. To take a 4-4-6, simply inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for another four seconds and then exhale for six seconds.  Repeat this a few times in a row, and you’ll find yourself peacefully returning to the present moment, as you let go of your worries about the future and regrets about the past. It’s a very quick, accessible and versatile technique for reducing stress. You can use it in a wide range of stressful circumstances in which you’re feeling overwhelmed – whether you’re stuck in a traffic jam, doing your grocery shopping or working on a project.  Best of all? It’s always available, and it’s always free! No one’s charging you for the air you breathe – not yet, at least. Now we come to the letter E of the RENT you need to pay to live in the House of Glad: exercise. If that word sends shivers down your spine, don’t worry. This blink isn’t going to be about trying to get you to run a 5K on a daily basis.  On the contrary, it’s about recognizing that setting lofty exercise objectives like these can be counterproductive. That’s because it takes a lot of planning and dedication to achieve them. For example, you’ve got to figure out a way to fit that 5K run into your busy day – perhaps by sleeping in your running clothes and doing it first thing in the morning. But when such high levels of planning and dedication are required, you’re likely to slip up on maintaining the ambitious exercise habit you’re trying to develop. Then you’ll start feeling guilty and unmotivated, which might lead you to give up on the whole endeavor.  To overcome the dedication problem, start with smaller steps. You can do this quite literally by taking the stairs at work instead of the elevator, or purposely parking your car farther away from the front door of the office. Or you can do what the author’s father did. Today, run from your mailbox to your next-door neighbor’s mailbox. Tomorrow, run to the second mailbox away from yours. The day after that, run to the third mailbox – and so on. Small steps like these can add up; within a year, the author’s father was running in a marathon!  As for the problem of planning, here’s another simple solution: embrace spontaneity! Have a spare minute? Try doing 20 push-ups or 25 jumping jacks. Have some more time to kill? Whip out your smartphone and cue up YouTube for your next workout video. Yoga, cardio, kickboxing, weightlifting – the list of free online video options goes on and on, and they’re all available for free anywhere you go! As you put some healthier exercise habits in place, you’ll want to fuel them with the right Nutrition – the letter N in your RENT. Here, there’s some even simpler advice to follow. First, energize yourself by consuming more protein, which provides a longer-lasting source of energy than carbs.  Second, protect your health by avoiding sugar. You probably already know that sugar is bad for your health, but did you know there are 76 different ways in which it’s bad? They can be grouped into four categories: nutrient imbalances and deficiencies; negative behavioral changes; bodily impairments; and increased risk of disease. These include unhealthy cholesterol levels, difficulty concentrating, premature aging and emphysema, to cover just five percent of the potential bad news that sugar spells.  So next time you’re craving a snack, skip the sweet stuff, and grab some protein-packed nuts instead! Last but certainly not least, we come to the final letter of the RENT acronym: T for thoughts. This is arguably the most important component of the RENT we need to pay to live in the House of Glad. After all, if you don’t have healthy thoughts about rest, exercise and nutrition, you’re not going to be able to cover the first three parts of your RENT! They’re a prerequisite to getting everything else right.  More broadly speaking, our thoughts shape our behaviors in general, so they’re crucial in all areas of our personal and professional lives. The more positive our thoughts are, the more positive our behaviors will be. Conversely, negative thoughts tend to lead to negative behaviors.  Imagine two salespeople encountering the same challenge – cold-calling an important person with a business proposition, let’s say. If the first person thinks, “I can’t do that” or “it’s impossible,” he’s likely to give up before he’s even tried. But if the other person believes in herself and the possibility of success, she’ll give it a shot – and who knows? She might make the sale!  As these examples demonstrate, the language we use when speaking to ourselves is crucial. Positive self-talk leads to positive thoughts and behaviors, while negative self-talk leads to the opposite. You can take advantage of this fact by practicing a variety of positive self-talk techniques, while avoiding negative self-talk habits.  For example, like the salesperson from our previous example, many of us often fall into the trap of telling ourselves, “I can’t do this” and “I can’t do that.” You can turn this negative self-talk pattern around by simply adding a few words to it: “I can’t do this, and I can’t do that, but what can I do?” Now, instead of urging you to give up on a problem, your words are encouraging you to come up with a solution!  If you’re still feeling stuck, remind yourself of the following phrase: “Salt the hay; find the way!” This refers to the old saying that “you can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” That might be true, but you can put salt in the horse’s hay to make him thirsty! In other words, there are often indirect, creative solutions to your problems; you’ve just got to keep looking for them!  In the next blink, we’ll look at some more positive self-talk techniques. Our next positive self-talk technique comes courtesy of a nineteenth-century French psychologist named Émile Coué. It’s called autosuggestion, also known as flooding.  To do this, simply repeat the same positive statement over and over again – 20 times in a row, once in the morning and once at night. Try doing this every day for a month and see how it works out for you. Better yet, take it to the next level and also practice it during idle moments of the day, such as waiting in line or driving somewhere.  What should you say to yourself? Here’s one affirmation from the spiritual teacher Robert Adams you can try: “All is well. Everything is unfolding as it should.” Here’s another from minister Norman Vincent Peale: “I expect the best and I get the best.” And here’s a third from author Louise Hay: “Someone somewhere is looking for exactly what I have to offer.”  While practicing positive flooding, you should also be on guard against any negative flooding you might be doing unintentionally. For example, when you’re feeling tired, you might say to yourself, “I’m exhausted; I’m exhausted” over and over again. Cut this out! It just makes your difficulties worse by causing you to dwell on them in a negative way.  Better yet, say something positive to yourself whenever you’re facing a challenging situation – whether it’s running late for an appointment or working under a tight deadline. Here’s one of the author’s phrases you can use yourself: “It’s okay, because I’m flexible and adaptable.” And here’s an even catchier one: “AFA, all the way!” AFA is the author’s nifty acronym; it stands for Always Flexible and Adaptable.  Why this emphasis on flexibility and adaptability? Well, these are two of the most crucial traits for success in today’s fast-changing world. If you’re adaptable, you can adapt to your ever-shifting circumstances – and if you’re flexible, you can bend yourself without snapping.  Of course, you can practice all of these positive self-talk techniques and still find yourself feeling low at times, so here’s one more technique that will help you pick yourself up. It’s called the Happiness Alphabet. Simply recite the alphabet, and for each letter, say a positive word. For example, “A is for Awesome, B is for Brilliant, C is for Creative” and so forth. By the time you reach “Z is for zealous,” you’ll hopefully feel ready to make all of those positive words a reality! To take up residence in the House of Glad, you’ll probably need to get yourself out of the House of Scared. Unfortunately, that’s where most of us tend to live. As we go through our days, we’re almost constantly troubled by our Worries, Anxieties and Fears – or WAFs, in short.  So the question becomes, How do we say goodbye to our WAFs? Well, here’s yet another of the author’s acronyms to the rescue: PAR. That stands for Prevent, Acknowledge and Release.  To help you “stay on PAR,” let’s break the acronym down, starting with P for Prevent. The idea here is that our WAFs are often caused by preventable problems, like a project with a deadline that you waited until the last minute to complete. So, begin by trying to prevent these problems from happening in the first place. Don’t procrastinate. Be proactive. That will greatly reduce your WAFs in one fell swoop.  But some problems are unavoidable, so you’re still going to experience problems and the WAFs that accompany them. That’s where the next letter of PAR comes in: A for Acknowledge. Don’t try to deny or ignore your WAFs. That just makes them fester. Instead, acknowledge them. If you’re feeling fear, admit to yourself, “I’m feeling fear.”  As you acknowledge your WAFs, you’ll feel an automatic sense of Release from them – the third letter of PAR. You can take this release one step farther by literally saying goodbye to your WAFs. “Goodbye, fear! Goodbye, worry!” you might say.  And if you really want to say farewell to your WAFs, start monitoring your Ogive curve. What’s that? Well, in statistics, an Ogive is a type of curve on a graph. Imagine a curved line going up and down, over and over again, like a roller-coaster track. That’s the Ogive curve of your emotions.  When it’s curving upward, one positive emotion leads to another, taking your mood higher and higher. When it’s curving downward, the opposite happens, and your mood gets lower and lower. The trick is to detect and deflect. Keep an eye on your curve, and when you detect it’s heading downward, do something to deflect it.  For this purpose, it helps to have a list of instant mood boosters ready to hand. These can be simple activities, like listening to music, calling a friend or practicing one of the many techniques you’ve learned in these blinks – whatever lifts you up! As we’ve seen, the language we use can have a powerful effect on us. And of course it can also have a major impact on other people in our lives. Just think about how much criticism can sting your ego or a compliment can lift your mood. Words can improve or injure our relationships – so let’s take a look at how we can use them to do more of the first and less of the second.  Now, for many of us, giving critical feedback can be one of our main sticking points when communicating with colleagues, friends and family alike. It’s hard to deliver such feedback without hitting the sensitive spots of someone’s self-esteem too hard. Fortunately, there’s an easy-to-assemble tool that can soften the blow: the Velvet Hammer.  To put it together, simply take your critical feedback and wrap it in some softer language. Here’s a template you can use, which is built around four stem words: “noticed,” “wondering,” “likelihood” and “when.” The template goes as follows: “I noticed X, and I was wondering what the likelihood is of you doing Y, and when you might do it.” So, for example: “I noticed that you’ve been running late with your deadlines recently, and I was wondering what the likelihood is of you getting back on schedule, and when you think that might happen.”  Of course, it’s also important to provide people with positive feedback about their good qualities and accomplishments. To deliver this feedback, you can use a truncated version of the Velvet Hammer template – this time just using the words “noticed” and “wondering.” For example, “I noticed that your sales have gone up 25 percent over the past quarter, and I was wondering whether you could share your strategies with the rest of the sales team.” And if you want to go beyond mere words, try giving out a “Because of You” trophy. To do this, buy an actual trophy, and give it to someone when you notice them doing something special. For example, if you were giving it to a coworker, you might say, “This office is such a better work environment because of you.” To make this an ongoing practice in your workplace, let the recipient keep the trophy for a few days – and then choose who gets to receive it next. That way, the positivity keeps getting paid forward. We started these blinks by touring the four houses of emotion. Now we’re going to end them by surveying the four lands of personality. With this metaphor in hand, you’ll really be able to take your language game to the next level!  To start off, imagine four countries. Each one represents a different personality type, which is defined by a different motivation. First, there’s the “Land of Social” people. Their motivation is to be accepted and noticed by the people around them. Then, there’s the “Land of Factual” people. They’re obsessed with accuracy. Next, there’s the “Land of Driven” people. Their focus is on winning. And finally, there’s the “Land of Helpful” people. They’re all about giving a hand.  Now, here’s the thing: each land has its own language. For example, Social people tend to use enthusiastic words like “Amazing!” “Yay!” and “Wahoo!” But Factual people’s language tends to be much more matter-of-fact and detail-oriented. Meanwhile, Driven people talk about the “bottom line,” while Helpful people tend to keep offering their help until you accept it. “Would you like some tea? No? How about a sandwich? No? How about...” You get the idea!  When you’re communicating with someone from another land, it’s crucial to remember these differences among their languages. This can help you translate your conversations. For example, let’s say you’re trying to praise a Helpful person for assisting you in putting up some shelves. If you’re a Factual person, you might be tempted to say, “Wow, great job with the shelves; they’re perfectly straight!” Now, that’s the sort of accuracy-oriented feedback that a Factual person wants to hear; for a Helpful person, however, a better compliment would be, “Gosh, I couldn’t have done that without you!”  Of course, other people usually won’t be familiar with the metaphor of the four lands, so you’ll have to translate their words in your head. For instance, if a Social person tells you that your work is “amazing,” that might seem annoyingly vague to you if you’re a Factual person. But if you remember what this word means in the Land of Social, you’ll realize that they’re paying you one of the highest compliments in their language. The more fluent you become in all four languages, the more you’ll be able to avoid misunderstandings, and the better you’ll get along with other people. The key message in these blinks: There are four primary emotions: sad, mad, glad and afraid. We can conceptualize them as houses that we inhabit temporarily, with one of them being our primary place of residence. To move from one of the negative houses into the House of Glad, we need to “pay our RENT” – an acronym that stands for Rest, Exercise, Nutrition and Thoughts. A wide variety of simple tools, tricks and techniques can help us to approach these four areas of life in a healthy way. They include breathing exercises, working out in small doses, avoiding sugar and repeating affirmations to ourselves. By using softening words when giving feedback and understanding the different languages of different personality types, we can also improve our communication with others.  Actionable advice:  Spread the message.  You’ve just learned a bunch of ideas, tools, techniques and lingo that can help boost your happiness and success. But don’t keep them to yourself; spread them to your colleagues and make them part of your organization’s culture. One way to do this is to include them in your organization’s list of expectations. For example, your list might encourage your team members to pay their RENT, take Purple Breaks or do the 4-4-6 exercise in times of stress. You can also sprinkle these ideas and this language into your day-to-day interactions. For instance, to remind people that you’re Always Flexible and Adaptable, you might include the AFA acronym in response to an email asking you to reschedule a meeting.  Got feedback?

You’ll be facing a fast-approaching deadline while coworkers seem to be lined up at your desk vying for attention, and the number of unread emails in your inbox is reaching staggering new heights. It all seems like more than any one person can possibly manage! Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to reclaim peace of mind – and, while you’re at it, increase productivity. While finding ways of working undisturbed can be part of the solution, as author Bruce Daisley makes clear, there is a less intuitive part of productivity: the social aspect.  Yes, we need to block out distractions while we work, but there are limits to how much time we should spend working before the harmful effects of exhaustion set in. Plus, what we do when we take our much-needed breaks can also have a tremendous impact on our well-being and overall efficiency. In these blinks you’ll find how to get a productive day started before 11:00 a.m.; why you may want to take your next meeting outdoors; and why it’s important to laugh, even when things are grim. If you’ve worked in an office, you may have had bosses or company executives that would stay hidden away in her office for hours on end. Perhaps you even thought poorly of them for being so detached and unsociable. However, if we look at the reasons behind good working habits, those aloof bosses may have been onto something. For starters, keeping your workspace free of distractions is a key component to working efficiently. In 2011, Danish management researcher J.H. Pejtersen conducted a study that revealed how people working in open-plan office spaces tended to take more sick days than workers who have private offices. The study also showed that those working in an open office space tend to be interrupted from their work on an average of once every three minutes. These breaks in concentration aren’t just due to colleagues popping over to ask you a question – they also take the form of distracting conversations coming from neighboring desks and cubicles. What makes these interruptions so bad for your efficiency is that once your concentration is broken, it takes a long time for you to get back to that same level of focus. This is the same reason why you shouldn’t try to juggle too many tasks at the same time. In his book Quality Software Management, the computer scientist Gerald Weinberg found that software managers who tried to jump between five different projects during the same day would only manage to work at a quarter of the efficiency they’d have achieved if they stuck to one project at a time. One excellent way of reducing distractions is to practice the Monk Mode Morning, which involves shutting out all incoming calls and visitors until 11:00 a.m. At first, your office mates may not appreciate this distraction barricade, but if you explain that it isn’t about being antisocial, but rather an attempt to put in a few hours of uninterrupted work before engaging with phone calls and meetings, then they’ll likely understand.  If Monk Mode Morning sounds appealing but you don’t have an office door to enforce it, you can try using headphones until 11:00 a.m. in order to create your own space. If you’re feeling stuck with a creative task, especially one with a quickly approaching deadline, you may not feel like stepping away from your work to go for a stroll. Yet, as J.K. Rowling, author of the world-famous Harry Potter books says, “There’s nothing like a night-time stroll to give you ideas.” As it turns out, Rowling’s claim about the creative benefits of going for a walk are supported by science. In a 2014 study by two Stanford psychologists, Marily Oppezzo and Daniel Schwartz, participants were asked for creative responses to certain scenarios. For instance, coming up with uses for a key that is shaped like an eye. Some responses were considered uncreative, like using the key as an artificial eye. A highly creative response was for the key to be used by a murder victim to carve the name of their killer into the floor. After testing participants who either sat still or; got up, went for a walk and sat back down, 81 percent of those who took a stroll were found to be more creative with their answers. According to the researchers, the act of walking reinvigorated the participants’ thinking and led to better ideas. Oppezzo and Schwartz also found that it helped to sit back down afterward and concentrate in order for the ideas to flourish. One way of fitting more productive walks into your routine is to have a stroll while you’re conducting a meeting. Productivity expert and coach Chris Barez-Brown encourages his clients to go for walks with another person. During this time, one person is allowed to talk about a pressing issue without interruption for up to 30 minutes. Then, the two people switch roles and, for the rest of the walk, the other person gets to talk.  By walking with this purpose, you’ll both energize your thoughts by allowing each other to say whatever comes to mind without censoring or correcting each other. Barez-Brown has seen this work wonders for his clients, who often come back from their walks with added clarity and exciting ideas. It’s common to feel like you’re in a rush or under pressure to get things done, but did you know that having a persistent level of stress can affect your behavior?  Just think of those times when you’ve been waiting for the elevator and feel the need to keep pressing the call button again and again, even though you know it won’t make the elevator arrive any faster. This is a typical example of what’s known as hurry anxiety. Essentially, hurry anxiety is characterized by a constant low-grade stress due to the feeling that you’ll never be able to finish all that you want to accomplish. Hurry anxiety is especially common these days thanks to the level of connectivity and abundance of information that the internet age provides. For example, according to a 2015 study by the Radicati Group, which looked at the daily habits of 2.8 billion workers worldwide, the average person responds to 130 emails during a typical day. And these emails are just the tip of the iceberg! In his 2011 book, The Organized Mind, social scientist Daniel Levitin revealed that the average American worker processed around 100,000 words of information every day – which is five times more than what workers processed in 1986. Given all the tasks we hope to tick off and information we need to process, is it any wonder we feel constantly overwhelmed?  Well, fortunately for us, there are steps you can take to lessen those levels of anxiety. One of the important things to realize is that being constantly busy isn’t the same as being productive. In fact, instead of striving to be busy, you can be more productive by setting aside time in your daily schedule for doing nothing. According to Dr. Sandi Mann, who works at the University of Central Lancashire’s School of Psychology, we’re better at solving problems and coming up with innovative solutions when we engage with our brain’s default network. This is the part of the brain that includes the subconscious. It is when we are at rest and doing absolutely nothing that we can really tap into this source of creativity. So, make sure you include time off during your day when you can take a break from all those incoming messages and emails. And rather than stressing about every email, just focus on responding to the few that are truly urgent. In a 2013 interview, British tennis champion Andy Murray explained just how exhausting a tennis match can be. As he explained it, physical exhaustion is only part of it. A tennis match also results in a great deal of mental exhaustion, due to having to make so many split-second tactical decisions. As Murray’s comments suggest, we are only capable of making so many decisions before we’re left feeling exhausted, which is why there’s a limit to how much work we can do before our productivity begins to suffer. Ultimately, the more decisions we’re asked to make, the more exhausted we become and the more we’ll gravitate toward undemanding tasks.  In a 2008 study, psychologist Kathleen Vohs had participants make a series of decisions, such as which movie, ice-cream flavor or washing detergent was their favorite, or how to solve different problems – most of which were purposefully unsolvable.  In between making decisions, the participants were asked to choose which activities they would rather perform – a challenging activity, like creative writing or studying a new subject, or something easy like watching TV or playing a simple video game. As Vohs discovered, the participants not only showed signs of mental exhaustion early on, but as the level of exhaustion increased, so too did their preference toward less challenging activities. So, the next time you come home from work and can only muster the energy to collapse on the couch and stream the first thing you see on Netflix, this is likely a sign of decision-making mental fatigue. This exhaustion can also have repercussions at work – especially when people ignore these signs of fatigue and continue working. Scott Maxwell used to work for the consultancy company McKinsey, which was the kind of workplace where people would sleep under their desks so they could put in as many hours as possible. Eventually, Maxwell realized that this behavior wasn’t increasing productivity. In fact, after he launched his own venture capitalist company and studied the data, he found that an employee’s productivity routinely declined if they worked over 40 hours a week. So, just because you’re pushing yourself to work more hours, doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing better work. In the long run, by keeping your work under 40 hours a week, you’ll actually be more productive. Have you ever dreamed of having an all-seeing eye and monitoring every worker in your company to see how they’re really spending their time? If the answer is yes, then your dream may already be a reality thanks to the new technology behind sociometric badges. Developed by Alex Pentland, a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sociometric badges combine traditional ID badges with smartphone technology, and make it possible to monitor workplace dynamics. Now, all the data behind an employee’s movements and interactions can be recorded and analyzed to reveal valuable information about individual behavior, such as how much time an employee spends in face-to-face conversations, as well as group behavior. When combined with the data recorded in daily work activity logs, the information captured by sociometric badges can reveal patterns that may relate to increased productivity. For example, when Professor Pentland looked at his own data and activity logs, he could see that his breakthrough ideas were often accompanied by increased time spent talking to his colleagues. In other words, he discovered that the more conversations he had, the more productive he was. Pentland also found that the most productive conversations tended to take place in informal environments, such as an impromptu chat in the hallway or break room. In these places, employees could speak casually and comfortably, giving new ideas the freedom to emerge. In his studies, Pentland looked at employee data from call centers and banks, and found that up to 40 percent of their productivity could be traced back to ideas that were raised during such informal conversations.  So Pentland also came up with ways for companies to better encourage such interactions. He suggested making lunch tables longer so you could get more people sitting next to one another and increase familiarity between coworkers. Additionally, if you wanted to increase communication between two teams at work, Pentland found it highly effective to strategically place a coffee machine or tea kettle between the two groups. Finding the right data to monitor productivity can vary from job to job. But at a call center, the information is pretty straightforward: there, we can easily see the number of calls being made and the success rate of those calls. And because these numbers are so apparent, employees at call centers feel a lot of pressure to spend more time making more calls to boost those numbers. However, this approach isn’t very effective. It may sound counterintuitive, but a better way to boost productivity in a call center is to give people more social breaks. In 2014, Bank of America hired the company Humanyze to help find ways to improve workflow and efficiency. Ben Waber, the CEO of Humanyze, noticed that the employees at the bank’s call center would generally take individual, solitary breaks, so he suggested that employees should take their breaks in pairs. Since the sociometric badges also monitored biometric information, such as the stress levels of the employees, it was revealed that the switch to social breaks decreased stress levels by 19 percent, while increasing productivity by 23 percent. The reason this change made such a big difference is that social interactions can serve to balance out the challenges of work. After all, work is often isolating as well as stressful. For example, in a call center, employees are on their own in having to deal with customers who are often angry, rude or dismissive. To say it can be a dispiriting job is an understatement. Therefore, being able to share their troubles and talk about their difficulties can provide instant relief to a call center employee. And who better to confide in than a colleague who is going through the same ordeal? These social break conversations also make the job easier. A colleague who has been handling calls for years can provide a newcomer with a proven strategy for how to calm down difficult customers, or get skeptical customers to stay on the line. So, making sure that coworkers are taking breaks, and using those breaks to talk to one another, will not only improve productivity – it will also improve their well-being. There’s one group of people who shouldn’t get left out when it comes to the productive benefit of social interaction at the workplace, and that’s the employees who are working remotely. While working from home may make it easier to enter Monk Mode and block out distractions, it doesn’t help when it comes to taking social breaks. While they didn’t announce their reason, the lack of communication between colleagues is likely why Yahoo recently launched a policy that forbade remote work. Yahoo and other companies know that, when employees spend too much time away from company headquarters, it can hurt productivity. According to Ben Waber, CEO at Humanyze, remote workers only exchange a weekly average of 7.8 informal communications with their colleagues, while employees in the office averaged 38 per week. As we discussed in the previous blink, this communication is crucial for both productivity and employee well-being. So, there’s a good reason to have your employees under the same roof. But sometimes, in order to get people to open up and feel comfortable sharing ideas, employees need a social push in the form of a company gathering. When CEO Margaret Heffernan moved from the UK to the US, she noticed that the employees weren’t as open with one another. It was apparent that her new office didn’t have the same upbeat, background hum of conversation between people. One big difference that she picked up on was that her US colleagues didn’t gather after work in the pub like their UK counterparts did. The pub was an informal place where they could wait for the rush hour to subside and get to know one another. As a result, Heffernan launched a weekly social meeting time at the office, every Friday starting at 4:30 p.m. It started off a bit awkwardly, but eventually everyone began to relax and bonding was underway. Indeed, thanks to the weekly meetings, the individual employees became much better team collaborators. For teams to work and be productive, members need to trust and appreciate one another and, for this to happen, they need to bond socially. So informal work gatherings are an ideal place for this to happen – and should therefore be considered a valuable source of productivity. There’s a good chance you laughed a lot more as a child than you do now. Children can be such constant gigglers that they even get on the nerves of more serious adults. But the fact of the matter is, every adult could benefit from more laughter in their lives. As we’ve come to find out, laughing is an effective and valuable way of coping with life’s challenges – even if you’re experiencing the stresses of war.  In 2011, ethnographer Mark de Rond spent weeks embedded with the staff of a US Army hospital in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Remarkably, de Rond found that, even though the staff were forced to deal with hundreds of casualties and numerous deaths every week, they were always quick to laugh and share a joke. Certainly, the humor at the hospital tended to be more morbid than your average workplace, but it nonetheless served as a valuable counterbalance to the death and suffering that surrounded them on a daily basis. According to de Rond and other scientists, laughing is an effective coping strategy for balancing out the intense emotions and situations we face. So, it stands to reason that it can be a valuable practice when dealing with stress at the workplace. What’s more, laughter has also been shown to stimulate creativity. In a recent study at Drexel University, participants were asked to solve various puzzles. Leading up to the puzzle, some participants were shown jokes from comedian Robin Williams’s stand-up routine, while others approached the puzzles without laughter. In the end, those who watched Robin Williams were found to show 20 percent more creativity in solving the puzzles than those who didn’t. Adding more laughter into your day requires the development of a workplace culture where laughter is encouraged. This doesn't mean that everyone has to crack jokes all the time – rather, it’s about approaching work with an openness to sharing laughter with those around you, if the chance arises. A culture that encourages laughter is one where employees have a cheerful perspective on their work life and are willing to share a laugh about it from time to time. Remember, whatever the circumstances of your job may be, there are always opportunities to make it more enjoyable. The key message in these blinks: We need to develop a different work culture. One in which we have time and space in the mornings for working without distraction, for going on inspirational walks and having casual but productive conversations with coworkers. We need to put more emphasis on the social aspects of work by encouraging employees to take social breaks with their colleagues, where they feel free to open up and bond with one another. By working undistracted and being more social in the necessary breaks we take from work, we’ll be both happier and more productive. Actionable advice: Get plenty of sleep. Sleep is probably the easiest way to boost your work performance, and it takes little effort. All you have to do is rest.  Science has shown that enough sleep, typically 8 hours a night, not only improves concentration and performance the next day, but also makes you less likely to cave in to cravings for coffee or sweet treats. Plus, it just makes you happier. According to scientists, sleeping well reduces the amount of negative thoughts floating through your head.  So start tonight! Turn off your computer and refrain from doing anything too stimulating after 9 p.m. Instead, relax and engage in soothing activities until you’re tired enough to lay down to sleep. Chances are, you’ll get a great night’s sleep.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Computers are getting smarter and smarter. Boring, repetitive and safe jobs associated with the nine-to-five grind are disappearing. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that you’ll have to adapt to the new digital economy. So how do you do that? Well, you have to embrace creativity and become an artist. As Seth Godin emphasizes, art isn’t just about painting pictures and composing music, but any creative task that requires passion and ingenuity. Things, in other words, that computers just aren’t capable of. Being an artist isn’t easy. It requires absolute dedication and a thick skin. It’s also risky: unlike those old-fashioned office jobs, there’s no guaranteed salary for your efforts. But it’s more fulfilling and better for society as a whole. After all, who wouldn’t want to live in a world in which people devote themselves to pursuing things they really care about? But you don’t have to go it alone. These blinks put commonplace myths to bed and provide a wealth of advice on how to unleash your inner creative potential. Along the way, you’ll learn: why getting out of your comfort zone helps you do your best work; how society uses shame to make people conform to its expectations; and why obsession, grit and perseverance are more important than raw talent. The future will be increasingly automated. Machines will take over more and more manual and administrative tasks. So, what’s left for us humans? Well, we’ll need to become a lot more creative. But we’ve been far too slow in recognizing this. Blame it on the Icarus Deception. We live in a society in which we settle for too little. We’ve taken the Greek myth of Icarus to heart, but we’ve also misunderstood it. Icarus was the son of Daedalus, a craftsman thrown into prison together with his son for disobeying Minos, the king of Crete. Daedalus had a plan, however, and started building wings for himself and Icarus to help them escape. He told his son not to fly too high so that the sun would not melt the wax holding his wings together. Icarus didn’t listen and soared towards the sun. Sure enough, his wings melted, and he plunged to his death. Our culture has fixated on this part of the myth. “Don’t fly too high!” is the lesson we’ve learned. But that’s not all there is to it. Daedalus also warned Icarus not to fly too low, as the spray from the sea would saturate his wings and drag him down. Aiming for the stars can be risky, but so is being overly cautious. It’s worth remembering this second piece of advice. If we want to thrive, we need to get out of our comfort zone, meaning we mustn’t fly too low. After all, the world has changed. In the past, it was possible to land a safe and well-paid office job with rewards. That model came to an end in the 1990s. Today, steady employment is guaranteed only to creatives who aren’t afraid to take risks and initiate new ventures. Just think of internet startups like Facebook, launched at a time when the success of this kind of business model was far from certain. We need to learn from that. The new comfort zone is all about creativity and connecting with others. When a kitten is in distress, its parent comes and picks it up by the scruff of its neck and carries it to safety. A monkey, by contrast, has to actively grab its parent’s back if it wants to escape danger. In the new economy, humans need to be more like monkeys and less like kittens. We need to learn to be more proactive. So, what defines the new economy? Well, two things stand out. It’s more connected and there are fewer gatekeepers. These two features are linked. Because everyone is connected through the internet, it becomes harder for gatekeepers to tell us what to do or set limits. Take creative jobs. Would-be musicians or actors used to rely on the approval of authorities in their industries like agents or directors – the gatekeepers. Today, however, people can take their careers into their own hands. Platforms like YouTube and iTunes mean anyone can connect directly with their target audience and share their creative work. And that creates lots of new opportunities. Think of the music industry. Before the internet revolution, the path to the top was clearly defined. You waited to be talent-scouted by a label, wrote a hit and hoped you’d be lucky enough to avoid being ripped off by your employers. The chances of making it as a musician were slim. Today, none of that applies. Write and produce a song that just two people buy on iTunes, and you’ll have made more than the royalties you would have received back in the pre-internet days for selling a whole album! But it’s not just musicians who stand to benefit from the new connected economy. Designers, consultants, teachers and therapists can all set up online businesses on YouTube, personal websites and social media platforms and reach an audience of millions. There’s a Japanese word that describes what it’s like to fully commit to an activity and immerse yourself in it – kamiwaza. Literally translated, it means “like the gods.” That might sound terribly arrogant, but that’s because our own understanding of humility is flawed and in urgent need of redefinition. Humility doesn’t mean accepting poor performance or not trying one’s best. On the contrary, there’s humility in working hard to become as good as you possibly can at something. When you fully commit to a task, you lose yourself in it and are no longer self-conscious about what you’re doing. That means you stop worrying about other people’s opinions. That’s real humility. When you achieve that kind of humility, you become much better at working with and for other people – sharing your best self and achievements with others. It allows you to take on responsibilities and lead others while taking the initiative, even in the face of risks. In this sense, if, for example, you have a strong sense of fashion, it would be more humble to launch your own fashion label rather than stick with your job as an office clerk and deliver uninspired work there. Redefining humility in this way allows you to concentrate on contributing your best work to society without arrogance or selfishness. And there’s another point to be made about humility: it’s the precondition for being fully committed to your art. And commitment is key to success: if you keep your safe job and pursue your art – or anything you’re passionate about – in your spare time, you’re unlikely to achieve anything with it. Creating something that you put out there in the world and inspire people with takes humility and struggle. But there’s no guarantee you’ll succeed. Unlike a regular job, art doesn’t have a fixed salary. All your efforts might come to nothing. That’s a harsh truth, and accepting it requires both confidence and humility. What is grit? Not the stuff you sometimes find between salad leaves! In fact, it’s one of the most important assets an artist can have. To put it bluntly, if you want to be an artist, you must have grit. Art isn’t just painting pictures or composing music. It’s any activity that you pursue creatively with the aim of producing something new in the world. Maybe it’s a revolutionary customer service system, or a new form of abstract painting. Whatever it is, you’ll need grit to get it out there. Take it from psychologist Angela Duckworth, the author of Grit. She noted that lots of people think grit just means perseverance. They’re not quite the same thing, however. Grit is all about developing clear goals that reflect your true passions. That could be something like establishing a social platform to bring environmental campaigners together. The vision is key. Once you know what you want to achieve, it’s much easier to persevere in your quest to get it done.   But grit isn’t the only thing you’ll need as an artist in the new economy – you’ll also need to be independent in mind and spirit. External oversight gets in the way of pursuing your ambitions. To be a true artist, you’ll need to get rid of outside influences that control your work, like bosses and superiors. Independence also means learning to do without external motivation. To succeed, you’ll need to become self-sufficient. How good or bad you feel about yourself and your work shouldn’t depend on others’ approval. You’re the sole judge of your work. Finally, you’ll need to become indifferent to success and failure. Turn on the TV and you’ll see hundreds of successful acts producing throwaway music that’ll soon be forgotten. Acclaim doesn’t always reflect the true worth of what you’re producing. Remember, just because you’re not getting a ton of recognition, doesn’t mean what you’re doing isn’t great and profound! Superheroes can achieve pretty much anything, but they usually have an Achilles heel. Think of Superman and kryptonite, the alien mineral that instantly robs him of his powers. Artists have their own kryptonite to contend with, though it’s altogether less exotic than a material mined on distant planets: shame. So what makes artists so vulnerable to shame? Well, what defines them is their complete investment in their creative efforts. Their work is deeply personal and extraordinarily meaningful to them. That’s why criticism stings so much. Imagine that your boss criticized your ability to take accurate notes during meetings. You probably wouldn’t worry too much about it, right? But imagine how hard you’d take criticism of a start-up concept you’d been working on for months and strongly believed in. Criticism is often a way of shaming people. And shame has long been used to make people conform to societal expectations. Teachers, for example, often try to control students with independent spirits who think outside the box by shaming them in front of their peers. Society also holds us back from pursuing our dreams and becoming free by making us feel ashamed of what it tells us is arrogance or foolishness. That means you have to grow a thick skin and learn to ignore criticism if you want to make it as an artist. After all, shame will quickly block your endeavors. Your only option is to refuse to be deflected from your aim by what others say. The best way of doing that? Focus on positive connections and don’t seek out negative reviews and comments. After all, it only takes one negative comment to make you question yourself. The author Ray Bradbury once gave would-be creatives a bit of sound advice. The most important thing of all, he suggested, was to avoid getting stuck in one’s own mind. Being creative is about engaging with the world rather than constantly thinking about it. And if you want to engage, you have to learn to really look at the world. So what’s the importance of this? Well, success is all about recognizing opportunities. Usually, however, we see the world through our own tunnel vision. We interpret things according to our preconceptions, which clouds our judgments. Think of the way lots of people view new technologies. They worry about the way these will change the world for the worse and choose to ignore them. In the end, they miss out on all sorts of great opportunities. Just ask Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist who’s made a fortune off the back of looking at the world as it really is. Knowing which way the wind was blowing, he decided to invest in internet platforms like Twitter, which went on to become a massive success. Editors Alan Webber and Bill Taylor are another great example. They realized that internet start-ups were the businesses of the future and decided to launch Fast Company, a magazine covering this new sector, in 1995. It’s gone on to be a huge commercial success. What these pioneers have in common is a knack for recognizing opportunity when they see it. But that’s not something they were born with. They learned it by training themselves to be more observant. Small things really can make all the difference. Take it from author Paco Underhill, a man known for his attention to detail. While doing consulting work for a retail company, he noticed that female customers were put off by other customers brushing past them while they were shopping. He recommended that shops widen their aisles. The outcome? A tremendous increase in revenues! Steve Martin is one of the most successful comedians in the world but, actually, he’s not all that funny. How can that be?   Well, art isn’t as much about talent as it is about obsession. Martin is a classic example of this. In some ways, he’s an anti-comedian – he’s neither particularly expressive nor known for delivering laugh-out-loud punchlines. That explains why he spent so long failing at his chosen career, often traveling the country to perform shows in front of just three or four people. He didn’t let that put him off, however. He continued plying his trade and obsessing over small details like the perfect hand gesture or moment to end a sketch. That work paid off in the end. Because of his attention to the details of comedy, his non-comic side began amusing ever-larger audiences. He was hilarious precisely because he wasn’t a comic’s comic. Audiences started cheering him on, urging him to finish skits and completing Martin’s lines for him. Gradually, he became less of a comic and more of a host and entertainer.   That just goes to show that being an artist doesn’t always conform to common stereotypes. Another misconception is the notion that you have to be an impoverished tortured soul to make it as an artist. According to that image, the artist is an extravagant bohemian in tattered rags defying conventional morality. But, like the misleading idea of talent being crucial for success, this is a myth. Think of TED talks. Most of the speakers are perfectly ordinary people, not eccentrics. Sometimes, they’re even slightly dull. What makes them special is their absolute dedication to making a difference in their chosen fields. And that’s the mark of a true artist. Writers often talk about being “blocked.” But have you ever noticed that hardly anyone ever suffers from “speaker’s block?” Speaking just feels too natural to imagine not being able to get the words out there. After all, everyone gets up each day, sees people and talks to them. Writing, on the other hand, is an entirely different matter. Getting your thoughts onto paper is often the bottleneck in which your creativity gets trapped. The key is to treat writing like speaking. And that means doing it every day! You don’t worry about talking because it’s something you do automatically all the time. If you get into the habit of writing all the time, you’ll soon find that a blank page isn’t nearly as terrifying as it used to be. In fact, your writing will take on the same qualities as talking – you’ll find a flow and, eventually, your own unique voice. Practice, as they say, really does make perfect. So make it a rule that you sit down once a day and write about something that’s meaningful to you. Even better, get it out there in the world and put it on a blog. That same dynamic applies to everything you might want to do. If you’re an aspiring filmmaker, but find yourself feeling blocked every time you have a camera in your hand, get into the habit of filming every day. Do that enough, and it’ll become second nature. This requires self-discipline, but it’s important to remember to be a kind boss to yourself. Being your own boss is often trickier than being someone else’s boss. There are fewer boundaries, and it’s easy to end up being much tougher on yourself than anyone else. The best way of avoiding that is to pay attention to the way you talk to yourself. Make an effort to be constructive and encouraging, rather than purely critical. Point out, for example, what you’ve achieved and praise yourself, even it’s only a small thing. Most importantly, stop telling yourself you can’t do something! Remember Steve Martin from the earlier blink? That’s the kind of attitude you need to take on. Who cares if you’re not perfect yet – the only thing that’ll make you better is pursuing your passion relentlessly. Once you start doing that, you’ll be set to thrive in today’s changing world! The key message in these blinks: Art is about creativity, and that’s something you can apply to any field. Whether you’re an aspiring painter or opening a new online boutique, thinking creatively is what gives you an edge in today’s fast-paced digital economy. Computers can do the humdrum work, but there’s plenty of space for independent thinkers and creators full of great ideas and the passion to pursue them. So stop worrying about immediate success or the approval of others and get yourself out there! Actionable advice: Remember that art isn’t always going to be fun. Whatever it is that you want to create, there’ll be moments of struggle, challenge and even pain. But don’t despair. These are the hurdles every artist faces on his path. Embrace them and focus on how much suffering you can put up with. The vital question you’ll need to ask yourself is if the final product is really worth it (it usually is). That’ll help you accept pain as an inevitable part of your life as an artist. Once you’ve internalized that fact, you’re much less likely to give up on your project. Got feedback?

Well, the key to this is to better understand the influences involved and our underlying motivations. These blinks aim to highlight the aspects of human nature that go overlooked or are under-discussed and make sure that we understand just how influential they can be. For the most part, we don’t like to admit that we’re envious, self-centered and prone to group mentality. However, we all have these tendencies. Once we acknowledge these aspects of human nature, we can begin to make the best of it by curbing these impulses or even using them to our advantage. We are all complex individuals, but there are parts of the human experience that touch us all. With a better understanding of human nature, you can start to live a better life with more control over your impulses. In the following blinks, you’ll find why it’s better to have a farsighted perspective; why you should always maintain a “reality group;” and why it’s beneficial to keep death in mind. We like to think that modern human beings are a clever and highly rational bunch. But the truth is we tend to make a lot of our decisions based on the emotions we feel at any given moment, which means we’re often pretty irrational. This struggle between our emotional and rational sides has gone on for ages. One of the early champions of rational behavior was Pericles, a well-respected statesman in Athens around the fifth century BC. When Athens was under threat of attack by the Spartans, Pericles was able to convince leaders to show restraint and not engage in all-out war. Unfortunately, his wisdom didn’t prevail when Athens was struck by the plague and Pericles died. Instead, emotions took over and resulted in a costly and drawn-out war that brought Athens to its knees. The secret to Pericles’s wisdom was patience, and this is what we still need to rely on to curb our irrational decisions. If there was a problem or important decision to be made, Pericles would withdraw to his home and calmly think it over, consider all the potential consequences and make the decision that’s in everyone’s best interest, not just the leaders or wealthiest people. So, whenever possible, increase your reaction time so that you’re not making decisions in the heat of an emotional moment. And meanwhile, try to consider all the possible biases influencing the decision. There are a number of these, including confirmation bias, where we tend to seek out information that supports our prejudices, and conviction bias, that leads us to believe that the stronger our emotions are, the more something must be true. Other biases include the appearance bias, which leads us to believe that someone who looks appealing, whether it’s attractive or rich, must somehow be of good character. Then there’s the group bias, which leads us to believe whatever the group we belong to suggests. For example, if you’re a member of a right or left-leaning political party, you might agree with every one of the party standpoints without considering alternate views. Our biases can easily lead to bad decisions, so it’s always good to be skeptical, analytical and curious about differing viewpoints. Plus, it’s wise to balance thinking with your emotions. You don’t have to be an emotionless robot when making a decision, but you’re bound to make better decisions when you’re feeling calm. Along with our tendencies to be irrational, human nature also carries with it the need for a certain amount of attention and self-absorption. In fact, by our very nature, we’re all narcissistic to some extent. This means each of us exists on a spectrum, ranging from healthy levels of narcissism to deep narcissism. Deep narcissists are usually people with a faulty sense of self, where they see other people as an extension of themselves. This can be traced back to childhood and the years between two and five years old, the age when a person stops seeing themselves as an extension of their mother and develops a sense of individual personhood. At this point, deep narcissism can develop for two reasons: either the parent was too involved, preventing the establishment of an individual identity, or the parent didn’t give the child any attention, creating a sense of abandonment. This results in low self-esteem and feelings of insecurity. As a result, deep narcissists try to cope with their broken sense of self through behavior patterns that include jealousy, attention-seeking, over-controlling, taking everything personally and being unable to handle criticism. Ironically, narcissism is often associated with “self-love.” This is actually what many deep narcissists lack, a proper sense of self to love. Indeed, one of the best ways to gain a healthier level of narcissism is to create a sense of self that you can love, which will reduce insecurity and raise self-esteem. Empathy is another thing that deep narcissists lack, and this is one of the best tools you can have in life. Empathy is the ability to sense what others are going through, thereby connecting us to the people in our lives. It’s also great for recognizing people’s true character and having the insight to turn yourself into a person of superior character. When it comes to being a judge of character, it’s important to understand that we all wear masks in our day-to-day life. We’re always trying to win people over by presenting ourselves in what we think is the best light and saying things we think people want to hear. As Shakespeare famously wrote, “All the world’s a stage.” So we shouldn’t accept what we see and hear as a reflection of a person’s true character. A person’s true character often reveals itself in how they face adversity, work with other people and whether or not they learn and adapt. Each and every one of us has a character that is a mix of strong and weak qualities. Some of these qualities we gain genetically, others are from our upbringing. Then there are the ones we pick up later in life. For example, researchers have found evidence that some newborns are more hostile than others, suggesting that our aggression levels are genetic. But our innate traits aren’t a prison. We can control them, and even weak ones can be used to our advantage. No matter the cards we’ve been dealt in life, we can strive to be of superior character. The first step is to be honest and admit that our characteristics are part of human nature and are nothing to be ashamed of. We can start by taking an honest look at ourselves, our past mistakes and our weaknesses and strengths. For example, a hyperperfectionist, who feels the need to control everything and can’t delegate tasks, shouldn’t deny it and put herself into situations in which she’ll be smothering people or fighting for the spotlight. Instead, she should find work that allows her to be in charge of a workload that doesn’t require delegation. Another aspect of human nature that people don’t like to admit to is envy. Yet, it’s a simple fact that we all tend to covet what we don’t have. As the sayings goes, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and there’s always a better place just over the horizon. There are some biological reasons for our envious nature. For starters, we’re not wired to be complacent. Instead, we’re competitive by nature and feel the same strong desire for things whether we encounter them in the real world or in our imagination. One of the reasons we tend to deny our feelings of jealousy is because admitting we feel covetous is also admitting that we feel inferior to someone else. Still, it doesn’t do any good to ignore or deny our jealousy, and once we admit to the fact that everyone has these feelings, we can start putting it to work for us. Knowing that we covet what’s elusive, we can start to make ourselves more appealing to others by employing the traits of elusiveness. In other words, we can be a bit mysterious and hard to pin down. The more we make people use their imagination, the more fascinated they’ll be. You might wonder why so much money and attention goes toward fighting terrorism while global warming, which affects all living things on the planet, is trivialized. The reason is very much tied to human nature. You’re far more likely to react to something that’s right in front of you here and now. This short-sightedness goes back a long way, to when survival was based on immediate concerns, such as finding food and water and avoiding violent predators like the saber-toothed tiger. To perform at your best, you need to recognize the tendency to neglect the big picture in favor of immediate concerns. However, it’s far better to adopt a farsighted perspective. First, remember to take a step back when making decisions and calmly consider the problem at hand, what your options are and what the consequences are likely to be. When you also recognize that today’s problems are likely the consequence of actions taken in the past, you’ll be better able to assess them. You should also know that sometimes doing nothing is the best thing to do! Western culture often considers doing nothing a sign of weakness, but Japanese and Chinese cultures both recognize the strategic wisdom in waiting to see what happens and letting the enemy wear himself out. Another strategy is to know how to deal with people’s natural defensiveness. Everyone is defensive to some degree, because everyone privileges autonomy and free will. That’s why one of the best techniques for managing human nature is to make someone agree with our plan as though it was their idea. This is done by showing our appreciation of the other person, validating their individuality and intelligence and playing to their natural stubbornness. Take the early career trajectory of the US politician and eventual president, Lyndon B. Johnson. When he first became a senator, he already had a reputation of being a hotheaded Texan, but Johnson knew he wasn’t going to get far using the same rabble-rousing tactics he employed as a congressman. Instead, he became fast friends with veteran democrat Georgian senator Richard Russell, outwardly admiring his experience and expertise. Russel, in turn, was impressed with Johnson’s organizational skills and helped Johnson get a seat on the Armed Services Committee after just a year and a half in the Senate, which is practically unheard of for such a prestigious committee. Johnson’s shrewd but friendly tactics led him to become the youngest ever senate leader of the Democratic Party at the age of 44. Do you ever feel like you’re cursed, or perhaps doomed to failure? If so, it’s likely due to certain unhelpful traits that you need to recognize and get under control. When you look within and see what’s repeatedly causing the same negative outcomes, then you can turn things around and avoid future calamities. Believe it or not, one of the main contributors to self-sabotage is a negative attitude. Fortunately, that’s something you can change. If you think your bad attitude is justified, just look at the life of legendary playwright Anton Chekhov. When he was a young boy, Chekhov lived with a father who regularly beat him and forced him to work at his shop rather than do his school work. What’s more, due to his father’s bad business sense, his family had to flee to Moscow. In doing so they literally abandoned Chekhov when he was around sixteen years old, leaving him behind to fend for himself while he finished school. The only reason he survived was because he was able to find the odd job as a tutor. It would have been understandable if Chekhov had developed a pessimistic attitude. Yet what Chekhov had was a remarkable sense of empathy that enabled him to pity his father, rather than be angry with him. When his family left, it gave him the opportunity to see them in a new perspective, and he recognized that his father had to cope with his own terrible upbringing and that he was really a lost, helpless old man. When Chekhov felt forgiveness for his father, he felt as though his mind was finally free. He felt liberated from anger. Negative emotions must be let go. If you hold on to or repress feelings of anger or worthlessness, they’re likely to lead to a prison of your own making, where things like drugs and alcohol become ways to numb the pain and repress your true feelings. If you have a dark side to your personality, whether it’s negative feelings or just selfish impulses, the first step is to acknowledge it. Then you can begin to use it in positive ways. The author refers to the dark feelings one represses as a “shadow self,” and the more these feelings are repressed, the more destructive they can be when they come to the surface. Look at former US president Richard Nixon, who bottled up his feelings of resentment and abandonment until they led to destructive behavior that destroyed his presidency. If you know someone who’s experienced even a little success, you may have looked on in wonder as that success went to their head and they proceeded to lose touch with reality. This is known as the Law of Grandiosity. Take the career of Michael Eisner: In 1976, Eisner made the leap from successful TV executive to head of the Paramount film studio. During his tenure, Paramount had a string of hits, even becoming the leading studio in Hollywood for a period. In 1984, Eisner then became the new CEO of Disney and proceeded to oversee the release of fifteen hit movies that revitalized the struggling brand. Eisner also came up with the idea of strategically using the company’s back catalog in the burgeoning home video market. In Eisner’s eyes, everything he touched turned to gold. But then he focused his attention on theme parks and building Euro Disney in France. It was far from a success, with attendances around half of what they’d hoped for. But Eisner was quick to cast blame elsewhere. In 1994 he shocked the industry by firing his underling Jeffrey Katzenberg, who’d been largely responsible for many recent hits, including The Lion King. Eisner also declined to purchase Yahoo! and instead orchestrated Disney’s own internet portal called Go. It was another calamity that leaked vast amounts of money. Meanwhile, Katzenberg successfully sued Disney for $280 million in unpaid bonuses while Pixar CEO Steve Jobs said he would refuse to work with Disney ever again due to Eisner’s meddling. Finally, with Disney’s stock prices dwindling, Eisner was voted out by board members in September of 2005. As a TV and film executive, Eisner showed he had a keen grasp on the tastes of US audiences, but afterward, with Euro Disney and Go, he showed little understanding for the tastes of Europeans or what people want in an internet service. But Eisner had lost his sense of reality. In not accepting the limits of his expertise and instead feeling insecure and threatened by underlings like Katzenberg, he helped precipitate his own downfall. Surely, a person with a grip on reality would have known that someone with Katzenberg’s talents would become a competitor once fired from Disney, which is exactly what happened when Katzenberg helped found Dreamworks. When you experience success, it’s easy to forget that mentors and teammates, as well as timing and luck, likely helped you get there. So it’s important at the best of times to be aware of contributing factors and your own strengths, limits and weaknesses. Remember: be realistic. In 1463, Caterina Sforza was born into a powerful dynasty in Milan, Italy, giving her the chance to pursue whatever interests she had. From a young age, Caterina had been drawn to physical combat training as well as fashion and the arts, so she became a student of both. In other words, Caterina was free to indulge both her feminine and masculine sides, becoming a strong figure who fascinated both the men and women of Milan. This universal fascination is something that artists like David Bowie achieve as well, when they explore both the masculine and feminine parts of their personality. We attain masculinity and femininity both from our genes and our upbringing. Due to society’s influence, men generally repress their feminine side and women their masculine side, but we’re better off embracing this duality within us. For starters, it would improve our relationships, making us more empathetic to those of the opposite sex. It can also improve problem solving, creativity and confidence. Men and women tend to think of the world in different ways, with men looking closely to separate and categorize things and women stepping back to see patterns and connections. The best minds will have ready access to both ways of thinking. Another way to experience a big boost in life is to get closer to a sense of higher purpose. Since we’re all complex people, we can easily slip into a sense of aimlessness and feel a general lack of cohesion. But if we take a calm look within, we can find what it is that really excites us. Often, we can trace back our higher purpose to a moment in childhood. For Steve Jobs, it was seeing his first electronics store as a young boy. For Marie Curie, it was being immediately fascinated when seeing chemistry tools for the first time. For legendary film director Akira Kurosawa, it happened later in life when he worked as an assistant for another director, Kajiro Yamamoto. Until then, he hadn’t recognized the full potential of film. But standing behind Yamamoto, he experienced a transcendent moment where everything suddenly became clear and made sense. It’s these moments we should be searching for, as they’re the ones that point to a higher purpose in life. We like to think of ourselves as unique, civilized and sophisticated individuals with independent minds. But if we pay close attention to human nature, we see that we also spend a lot of time worrying about what others think and how well we fit into certain groups. While it’s true that we’ve come a long way from our tribal roots, we still tend to devolve into primitive, reactionary thinking when we’re part of a group. It’s not a pleasant thing to consider, but we’d all be better off to recognize that this tendency is within all of us. One of the best examples of group mentality gone wrong is the Chinese Cultural Revolution under Chairman Mao Zedong. The revolution was intended to be a rebellion against the elitists and their unfair hierarchies, but in a group mentality, any nuanced thinking went out the window. Soon, anyone wearing clothing that resembled Western fashion was attacked in the streets as being part of the elite. As a result, a police state formed to try and control the chaos, and the revolution ended up achieving the opposite of what it set out to accomplish. To avoid such things from happening, we should all be part of what the author calls a Reality Group. You can think of this group as the gold standard in teamwork,  where everyone stays focused on the original goal, while also making sure the group doesn’t get caught up in power plays or pointless disputes. This structure focuses on the beneficial aspects of teamwork, and emphasizes that people can accomplish great things when they cooperate. Another unpleasant aspect of human nature is entitlement. Although all of us will feel entitled from time to time, there is no institution that represents this unfortunate trait more than royalty. For centuries, people have been expected to honor and worship individuals just because they are born into a certain family. Though many royals demand respect and authority automatically, one monarch in particular can teach us how to really earn it. Queen Elizabeth I stands out in history as one of the few who wanted to earn the respect and loyalty of her subjects. So she declined her income and used that money to help the people of England, and she only made decisions she believed were in the best interest of her people. What Elizabeth understood is that the entitlement of earlier monarchs only leads to resentment. So we should all prove ourselves worthy of admiration by working hard, owning up to our mistakes and making sacrifices when it’s in the greater interest. In the mid-nineteenth century, businessman Maurice Clark met an unassuming guy who came from a troubled background. This was John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller’s father had been a notorious con man who would often take off suddenly, leaving his family with barely enough money to keep from starving. Clark didn’t know it at the time, but Rockefeller’s childhood left him with an obsession for accumulating money and being in control of an orderly and predictable environment – the things he’d grown up without. All Clark saw was a guy who was deeply religious and had a knack for irritating him to no end. The two men had gone into business together, but Rockefeller was so irritating in pressuring Clark to expand the business that Clark agreed to sell his shares of the business at an auction, thereby playing right into Rockefeller’s hands. Rockefeller bought those shares and turned that small initial business into the Standard Oil Company, one of the most powerful companies ever created. Rockefeller was an aggressive businessman, but he was a sophisticated aggressor. He knew how to read people’s motivations and recognize what people would accept in order to get what he wanted. We all have some level of aggression in us – our aggressive nature helped make us the dominant species on the planet – and we shouldn’t try to repress this part of our personality, as it will lead to passive aggression. Repressed anger can also show up as an internal voice that projects the aggression inward, toward yourself. It’s better to accept healthy levels of aggression and find ways to put it to good use. The first step is to recognize where the aggression comes from. It might be due to insecurities, domineering parents, trauma from childhood or wanting to control your environment. Once we understand our aggression, we can direct it toward productive ends, like using it to fuel ambitions and realize goals. We can use it as energy to be tenacious and fearless in pursuing a higher purpose. Plus, when we better understand aggression, we can recognize it in others and know how people use it to hide their own vulnerabilities. This can help us defeat an aggressor, and there are few things in life more rewarding than outwitting a bully. Back in the fourteenth century, the Egyptian historian Ibn Khaldun suggested that generations run in a cycle of four different types. The first is a revolutionary generation that brings about great change, which is followed by a generation of order and stability. The third generation focuses on pragmatism and comfort, while the fourth generation is one of inquiry and cynicism. The trends in this pattern aren’t set in stone, but we can see how each generation is influenced and responds to the one that came before it. For example, in the first half of the twentieth century, the US had the Silent Generation, who grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression and fought in World War II. By and large, they practiced conservative values. They were followed by the Baby Boomers who rebelled against their conservative parents and blossomed in the counterculture movement of the 1960s and ‘70s. They were followed by Generation X, who chafed against the perceived hypocrisy of their parents and championed pragmatism and self-reliance. Then came the Millenials, who in turn champion teamwork rather than individualism, and generally oppose conflict and confrontation. Understanding how generational values influence decision-making is more important than ever. Nowadays, the world is highly connected, and it’s very likely that we’ll see trends that span the globe in future generations. So by understanding today’s historical context, we’ll be well positioned to understand the zeitgeist of tomorrow. Finally, one of the biggest influences on our decisions has always been our sense of mortality. It’s easy to understand why a person would prefer not to think about death. However, its incredible influence on us is precisely why we should think about it. It makes little sense to deny the inevitability of death, and when it’s embraced, it can serve as a great motivator for leading a productive and vibrant life. It’s also a great source of empathy, since death is the great equalizer that unites us all. When twentieth-century American writer Flannery O’Connor discovered she had the fatal disease of lupus, she didn’t despair. In fact, she became more empathetic, open-minded and enthusiastic about life. The Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky had a similar reaction after a near-death experience – he felt reborn, with a renewed sense of wonder. So stop going through life on autopilot, with an inward, distracted gaze. Recognize how amazing it is that we exist on this planet to begin with, and commit to doing something beautiful to honor this remarkable gift. The key message in these blinks: Human nature is full of laws that greatly influence our day-to-day lives. These include the laws of irrationality, narcissism, envy, shortsightedness, aggression and the denial of death. Some of these laws are aspects of the human condition that aren’t easy to accept. Once you do accept their existence, though, you can begin to improve your life. With a better understanding of human nature, you can recognize when emotions are leading to irrational decisions, or when your opinions are too influenced by groups and organizations. Understanding human nature is also a way to understand the commonalities between all humans, which can provide a much-needed boost to your empathy levels. Actionable advice: Be motivated by the sublime. Take a moment to consider all that happened in order for life to occur on this planet. Against great odds, the right conditions fell into place, one thing led to another and billions of years later here you are reading this sentence. To grasp the amazing chain of events that led to your conscious life, as well as all the mountains, oceans, plants and wildlife, is to grasp what’s known as the sublime. Your life is a wondrous thing and you should never lose sight of this. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Well, provided that you hope to cross the finish line before collapsing from exhaustion, you would start out at a moderate speed and save some energy to give your all on the home stretch. A marathon is a long and demanding challenge, which may make you want to avoid it in the first place. What you may not realize, however, is that you have a marathon lying ahead of you – or perhaps you’re already running it now. This marathon is your career journey, and you may well be going at the wrong speed. These blinks will remind you how long a typical career path is. You will learn about the different stages of your career and which strategy you should apply in each of the stages. Find out how to develop your skills and see what it takes to succeed in the rapidly changing working world of today. You’ll also learn at what age you’ll make most of your wealth; the point at which you do not need to work on your weaknesses anymore; and what you owe the younger generation when you retire. When you think of your dream job, what do you see? How important is it that your work is appreciated and rewarded? Do you want to be able to learn, have fun and grow as you go along? These are the kind of questions that The Futures Company asked in 2015 when they tried to get to the bottom of what Americans consider a fulfilling career today. What they found was that people want a combination of financial success and happiness. Their poll found that 70 percent of people will choose happiness over financial perks when making career decisions; at the same time, however, 86 percent chose money as the most important factor overall. This tells us that financial success is important, but ideally, this money won’t come at the expense of happiness or a healthy work-life balance. As a result, we are seeing an increase in flexible work schedules, with more part-time roles, as well as freelance jobs, work-from-home opportunities and job-sharing offers. All of these are now viable alternatives to the traditional nine-to-five job. So the question now becomes: how can I put together the right strategy to build a flexible, fulfilling and balanced career? The answer to this lies in taking all the aspects of your life into consideration and emerging with a path that allows you to be successful without sacrificing important things like family, friends and health. After all, as career and motivation experts like Dan Pink and Tom Rath point out, a happy work life directly translates into higher productivity, better health and increased satisfaction. In the blinks that follow, we’ll take a closer look at the tools we need to create a healthy work-life balance and still have a successful career. Would you rather be given a dollar today or be able to save two dollars next month? Many of us would choose the first option, and we tend to make similar choices when it comes to our career by focusing on immediate rewards over long-term success. However, if you are serious about securing a fulfilling career, you’ll eventually need to look at things from a long-term perspective. After all, a career path covers a very long period of time, and the average US employee will spend more than 100,000 hours at work. This is more time than we’ll spend sleeping, and even when we’re not at work, we’re often thinking or worrying about it. But most people come at their careers from the wrong angle by only considering how to succeed as quickly as possible, rather than planning things out for the long term. There’s a saying that your career should be thought of as a marathon, not a sprint. And every marathon runner knows that they can’t start off running at full speed, or else they’ll never make it to the finish line. Much the same way, it’s important to consider that the average retirement age is 65, so you need to have the right mindset for planning that far ahead. This implies keeping important aspects in mind, such as your education, networking and your and your family’s happiness. Accumulating wealth is important, but keep in mind that most of this happens later in life. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, 85 to 90 percent of your personal wealth will likely be accumulated after your fortieth birthday. Until then, it’s best to take your time and figure out what you really like doing and how you can become an expert in your field. This way, you won’t be stuck doing something you hate for the next 45 years. There’s an old adage that says good things come in threes, and this applies to the three best ways you can spend your time in order to help create opportunities at any stage in your career. These three pillars are transferable skills, meaningful experiences and enduring relationships. So, let’s begin with the first of these and start building a useful skill set. To understand how important your skills are, picture being 40 years old, losing your job and being forced to start all over again on your own. For this scenario to work out, you’ll need a strong set of talents, which is why you should spend your twenties and thirties gaining skills. Now, the best ones to have are transferable skills, which can be applied to a variety of different jobs. You can get these by picking up academic degrees, foreign languages and computer skills, as well as more personal characteristics like communication skills and emotional intelligence. Having strong and persuasive communication skills is an excellent trait for any job, whether you’re in sales or a political activist trying to win people over. No matter what, this is an essential skill for success. These are especially important nowadays since the modern job market is unpredictable and constantly changing, so having transferable talents gives you a clear advantage. Now, while you’re collecting skills, you should also be working in different environments in order to build meaningful experiences. People who spend their career in one environment probably know how to do one thing efficiently but get overwhelmed when confronted with something out of the ordinary. With a diverse job history, you’ll improve your decision-making skills by picking up different perspectives, which will make you more appealing to potential employers. So take chances and move from a corporate environment into an entrepreneurial one that might provide the opportunity to launch a new brand from the ground up. Or perhaps work abroad for a while. Either way, don’t be afraid to fail, as failure also comes with important lessons. Next up, we’ll look at enduring relationships. Now, let’s look at that third category of time well spent: enduring relationships. Whether you know it or not, work relationships offer the biggest source of support for your career, because no matter what field you’re in, the smartest and most successful people all got there with advice from others. The best relationships you can form all fall into one of four levels: The first level is your basic contacts, which covers everyone who’s ever entered your life. These are unfiltered connections that include all your social network platforms, including e-mail, LinkedIn and Facebook contacts, as well as Twitter and Instagram followers. These might not be the strongest connections, but they’re useful for sharing a message, such as the launch of a new product, with as many people as possible. However, if you want one of these contacts to take action on your behalf, you’ll have to raise them to one of the following levels. The second level contains the experts, who are people that carry specific knowledge and have access to certain information that could one day be the solution to a major problem. It’s important to maintain a good relationship here, which you can do by readily offering them your own expertise. At the third level are the critical colleagues, which include your boss and other people who have the most impact on your career success. They might be the deciding factor in promotions and pay raises, and are largely responsible for your general happiness at work. Finally, the fourth level contains the champions, such as your mentors and the small number of people who are there to offer support and advice. These might include a former professor or colleague who can provide a good reference for you. Naturally, these are people who should receive regular appreciation and goodwill. Now that you have them in order, it’s good to regularly check in and identify your key contacts. And it’s always good to spend the most time with those who make you feel intelligent, stronger and more able to conquer your career goals. Careers last an average of 45 years, which is such a long time that it can be helpful to think of it in three separate stages, each of them lasting for about 15 years. The first stage is all about getting yourself in the game, so this includes putting together a plan for your job search and building connections to land that first gig. Creating a spreadsheet can be useful, as you can fill in the first column with around 20 different companies that you would be interested in working for. Then, start researching these businesses and try to find contacts that can help you get your foot in the door. LinkedIn can be a good tool for establishing these contacts, as can your alumni network, which might contain someone who works at one of these companies. Once you find a connection, send a short e-mail, along with your resume, to see if they’d be willing to spend 15 to 20 minutes talking about their job. A short phone call will give you the chance to find out what skills the company is looking for, what the company culture is like and what your contact likes and dislikes about the job. In job hunting, having a connection within the company always provides a huge advantage and increases your chances of getting that first interview and landing the job. This first stage is also a time to discover what you are good at and improving these skills. Discovering what you are good at can be as simple as creating a list of what you enjoy and don’t enjoy doing. No matter what, the 15 years of the first stage in your career should always be about finding ways to continue accumulating knowledge, better understand your strengths and overcome your weaknesses. Everyone has weaknesses, such as public speaking, for instance, which can be improved by taking a class to learn different tips and tricks for making yourself comfortable in front of others. The main goal here is to lay a solid foundation to build upon during the next two stages. Just as stage one is about finding what you’re good at, stage two is about becoming an expert at it by building upon your core strengths and making sure you stand out from the rest. A great way to set yourself apart is to find your “sweet spot,” which is the intersection between what you are good at, what you love doing and which service you can provide the world. So, if you are a talented communicator, you might focus your time and energy on building a reputation as being the best public speaker in your company. Or, if you are a creative genius, work at becoming the company’s visionary and go-to person for innovative ideas. Whatever it is that you’re good at, highlight it and make sure others recognize it as well. During this second 15-year stage in your career, you should be familiar with your weaknesses as well as your strengths. You can use this information to your advantage by building a strong team that contains people with skills that complement one another. No one is perfect, so use this time to surround yourself with teammates that can compensate for the areas that aren’t your strongest. Maybe those public speaking classes still didn’t make you a master of delivering a sales pitch to potential investors – so keep an eye out for the person that is great at selling ideas and winning people over. During the second stage, you can put together all the pieces you need to sell your expertise as something that could benefit any company. In the next and final blink, we’ll find out how everything comes together in the third stage. Remarkably, the average life expectancy for those in first-world countries has grown by 30 years over the past century, which means a person’s career can last longer than it ever has before. But there are still preparations that need to be made, which is why the third stage of your career is all about setting the stage to pass your expertise on to the next generation. For many people, work provides a purpose and motivation to get up in the morning, while also being a source of satisfaction. As such, reaching retirement age isn’t everyone’s idea of a blessing. But if you plan ahead, you can still pass the torch on to others and maintain a sense of contribution and value. Succession is one of the most popular ways to go about this, as it ensures your company is prepared and can seamlessly transition from one leader to the next. The formal way to set up a succession is to write everything out in documents that detail all your responsibilities, contacts, ongoing projects and the long-term goals you have for the company. Another way is to have internal training and mentoring sessions at the company to share your knowledge and all the best practices that you’ve developed over the years. These sessions can even be recorded and stored using programs like Google Hangouts. Depending on your area and depth of knowledge, your third stage could include time spent teaching a college course or perhaps offering classes in your neighborhood to help people of all ages learn a new skill. But just because this is the final stage in your career, it doesn’t mean you should stop learning. Things are changing quickly, especially in the business world, and it’s important to stay up-to-date on all the latest developments if your expertise is going to stay relevant. If you work in marketing, you can’t ignore emerging topics like e-commerce and marketing automation. So, use your mentoring sessions with the younger generation to both pass on knowledge and stay informed on current topics. This way, the final stage of your career can be one of respect and personal accomplishment. The key message in this book: We often underestimate how long a career is and miss out on the big picture by focusing on short-term successes. We can fix this short-sightedness by recognizing the long journey that constitutes a successful career and equipping ourselves with the right skills and relevant experiences to attain long-term satisfaction.  Actionable Advice Ask your boss and colleagues for feedback. If your company doesn’t offer any performance reviews, you might want to speak with your boss and suggest that these start taking place on a regular basis. Receiving feedback from your superiors and peers is a great way to learn about your strengths and weaknesses, which, in turn, will help you improve your performance. Got feedback?

Schwartz","summary":"Everyone has goals throughout their lives. These range from small tasks, like cleaning out the garage before the weekend, to life-changing achievements, like saving $20,000 in ten years. When you are ready to start working toward your goals, you may wonder. How do I even begin? The best approach to overcoming this daunting question is to start by believing in yourself. This means honing a mindset in which you feel 100 percent capable of doing anything you set your mind to. This works because once you start truly believing you can accomplish something, the mind releases creative power – the mental focus necessary for finding ways to accomplish your goals. The more you believe in yourself, the more creative power is released. This means even the most challenging goals, like becoming vice president of your company, become feasible as long as your level of belief matches the task’s difficulty. Believing in yourself also creates another great advantage: other people start believing in you too. This is what a study by the McKinsey Foundation for Management Research found. They interviewed business, government, science and religious leaders to see what types of people they preferred to work with. And their most desired trait in a candidate? A sheer desire to get ahead – a trait which is contingent on how much a person believes in themselves. This desire, or belief, is what societal leaders associate with success. It’s what keeps individuals motivated, regardless of any hurdles they encounter. This is a perfect quality in a candidate because it means they won’t give up. By simply believing you can succeed, your mental power will shift to help you get the job done, and as a byproduct you’ll create a support system by inspiring others to place confidence in you. You might be familiar with the term “knowledge is power,” which means that the more we know, the more we can do. This saying fails to distinguish between the two types of knowledge: fact memorization and creative thinking. With fact memorization, you learn pieces of information and store them in the brain to be recalled later. But many of these remembered facts end up like old boxes in a garage: you only access them when you need what’s inside. Creative thinking, on the other hand, is focused on finding innovative solutions. This means crafting new, improved approaches for handling any kind of problem or challenge. Although memorizing facts is important in its own right, creative thinking gives us the ability to quickly and efficiently overcome any hurdles we encounter. Fact memorization makes our brains rigid; creative thinking makes our brains adaptive and flexible. This means that successful people always focus on improving their creative thinking rather than merely trying to remember facts. You can boost creative thinking with these three actions: be receptive to new ideas, take as many opportunities as possible to try new things, and devote ten minutes each morning to reflecting on the question, “How can I do a better job today?” One way you can help promote these three actions is by diversifying your lifestyle. For example, make sure you spend time with people who support you yet also challenge your beliefs and ideas openly. Or join a community group in an area outside your occupation. If you’re a car salesman, for example, you may find it interesting to join something as far removed from your line of work as a graphic design club. This will bring new skills and – who knows – maybe allow you to eventually start designing advertisements for your company. In today’s society, negativity is everywhere – from murders reported by the news to advertisements that try to make us feel fat or ugly. But it’s not only the media being negative. Even the people closest to us often spew “you-can’t-make-it-so-don’t-even-try” propaganda – for example, your best friends might start criticizing your dream of becoming president of a company. After a while, we get so used to negative thinking that it feels normal. Our negative thoughts work like mental monsters: the more we let them into our psyche, the stronger they become, until they completely overpower our positive thinking. But the truth is that negative thinking isn’t normal or healthy. In fact, it’s one of the main things that keeps people from becoming successful. This is why people who say “it can’t be done” are almost always unsuccessful or average. Clearly, then, it’s necessary to get rid of that negativity in order to achieve your dreams. To do this, start thinking and acting positively every day. This will help you eradicate negativity by not giving it space to fester in your mind. The best way you can do this is by writing yourself a pep talk that reads like an advertisement: a “sell-yourself-to-yourself” commercial in which you remind yourself of your best traits and of how they distinguish you from everyone else. Say this “commercial” out loud in private at least once a day, and read it silently several times a day. Soon you’ll believe in yourself so much that the outside world’s negativity will deflect off you like rain off an umbrella. For example, if you’re a teacher and you recognize that you make your students laugh, remind yourself that this is what separates you from other teachers. By recognizing this distinguishable trait, you’re identifying yourself as an influential member of the faculty, which will boost your confidence and encourage you to contribute your best every day. Have you ever had a co-worker be mean to you for no reason? Naturally, your first reaction would be to brand them as angry, or maybe even crazy. What you have lost sight of, though, is that they’re just like you – and chances are they’re only reacting against you because they’re being affected by something else going on in their lives. Knowing this, you should still treat them as you’d wish to be treated yourself: like an important individual. If you treat everyone you know and encounter like they’re important, you’ll notice they will stop being mean to you and will start thinking of you and treating you the same way. This also means that these people will most likely be by your side as you’re trying to make your way to the top. And their support, you'll find, is crucial for your own success. Why? Because it’s rare for a single person to “pull themselves up” to a higher level job or position of success with no help. More commonly, you’ll be “lifted” by your equals and subordinates – the people around you. Which makes it no surprise, then, that successful people are committed to nurturing relationships with the people around them. American ex-President Lyndon Johnson, for example, followed his own ten-point formula for success, which promoted such practices as memorizing everyone’s names and making sure he congratulated the people he knew any time they achieved a success. So remember, at the end of the day, no one ever becomes a success on their own. This is why you should treat each encounter with another person like it’s the one that makes or breaks your career. You’re probably familiar with the phrase “you are what you eat,” which implies you should follow a healthy diet if you wish to have a healthy body. That same idea applies to your mentality: the way you think is influenced by what you see and hear. Your living space, your friends, what you read – all of these act as “mind food” and are instrumental in influencing your thought processes. For example, prolonged association with people who gossip will make you more likely to gossip. Conversely, prolonged association with people who only speak positively of others will cause you to do the same. Make no mistake: you are affected by the company you keep. Therefore, in order to become successful, do what successful people do: create a high-quality environment for yourself. Do this by making sure that your home, study area, work area, social circle and leisure time are all of the highest quality, meaning that they encourage you to grow as a person. One way you can do this is by surrounding yourself with other successful people and studying them. When you have questions or are searching for advice, be sure to ask only those who are successful and are where you want to be in life. After all, the highest quality professionals always give the highest quality advice. Also, be sure to surround yourself with the highest quality of friends – those who not only have their own ambitions but also believe in your ambitions and believe you’re capable of achieving them. Having this support system behind you will keep you motivated along the long, sometimes daunting, path to success. In the end, if you want to be successful and accomplish your dreams, make sure you’re living in an environment that supports these goals. Sometimes when you’re speaking with a friend or significant other, you can tell when they’re feeling uncomfortable or down, even if they choose not to talk about it. This is because our attitudes and outlook on life are always clear to others. How are we so good at detecting this? Because for millions of years, our evolutionary ancestors had no language. Communication depended on understanding body and facial expressions, not words and sentences. We can read attitudes because in the past this ability helped keep our ancestors alive. Attitudes are mirrors of the mind. People will always pick up on them, and a person with a bad attitude will receive a different reaction from someone with a positive attitude. Therefore, if you want to get the best outcome from encounters with others, you need to adopt an attitude that brims with positivity. One way to keep a positive attitude is to make sure you’re doing what you believe is morally right. When people do things they don’t feel good about – like lying to a significant other or taking from a friend without asking – it harbors guilt and erodes confidence. These negativities always show up in a bad attitude. Being happy and comfortable with your decisions, on the other hand, builds more confidence and therefore sustains your better moods. In a completely different vein, another way to stoke a positive attitude is to look your best. When you dress well, it makes you feel important and makes others think you’re important. Try to do this all the time, even outside fancy occasions. But most importantly, nothing provides a positive attitude like believing that what you’re doing in life is important and worthwhile. This will naturally become a perpetual source for confidence, and leave you little reason to ever feel doubt toward yourself. The advice “fear is all in your head” is often given to help people overcome their hesitancy toward entering situations they’re uncertain about. But whether or not one's fear is self-created or legitimate, the fact is that fear does exist. And it can become the number one enemy preventing you from being successful in what you want to do. A common fear is the fear of other people. This stems from forgetting that others are just like you. There are no “supermen” or “superwomen” – everyone is fundamentally the same as everyone else. Nevertheless, this fear, if left unchecked, can have devastating effects on your success. Regardless of what kind of fear you’re facing, it needs to be known that all fears have the same antidote: confidence. Consider confidence to be an immune system protecting you against fear. The stronger your confidence, the less likely it is that fear will have a debilitating effect on you. Just as our immune system needs proper nourishment to function, our confidence needs continuous support to ensure it’s as strong and effective as possible. What is one of the best ways to build confidence? Start acting confident – even if you don’t feel it. At first this will be difficult to sustain, but over time it’ll become natural. This is because you can manage your emotions by behaving the way you want to feel. Try sitting in the front row during classes or presentations, making more eye contact with other people, and walking 25 percent faster than usual. These actions build confidence because they make you stand out from the crowd and cause you to increase your interactions with others – thereby strengthening your self-awareness. Just remember that no one is born with confidence. At the end of the day, even the most confident people had to work for their confidence. Everyone has their own unique take on the classic statement that “There are two kinds of people in the world...” Two types of people we can all generally identify with, though, are failures and successful people: those who have failed to actualize their potential, and those who have made themselves a success in their career or lifestyle. What is it, though, about successful people that keeps them from drifting over into the “failure” category? It’s their ability to bounce back after setbacks. While failures are busy finding excuses for why they failed, successful people are dusting themselves off and looking for another way to try. At the end of the day, every successful person has encountered the same opposition, discouragement, setbacks and personal misfortunes as failures – but the way they chose to handle these challenges made them the leaders of the pack. For an example of how successful people get creative, consider the following tale: A young couple wanted to buy a house but found out they were unable to afford the down payments. While many people would have taken this as a sign to give up or make excuses for themselves, this couple decided to think creatively. The husband contacted the house’s builder and asked for a private loan to cover the initial payment. To afford the $100 monthly loan payments, the couple decided to cut back on $25 worth of spending each month, and the husband convinced his boss to let him work extra hours on weekends to make up the extra $75. Eventually, because he had developed the traits of a successful person and honed them, he was able to secure the house and get on the property ladder. If you’re someone who knows what you want to do in life, it was probably pretty exciting to reach that realization. But on the path to success, that’s the easiest part. Goals are easy to generate but become pointless without action. And before taking action, you need to solidify a plan to make sure achieving your goal can become a reality. A plan for success should describe the steps you need to take, how to take them, and when exactly you can expect to see results. Base your plan on the attitudes and techniques of successful people. Look at your idols and ask yourself, “How did they do it?” Of course, even with the most rigorous plans, nothing ever goes 100 percent as expected. When you encounter setbacks or delays, learn how to use these hiccups as opportunities to improve your chances of avoiding them in the future. Doctors perform autopsies to better understand the cause of someone’s death, and the Civil Aviation Administration studies plane-crash sites to find out what went wrong. This is because studying the cause of a problem or disaster teaches us how to avoid these things in the future. And this is the same exact logic behind studying your setbacks. After encountering a setback, never put your energy into discouraging or berating yourself. Only put your energy toward answering the question, “What can I do to make myself more deserving of the next opportunity?” So to reach your goals, first ensure that you have a workable plan. Remember, though, that no plan comes without its setbacks. When they happen, analyze them – this way you're ensuring you continue forward on the path to success and you will be stronger than ever before. The main message of this book: In order to become a success, the most important tool is self-belief. Successful people aren’t any more talented or deserving than other people – they’re just more driven and more confident because of their self-belief. But these aspects lie nascent within everyone, and once realized they make the path to success an accomplishable reality. Actionable ideas from this book in blinks  Listen more, talk less. Whether you’re speaking with someone you’ve just met or with your childhood best friend, be sure to spend more time listening to what they have to say than talking about yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in speaking about yourself because “you” are the subject you’re most knowledgeable about. But in order to show others you care, and therefore get them to have an interest in and like you, you need to make sure your conversations focus around asking them questions and thinking carefully about their answers. The best questions to ask are the ones that challenge your beliefs or ideas, because they always lead to fruitful, engaging discussions. Invest in the most important investment you will ever come across: yourself. By buying books written by experts in the fields you’re interested in, paying tuition to take classes and enhance your knowledge in a certain subject, or signing up for a subscription to a thought-provoking journal, you’re making investments in your knowledge and enhancing the power of your mind.  On the path to success, “yourself” is the most important place to put your money. The more you shape yourself with “tools” to reach the success you want, the more confident you become. This confidence works in a perpetual cycle by promoting self-belief and pushing you closer to realizing your goals. Avoid menial detours that take your attention away from the task at hand. You’ll most likely reach a point while working on a challenging project – like writing a novel – when you start finding excuses to take a step away. Suddenly stopping work to walk the dog, take a nap, or talk on the phone, and so on, all become incredibly appealing – and easy – ways to spend your time. While these may all be important in some ways, don’t fool yourself into thinking they’re not taking you away from your work. If you truly want to be successful, you need to devote yourself to every second of your designated work hours. Whenever the temptation comes up, tell yourself, “No. I’m ready to work right now. I’m in perfect condition to work right now.” Repeat this until the urge goes away and then get back to the task at hand.","headers":["If you believe you can accomplish your goals, others will start supporting and believing you too.","Instead of memorizing facts, do what successful people do and sharpen your creative-thinking skills.","Eradicate all negative thoughts by thinking and acting positively, every day.","No one is an island: success depends on the support of others, so treat everybody with respect.","From the friends you keep to the advice you take, ensure that your environment is of the highest quality.","Watch your attitude: it’s speaking for you even when you don’t open your mouth.","Destroy fear – the number one enemy of success – by building confidence.","Failures are eager to find excuses for why they fail, while successful people are eager to find ways to try again.","Reach your goals via two steps: devise a plan and, as you make progress, study all setbacks or mistakes you encounter along the way. ","Final summary"],"category":"Career","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/52fa321f6662610011140000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"The Magic of Thinking Big (1959) unveils why believing in ourselves is a pivotal key to success, and how we’re each capable of achieving any of the goals we’ve always dreamed of.

But how much can these incredible stories teach us? Are the glittering press releases giving us the truth about their rise to the top, or are we only getting the sanitized version that they want us to hear? Understanding how the most successful companies got to where they are today is crucial, given that 90 percent of all start-ups crash and burn before making any impact on the marketplace. When entering into an exciting and uncertain start-up journey of our own, how do we make sure it ends up being one of the successes? While many guides focus on either kicking off or concluding your venture, we’ll discover that the real determinant of accomplishment is whether you can weather the highs and lows after you’ve already gotten your project started and your initial funding secured. In other words, the key to start-up success is found in the messy middle. Read on to learn why preparing for long-term accomplishment feels counterproductive; why you should be focused on fixing what works, not what’s broken; and why you should never think of your project as finished. Beginning a new venture is akin to setting out on an arduous journey. Whether your chosen field is entrepreneurial or artistic, you’ll probably share similar fears and hopes with the other people trying to strike out and plunge into something new. But regardless of what it is you’re attempting to create, you’ll undoubtedly encounter the messy middle. The messy middle of any worthwhile venture is incredibly volatile – a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, during which your enthusiasm and your venture itself will expand and contract seemingly without warning. Once you and your new project are out of the initial honeymoon phase – when you’re blissfully unaware of how much you don’t know – you’ll likely feel lost. Why? Because the middle of a project is all about finding a direction, making progress, and then stumbling and losing your way again. Your task is to weather the lows, enjoy the highs, and keep pushing to ensure each low isn’t as low as the low before, and each high is higher. When you’re in the thick of it, this mid-section might look like its made of only downhills and uphills, but after a while, you’ll hopefully see an upward-slanted median toward successful completion. This is what the journey to accomplishment looks like. If you’re not convinced, just consider the author’s path. After founding in 2006 an online platform called Behance for connecting professionals working in creative industries, Scott Belsky experienced his own messy middle, which lasted for several years. During this time, there were periods when his whole project seemed on the verge of falling to pieces. No one beyond his employees cared for or understood his idea, and if anyone did show an interest in the project, all they expressed were doubts. During this difficult stage of his business, Belsky was so crippled with worry and self-doubt that he could only maintain an appetite by taking anti-nausea pills. Many entrepreneurs feel uncomfortable talking about this ugly period in their lives, but this is the reality of the messy middle. If you’ve ever tried your hand at something entrepreneurial or creative, you’ll know that any prosperous venture requires vast amounts of time and commitment. And whether your project involves writing a novel or launching a start-up, you’ll likely face hurdles. Unfortunately, these hardships are often compounded by the fact that, during your journey to success, you’ll likely receive little to no external rewards. Instead of reaping profits, you’ll be spending money. Instead of adoring customers, you’ll be struggling to inform people that your business even exists. So how can you stay motivated when no one is rewarding you for your hard work, and the big pay-off still seems far away? This question is an important one because humans tend to have a preference for short-term rewards over long-term. Throughout our lives, we are taught to pursue short-term rewards. As children, we get high grades as a reward for learning. These grades also earn us rewards in the form of approval from our teachers, classmates and parents. This short-term reward system doesn’t stop in our adult lives either. As soon as we find ourselves in a traditional job, we’re rewarded with a regular salary – a short-term reward that gratifies us each month. In contrast, entrepreneurial and creative ventures don’t offer much in the way of short-term rewards. To satisfy our need for them, we need to get creative. Your project may not be rewarding you with profits or customers yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t manufacture your short-term goals, and reward yourself for achieving them. When Belsky founded his start-up, he was not rewarded with profits or external recognition until he was several years into the project. He, therefore, set about manufacturing his own short-term goal and reward system. For example, after realizing that Google’s search engine was failing to recognize “behance” as a legitimate search word, Belsky set a team goal: that Google would recognize the name of his company without auto-correcting it to “enhance.” When the team achieved this milestone, he made sure they all celebrated it, even if it was only with cheap Champagne. Thus, he was able to give himself and his employees a sense of a reward, even in the absence of traditional markers of success, such as profits and customers. During your entrepreneurial journey, you’ll inevitably experience both the triumphs and failures and these will have an impact on your project. But what’s less obvious is that these extremes will also have a significant effect on you as a person. This is where self-awareness becomes indispensable. Why? Because understanding how the highs and lows of an entrepreneurial journey may adversely influence you will help you to remain clear-sighted, even in extreme times. Self-awareness begins with the understanding that when you’re in a valley or a peak, you’re likely to become a worse version of yourself. When a project is going well, our ego often takes over. This has negative implications for our decision-making abilities and thus for our ventures. Why? Because we will be more likely to believe that our opinion is the only one that matters and become less receptive to good advice or subtle signals that something may be wrong. In other words, we become overconfident. Conversely, when things get tough, our insecurities might get the best of us. This is because, when we become stressed, we often feel vulnerable. To cope with these feelings of vulnerability, we may try to boost our confidence by unfairly blaming those around us for the problems. After all, it’s less threatening to point the finger at someone else than ourselves. Therefore, whether we find ourselves at a trough or peak, we must always fight to stay self-aware. To achieve success, you’ll also need enough awareness to act on other people’s feedback and criticisms when developing your project. In the author’s experience, the start-up founders with the most potential for accomplishment are also those who are the least defensive when it comes to listening to difficult truths about the strengths and weaknesses of their venture. Founders able to keep their minds open to feedback and integrate good suggestions into their operations will usually outperform those who are hostile to constructive criticism. Furthermore, the best founders are proactive in seeking constructive criticism and feedback. They aren’t just open to feedback – they go looking for it. If you know you have a tendency to become defensive when people give you feedback, have the self-awareness to change your ways. Try to become more receptive to the insights of others and don’t go on the offensive every time someone tries to give you some advice. The human brain is excellent at identifying cause and effect and understanding the short-term consequences of actions. But we often struggle to project chain reactions. Our failure to take into account the long-term means we neglect to lay the foundations for future accomplishments and opportunities. Playing the long game in business requires you to disregard the usual principles of productivity occasionally. You’ll spend significant time exploring ideas and avenues which offer little hope of any short-term business transactions, but which help you to build the strong working relationships that might yield fruitful collaborations several years in the future. Bill Gurley, the investor behind prosperous start-ups like Uber, is renowned for his in-depth exploration of potential new business interests, even though his schedule is also packed with short-term profit-making activities. Whether he’s building relationships with people in industries as diverse as the healthcare sector or in the transportation industry, Gurley typically pursues different ideas and interests for months or even years. This huge, long-term time investment doesn’t bother him, even when the interest never presents an opportunity for his investment. Why? Because he never feels like he’s in a race against the clock to complete a transaction. Instead, he has a genuine curiosity about his chosen field of work, appreciates that he’s in it for the long haul, and so accepts that most relationships take time to pay off – if they ever do. To play the long game, you’ll have to be willing to invest time, energy and money in those whose current ideas or projects are perhaps not viable, but who you believe have great potential to add value to your business in the future. Unfortunately, history is littered with business leaders who didn’t have the foresight to play the long game. The internet-streaming giant Netflix approached video rental chain Blockbuster back in 2000, when Netflix was a promising but not yet successful venture. They offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for the bargain price of $50 million. Unfortunately, Blockbuster executives weren’t interested in considering the long-term potential of this acquisition. They didn’t stop to think that, with the advent of the internet, the video rental industry might eventually move out of bricks-and-mortar stores, first, moving to a mail-order subscription service and then going online. Nowadays, Netflix is worth $150 billion, and Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010. This just goes to show that, while the majority of people say they value activities that plan for the long-term, few of us possess the patience to adopt these long-term focused behaviors. It might not feel like it sometimes, but the messy middle is not only about getting through the inevitable lows and setbacks that hit you mid-project. Muddling through the messy middle also means using the high points of your journey to accelerate your progress toward the finish line. To leverage these highs, you must recognize and build on the aspects of your venture which are working well. In other words, you’ll need to optimize. When you try something that works – whether it’s a new habit that boosts your productivity, or an inspired alteration to a product that customers love – you should rigorously evaluate the improvement. Ask yourself: why was it successful, how can we replicate this accomplishment, and how can I spread this improvement through my team? Optimization is born from the belief that something can always be done better. It’s less concerned with repairing something that’s broken, more focused on improving something that already works. Google and other contemporary internet companies have pioneered the optimization of web-based products through A/B testing. In A/B testing, web pages or any aspect of online experience are improved by comparing the performance of the original product (version A) to that of the changed version (B). An e-commerce website may change the color of their purchase button for a certain proportion of customers viewing their site. If this altered version gets more shoppers to buy something, then this color change will be applied throughout the website. If not, the test will be abandoned, and the existing version without the change will continue to be used. But whatever the outcome, the philosophy is the same: even if something seems to be working, it's always worth trying to improve it. Importantly, A/B testing is not only useful for online buttons. You can employ it to optimize every aspect of your everyday life – try A/B testing your working habits or the way in which your team organizes itself. Your team could change how they conduct meetings or the time of week at which they meet. Or someone on your staff could try to use a new application or tool for a month to see if their productivity improved. If this works, make the alteration permanent. If you’ve learned from your mistakes and optimized the things you’ve done right, then at some point during your venture, you will make it out of the messy middle and head toward the finishing line. This point of completion will mean something different for every person – it could be getting your novel published or selling your start-up to a bigger company. But as you emerge from the middle of your project, try not to lose the mind-set that helped you get through it. Interestingly, the only downside to successfully progressing any new venture toward its completion point is that you’ll move past the period of development when you were willing to take bold action. And ironically, it was probably these audacious actions that accelerated your progress. The opening stages tend to be when your company or venture is at its most flexible. Because you have not yet had any accomplishments, you feel no sense of entitlement. Instead, you’re open to making errors and risk-taking. Your product is only just finding its feet, and so can handle big alterations. This is when you’ll likely find yourself waking up every morning with new insights and fresh ideas for little tweaks which make a big impact. But as you continue into the later phases of the venture, try to maintain the mentality of openness, brashness and humility that got you this far. One company that’s been highly adept at maintaining this mind-set is Facebook. If you took a walk around Facebook’s headquarters, you’d be confronted with posters and laptop stickers proclaiming that “this journey is 1 percent finished.” Why? Because this is a company that prides itself on always behaving as if they were still in the messy middle of the project. Sustaining this mind-set has kept their workers and executives questioning existing assumptions and constantly thinking of ways to do things bigger and better. Just consider how much the company has changed since its 2004 beginnings. What began as a university directory reached huge success as a social network by 2008. But they didn’t stop there – instead, they morphed into a platform allowing their users to access other applications and websites, and Facebook is now also a respected medium where online communities and groups work together. Facebook is continually evolving, and its progress will only stall if employees start feeling and behaving like they’re about to hit the finish line. Even though the middle of a project is fraught with uncertainty and setbacks, it's also an intense period of creativity and optimization that determines your future accomplishments. So embrace the messiness and remember to take a little of it with you, wherever your journey leads you next. The key message in these blinks: Most of us have been taught to believe that a prosperous entrepreneurial journey starts with an idea, is followed by a lot of hard work, and is completed with a gradual and incremental rise to success. But this is false. In reality, the middle part of any venture is always the most difficult. To get through it, you’ll have to cope with dramatic highs and lows and a lack of external recognition. You’ll also have to find your sense of reward and engage in plenty of optimization if you’re to finish with success. It’s not easy, but if you learn how to navigate through this messy middle, you stand a great chance of being successful.  Actionable advice: If you can’t end with success, end with grace.  No project turns out exactly as we thought it would, and still fewer produce the sort of results we hoped for at the outset. But if you find yourself disappointed in the closing stages of a venture, try and resist the urge to swiftly shut things down and hop to the next project. Why? Because this final phase is key to maintaining your reputation with people like your investors and your shareholders. You may want to slip away quietly from view and avoid having difficult conversations with those who might hold you accountable for the failure, but keeping your reputation intact for future ventures will mean doing the opposite. So own the outcome of the project, whatever it was, explain yourself to stakeholders, and finish gracefully. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The son of an Italian immigrant who arrived in the UK without a penny to his name, he knew from the get-go that success was something he’d have to struggle for. Entrepreneurial to the core, he was cutting hair and overseeing the salon’s payroll by age 12. Fast forward to the mid-80s, and Stanzione was making a killing trading equities at the height of the financial revolution unfolding in Thatcher’s London. Then came the 1987 crash, which wiped him out. Others might have thrown in the towel, but Stanzione dusted himself off and got back to business. Within a decade, he’d remade his fortune, and then some. It’s been a rollercoaster ride for Stanzione. Along the way, he picked up some invaluable life lessons. First off, that persistence pays. Second, failure is part of your journey. Those core messages resonate throughout these blinks. If a near-bankrupt, non-academic and occasionally homeless social dropout like Stanzione can make it, so can you. The key is to recognize that your future is in your hands – if you want success, you’d better be ready to get out there and fight for it. But you don’t have to go it alone: start putting the advice in this practical, hands-on self-help manual to use, and you’ll already be well on your way to a more fulfilling and successful life. Read on to find out how to make better decisions; why mail order might just be the best business model in the world; and how to make your money go further. Do you love your life the way it is right now? Do you earn more than you’ll ever need and feel fulfilled by your job? If your answers to these questions are “yes,” then congratulations – you can stop reading right now! But what if you sometimes wake up dreading work or struggle to stretch your paycheck to cover all your wants and needs? Well, welcome to the club. Like millions of others, you’re not living your best life. But that’s about to change. Let’s get one thing clear from the get-go: turning your life around won’t be easy. Change is a long and occasionally arduous journey – but that can’t come as too much of a surprise. Whether it’s overeating, drinking too much, failing to save money or giving up on learning, most of us spend a good twenty or thirty years messing up our lives. Tidying that up takes time and effort. But here’s the silver lining: it can be done. So where do you start? Well, as an old Chinese proverb has it, a journey of a million miles begins with one step. The first item on your travel itinerary is breaking out of your comfort zone. It’s the most familiar place in the world and includes everything that has become so routine you do it on autopilot: commuting, grinding out another day at the office, watching TV on the sofa in the evenings and sleeping for as long as possible before it all restarts the next morning. The truth is that most people live in their comfort zones. They regard it as both acceptable and normal because they’ve given up on their old dreams. They’ve lost all hope of doing something dazzling and achieving fame and fortune – in other words, they’ve come to terms with the fact that their highest priority is simply getting by. It was this which moved Benjamin Franklin to remark that “most men die at 25, we just don’t bury them until they’re 70.” Think of this as your wake-up call. Your time on earth is too precious to spend it simply existing. In the following blinks, we’ll be taking a closer look at how you can get out of your rut and start truly thriving. First, let’s get down to basics and ask the most important question of all: What do you actually want? Ever heard the phrase “the squeaky wheel gets the grease”? It basically means that the loudest problems get the most attention. People blame their unhappiness on all sorts of issues, but the real culprit is usually much less obvious: they’ve never sat down and defined what they actually want in life. It’s like going to a travel agency and saying you want to be sent somewhere nice where you’ll find a great job, a perfect partner and where you’ll be happy – a vague wish that’s pretty much impossible to fulfill. You need to define your destination before you embark on your personal expedition, and here’s where to start. Imagine that the author himself knocked on your door and offered to take care of anything you asked for. What would you put at the top of your list? Well, let’s find out. Grab a pen and write down these headings: financial needs like bills that need paying, financial wants like that gold Rolex you’ve always dreamed of having and non-monetary aspirations like becoming a better public speaker. Now put your answers into sentences like these: “My personal goal is…,” “I will benefit from this because…” and “My projected goal will be achieved by...” This works best if your targets are positive, so, “I want a $750,000 townhouse” rather than “I need to get out of this terrible apartment,” for example. You should also err on the side of being ambitious. If you’re earning $40,000 right now, aim to bump that up to $100,000, rather than $50,000. But don’t forget to keep things realistic. If you want to leave that old walk-up and move into a beautiful four-story house with a view, you’ll also need enough money coming in to cover it! So, how does any of this help you? Think back to the beginning of this exercise. Chances are, your idea of what you wanted was pretty hazy. By now, you should have a much clearer set of goals. This is one of the most important steps you’ll take on your million-mile journey. In the next blink, you’ll learn how to start transforming that wishlist into a reality. The human mind is a bit like a memory stick. When we’re born, it’s blank, but as we grow, we gradually fill it with new skills and ideas. Some of the files we add, however, contain negative and hurtful comments, from adults who told us we were too clumsy to play soccer or not clever enough to be good at math. Those comments often end up creating negative feedback loops that hold us back later in life. But while the human brain doesn’t have a delete button, it can be rewired. Let’s see how you can record new, positive suggestions over those bad memories. For this exercise, you’ll need that list of personal goals. The first thing you’ll do is rewrite your aims in the present tense, as if you’ve already achieved them. So, say your goal was to lose ten pounds and buy your dream car in the next five years. Write: “It’s the year 2024. I’m at my ideal weight, and I have a Maserati parked in my driveway.”   This is your new private mantra. Repeat it to yourself every morning and evening before bed with conviction and enthusiasm while visualizing your new life. It doesn’t matter if you live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment while confidently stating that you own a mansion – the idea is to prepare yourself for the future. As Cary Grant once said when a reporter enquired how he’d become a Hollywood star, “I started to act like the person I wanted to be, and eventually, I became that person.” But don’t just take the author’s – or Grant’s – word for it. Ask any top athlete how they prepare for big events, and they’ll tell you that they don’t just train their bodies – they also visualize success. Consider Roger Bannister, the first man to ever run a four-minute mile, a feat many thought impossible. The key to his victory was his mental preparation: by the time he ran that historic race, he’d already completed it hundreds of times in his mind’s eye. That might sound like mumbo jumbo, but there’s a pretty straightforward explanation for how it works: visualizing your success reinforces a sense that things you’d previously thought unobtainable are actually within your reach. Bannister’s imaginary races, for example, gave him a mental edge – he was self-confident enough to ignore the naysayers and simply give it a go! Life is all about making calls. Many of the things that happen to you – good and bad – can be traced back to past decisions. Chances are, a fair few of your choices still haunt you. But it’s not just hindsight that’s twenty-twenty – in fact, decision-making can be just as effective, as long as you apply the right techniques. Take the so-called “Ben Franklin Method.” Say you’ve been offered a job in Germany, but you’re not sure whether to take it. Write down all the “pros” in one column, and all the “cons” in another. Give each factor – “better pay” versus “losing contact with old friends,” for example – a value from one to ten in terms of importance. All you have to do then is count up the numbers and see which side has the higher score. Then there’s the “Coin Method.” Have you ever been caught on the horns of a dilemma and later realized you knew which decision was the right one from the get-go? Well, here’s a shortcut. Take a coin and make heads “yes” and tails “no.” Now toss it and see how you feel about the result. The author uses this to make tricky investment calls: if the coin says “yes,” but he’s still unconvinced, he’ll trust his gut and go with “no.” Right, so you’ve made your decision – now you need to act on it. That’s the difficult part. Nothing stops us in our tracks like the fear of failure. But let’s be real: success won’t come to you if you don’t stick your neck out now and again. Put differently, the only insurance against never failing again is doing absolutely nothing. Remember, failure is all about perspective. Take it from Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. When he was asked how it felt to have failed 10,000 times, he answered that he hadn’t failed 10,000 times – he’d successfully found 10,000 ways that didn’t work, and was 10,000 times closer to finding a formula that would! Once you learn to adopt Edison’s stoical way of thinking, you’ll realize that setbacks are part of ultimately achieving your goals. That’s something self-made business guru Dan Pena knows all about. Over 200 banks rejected his business loan applications. Lots of people would have called it quits after two or three attempts, but he kept going. Today, he’s worth a cool $250 million. The American billionaire John Paul Getty was savvy about making money. His view? No one ever got rich working for someone else. In a sense, though, you’re already self-employed – the company you work for is a means to an end, and if you didn’t get paid, you’d stop showing up. That means that you’re working for yourself, but giving someone else most of the profits! That’s a great reason to consider ditching the nine-to-five slog and striking out on your own, but it’s not the only one. The world of work has changed dramatically in recent decades, and the old rules no longer apply. Even if you wanted it, steady lifelong gigs ending with a pat on the back and a gold watch when you retire barely exist anymore. The new corporate buzzwords are “restructuring” and “downsizing” – in plain English, layoffs. Those who don’t lose their jobs aren’t exactly living off the fat of the land, either. Pay rises are rare in the best of times, and economic downturns inevitably lead to perks being slashed and new responsibilities. Meanwhile, the list of qualifications you’re expected to bring with you into over-regulated, poorly paid jobs continues to grow.   Then there are promotions. Whatever they claim, most employers are still pretty old-fashioned about who they’ll help get a foot on the career ladder. If you’re a woman, disabled or just have a foreign name like Anglo-Italian author Stanzione, you’re likely to find yourself passed over at one point or another. Sounds pretty bleak, right? Well, here’s the upside: we’re living in a new golden age for entrepreneurship. In a way, it’s a return to the historical norm. A few hundred years back, virtually everyone was self-employed. Whether they worked a particular trade or produced goods at home in so-called cottage industries, most people relied on their own business acumen. It was only when factories came along that people started relying on companies to look out for them. There’s a simple reason that flying solo has once again become such a viable option: globalization. With the internet at your fingertips wherever you are in the world, an international lingua franca – the language you’re reading these blinks in – and the ability to transfer goods and cash across borders, you can work anywhere and anytime you please. How? Read on to find out! First things first: quitting your job and going it alone is a big call, and only you can decide if it’s the right one. Before you take the plunge, answer these questions: Is your job fulfilling? Is the pay good? Would you continue doing it even if you didn’t need the money? If any of the answers are “no,” it’s time to get out for your own good. After all, unhappy people overeat, drink, smoke too much and – eventually – burn out. So where do you start if you’ve decided you’re ready? Well, it’s time to learn about mail order commerce. The author has good reason to call it the greatest business model in the world – it’s how he made his millions. Here’s how it works. Mail order means selling goods or services to customers who’ve never laid eyes on your product and have been drawn in by ads, articles, blog posts or internet searches. If they want to buy your product, they order it over the phone or online. What you sell is down to you – it can be anything from bespoke kitchenware to golfing manuals. The neat part is this: getting started is simple, quick and, most importantly, cheap. Most businesses fail because they’re up to their eyeballs in debt before they’re even up and running. They need to pay for staff, premises, licenses, and permits. Mail order businesses don’t require any of that. You’ll be doing everything until you’re ready to expand. Your “office”? A website. Need a phone line? Hire an answering service. Outlay? The bare minimum, just somewhere to store your product. If your product is information – something we’ll look at later – you’ll need little more than a closet. Best of all, economic conditions are in your favor. Customers have never felt more comfortable ordering online or sharing their credit card details with third parties. Knocking together a professional website takes only a matter of hours even if you’re an amateur, especially if you use the services of companies like Wordpress. And thanks to reliable courier services and electronic downloads, even the smallest business has global reach. Does it work? Ask Richard Branson, the founder of the multi-billion dollar Virgin Group. He started out in a tiny apartment selling mail-order records, which he advertised in student magazines. Anita Roddick, the mind behind the multinational cosmetics chain Body Shop, first cut her teeth selling beauty products to customers who read her ads in magazines aimed at teenagers.   Now, what should you sell? Marketing expert Gary Hebert often plays a game with his audiences when he gives talks. What, he asks, would they choose as their advantage if they ran a burger stand in competition with his burger operation. The usual answers? The biggest stall, the best meat or the most prime location. Hebert concludes by telling them the advantage he’d chose: a hungry crowd. It might seem like an obvious point, but billions of dollars are squandered every year by businesses that have forgotten Hebert’s lesson – you can only sell something if there’s an appetite for it. So, here’s your first maxim if you’re considering the mail order game: know your market, and decide what you’re going to sell accordingly. Understanding and responding to changes in what people want is a central component of business acumen. That’s because people’s wishes change all the time. But if you can read these desires correctly, you’re more likely to profit from them. When Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Jurassic Park hit movie theatres back in 1993, for example, sales of wooden dinosaur kits in the British Natural History Museum shop tripled overnight! You don’t have to reinvent the wheel, either. As the author puts it, you’re often better served by being the second or third person to think of something, rather than the first, as both the risks and opportunities will have become clear. Think of it as letting someone else dip their toes in the pool to check the temperature before you jump in yourself. What really makes the difference is identifying easy targets: products with a proven record of exciting interest and getting hands reaching for wallets. Luckily enough, lots of the tools to conduct thorough market research are already at your fingertips. Even better? They’re usually free! Here’s a tip to get you started. First off, set up a Google Ads account. Don’t worry about placing your own ads at this point – what you want is the keyword tool, which will tell you what people are searching for on Google. When the author was writing this book, for example, he noticed that “golf swing” generated 450,000 searches in one month. That’s a huge potential market for anything from courses to DVDs to newsletters on perfecting your golf swing! The best mail-order products are small, lightweight, sturdy enough to survive transportation and hard to find locally. Most importantly, they’ll have a high perceived value, and they cost little to produce. In this blink, we’ll take a look at one type of product that fits the bill. Think back to all those people searching for “golf swing” on Google. What they were after was information. It’s one of the most sought-after products out there, and people pay good money for it. Best of all, getting it to market doesn’t require massive outlays. The author, for example, remembers once selling a four-page document for $65. The production costs? 65 cents for the paper and ink! So how do you sell information? One way is to package it as a “how-to” manual. The first step is to hit Amazon or eBay, and see what topics are doing well. Top-selling information categories usually include advice on money, dieting, computing, cosmetics and dating. Once you’ve chosen your subject, you have three options: you can either research and write the manual yourself, hire a freelancer to do it for you or purchase the reprint and resale rights to an existing publication. Next up, you’ll want to use Google Ads to find out how people are searching for your subject. Say you’re producing a manual on effective gambling strategies: you might discover that people are looking up “make money from horse racing.” That’ll tell you which keywords to use in your own ads, which you can then place online and in magazines specializing in your area. Finally, you’ll need to get hold of a list of people who’ve bought similar products and contact them directly. That’s surprisingly easy – googling “direct mail list brokers” should help you find plenty. Once you’ve produced your manual, you can use the same information to create another product: audio. It’s a great way of reaching out to today’s overloaded and time-poor consumers. For this, you have a couple of choices. You can either record the audio yourself using free podcasting software, or hire a voice-over artist for a couple of hundred dollars. If you get stuck with the tech, remember: you can outsource anything these days! Just think of Bill Gates. When it came to writing the code for MS-DOS, the forerunner to Windows, he simply paid someone else and licensed it to IBM! By now you should have a good idea of how to start generating new income. But here’s the thing: looking after what you already have is just as important as making money. Shopping, in other words, is a skill, and buying smart makes all the difference. It’s the reason some folks get along just fine on $50,000 a year, and others struggle with $250,000. The key is becoming more mindful about your consumer choices. It’s all about taking a step back before splashing out and asking yourself a simple question: Do you really need this, or is it an impulse purchase? If the answer is still “yes,” follow up with some other questions. Could you rent it for a couple of days rather than buying, for example? And, if you do buy it with a view to reselling it later on, how quickly will its value depreciate? Answer those honestly, and you’re much less likely to end up regretting your spending decisions. That said, sometimes there’s no way around it, and you’ll have to reach for your wallet. In those cases, it’s well worth taking a look at used products. That doesn’t mean heading to the thrift store, though. Think about consumer electronics – lots of big retailers offer money-back guarantees. When customers return their goods, the shop sells these virtually unused products at a discount of around 25 percent. E-commerce platforms are another good bet, especially if you decide that last year’s iPhone will serve you just as well as the latest model. But be careful: if a deal sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Exercise caution and always check out sellers’ ratings before hitting the “buy” button. You can also save a ton of cash on big purchases like cars if you know where to look. Most large car rental firms like Hertz sell used models, which are generally no older than six to eight months and are offered at a discount of up to 30 percent. But here’s the best tip of all: if you’re in the market for a car, aim to buy around Christmas. People’s minds are usually focused on the upcoming holidays and business is slow in most dealerships, which means you’re much more likely to find a bargain! The key message in these blinks: Anyone can turn their life around, earn more and find greater fulfillment. But here’s the thing – it’s a long journey. That said, the largest tasks can be accomplished by taking smaller steps. As the saying goes: the best way to eat an elephant is by taking one bite at a time. And that’s exactly how you’ll start turning your life around. Whether it’s learning to make better decisions, setting up your own business or making your cash go further, these blinks are a step-by-step guide to becoming your best self.   Actionable advice: Smile! You’ve probably come across the idea that if you don’t ask, you don’t get. That’s true enough, but it leaves out something vital: you’re much more likely to get what you want if you ask for it with a smile on your face. Smiling is a universal language – you can even hear it over the phone. Telemarketers often put mirrors on their desks, as they know that if they’re smiling while making their pitches, their sales figures will look a lot better at the end of the month! Got feedback?

But with so many places advertising vacancies – agencies, apps, social media and more – it’s hard to know exactly where to look. And as technology advances and brand new roles are created, the sheer number of possibilities and opportunities makes the task even more intimidating. Authors Cavoulacos and Minshew recognize that finding your niche in the modern world of work can be overwhelming. Using their experiences running a career consultancy, they’ve come up with a list of New Rules to help you navigate the ever-changing landscape. These rules encourage you to think about what you value most and to let those values guide you all the way from job search to job interview. If you’re stuck in a work rut, looking to change lanes and challenge yourself, or even if you’re still picking a college major, the New Rules will help you make informed choices and prepare you for your first day at that dream job. In these blinks, you’ll also find out why you shouldn’t listen to your parents; that having friends over for dinner can be a smart career move; and how Back to the Future’s Marty McFly helped one woman secure her dream job. Ever found yourself on a job-search website staring at the blank search bar, wondering what to type? Traditional searches like this are only helpful if you already know what you want to do. So, if you’re not sure what that is, you’ll need to identify your values. Every person’s idea of happiness is different. Think about what you need to feel happy and fulfilled. Perhaps you need a creative outlet, the opportunity to travel or the ability to make a positive impact in the world. These are your values, and they should determine what you look for in a job. Chances are, if you’re reading this, your current job might not line up with your values. Kathryn, one of the authors, once found herself in exactly this situation; though she’d landed the job she always wanted, she wasn’t fulfilled. Kathryn majored in international relations and French and dreamed of a career in the foreign service. But a few weeks into her dream job at the US embassy in Cyprus, Kathryn realized the pace at which policy changes could be implemented wasn’t what she’d expected. It was so slow as to be incompatible with her need to see the results of her work: Kathryn needed a job that fulfilled her need to roll up her sleeves and make a noticeable impact. As you consider your own needs, be conscious of outside influences, such as your parents’ expectations for your career, and don’t be swayed by external pressure. That’s something Alex, one of the authors, realized early on. Alex grew up in France where school pupils must select a course of study – either science, literature or economics – at age 15. Alex chose science. In her senior year, she then had to choose between biology, math and physics. She chose biology and developed an interest in genetics. It was only after relocating to the United States to study genetics that Alex realized she didn’t enjoy the everyday lab work that would be a large part of her job if she were to continue in the field. She was faced with the challenge of reassessing what she thought she wanted. She ended up pursuing a career in consultancy, where she met Kathryn, and cofounded their consulting company, The Muse. Just think, if Alex and Kathryn hadn’t taken stock of what was important to them, they’d never have met, and this blink wouldn’t exist! So you’ve decided you’re born to be a designer. That’s great. But before you start firing off résumés for every creative role you find, consider whether the position you’re applying for aligns with your values. Designing for a small NGO, for example, will be wildly different from working at a multinational corporation. To be truly satisfied in your work, you should consider your interests, skills and values all together. That’s what Sarah, a literary studies graduate, learned after starting a career in publishing. She thought it would be the perfect match for her expertise and interests, assuming it would let her read, write and work with like-minded people. But a year at a traditional publishing house disabused her of these assumptions. Sarah spent more time at her desk than engaging with authors. So she researched roles that would combine her literary interests with her need to interact with those producing literature. Recognizing this need helped her focus her job search and find her current role as the leader of business development at a self-publishing start-up. At this smaller organization, Sarah has the opportunity to work with authors directly. But how can you know if your chosen career lines up with your values before you actually start it? The Muse suggests making a grid. Down the left-hand side, list six roles or industries you may be interested in. At the top, write down your three most important values. Now consider how – and if – each role and industry will enable you to live by those values. If you’re not sure what each role involves, look at the LinkedIn profiles of people with that job at companies you’re interested in. It’ll show you which skills you need and what those who’ve held the role in the past have gone on to do. If that’s not enough information, get proactive to gain a fuller understanding. Before starting The Muse, Kathryn got in touch with a former colleague who was also starting a business. Kathryn could talk honestly with him about the pros and cons of being a young entrepreneur and got a firsthand look at the daily life of a start-up CEO by joining him on sales trips for his company. When you’ve got a clearer idea of which role and industry best matches your values, you’ll be ready to show employers that you’re the perfect fit for their values. Coca-Cola. Nike. You. What do they all have in common? Well, they’re all brands. Branding isn’t just for companies anymore – it’s also a way for prospective employers to gain insight into your personality. The authors suggest requesting feedback from your peers on the qualities that make you stand out. Take the three most commonly used descriptors and communicate them in a way that presents you as a good employee, not just a nice person. Take Jennifer, for example. When Jennifer tried this exercise, colleagues described her as “super nice,” “works hard for others” and “easy to get along with.” When introducing herself to employers, Jennifer might phrase her attributes in a way that demonstrates their value to the employer, such as, “Relationship builder, strong follow-through and motivated to collaborate.” Using this method, you can be honest about your strengths and weaknesses and still present yourself as the best fit for the job. Consider Zach, who also completed the authors’ exercise. Zach’s peers described him as “willing to take risks,” “passionate and occasionally stubborn,” “authoritative” and “irreverent.” These could be interpreted as qualities of a difficult, overbearing character, but Zach could turn them to his advantage, marketing himself as a confident, ambitious leader, who will go above and beyond to achieve company goals. Your attributes will form your unique brand, and every interaction you have should support the image you put forward. This applies to both face-to-face and online interactions. The companies you follow, the content you post, the way you communicate – it should all showcase your interests, expertise and personality. However, traditional social network templates often limit how you can communicate your skills. To have complete freedom over how you present yourself and your work, the authors recommend setting up a personal website. That’s what Jillian Youngblood did when she decided to transition from a career in politics to a role in tech. She built her own website to demonstrate her web-development abilities. The head of a development team found the site, and Jillian was invited to an interview, something that may not have happened if she had stuck with a more traditional job template. Treat your professional profiles similar to a dating profile – no lies, just carefully curated highlights that show you at your best. And definitely no swimsuit photos! If the word “networking” conjures up images of cheap wine, dry canapés and awkward small talk with strangers, you’re not following the New Rules. Formal networking events are no longer the most efficient way to expand your professional circle. Social media, in contrast, can put you in instant touch with interesting people within your industry. Your interactions can be as easy as a Twitter exchange, joining a Facebook group or a message inviting someone for a coffee. Why not take a leaf out of LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman’s book? He holds dinner parties, invites three interesting people and asks each of them to invite three of their friends. With this kind of event, you never know who you’ll meet or what you might learn. Traditionally, networking has focused on finding people who can help you out immediately, but it’s just as important to nurture relationships over time, as you never know when that relationship will pay off. Take Alex, one of the authors. She met a writer at a conference, and they stayed in touch, catching up whenever they were in the same city. When her contact was going through a career transition, Alex was glad to offer her advice. Years later, Alex was looking to solve a work problem of her own. Her contact happened to be working for the particular social networking site she needed help from and was happy to help Alex out. If cultivating your network this way sounds time-consuming, just remember that you don’t need a huge network, just the right one. Most job postings are never advertised, so bring yourself to the attention of the hiring manager of every company you’re interested in. Next time a position becomes available, they’ll have you in mind. This approach certainly worked for Elliott Bell. In 2012, Elliott heard one of the authors, Kathryn, speak at the Women 2.0 conference. The very next day, he sent her a LinkedIn message, mentioning he was blown away by Kathryn’s speech, her team and the company itself. He briefly detailed his marketing experience, how his knowledge could help The Muse expand and asked for the chance to discuss his ideas further. He even mentioned a mutual contact, who gave Elliott a glowing reference after Kathryn got in touch. The Muse wasn’t actively hiring at the time, but Kathryn was so impressed with Elliott that he was hired a few months later as head of marketing, where he stayed for four years and established the marketing team. Did you know that 55 percent of hiring managers won’t even read your cover letter? That’s what a September 2015 Jobvite survey found. So why should you bother writing one? Well, because 45 percent of managers will read it! The consultants at The Muse believe a well-thought-out résumé and cover letter can make all the difference. The key is making the information most relevant to your application – whether that’s your experience or your education – easy to find. It should appear in the top third of your one-page résumé, even if that means taking achievements out of chronological order. If it sounds like a chore to rewrite your résumé for every application, keep a master document of your achievements and employment history. Then all you have to do is copy and paste the most relevant examples into each version of your résumé. When it comes to your cover letter, avoid repeating the contents of your résumé. The résumé will show you have the skills to do the job; the cover letter is your chance to demonstrate that you are the best fit. Try starting your letter with a relevant anecdote. It will grab the hiring manager’s attention and let your personality shine through. That’s what Abby Wolfe did when she applied to intern at The Muse, and the authors remember her letter to this day. Abby submitted her application on October 21, 2015 – the day that Marty McFly traveled to the future in the movie Back to the Future Part II. Abby displayed her creativity by comparing Marty’s future-changing action to her own hopefully future-altering decision. She then emphasized her best attributes with personal stories, and even memes. It really caught the attention of The Muse’s team and showed that Abby understood the company culture. Needless to say, she got the job. Abby was able to show, as well as tell, her future employer that she was the best candidate for the job. You can do the same by backing up your skills with concrete examples. Perhaps you can quote increased sales figures as a result of a campaign you led or increased employee engagement as a result of an event you organized. Why not show that you can already do the job you’re applying for? One BuzzFeed applicant, for example, turned her cover letter into a classic BuzzFeed-style article. It demonstrated she was familiar with the company and its culture. So what if you send off your perfectly tailored application and hear nothing back? You should check in after about a week. If you can make your follow-up memorable, too, it’ll give your application an extra boost. Congratulations! You’ve worked hard, been through several rounds of interviews and the HR department at your dream company has called to offer you the position. Naturally, you’ll want to say, “Thanks! When do I start?” But there’s good reason to hold off on accepting an offer. Addressing any reservations you have at this stage will save you time and stress in the future. Once you’ve been offered the job, you’re finally the one in a position of power. The contract can’t start without your signature, so be sure the role and industry align with your values before accepting. Be honest with yourself. It may sound like a promising opportunity, but ask yourself how it fits with the lifestyle you want. Maybe you’re planning a big trip, but the vacation pay isn’t great. Maybe you’re ready to start a family, but the parental leave is unpaid. These things can all be negotiated. It may sound intimidating, but companies will expect you to ask questions. So how do you know if you’ll be happy in the job? You guessed it – more research. Some simple detective work on LinkedIn will give you an idea of the company’s employee turnover, what your career progression could look like and what the company culture is. You may want to contact current or former employees with more specific questions. If this seems excessive, consider Kathryn’s experience. Kathryn eagerly accepted a new job without looking much further than the job description. It wasn’t until she arrived in the office and met the team that she realized her colleagues would be less than inspiring. Some research beforehand would have informed Kathryn that the working environment wasn’t a good fit for her. Even if you’re certain that accepting the job is the right decision and you’re happy with the conditions, there are additional benefits to consider. Perhaps you can’t negotiate the salary, but it doesn’t cost you anything to negotiate your title – something that could make a world of difference when it comes to your next job search. Let’s say you’re offered the role of “HR assistant.” Why not ask to have it changed to “HR generalist.” You instantly sound more experienced! Lastly, be prepared to say no if you’re not convinced that the job is a good fit. Your working environment has lasting effects on your happiness and personal growth, so turning an offer down may be the best decision for you. “Excellent communication skills,” “Confident communicator,” “Communications genius.” Some version of this undoubtedly appears on your résumé – and hopefully with good reason. Being a strong communicator is key for working well with colleagues, avoiding conflict and building relationships. The authors believe planning is the key to effective communication. Think carefully about what you want to achieve with the information you deliver, who you’re trying to reach with it and the most efficient way to deliver that message. Some colleagues will prefer a phone call; others will prefer email. Choosing the right channel will save you and your colleagues time. One of the authors, Alex, learned this lesson when she worked under two very different managers. Each had a very different communication style. One was gregarious and quick on her feet. If Alex had a question, she could pop into the manager’s office for an instant answer. Alex’s second manager was thoughtful, analytical and valued focus. Alex learned it was better to save up her questions for this manager and ask them all at one time. If Alex hadn’t adapted to each manager’s personality, it would have affected her own and her managers’ productivities. It’s worth thinking about who you communicate with, too. In the workplace, you would traditionally only build relationships with people on the same level or maybe the next level up, but the New Rules place importance on nurturing relationships at all levels. You never know who you can learn from – even new hires have something to offer, as their inexperience allows them to see the company through fresh eyes. Kathryn, one of the founders of The Muse, received mentorship from her peers. When The Muse was getting off the ground, Kathryn reached out to investors, and she found that the best advice came not from well-established business people, but from other early-stage start-up founders. They had just gone through the same process as Kathryn, so their knowledge was current and firsthand. In contrast, Alex was mentored by somebody higher up. Alex worked with a manager at McKinsey & Company, whose balanced communication style she wanted to emulate. Even when she no longer worked under the manager, Alex continued to work with and learn from her. The manager became a mentor, giving feedback, introducing Alex to opportunities and helping her develop her own style. Don’t forget: everybody has valuable wisdom to share – including you. So you’ve found a job that matches your values, bought a cactus for your desk and claimed your favorite coffee mug from the kitchen. Don’t get too cozy! As your values change over time, you’ll need to make upward or lateral moves. Keep adding to your skills, and you’ll not only become more efficient in your current role; you’ll also be well prepared for your next challenge. There’s no need to sign up for night classes – just stay curious and remain open to learning new things. You could start by working on your productivity. In 2012, a LinkedIn survey showed that 90 percent of professionals admit they’re unable to accomplish all the tasks on their to-do list by the end of the day. If you’re in that 90 percent, there are strategies to help. Entrepreneur Robyn Scott suggests thinking about how completing tasks will make you feel and grouping tasks under the emotion you will experience on completion. Focus on the motivation behind each task. Finishing your tax return will ease financial worries, phoning a friend will lift your spirits and exercise will leave you feeling fit and ready for anything. It’s no longer a long to-do list, but a list of tasks whose completion will lead to emotional rewards – a good trick for chronic procrastinators. Your job will also change as technology evolves. You have to be proactive to acquire the new skills required to keep up. Say you often work with software developers but have no head for tech; why not sign up for some coding classes? You’ll gain an understanding of the developers’ job and learn a new skill in the process. Another effective way to prepare yourself for a career move is managing up. When you understand how your role supports your manager’s goals, it makes you and your manager more efficient. Build a relationship with her, get to know the challenges of her job and find ways to take work off her plate without being asked. Looking beyond your own responsibilities not only shows that you’re dedicated to your development, but it also makes clear that you care about the company as a whole. And when you do move on, you’ll take more from the job than just a cactus and a coffee mug – you’ll have a wealth of skills and achievements under your belt. The key message in these blinks: Exploring and understanding your personal values is the key to a happy and fulfilling work life. For a lifetime of satisfaction, assess these values every few years. Meanwhile, strive to keep learning new skills and building meaningful relationships at all levels in the workplace.  Actionable advice: Treat staying in touch with people as part of your job.  When you’ve only met somebody once at a conference, it can seem daunting to try and turn that brief connection into a long-term relationship. So here’s one way to get started. Send a short, friendly email within 48 hours of meeting. Include a link to an article you think they’d enjoy, or a joke about the event you were at, and let them know you’d be keen to meet again.

Similarly, when J. K. Rowling conceived the idea of Harry Potter, she envisioned seven books about life at Hogwarts before she wrote even the first chapter of the first one. Both of these people went on to be extraordinarily successful, and this was in no small part because they were not afraid of thinking big: starting out with a grand vision of success before even beginning to work toward it. It’s hard to imagine that they would have achieved such great success had they failed to think so big in the first place.  Yet, for most people, the thought of big ideas or big achievements is daunting and has negative associations, such as feeling overwhelmed and intimidated. These negative thoughts often prevent people from thinking big. When we fail to think big and allow these negative associations to dominate us, our thinking shrinks and we lower our trajectories. We actively limit our potential achievement, condemning ourselves to mediocrity. Consider science and how much of its progress would have stalled if someone hadn’t dared to think of previously unimaginable possibilities, like that humans could breathe underwater, fly through the air or explore space. History tells us that we’ve done a remarkably poor job of estimating our limits, so we should not let the limits we perceive constrain our aspirations. Success requires action, and action requires thought. But in order to achieve extraordinary results, our actions have to be based on big thinking in the first place. Failing to think big can limit your opportunities. Most people, from time to time, make “to-do” lists to keep track of all the tasks they have to complete. But once you have your list, how do you decide which item to work on first? Do you start with the most time-consuming ones, or get smaller tasks checked off first? Maybe you just work through them in the order they were written? These approaches fail to address a key point: all items are not equally important. In fact, it is likely that only a few of them will have a profound impact, and these should therefore be given the highest priority. This conclusion can be drawn from the work of Joseph M. Juran, a pioneer of quality-control management. Whilst working for General Motors, he discovered that a majority of the defects in their cars came from only a handful of production flaws. It was clear that fixing these flaws should be their highest priority. Juran named his finding the Pareto Principle, after an Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto, who wrote a model for wealth and income distribution in nineteenth-century Italy. In the model, Pareto showed that 80 percent of the land was owned by 20 percent of the people. Juran had noted that these proportions matched his own: 80 percent of the defects came from just 20 percent of the flaws. Juran realized that this 80/20 principle may in fact be a universal law: 80 percent of your results or outputs are always delivered by 20 percent of your work or inputs. The implications of this principle are clear: the tasks on your to-do list are not equally important; just a small number of them will make the greatest contribution to your success. Prioritize your tasks to focus on the ones that will achieve the greatest proportion of your results. Prioritize your to-dos – they are not all equally important. On the subject of success, Mark Twain once said, “The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.” This is great advice, but knowing where you want to go and what the first task should be to get there can be difficult. This conundrum is exactly where it helps to ask the focusing question, a question specifically designed to help you identify both where you want to go and how you can get started on your journey: “What’s the ONE thing I can do, such that by doing it everything else will become easier or unnecessary?” This question can be asked on two levels, each serving its own function: First, on a macro level the focusing question can help you to see the big picture and identify your overall goal: the ONE thing you want to do and achieve in life. For example, here your ONE thing could be your overall career goal. Second, on a more practical, short-term level, the focusing question provides you with a small focus to prioritize your immediate options and select the most effective task to start with. Here you are looking for the ONE thing you can do right now; for example, “Make that phone call.” The first level is about finding the right direction in life; the second is about choosing the right action. Repeatedly asking yourself the focusing question will not only keep you aimed at your goal but will provide you with actionable steps that build on each other, creating progress and momentum. Keep asking it, and who knows what you can achieve? Asking the “focusing question” will help you to prioritize, create actionable tasks and achieve your goals. When we think of someone as successful as Bill Gates, we tend to attribute his phenomenal success to the extraordinary self-discipline that allowed him to learn how to program computers in his formative years. This level of discipline seems like a daunting unachievable goal. How do successful people maintain such discipline? On closer inspection, we see that the key to their success is not so much to constantly apply a tremendous amount of discipline in order to stay focused and driven but, instead, to use discipline selectively to form enduring good habits. The success story of Michael Phelps is a revealing example. He is widely admired for his focus and discipline, but in fact as a child he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It was thought that he would never be able to focus on anything. So how did he turn the tables? He channeled all of the discipline he could muster into forming one habit: swimming every day. For almost a decade – from the age of 14 through to the Beijing Olympics – he trained seven days a week, 365 days a year. One habit is just the start. Habits are much easier to maintain than to begin, so once something becomes a habit, you can shift your discipline into forming a new one and then build them up sequentially. For example, you could start by getting into the office 30 minutes earlier every day to clear your inbox before your colleagues arrive. Once this habit is established, you can build on that by channeling your discipline into staying focused on one particular task for longer periods. Once this habit has been formed, you can move on to the next one. Building up positive habits by selectively applying discipline will give you the appearance and benefits of a disciplined life, without the need for super-human discipline. The secret to a disciplined life is sequential habit forming. Nowadays, it is generally accepted that multitasking is an effective thing to do. We generally understand the term as meaning: to do two or more things simultaneously. But it was originally coined to describe a computer using a single processor to work on multiple tasks, alternating back and forth between them in rapid succession. A distinction which, as it happens, is very revealing. Although we can do some things at the same time – for example, walking and talking on the phone – what we can’t do is effectively focus on two tasks at the same time. This means that frequently, when we think we are multitasking, we are actually juggling two or more tasks, switching focus from one to the other just as a computer does. Research has shown that, for humans, such task switching exacts a time penalty, as it takes time to move from one task and then refocus on another. This time cost may be small in the case of relatively simple tasks, but it increases greatly when the task you are returning to is more complex. For example, if you are working on a complicated spreadsheet and a co-worker interrupts you to discuss a tricky business problem, time will be lost when you switch back to the spreadsheet and struggle to remember where you were in the process and what you were trying to achieve. During the day, these time penalties soon add up, particularly in the work environment. It has been estimated that, on average, office workers are distracted every 11 minutes, and spend up to a third of the working day recovering from these distractions. Can you really afford to lose a third of your working day? Figure out what matters most in the moment and give it your undivided attention. Multitasking is horribly inefficient: pick one thing and give it your undivided attention. Most people are painfully aware that they do not have ironclad willpower. What is surprising, however, is that research has shown that our willpower, far from being a constant resource, actually drains at varying rates throughout the day, depending on what activities we engage in. For example, our willpower is depleted when we make decisions to focus our attention, suppress our emotions or modify our behavior in pursuit of a goal. When our willpower has been drained, we are less able to exert it should further tasks call upon this resource. This would explain why you may be unable to resist a tasty snack after a period of making tough decisions or being engaged in tedious work. Giving in to a guilty pleasure is one thing, but if you are making life and death decisions when your willpower is low, the consequences are potentially much more serious. For prisoners, few decisions are as important as the ruling at the next parole-board hearing. Could decisions of such gravity be influenced by something as arbitrary as the time of day? Research involving Israeli parole judges shows that they could: judges were much more likely to give favorable judgments at the start of a parole hearing than towards the end. This is because the judges tended to rely on the default decision of “no parole” as the day wore on and their willpower ran low. The rate of favorable judgments picked up again after breaks and a snack. Full-strength willpower requires a full tank, so plan your day so that you can avoid making key decisions or judgments when you’re running low. Your willpower is like a fuel tank: choose carefully where you use it or you may run out when you really need it. We all struggle at one time or another with saying no to requests, because we want to be helpful. Helping others can be deeply rewarding, but, in order to preserve your time and energy for your biggest goals, you need to say no to lower-priority requests. Steve Jobs was famously as proud of the projects he didn’t pursue as the ones he did. When he returned to Apple in 1997, he reduced the company's output from 350 products down to just ten. That’s a lot of no's. At a developer’s conference in 1997, he explained, “When you think about focusing, you think ‘Well, focusing is about saying yes.’ No! Focusing is about saying no.” Saying no to people all the time does not have to be as cold or as selfish as it may appear. You can always try to give them an alternative solution that doesn’t require your assistance, or redirect them to someone who can be more helpful. Also, think about implementing strategies that will cut down on the requests you get; for example, by asking that staff refer to a list of frequently asked questions before approaching you. This may help, but remember: sometimes you will still have to actually turn people down if you are to succeed. With limited time and resources, you must be prepared to say no to trivial tasks if you want to focus your energy and get the most important ones done. Saying “no” to unimportant tasks is vital if you are to focus your efforts on the most important ones. Imagine for a minute that you currently have no concrete goals or ambitions whatsoever. Adrift like this, how would you decide what to do each day? Do you think you would persevere at a difficult and tedious task without knowing why you’re doing it? When we imagine the above scenario, we realize how important it is to have a goal to work toward. It gives your life added meaning and purpose, which leads to greater clarity in your thoughts, more conviction in your actions, and faster decisions. Most importantly, though, knowing why you’re doing what you’re doing provides inspiration and motivation when problems occur. With a goal in place, you can start planning the steps to reach it, but it’s even better if you also visualize each step along the way, as this motivates you and prepares you for the road ahead. These beneficial effects were shown in a study of students, who, when taking a test, were asked to visualize either the outcome of the test or the process of preparing for and taking it. The students who visualized the process reported higher levels of motivation, were better prepared and subsequently got better results. Recall the image of being so adrift at the start of this blink? Now imagine that you have found your calling: you want to climb Mount Everest. Your goal is suddenly clear: it’s the ONE thing you want to do. You now need to do some research, start training and get the right equipment. Thanks to your goal, you’re already making plans, visualizing the steps and progressing toward it. Defining a goal – the ONE thing we want to do and achieve in life – is something we should all strive toward. Living with purpose and visualizing the steps to get to your goal will set you on the path to extraordinary results. We all strive to achieve a balanced life – to divide our time equally between all of the things that matter to us – but we do this without stopping to ask why, and what it is that we are actually trying to achieve. It’s understandable that we strive for balance because all of the demands in our work life and personal life seem so important, but in fact this vision of a balanced life is unobtainable and undesirable. If you try to do everything, you will end up short-changing everything you do, in both your personal and your professional life. Author James Patterson encapsulated this dilemma when he said: “Imagine life is a game in which you are juggling five balls. They are called work, family, health, friends and integrity. And you’re keeping them all in the air. But one day you finally come to understand that the work ball is made of rubber – if you drop it, it will bounce back. The other four balls are made of glass.” As the quote illustrates, we should never sacrifice priorities in our personal life when the pressure is on at work. The damage done may be irreparable. But if our personal life always takes precedence, how can we succeed professionally? The trick is to prioritize your work time ruthlessly to focus on professional goals. In your personal life, neglecting any area can be perilous; but in your work life, you have your top priority and everything else is negotiable. From time to time, lesser priorities will have to be minimized, be made to wait, or be managed by someone else until what really matters is done. This approach will allow you to focus on your most important work, giving it the concentration that is required to achieve great results. Never compromise your personal life for your professional goals – instead, prioritize your work time ruthlessly. Let’s assume you have discovered your ONE thing, the key priority you need to achieve, and you have a clear plan of the steps needed to reach your goal. You’re all set to conquer the world but with only one small problem: life does not have a pause button. While you are beavering away, working on your masterpiece, the world does not patiently wait for you to finish. Things stack up. There will always be other people and projects that demand your attention. Imagine you are working on landing a big contract. You’ll need to make sacrifices. Your regular work is going to pile up or be delegated to colleagues. As the chaos builds up in other areas, so does the pressure to attend to them. Learn to deal with this by trusting that the work you are doing on your top priority will come through for you, and in doing so will simplify other areas of your life. In short, let the chaos pile up. So now that you’re focusing on your ONE thing, how do you make the most of your time? Schedule blocks of time to work on your ONE thing, commit to them and defend them like they are your most important appointments. You also need to ensure that your physical environment doesn’t prevent you from using this time effectively. Wherever you work, you need to minimize potential distractions. Consider working away from your office if this is not possible. Techniques such as these allow you to give your ONE thing the attention it deserves. To focus on your ONE thing, you need effective time-management strategies, and to accept some chaos in other areas. The main message in this book is: Success comes from focusing on ONE thing, not many things. When working toward your ONE thing, avoid the pitfalls that prevent you from achieving success. Learn how to cut through the clutter and do your best work where it really counts.  This book in blinks answered the following questions: How should I set goals and prioritize my work? Failing to think big can limit your opportunities. Prioritize your to-dos – they are not all equally important. Asking the “focusing question” will help you to prioritize, create actionable tasks and achieve your goals. How do I avoid being diverted from my ONE thing? The secret to a disciplined life is sequential habit forming. Multitasking is horribly inefficient: pick one thing and give it your undivided attention. Your willpower is like a fuel tank: choose carefully where you use it or you may run out when you really need it. Saying “no” to unimportant tasks is vital if you are to focus your efforts on the most important ones. How do I achieve great results in pursuing my ONE thing? Living with purpose and visualizing the steps to get to your goal will set you on the path to extraordinary results. Never compromise your personal life for your professional goals – instead, prioritize your work time ruthlessly. To focus on your ONE thing, you need to use effective time-management strategies, and accept some chaos in other areas. Actionable ideas from this book in blinks Prioritize your to-do lists – If you want to work much more productively, realize that not all of the tasks on your to-do list matter equally; some will provide a greater proportion of your results than others. With this in mind, you should always try to prioritize the ones that are likely to contribute greatest to your success, and then work on these highest-priority tasks first. Ask yourself the focusing question at the start of everyday – Asking yourself the focusing question – “What’s the ONE thing I can do right now, such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” – on a regular basis will help to keep you focused on your goal, help you to prioritize your tasks, and simplify your life. Stop multitasking – You cannot focus effectively on two or more things at the same time. When we try to multi-task, what we are really doing is switching our focus between the tasks, which comes at a cost. We are more likely to make mistakes and work less efficiently. Decide what the most important thing in the moment is, and give it your undivided attention.","headers":["Failing to think big can limit your opportunities.","Prioritize your to-dos – they are not all equally important.","Asking the “focusing question” will help you to prioritize, create actionable tasks and achieve your goals.","The secret to a disciplined life is sequential habit forming.","Multitasking is horribly inefficient: pick one thing and give it your undivided attention.","Your willpower is like a fuel tank: choose carefully where you use it or you may run out when you really need it.","Saying no to unimportant tasks is vital if you are to focus your efforts on the most important ones.","Living with purpose and visualizing the steps to get to your goal will set you on the path to extraordinary results.","Never compromise your personal life for your professional goals – instead, prioritize your work time ruthlessly.","To focus on your ONE thing, you need effective time-management strategies, and to accept some chaos in other areas.","Final summary","Actionable advice"],"category":"Career","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/52934d2d6231360018110000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"The ONE Thing (2013) helps you to discover your most important goal, and gives you tools to ensure you can use your time productively to get there.

Wrong! You don’t need an MBA or a winning lottery ticket to start a successful business or improve the one you’ve got. You just need some common sense and a few basic guidelines. For example, every good businessperson knows how to negotiate, but you don’t need a whole semester to learn the key to good negotiation (Just check out blink seven). And that’s just one of the tips that’s helped The Personal MBA become the go-to book for anyone interested in business. In these blinks, you’ll learn why an MBA is a big fat waste of time and money; how to confirm if your business idea is any good; and how borrowing money can actually increase your profits. Want to go into business, but have no idea where to start? Business school seems like a tempting prospect, a place where all the knowledge and contacts you need are simply handed to you – but is it really your ticket to success? It has to be, right? Otherwise why else would people pay so much for their MBA? Business school is expensive, that’s for sure – the top 15 MBA programs charge up to $53,208 per year for tuition. That’s not even including fees, loan interest or living expenses! What if we factor those into the equation, plus the opportunity cost of lost wages too? Turns out there are eight different US business schools where the cost of an MBA exceeds $300,000. “Wait,” you might think, “surely not all business schools are that pricey!” True, however, any student who holds an MBA has an average debt of $41,687 (again, without accounting for additional expenses). OK, so business school costs a lot. Is this what the educational experience is worth? Short answer: nope. In the long term, an MBA does nothing for your career. If it did, a master of business administration degree should correlate with measures of success, like an increased salary, or promotions to higher level positions. And it doesn’t. Researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington conducted an extensive study into the matter. Analyzing 40 years’ worth of data, they found that there is no correlation between long-term career success and possessing an MBA, whether you graduated with flying colors or just scraped a passing grade. So if business school can’t make your entrepreneurial career blossom, what can? Well, you can learn a lot from experience, and from your own research online – or from books like this one. Now that you know not to waste your money on an MBA, let’s get down to business – your business. What kind of company should you start? You might think that since the IT industry is booming right now, starting an IT business would be a smart idea. But what if you absolutely despise IT as a field? Here’s a fact that more people should know: your business won’t thrive if you do it for money alone. Even if it’ll run itself eventually, your business will still need hundreds of work hours and generous amounts of money to set up. For example, in order to afford to hire people to deal with mundane tasks like payroll and HR, you’ll need to work incredibly hard for a few years. If you’re only in it for the money, can you see yourself persevering until your company reaches that point? Probably not! But if you start a business in a field that you like, not only will you be more likely to stick with it, you’ll also be ahead on the decision-making front. If you know a certain amount about the specific market you’re entering, you’ll be able to make sound decisions, develop an attractive product and tackle the competition. Say you’re into team sports. This may put you in a better position to judge which products meet the needs of sportsmen, making for a better line of business to focus on – even if there’s more demand for IT products. On the other hand, you might feel so passionate about an idea that it impedes your judgment. Imagine a small town, where expressionist art exhibitions are understandably in no high demand. When you’re an expressionist art lover, you may be oblivious to this lack of interest and try to found a museum of Expressionism right there. Sure, this could be a highly rewarding experience, but by no stretch is it a promising business idea – a painful truth that an enthusiastic art lover might be reluctant to acknowledge. But let’s say you’re not an oblivious expressionist art fan, or a grudging IT entrepreneur. Let’s say you’ve found just the right mind-set to start your own business. The next question is – how do you actually enter the market? Underneath that there’s another question: is there a shortcut to getting all the money you need? Read on in the following blinks to find out. So you’ve found a great new business opportunity, but you’re short on the cash you need to pursue it. Should you just stop right there? No way. Instead, leverage your investment. What is leverage? Simply put, it’s any technique that amplifies investor profits or losses. Typically, it’s the strategy of using borrowed money to increase your profit potential. In this way, you can make enormous gains with very little of your own capital. Let’s say you want to make a big investment that you couldn’t afford without borrowing money: you want to buy four properties at $100,000 each, but only have $20,000 of your own capital. If you borrow $380,000 and the properties double in value, you’ll have made $400,000 with just $20,000 of your own capital. That’s a 20-times return on your investment! But if the idea that borrowing more always means earning more seems a little too good to be true, well, you’re right. Leverage can be risky because it also amplifies your losses.  Let’s return to our example: imagine that the properties you bought lost half their value – your losses would amount to $200,000. That’s right, you’d lose ten times your own capital resources. For a real life example of this, you need only look to the catastrophic recession of 2008, which was caused in part by the enormous amount of leverage used by investment banks, who were caught with catastrophic losses when the property bubble popped. The lesson? Leverage can be great, but you’ve got to watch out. Many think that for a product to sell, it just has to be good – not true. Consider this: People will only want something if it fulfills their needs. Let’s put it this way – a vampire won’t pay to use your state-of-the-art solarium (unless you’ve allowed him to use it to trap unsuspecting customers!) All our decisions are influenced by our basic needs, including our buying decisions. Imagine selling a bottle of stale water to a hiker lost in a desert. He’d be willing to pay just about anything for that lousy bottle, just because it responds to his predominant need. The lesson here? Find your own desperate hiker. Any successful business fulfills one or more of its customers’ needs, and Harvard professors Nitin Nohria and Paul Lawrence asserted that there are four needs or drives that are common to all humans. The first of these is the desire to acquire and collect things, whether it’s stamps, shares or social status. Retailers and investment brokerages are the businesses that cater to this. Secondly, we have the drive to bond with other people, so we can feel valued and loved. Businesses such as dating services and companies that promise to make us more desirable (perfumeries, beauty salons) are the ones that meet this drive. Thirdly, we want to learn and satisfy our curiosity. Why else would you be reading these blinks right now? It goes without saying that Blinkist is one of the services that fulfills that need. Finally, we strive to defend ourselves, our loved ones and our property, which is where security firms and companies selling alarms come in. Consider your business idea in the light of each of these drives. Which of these four drives could your business cater to? Say your product meets not just one, but three of your customers’ basic needs. It’s ready to deliver! Now, where are all those clients who should be drooling over it? Well, you’ll need to get their attention first. But in this age of social media and information overload, this is no easy task. If you want customers to pay attention, you’ll need to offer something remarkable and memorable. And if we want to do this, we’ve got to think about the way we deliver our message to clients – the medium matters. For example, if the form of your message makes a customer think it’s made just for her, you’re far more likely to get her attention. Show your customer that you’ve made the extra effort, even if it’s just with a hand-addressed FedEx envelope. Sure, this can be expensive, but it’s worthwhile to inform selected prospective clients in a high-quality way – certainly better than spamming an entire town’s inboxes with irritating emails. If you want to market your product effectively, there’s another crucial aspect you should consider: the product’s end result. Think about it: people don’t buy a product for its own sake. They buy it because of the end result they’re hoping to attain. For example, a woman won’t pay $20 for a lipstick simply because the color is nice. She buys it because she hopes it will make her more desirable. A great way to highlight your product’s end result is through testimonials, in a statement made by an ordinary person who overcame adversity, all thanks to your product. Say you’re selling an acne cream – your testimonial could be from a pimply teenager who thought he was doomed to be an outcast until your product cleared his skin right up. That’s the sort of story that’s going to draw your customers in. Picture this: you’re visiting a pet store and see a puppy that you’re absolutely smitten with. But you’re unsure whether you want to buy it. The owner makes an offer to you to take the dog home for a week and guess what? It works its charms and you can’t imagine returning it once the week is over. This is an example of how a sales expert can convince a reluctant prospect to become a customer. But how, exactly? You can increase sales if you account for your clients’ fears. We all hate to make a bad choice, and this makes us cautious customers. Instead of buying the wrong thing, we’d rather buy nothing at all – right? In sales theory, this is called a major barrier to purchase. Naturally, it’s something salespersons hate. To encourage prospects to buy something, salespersons shoulder the risk of a bad transaction – by allowing the customer to return that cute puppy if things don’t work out. This strategy works for non-adorable items, too. For example, it’s often possible to try out a bed for an entire year, and return it for a full refund. This makes people more likely to purchase a bed. So if you can find out why your customers might say no, you’ll be able to talk them into a “yes.” In sales, reasons for saying no are called standard objections, and there are several of these. A customer might fear the product costs too much, or it won’t provide the promised benefits, or that he doesn’t need the product yet, and so on. If you know why your client won’t buy, you can devise an argumentative strategy and basically convince him that he’s dead wrong. Say he thinks his old laptop will have to do for a while longer. You can convince him that his old laptop is incompatible with essential new software. How do you picture a negotiation? You might see yourself sitting at a conference table and discussing a deal, but don’t get ahead of yourself! This is just the last phase of a negotiation. A good negotiation actually occurs in several stages. The first part of negotiation is setting the stage. Long before you start exchanging offers with your business partners, you can optimize your outlook in the early decisions you make. You could make sure you’re negotiating with the right person, for example: did the company send someone with real decision-making authority? Or just someone who’s been assigned to collect information for those in power? You can also create a conducive environment by choosing the setting you’re most convincing in. Will you present your offer in person, over the phone or should you organize an online meeting? An elegant office could make a great impression, but maybe your voice is a lot more confident over the phone. If you’re having trouble deciding, research data in your industry or market may prove very helpful. Once you’ve prepared, decide on the terms of your proposal. Consider how attractive your offers will be to the other party, and in every case, search for ways to make the offer even more desirable. You could even try to find out the other party’s offers. Then you can work out a way to make yours seem superior. You’ve always got to consider the worst-case scenario, so anticipate possible objections and create an argumentative strategy to defuse or counter them. And, in case they don’t work, decide on the concessions and compromises that you’re willing to accept. The final stage of negotiation is the actual discussion. Because of the effort you put in during the first two stages, you’ll be far better prepared. In fact, most of the hard work at this point is already over! Ever had a plan that seemed great until you tried to put it into action? Some bosses have great schemes they just can’t implement. Are they unlucky with their employees? Or is it possible they just don’t know how to communicate with them? Here’s what they don’t know: If you want others to do something, you should tell them why you want them to do it. Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer demonstrated this in a study where her students asked others queuing in front of a Xerox to let them go first. 60 percent of the people agreed, but when a reason for the request was provided, an impressive 95 percent complied. Moreover, if you tell people about your intentions, everyone can work in ways that support that plan, and know what to do if the situation changes. This way, you won’t have to micromanage every step. Imagine a general telling his field commander to capture a hill, but the situation changes and capturing the hill becomes strategically futile – the field commander will know how to react if he knows the larger goal is to flank the enemy. There’s another way to boost your communication, and it’s very simple: stop putting others down. Yet it’s surprising how often we find ourselves dismissing our coworkers’ comments. It might make you feel superior but it gets you nowhere, causing your partner to withdraw from the conversation, even if you don’t notice it. People can also become defensive and try to save face rather than understand your comments. Think about it: how engaged and cooperative would you be in a conversation with your boss after he said: “This is the silliest idea I’ve ever heard of.” By contrast, effective communication sees both partners actively and comfortably exchanging ideas in a dialogue that could strengthen the entire organization. Sure, it’s no fun to be unproductive, but being too busy can harm you and your work too. The best way to be productive is, in fact, through setting limits. If you have several things to do at once, your performance can be reduced across all of them. Your brain can only handle so much. Think of it like juggling: the more balls you’re trying to juggle at once, the more likely you are to drop them all. Moreover, with every task come unexpected demands that take extra time and effort to deal with. If your schedule doesn’t allow for extra time, you won’t be able to cope with those demands, especially if they’re coming from several tasks at once. So how can we stay in tune with what we can handle? Your best bet is to listen to the natural fluctuations of your energy. We’re not talking about a far-fetched, new age concept here – it’s simply that your productivity isn’t distributed evenly throughout the day. Instead, your body has a natural rhythm. Sometimes you can feel highly alert and productive. At other times, you’re far too tired to get anything done at all. Though it varies from person to person, most people are more productive in the morning than around noon. We also know that energy cycles in 90-minute-spans. So within that one-and-a-half-hour frame your energy will both rise and fall. If you’re aware of these natural fluctuations, you can take advantage of the times when you feel energized. And more importantly, you can recognize when you’re crashing and take a well-needed break. The key message in this book: If you want a thriving business, your product should cater to the core needs of your customers. By communicating confidently and cleverly, you can convince your clients to buy, your employees to cooperate and your business partners to sign your deal.  Actionable advice: Actions speak louder than words.  The next time you have to hire a new employee, don’t go for the applicants who performed best in an interview. Instead, do some extra research and find out how an applicant has performed in past months or years. Past performance is the best predictor of future performance.

If you expect it to reveal anything close to a 50/50 split between men and women in top positions, think again! Currently, women hold only 5.2 percent of Fortune 500 CEO positions. If you see this statistic as something that just has to change, you’re not alone.  These blinks  offer valuable insights into the politics of promotion, a particularly useful tool for women. They’ll provide essential pointers on the importance of knowing and understanding the internal politics and culture of your organization, and not least on how to proceed in order to get the promotion you so badly want. In these blinks, you’ll discover why performing well is not the only thing you need to do in order to get promoted; why being excluded from Monday night’s ballgame has a negative bearing on your career advancement; and why power in certain contexts is better than likability. You perform well at work. Your projects all receive high praise from your boss. Yet, when your next promotion opportunity comes along, you’re left empty handed. Why?  Workplaces are highly political environments, not meritocracies. Advancement in the business world requires not only skill and competence, but also political savvy. Politically savvy people know how to subtly work the system. They are conscious of their surroundings, and can easily identify which stakeholders and relationships are important for their success, using this knowledge strategically in order to get ahead. It all starts with building good relationships with those in power, that is, the ones who have influence over the decisions that will affect your career trajectory. Without this political savvy, you can deliver great results time and time again and still be passed over for promotion. It could be that your colleague, who, despite being less competent, still got the promotion you think you deserved, simply bonded with the people who had influence over the decision of who to promote. The need to bond with important stakeholders is clear enough. But that’s easier said than done for women in the workplace, as company culture and politics today are still biased against them. Even if a company has made it clear in its guidelines that all employees are to be treated equally, women still face challenges when it comes to building workplace relationships. For example, a woman in a team mostly comprising men probably won’t get invited to weekend fishing trips or Monday night ball games. It won’t necessarily be out of malice, but simply because she is a woman, and her colleagues assume that she wouldn’t be interested in these activities or wouldn’t fit in.  But if she’s excluded from theses outings, she’s also excluded from the important conversations and bonding opportunities that come with them. As a woman, you have to be creative in forging bonds with the men in these networks, even though they might not make an effort to do the same. Picture that colleague of yours who is always talking about his achievements at work, and you can’t help but feel that he’s bragging. But is he really? Or is he preparing his promotion by promoting himself?  Performance in the workplace doesn’t speak for itself. Not everyone sees or has the context to understand your work, so you need to actively cultivate your reputation across an organization by talking about it. If you assume that performance speaks for itself, then the chances of career stagnation increase. In fact, research shows that women who know how to talk about their accomplishments and achievements receive both more promotions and higher compensation. In contrast, those who keep it to themselves are more likely to get neither.  Imagine that your company finally closes a massive deal after seemingly endless negotiations with another company. These hard-fought negotiations were brought to a close thanks to your convincing argumentation. After the meeting, what should you do? You should make sure to meet with your boss and tell them about the successful negotiations! Don’t just assume that they know a deal was made, and that it was your savvy that finally made it happen. But sometimes your contributions aren’t so cut and dry. In order to be able to promote yourself, you also need to be aware of your value proposition, in other words, the ways in which your work contributes to positive business outcomes. It’s important to know your value proposition, because you can only really promote yourself once you know what you bring to the table. To figure out your value proposition, write down some situations at work in which you were recently involved. Next, ask yourself how you specifically contributed to the success of these situations. This will give you insight into the skills and competencies that you can promote as part of your reputation. Most people believe the path to promotion involves keeping your head down and powering through your tasks – but this is absolutely incorrect. Rather, promotion depends on keeping your head up and looking around your company. The first step toward promotion is understanding how decisions are made and detecting the hidden rules that influence the decision-making process. Decisions in organizations are almost never made by a single person, but instead by many people. You need to find out which people have the most influence on the decisions that affect you – like promotions – and build good relationships with them. One way to figure this out is through simple observation. Ask yourself questions like who the management consults with before making important decisions. You should also be aware of unspoken rules. Though your organization’s official policy might be to “hire and promote the best people for the job,” it’s likely that there are other rules, such as tenure, that affect your promotion. So don’t worry if you aren’t promoted right away. Just develop an awareness of these informal rules in order to understand the organization and your position in it. But hidden rules go beyond the promotion process. There are also unspoken rules in the company culture – the personality of your company that defines the codes of behavior that are accepted, rewarded or viewed as favorable.  If you want your career at a particular company to prosper, you have to behave in accordance with their company culture. This will vary greatly depending on where you work. Company A, for instance, might have an unspoken rule that the one who barks the loudest gets to speak. In this environment, you have to interrupt others to make your point and thrive. This same strategy might not work for company B, where patience and listening are more highly valued. At this point, you’ve learned some of the things that you can do immediately to start preparing for promotion. The final blinks will examine the kinds of people that can help you along the way. Imagine that your colleague just got promoted to a position that you didn’t even know was vacant. How did that happen? In all likelihood, her network provided her with the right information at the right time.  You can do the same by building a strategic network, a group of people who support, protect and promote you. Your strategic network doesn’t just help you get promoted. It also provides you with valuable information about the workplace, the people in it and its hidden rules.  For example, if you are applying to a new position, take some time before your interview to consult a trusted colleague within your strategic network about the hiring manager and their decision-making process. This way, you’ll have a better idea of who to talk to and how to best leverage your value proposition. In order to build an effective strategic network, you first have to define your career goals. After all, without these goals, how will you know who can help you achieve them? These goals should be divided into short-term and long-term career goals. Knowing these goals, you can better analyze the position you want to achieve, as well as the people who might help you get there. One way to keep track of who can help you, and where, is to list all your important professional relationships on a track sheet, evaluate their level of influence and the quality of your current relationship to them. Imagine, for instance, that you currently occupy an entry-level position in your company’s marketing department. Your goal, however, is to become a team leader in the sales department. To reach this goal, start by identifying who the current team leader in the sales department reports to, who the decision makers in the hiring process are and which members of the sales team can support you in the hiring process. Connect with all of them, and you’ll be on the right track! Imagine that you’re looking for a new job. But, instead of making endless phone calls and writing your applications yourself, someone else tells you all about positions that aren’t even listed yet, and then goes ahead and recommends you for them. Sounds like a dream, right?  It’s not a dream. In fact, if you find the right sponsor, this could be your reality. A sponsor is someone from within your organization – an influential person who is higher up on the ladder than you currently are and who wants to see you succeed. Sponsors are different from mentors in that they help you on multiple levels: not only do they offer you their sage advice, they also actively make things happen for you. If your goal is to hold a top position in the marketing department, your mentor might advise you to build a relationship with the marketing manager. Your sponsor would do the same, but would then actually introduce you to said marketing manager. So how do you go about finding the right sponsor? That depends on you and your career goals, but one thing’s for certain: the right sponsor might not be the one you like the most, but rather the one with the most power. For instance, while you might admire a top-level manager for their inclusive leadership, their decisions are always undermined by those who push decisions through without worrying about inclusion. This inclusive manager might be likeable, but he has less power, and thus less value for you as a sponsor. Instead, consider other contacts with a greater level of influence, and make dedicated time in your schedule to bond with them. But why would anyone be interested in being your sponsor? Well, sponsorship is always mutually beneficial if it’s done right. By helping you, your sponsor can expand her impact and reach across the organization. We all need help and guidance sometimes. And just like a personal trainer raises your chances of reaching your health and fitness goals, a professional coach can help you reach your career aspirations. As you learned previously, knowing and setting goals is critical for your career development. Your coach can not only help you to define these goals, but can also provide you with the strategic focus necessary to achieve them, along with the accountability necessary to keep you on the right track. Imagine that your goal is to become a manager. As you now know, reaching that goal is dependent upon your ability to create or improve your strategic network. After meeting with your coach and discussing your goal, you decide that the best approach is to spend an hour each week networking with important people in your organization. As time goes by, however, you become overwhelmed by your day-to-day work and stop networking. Here, your coach steps in, holds you accountable for straying from your plan and encourages you to keep networking! Finally, your coach can teach you important skills that will help you climb the career ladder. For example, once you’ve landed a leadership position, you might realize that your leadership skills are lacking; you don’t know how to trust your subordinates to complete tasks as well as you could. You know that if you don’t let go, you’ll be overwhelmed by tasks that your subordinates should be doing anyway and demoralize them in the process. Luckily, your coach can teach you the leadership skills that will allow you to trust your team and let go of the desire to control everything. The key message in this book: Women face more obstacles than men in the workplace, and overcoming these obstacles isn’t as easy as just doing a better job. Rather, women need to be politically savvy by understanding workplace dynamics, and identifying the people who can help and support them in reaching their career goals.  Actionable advice: Always ask yourself: How can I add extra value to my work? Your value isn’t just your ability to complete tasks. It’s also the knowledge and attitude you bring to the workplace. By taking the time to do things like sharing interesting articles on topics that are relevant and important for your company or department, you add extra value and people notice that you care and contribute.

Take someone like Dr. Dre, who started as a DJ in Los Angeles’s South Central district, moved on to become a successful producer and is now the owner of a headphone empire, as well as a high-ranking executive at Apple Music. Stories like his can be inspiring, but are also easily dismissed as something that only a happy few can achieve – specifically, those with exceptional talent and timing. But there is also power to be found in being broke. These blinks will offer insights into how being broke can help us achieve greatness, based on the experience of self-made men and women. In these blinks, you’ll find out how a poor immigrant turned an ice cream truck into a restaurant empire; why trying to reach new customer demographics can be a bad thing; and which successful computer company was founded by a guy who couldn’t operate a computer. Have you ever had to come up with something for dinner when you’re stuck with only two or three ingredients? If so, you might remember that limitations like this can often result in some of the tastiest meals. This is just one example of the truth in the old saying, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” Or, to put it another way, being short on resources can generate real creativity and inspiration that would otherwise never emerge. Having a million dollars to launch a business doesn’t mean it will be successful. On the contrary, already being rich can take away the passion and innovation that long-term success requires.   But with an empty bank account, it’s clear that your only chance for success is to dig deep and become innovative. It’s like being a basketball player who has one shot to win the game, but they’re at half-court with only a second left on the clock; there’s no other option but to go for it and take the spectacular shot. It’s also important to realize that innovation comes from a singular vision that starts from the bottom up, not the top down. It doesn’t matter if it’s entertainment, fashion or technology, ideas grow organically from the ground up – they aren’t inspired by executives dumping a bunch of money on a project. And when an idea really takes off, it’s usually because people respond enthusiastically to something real and authentic. Take Art Basel, for example, one of the world’s biggest art fairs, which takes place in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Miami Beach. While it has many established artists on display, many visitors get more excited about the unfunded street artists who are seen as being more genuine and “authentic.” This played a key part in coauthor Daymond John’s success with FUBU, which stands for For Us, By Us. The clothing line was inspired by the way real people in the streets were dressing, not by designer studios. You can also think of your brand as a personal relationship with your customer; like any good relationship, it has to be built on solid foundations. So be true to yourself – otherwise, the relationship is doomed to fail. If you’re familiar with the Rocky movies, you know that Rocky’s career falls apart when he lets his success get to his head and starts throwing money around. To get back on top, he realizes that he needs to rediscover his passion and hunger to win. A similar principle applies to business, as being hungry can keep you focused on your growth and help you stay realistic about what’s within reach. Just look at Capital One bank’s Small Business Confidence Score. This score is determined by a number of questions about a business's hiring plans, future outlook and the current economic situation. What the scores show are that overall confidence is at its highest rate since the 2008 recession, and that’s because small, hungry business owners know how to stick to business plans and use small steps to make great strides. A great way to stay hungry and successful is to think like a shark by knowing your waters while keeping focused on your target. On ABC’s reality TV show Shark Tank, one entrepreneur after another pitches their product or idea to investors. And if there’s one thing the show teaches, it’s that investors want to hear that an entrepreneur has a clear understanding of both their market and their goals. In one case, the show’s investors rejected an affordable athletic shoe company called Forus because the entrepreneurs had their target market down, but still wanted to expand in a way that took them well outside that market. With this in mind, an investment would have done them a disservice by encouraging them to focus on the wrong demographics. This is why an entrepreneur who uses the trunk of their car to sell a cheap product might have a better chance with an investor. If they can sell 50 units in under five minutes, it proves that they have a perfect understanding of their market. Some people are born with certain advantages while others start out at a disadvantage – but even if you have to work harder than others just to get on equal footing, don’t let it get you down. Being at a disadvantage and having few resources is actually a proven a recipe for success. In fact, immigrants to the United States are twice as likely as US citizens to start their own business. Rocky Aoki came to the United States from Japan in the 1960s, and in order to pay for his restaurant management classes, he rented an ice cream truck that he drove around New York City. He eventually saved up $10,000, which helped convince his father to invest in his restaurant, which went on to become the popular Japanese restaurant chain, Benihana. Rocky wanted his son, electronic dance musician Steve Aoki, to find his own success without relying on Rocky’s money. So, when Steve was 19 years old, he used the $400 he had to help start a music label by the name of Dim Mak Records with his friends. Their office was his apartment, which was regularly packed with up to 13 interns. Steve and his friends would self-produce a seven-inch single and sell it out of the back of their car after Steve’s DJ gigs until they could afford to make another one. While Steve did eventually max out ten different credit cards, today he’s a hugely popular musician with a successful label and lifestyle brand. As the Aokis show us, sometimes you have more resources at your disposal than you may think. If you’re a homeowner, you might have equity in your house that you can invest. But if you’ve taken out a loan, make sure you put money aside so you can make payments until your business starts earning money. Extra money can also come from small things you don’t need. If your car is just sitting in a garage every day, maybe you can sell it, like Steve Jobs did with his car to help buy the components for the first Apple computer. It may be that not everyone will notice or appreciate your authenticity, but it’s important to stick to your guns nevertheless. For instance, Acacia Brinley was recognized for her trendsetting Tumblr page, but her posts received a fair amount of negative feedback as well. Even so, the “selfie queen” of social media didn’t let this stop her. Remember that you don’t need to please everyone; it’s far more important that you remain true to yourself. Being broke only means you can't spend money to make things look fancy. Instead, use the Power of Broke and the fact that you’re in a can’t-lose situation to let your personality shine through. When Daymond John started FUBU, he knew he was going to be competing for shelf space with other clothing lines. But through his brand, he could show how much his community and clothing meant to him. And it didn’t take any extra money to do so. In fact, John used the Power of Broke, which forced him to spend very little money extremely wisely, to display his authenticity to the black community. John was one of the first designers to give his clothes away to hip-hop artists, who in turn wore them in music videos and helped solidify FUBU’s place in the fashion world. John then focused on Black Entertainment Television (BET), a US cable network that focuses on the black community. This way, John could reach his target audience easily, cheaply and directly. Since the Nielsen ratings company used very few black households to measure ratings when John started out, BET appeared to have a very low amount of viewers, so they charged very little for advertising. This worked in FUBU’s favor, as it allowed the brand to reach a wide audience for very little money. This is the kind of opportunity that you should keep an eye out for when things are looking bleak – one that allows you to stay in your market and stay authentic. Too many companies have gotten used to the idea of using “other people’s money” to do business. And though the thought of funding might sound appealing, there is such a thing as too much help. When you consider looking for investors, make sure you don’t risk losing control of your business. Bringing an investor on board means giving up a percentage of your business, which could also mean cutting into your already small profits or growing more quickly than you can handle.   The better kind of growth is one that is slow, profitable and under your control. Furthermore, bringing in outside capital also means having to rewrite your business plan, which can cause you to lose focus as well as control. Instead, be like Gigi Butler and stick to your vision, even when funding is nowhere to be found. Butler was determined to open a cupcake shop in Nashville, even when banks thought she was crazy and refused to give her a dime. Butler’s prior employment was as a cleaning lady for Nashville’s upper crust, so no one was willing to help fund her dream. But after maxing out credit cards and emptying her bank account down to her last 30 dollars, Gigi’s Cupcakes was finally open for business. And, sure enough, customers lined up out the door. Not only was Butler able to pay off her credit card debt, she maintained total control over her business and her profits. Today, there are Gigi’s Cupcakes locations in 24 states with $35 million in annual sales. Sometimes debt is impossible to avoid, so don’t let it get in the way of your vision. When you start turning a profit, you might be tempted to put it back into your business, or simply to enjoy it. But the smartest thing to do is to pay off your debts so that interest rates don’t eat away at your earnings and your accounts can start looking healthy and prosperous. Far too many businesses have gone under because of debt that got out of hand, so don’t be one of them. So far, we’ve seen how the Power of Broke can be applied to give hungry and focused entrepreneurs a leg up in the business world – but these same principles can be used by the major players as well. After all, most big corporations started out as small businesses, and they should all continue to use the same strategies that got them to where they are today. Yet, when companies get rich, they tend to start throwing money at problems rather than coming up with creative solutions. Take marketing, for instance; you could easily throw away millions on ad campaigns and forget about using free or low-cost resources like social media. One can only wonder why 38 percent of the current Fortune 500 companies don’t have an active Twitter account. Let’s look at a smart campaign from years ago, before the era of social media: General Mills, a company with an enormous marketing budget, wanted to reintroduce its struggling Nature Valley granola bars. Even though they could have spent millions putting ads in every grocery store, they stayed tightly focused and targeted places with active young clients, such as ski resorts and outdoor gear shops. Since then, Nature Valley has gone on to be one of General Mills’ top-selling brands. The Power of Broke can also be applied to an entire industry. At the start of 1970, cigarette advertising was everywhere in the United States, from radio and television ads to billboards and magazines, featuring beloved icons like the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel. Later in the year, however, the US government announced its intention to tighten advertising restrictions for tobacco companies; meanwhile, Chinese cigarette companies were planning on making their first foray into the American market. Rather than throwing money and lobbyists at this potential problem, the American tobacco industry saw an opportunity that wouldn’t cost a penny: they accepted the government’s advertising restrictions. The US brands knew they already had a strong hold on the market, and they also knew that without billboards and TV commercials, the new foreign brands wouldn’t stand a chance. Coca-Cola has been around so long that you can be forgiven for thinking it’s always been a success. But like any other global brand, it had to start somewhere. It’s possible to pinpoint four different phases that you need to get through patiently before your brand can go global. The first stage is the item, which is your product in its most basic form: no label, no marketing, nothing but a product that satisfies a need. So you might have a coffee maker that doesn’t even have a logo or name yet. The second stage is the label, which is when you give your product a name that sets it apart and makes it memorable. This way, after customers see it for the first time, they’ll know to ask for it by name the next time they’re in the market. The third stage is the brand, at which point you create a logo for better label recognition, as well as an identifiable style around your product. This stage accounts for the money spent on advertising and marketing, ensuring that people will seek out the product and will easily spot it on a crowded shelf. The fourth and final stage is the lifestyle, which is when your brand has grown to the point that customers have come to expect a certain level of quality and experience. This is the stage at which a product can become a status symbol, as is the case with Nike, Apple and FUBU. By leveraging the Power of Broke in each of these phases, companies have a greater chance of making it. As your product moves through these stages, you might encounter some sort of crisis, and this is when you’ll need to be patient. As the Harvard Business Review confirms, businesses that survive recessions do so by cutting costs and continuing to invest in growth, which you might do by, say, increasing funding to your research and development department. This way, you’ll be prepared to launch when the inevitable upswing comes around. The office supply chain Staples made it through the 2000 recession by shutting down underperforming stores, while increasing its overall workforce by ten percent. When the recession ended, Staples had actually become more profitable than it had been beforehand. These days, remarkable technological advances are a seemingly everyday occurrence. It’s a great time for small businesses because it’s easier than ever for them to get the funding they need. For starters, the cost of technology is extremely low. Every year, it gets cheaper and easier to maintain a website and store massive amounts of data online, which makes it less risky and costly to take potentially lucrative chances. Other great tools for small businesses are crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which allow entrepreneurs to raise money for their ideas while maintaining strict control. Honey Flow is just one example of a crowdfunding success. The company posted a five-minute video to Indiegogo about their dream to start an innovative beekeeping and honey-extracting business. They had hoped to raise $70,000 to make it to the label phase, but ended up raising an astounding $12 million, becoming the most successful Indiegogo campaign ever. Today, it’s easier than ever to turn creativity into success, even if you’re not particularly skilled. FUBU’s Daymond John couldn’t draw or sew anything more than a straight line, but it didn’t keep him from starting a clothing line. Even short basketball players who seemingly can’t compete with their taller peers can end up having successful careers by using their speed and agility to their advantage, or perhaps by managing or coaching a team if they’re passionate enough about the sport. But one of the best paths to success is to come up with creative solutions for those who need help doing something. Michael Dell wasn’t a computer genius; on the contrary, he started Dell Computers with the goal of coming up with a computer that would be more user-friendly. You don’t need to be a rich genius to become a successful entrepreneur. With the Power of Broke, all you need is some creativity to find the right idea, and a willingness to embrace change and overcome the challenges along the way. With these traits in place, there’s nothing to lose – and no limit to your possibilities. The key message in this book: It doesn’t take a lot of money to launch a business. In fact, not having money forces budding entrepreneurs to rise to the challenge with creative and innovative solutions that otherwise may not have occurred to them. There will always be challenges in the business world, but you can use the Power of Broke to stay prepared for anything that might come your way. Actionable advice: Follow Daymond John’s Shark Points for Success: Define your goal so you know where you’re headed. Do your homework: analytics are key, as is knowing the competition. Be passionate about what you do. You are the brand, so be aware of how you carry yourself. Keep moving forward, keep scheming and always be ready to challenge your competitors. Got feedback?

It always seems like there’s something we could do better, faster or more efficiently. All too often we look to “time management” as a means of getting closer to the coveted “peak performance,” hoping – ultimately in vain – that all we need to do is squeeze more and more work into our finite, 24-hour days. If you remember the last time you pulled an all-nighter or really worked for eight hours straight, you know it’s not the right strategy. In order to perform to our best, i.e., at full engagement, we need to focus not on squeezing more into our limited hours but finding ways to do more with the time we have. To accomplish this, we need to shift our focus to managing our energy, not our time. The following blinks will talk about various kinds of energy, how they affect performance and what you can do to increase their capacity. In doing so, you can sharpen your focus, become more efficient and unlock your creative potential. Furthermore, you’ll discover how to truly balance work and play, never again having to compromise your hobbies and personal relationships for your work. In addition, these blinks will show you how doing less work can actually help you get more done, why your best ideas can often come to you in the shower, why it’s better to look for land than bail out water on a sinking ship and, finally, how to live your life according to your deepest-held values. Many of us race through life without ever taking a break: we return home exhausted from a long day’s work, feeling overwhelmed with both work and our private life. And no matter how hard we try, there’s never enough time to get everything done. But energy, not time, is the fundamental source of efficiency and high performance. Unfortunately, it’s too easy for us to forget this. Since we’re limited to 24 hours per day, we naturally focus on optimizing our time. But time alone won’t help us achieve our goals. We also need energy – without it, we can’t perform at our potential, no matter how much time we allow ourselves to do what we want! So rather than optimizing our schedules, we should focus on optimizing the quantity and quality of our available energy. One way to efficiently manage energy and get more accomplished is in fact to work less and take more breaks. When we concentrate on managing our time, many of us tend to work for hours on end without pause. But this takes a toll on our energy levels, and consequently makes us less productive. Think about it: How do you feel after working for four hours straight? Chipper and ready for more? You probably feel totally drained, and no matter how many espressos you drink, you’re still unable to keep your concentration and maintain productivity. Instead, try maximizing your energy (and therefore your productivity) by working less and taking lots of breaks. These breaks give you a chance to recharge your energy levels, thus allowing you to stay productive for more time. By focusing on managing our energy level rather than trying to cram 48 hours into a single day, we not only become more efficient, but also have energy left for our private lives. In order to make use of our energy, we must first understand what it actually is. We’re all familiar with physical energy, i.e., what we use to get around, but there are three additional sources of energy – emotional, mental and spiritual – that also require our attention. Luckily, we can use the same language as we do with physical energy – e.g., flexibility, endurance and strength – to describe the qualities of the other energies. Emotional flexibility allows us to demonstrate a wide range of emotions appropriate to a given situation rather than responding with rigidity. For instance, when faced with a threatening situation, emotional flexibility allows us to experience not only fear but also the curiosity and resilience necessary to surmount this obstacle. Mental endurance keeps us focused and concentrated over time. It helps us, for instance, to power through the times when we’d rather quit but shouldn’t, like when we’re reading those hopelessly boring (but necessary) reports at work. Spiritual strength helps us stay connected to our deepest values, which act as our life’s compass. For example, spiritual energy is involved when considering whether a decision we make, such as accepting a high-paying job with an unethical company, is congruent with our values and morals. In order to perform at our peak and feel our very best, we must maximize each of these energy levels, especially the physical and emotional ones. In fact, physical and emotional energy are our most fundamental sources of energy: without either, we would simply be too exhausted and deflated to accomplish anything. Imagine, for example, that you’re about to undergo heart surgery: where do you want your surgeon’s energy levels? If he is emotionally and physically exhausted, then he’ll be unfocused, prone to mistakes and in even incapable of making the right decisions in complicated situations – thus putting your life in imminent peril. But it’s not enough to know that energy is important; you also have to put that knowledge to good use. The next few blinks will show you exactly how to maximize your energy. Unfortunately, our energy reserves are not unlimited, and we tend to expend more energy per day than we recover, which eventually results in a burnout. In fact, recovery is an integral part of sustaining high levels of energy and thus high performance. Indeed, all organisms must recharge their batteries by following life-sustaining rhythms, i.e., patterns of behavior that help them stay alive and kicking. For humans, this includes the need to rest every 90 to 120 minutes. If we, however, override this natural cycle and work past the point when we need to rest, then we’ll constantly flood our bodies with stress hormones, which, over time, cause aggressiveness and impatience, and can even lead to heart attacks. So, if we want to live a happy and productive life, we need to learn to heed our life-sustaining rhythm and disengage at regular intervals. At work, this means taking a relaxing break every 1.5 hours or so by doing things like having a coffee or taking a leisurely stroll through a nearby park for fifteen minutes. In addition to preserving the energy in our reserves, we can also build up our energy levels by taking small steps outside our comfort zones. Just like training muscles, which we build up by stressing them beyond their normal levels, we can also expand our emotional, mental and spiritual energy capacity. We can train our energetic muscles the same way: by simply pushing them beyond our comfort zone and enduring short-term discomfort. For example, someone who suffers from constant negative thoughts (resulting from negative emotional energy) could write down his thoughts every morning right after getting up and then force himself to read through them. The resulting discomfort causes him to further reflect on his thoughts and view his struggles as challenges rather than problems. In doing so, he “trains” and strengthens his emotional energy. It’s obvious that without the physical energy required to move or think, we wouldn’t get much done. In fact, our physical energy is our most important fuel. If we want reach our potential, then we have to maximize our physical energy. But how? Our physical energy capacity is dependent upon how we eat, sleep and recover. Since the fundamental source of our physical energy comes from food, we should therefore look for foods that maximize our energy capacity, such as nuts, leafy green vegetables and yogurt. These foods provide the slow release of energy to our bodies, thus providing us with more sustainable energy. Drinking enough water is equally as important – in fact, muscles dehydrated by only 3 percent lose around 10 percent of their strength! Additionally, we need to recharge our batteries with regular rest. You’ve probably noticed that the longer you work into the night, the more mistakes you tend to make. That’s due to declining physical energy levels. So how long do we need to rest? One study measured the amount of sleep its subjects got in complete isolation, away from their watches and alarm clocks. They slept between seven and eight hours every night, which we can take to be the optimum amount of sleep. But maintaining high physical energy levels doesn’t just improve our physical performance: it also helps us perform mentally. In fact, various studies have verified that people who work out regularly show a marked improvement of up to 70 percent in their ability to handle complex decisions! It’s therefore crucial to maintain physical health. This doesn’t necessarily mean we have to hit the gym every day. Even just incorporating small exercises into our everyday lives will do, such as taking the stairs instead of escalators and elevators or walking just a little bit further than the nearest restaurant on our lunch break. Even by making a few minor changes to our lifestyle, we can set a foundation of physical health upon which we can increase our other energy capacities. When was the last time you did something simply because you enjoyed it, and not because you were obligated to? In a frantic effort to maximize our time, we tend to choose “useful” activities over “enjoyable” ones. As we will see, prioritizing work over play can have powerful negative consequences. That’s because we derive positive emotional energy from doing things we enjoy and find relaxing. In fact, it’s positive emotions, like enjoyment, feeling challenged, experiencing adventure and seeing opportunities, which fuel performance. Activities that inspire these emotions are enjoyable and fulfilling, and thus a source of emotional renewal, which helps us replenish our emotional energy. It’s therefore important for us to actually prioritize these kinds of enjoyable activities over ones that are supposedly “more productive.” For example, imagine that your boss comes rushing into your office with some extra report that has to be done right away. That will probably stress you out and lead to high negative energy which hampers your performance. So what do you do? You have to figure out an emotional renewal strategy: any activity that you find fulfilling and captivating and helps you to relax, e.g., taking a stroll around the block or reading a novel to take your mind off work. Afterwards, you’ll have the energy available to complete the report. In addition, we can avoid negative emotional energy by maintaining high levels of physical energy. That’s because our bodies raise our stress levels, and in turn our negative energy, whenever we’re low on physical energy. That’s why people tend to get grumpy and short-tempered when they haven’t eaten all day or gotten enough sleep. So, in order to sustain positive emotional energy, we should remember never to neglect our bodies, and always get enough food and rest! In order to compete in this ever-changing world, we need to be creative while maintaining as much efficiency and focus as possible. Counterintuitively, the harder we try to achieve all this at once, the less of each we seem to have. So how can we balance them all? The key lies in using your mental energy. First, we need to find ways to focus most efficiently on our work. Doing so means adopting realistic optimism, i.e., viewing the world “as it is” while simultaneously working positively toward our desired outcome. Realistic optimism helps us keep our sights on the target, even when things go awry. Imagine you feel like you’ve jeopardized your relationship with a customer by saying the wrong thing. Rather than getting upset or ignoring the feeling, you should first accept the situation and then find the positive aspects in it: remind yourself, for example, that the relationship is not finished and that you have an opportunity to learn from this mistake. Once you’re able to keep your focus through realistic optimism, you can set your sights on boosting your creativity. Consider this: our greatest ideas often come to us when we’re not actually working, for example, while we’re in the shower, when we’re falling asleep, painting a landscape, etc. Why? Creativity requires the work of the brain’s two hemispheres: the left hemisphere is used for logical, linear thinking, and the right is more visual and can see “the big picture.” At work, we overwork our left hemisphere by constantly carrying out mundane tasks while neglecting the visually stimulated right hemisphere. However, once we relax or do something enjoyable, our left hemisphere has a chance to rest while we work our right hemisphere. If we want to unlock our creative potential, we need to give both hemispheres a workout without over-exerting either, and thereby employ all our creative capacity. While most of us don’t consider ourselves spiritual, we nonetheless all have spiritual energy. Spirituality doesn’t necessarily mean adhering to a particular religion but describes a commitment to a set of personal values that give us purpose as individuals and so compel us to act. Indeed, spiritual energy is very important and provides us with our drive and motivation. But where does it originate? Developing spiritual energy requires us to be motivated by something beyond our immediate self-interest – often, this means thinking about the needs and wants of others. However, we often only act based on our immediate needs and desires, doing things because they provide us with immediate gratification. All too often, we don’t stop to consider whether these actions ultimately prevent us from living at our full potential. A perfect example of this is smoking cigarettes. Many smokers have an extremely difficult time quitting in spite of the obvious risk to their health, focusing first on the immediate desire for a smoke rather than their future well-being. In order to change this destructive behavior, we need to find a source of motivation beyond our self-interest, i.e., a purpose in life that helps us to act positively. Looking back to the smoker: although kicking the habit can be excruciating under normal circumstances, smokers who become pregnant find it much easier to quit. Why? Because they have the health of their child to think about. In other words, they have a source of motivation (or spiritual energy) that compels them to act more positively outside of their own self-interest. In order to maximize our spiritual energy, we need to find a way to balance our guiding purpose beyond our self-interest with our own goals and desires. In the next two blinks, we’ll see how to find our true purpose and how to connect with our values. The search for meaning is among the most powerful themes across all the world’s cultures. As we saw in the last blink, a sense of purpose is the motivation behind our engagement and commitment to what we do. But what constitutes a “good” purpose? First, your purpose must be positive. Purpose serves as a powerful and enduring source of energy as long as its focus is positive. A purpose fueled by the feeling of threat or deficit limits our choices for action. For example, imagine sitting in a leaking boat: your purpose, of course, is to keep the boat from sinking. But if you’re only focused on bailing out water, then there’s no way to navigate towards the shore! However, if we shift our purpose from being built around feeling threatened to feeling challenged, then we are able to set our sights on something more worthwhile. Second, our purpose has to be intrinsically motivating. We need to want to do something because the activity itself is fun or satisfying for us. In fact, external rewards, such as money and fame, can actually undermine our motivation. This was exemplified in one study where children were observed while playing as a way to assess what they most enjoyed doing. Surprisingly, when they were rewarded each time they engaged in their preferred activity, their interest in that activity suddenly – and rapidly – diminished. Finally, as mentioned previously, our sense of purpose must be rooted in something beyond mere self-interest. The challenge, however, is to find a way to express our deepest values during the normal working day. Often we can insert our values into the small choices we make, such as how we communicate with our coworkers or lead our subordinates. For example, if you value “respecting others,” then avoid making your coworkers feel unappreciated by doing things like rescheduling personal meetings at the last minute. By doing this, you keep your actions calibrated to your values, and move one step closer on the path to full engagement. Sure, social status or how many Facebook “likes” we get every day might be important to us, but values that really matter have an intrinsic worth. They provide us with a source of our life’s meaning, which can’t be taken away from us, regardless of whether someone “de-friends” us. Our values provide the framework for how we would like to behave. If you want to find out what your personal values are, ask yourself what matters most to you. To give an example, one of the authors’ clients identified the following values: family, respect and kindness towards others, excellence, integrity, and health. Another strategy is to reflect on someone you deeply respect and ask yourself: What are the qualities you most admire about him or her? Those can be your values. Our values should ultimately serve as guideposts for every action we take and decision we make. When our values don’t guide our choices, the values themselves are meaningless. For example, if one of your values is “honesty,” yet you cheat on your partner, you must honor your value by telling him or her about your affair or your feelings. Otherwise, you couldn’t truly say that you’re guided by honesty. You should therefore aim to achieve spiritual alignment, i.e., the point at which you truly “walk the walk” and your values are evident in every aspect of your life. One way to help us towards this goal is to remind ourselves of our values every day by formulating them as a vision statement that tells us how to invest our energy such that we serve our values. Here’s one example of a vision statement provided by the authors: “I fight passionately for what I believe, but remain open to learning and growing. At work, I am committed to helping people grow, deepen and behave more effectively in the world.” By creating a vision statement, you have a clear way of knowing whether your actions are congruent with your values, and can thus better manage your spiritual energy. While it’s true that we require positive energy on the path to full engagement, we should not take this to mean that we should deny or suppress our negative feelings. Instead, we should strive to consciously manage them. Understandably, many of us tend to avoid the truth at times in order to protect ourselves from the pain of negative emotions. In the long run, however, this can actually decrease our energy levels. For example, if we receive negative feedback on the work we’ve done, many of us choose to ignore or dismiss this criticism as simply “wrong” rather than actually looking into the criticism for any insights that might help us improve. In fact, avoiding the truth in this way consumes a lot of energy due to the mental effort it requires. Although ignoring criticism protects your self-esteem in the short-term, in the long-term you’ll be destined to repeat the same mistakes and therefore have to face criticism every time you submit your work. Therefore, whenever you force yourself to ignore criticism, you squander your precious energy. On the other hand, being honest with ourselves and open to improvement helps us build positive energy. Often, this is difficult because people believe that the way they see a situation is the “absolute truth,” thus preventing themselves from accepting criticism. Instead, we should accept that our viewpoint is only one of many and might not necessarily be the best. Adopting this approach allows us to learn from others and improve ourselves. Being honest with ourselves also means accepting self-criticism. Ask yourself how closely your behavior correlates to your values and how consistent you are with your priorities, and don’t be afraid to give honest answers! If you identify a performance barrier, such as a bad work/life balance or a poor attitude towards your work, then admit it so that you can figure out how to overcome it. People often consider “rituals” to be relics of a lost time – certainly not something relevant to our flexible, ever-changing modern lives. Not so! Rituals are positive, consciously acquired behaviors that we perform without thinking, thus saving energy and time. In fact, most of our actions are driven by rituals, thus helping us perform more efficiently. According to research, only about 5 percent of our behavior is consciously performed, meaning that 95 percent of our actions occur automatically, out of habit. Try as we might, we cannot discipline ourselves to always act consciously; the toll self-control exacts from our energy is simply too high. Rituals therefore allow us to balance our energy expenditure and renewal – they allow us to act without thinking, even in the most stressful of situations. Think of it like soldiers preparing for combat: the recruits build rituals around every aspect of their lives, from what they eat to how to think and act under pressure. This code of conduct allows them to automatically make the right decision, even in life-threatening situations. But rituals don’t only conserve energy: designing positive rituals helps us to live in accordance with our values and perform at our very best. But how can we form these rituals? One way is to use a technique called priming: every time you’re tempted by something “bad,” do something “good” instead. For example, if you’re trying to give up sweets, then every time you feel the temptation to eat a piece of cake, tell yourself “Whenever I’m tempted by dessert, I’ll have some fruit instead.” Over time, you’ll form a habit of eating fruit and not dessert, which is far more efficient than consciously forcing yourself to stay out of the kitchen every time you face temptation. Moreover, rituals must be trained by carefully pushing beyond our comfort zones: start by building rituals in increments, focusing on one lifestyle change at a time, and then build upon that improvement with new rituals. Eventually you’ll incorporate all your values into your daily life. The key message in this book: In order to become fully engaged in whatever you do and perform at your absolute peak, you must first actively build your energy capacity in all dimensions of life – physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually – and manage this energy intelligently.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

While you see parts of it above the surface of the water, most of it is hidden beneath. The same can be said of your mind: the part we are aware of – the conscious mind – is visible and known to us, while the other, and at least equally large, part constitutes our subconscious. So how do we tap into such a vast and seemingly inaccessible part of our minds? That is exactly what we will look at in these blinks of a classic book from the early 1960s. You will discover how to unleash the potential that is hidden in your subconscious to tackle a wide array of issues and problems, coming out at the other end feeling both wiser and happier. You’ll also find out how a doctor used his subconscious to reduce mortality rates; why you need to visualize your house being sold; and why you must learn to love the boss you don’t like. Do you remember when you learned to ride a bike? It likely required intense attention and focus from your conscious mind. But after a while, your subconscious probably started to get the hang of things and, pretty soon, riding a bike was a natural, almost automatic task. This is a great example of conscious to unconscious learning, an incredible tool at your disposal. Using it only requires harnessing the power of your subconscious mind through the repetition of positive thoughts. Just take Enrico Caruso, the Italian opera tenor. In the late nineteenth century, he performed at famous opera houses throughout Europe and the United States. However, he used to suffer throat spasms and would find himself drenched in sweat moments before he was supposed to sing. Why? Well, his mind was filled with negative thoughts; he always imagined the crowd laughing him off the stage or heckling a poor performance. Nonetheless, he got over this stage fright by telling his “small me,” or conscious mind, to stop interfering with his “big me,” or subconscious mind. By repeating this meditative practice, he eventually gave his subconscious mind the ability to ignore his fears, freeing up more energy for his powerful voice box. In other words, the subconscious mind is tremendously powerful. In fact, it can absorb and manifest any idea that you suggest to it. For instance, psychologists have done a number of experiments in which a seasoned hypnotist puts his students into a hypnotic state before suggesting to them that they are cats. The students then go on to act the part with total authenticity; their subconscious minds simply accept whatever their conscious minds believe to be true. Or consider the Scottish surgeon, Dr. James Esdaille. Between the years 1843 and 1846, he performed some 400 operations, including amputations, well before the development of anesthesia. The mortality rate for his procedures was incredibly low, at just two or three percent, and it was all thanks to his technique of hypnotically suggesting to his patients that they would not contract an infection. This hypnotic tool was sufficient to prompt a response on the part of their subconscious minds and, in turn, their bodies. Back in the eighteenth century, priests would heal the sick by convincing them that God would make them well. Incredibly, this approach often worked. But it wasn’t the work of some mysterious deity; the subconscious mind was the real healer. This seemingly supernatural effect can be explained by the fact that positive thoughts give your subconscious the power to heal diseases. For example, after one of the author’s relatives developed tuberculosis, the man’s son became determined to heal him. He told his father that he bought a cross from a monk who recently visited a healing shrine in Europe – but, in reality, it was just a piece of wood he picked up off the sidewalk. He said that simply touching the cross had already healed countless people. So, his father gripped the object, praying with it in his hand as he fell asleep. The next morning, he was completely healed. In fact, the father was so convinced that he was healed by the cross that nobody ever told him the truth; breaking this illusion would likely have caused the disease to resurface. In a similar way, simply imagining something you desire can help make it a reality. A good example here comes from the author’s teachings at the Church of Divine Science, which became a weekly radio show with millions of listeners. In one segment on this show, the author discussed the mental movie method while advising people on the process of selling their homes. In this method, visualization is used to create and hold a mental image until the subconscious mind makes it real. For a home seller in the example above, the first step was to build confidence that she had set a reasonable price. Then, while in a sleepy state, she would envision celebrating the day the sale finally closed. As she dozed off, keeping this image in her head, her subconscious mind would connect her with the buyer. This process worked so well that a number of listeners sent in letters, thanking the author for helping them sell their homes. You now know how visualization can help you sell your house – but that’s just the beginning. This powerful tool can do much more. It can even help attract money and, for it to do so, you need only picture your desired result and rely on your subconscious to make it happen. Just take the story of an Australian boy who dreamed of becoming a doctor and a surgeon, despite lacking the money he needed to start on the path toward this dream. Every night for months, before he fell asleep, he would imagine a medical diploma hanging on his wall with his name written on it. Eventually, a doctor who knew the boy saw potential in him and trained him to sterilize instruments, give injections and eventually paid for his medical school tuition. Another way your subconscious can help you is by overcoming envy, a feeling of inferiority that can obstruct your path to wealth. For example, seeing another person cash a huge check might make you feel envious, but you can easily defeat this response. The solution is to wish greater wealth upon others, which will signal to your subconscious that you deserve the same for yourself. If you instead remain envious, you’ll only preclude your own potential affluence. And finally, you can reap tremendous benefits by pairing visualization with passion. For instance, the author knew a young pharmacist who was in love with his work and often dreamed of having his own pharmacy. He focused his mind on conjuring images of himself distributing prescriptions and, one day, began a new job at a major chain store, where he worked with the passion he had always imagined. Eventually, he became the manager and, after four years, he had saved enough to open his own pharmacy. Through passion and visualization, he rose through the industry and was able to realize his ambitions. Did you know that humans spend a full third of our lives asleep? But that’s not to say this is all lost time. In fact, lots of things happen while you sleep; your body restores its energy, heals faster and digests properly. With your physical body so active during rest, you better believe that your subconscious is working through the night as well, striving to protect you. Incredibly, these intuitive powers of your subconscious can help guide you. Just take one of the author’s Church of Divine Science radio show listeners, a woman from Los Angeles. She was offered a job in New York City at double her current salary but couldn’t decide whether or not to take it. In the end, she sought guidance from her subconscious, trusting that the answer would come to her in her sleep. She practiced meditation as she dozed off and the next morning had a strong feeling that she shouldn’t take the job. Months later, her choice was validated when the company filed for bankruptcy. Her subconscious mind’s intuition had guided her to the correct decision. And that’s not all your subconscious can do for you in your sleep; it might even be able to find you your dream partner by simply focusing on the qualities that you desire in a better half. For instance, the author knew a teacher who had three ex-husbands, all of whom were passive and weak, despite her attraction to the opposite qualities. What was happening? Her masculine, dominant personality had subconsciously attracted submissive partners. However, by mentally constructing her ideal husband every night, she succeeded in breaking the pattern. She took a job as a receptionist in a doctor’s office and immediately knew that the physician was the healthy, successful man she had been imagining. To make a long story short, they got married and had a happy life together. Just about everyone has known the glee you can experience upon finding a great deal at a flea market or a $20 bill on the street. But we also know that such happiness is fleeting. Luckily, there are ways to get more happiness into your life. It begins by changing your thoughts. In order to be happy, you need to choose happiness. For example, a salesman once asked the author for advice because, despite consistently outperforming his colleagues, he had never received recognition for his work. He blamed this discrepancy on a belief that the sales manager disliked him and therefore treated him poorly. His mind was full of hostility and anger toward his boss and, eventually, these thoughts began to obstruct his progress. However, he realized that he had the power to choose happiness instead by switching to a positive mind-set. He began wishing health and success upon his boss and practiced visualizing his manager congratulating him, going in for a friendly handshake and shooting him a beaming smile. One day, his boss called him up and promoted him to sales manager, giving him a huge raise in the process. The takeaway here is that negative thoughts are highly detrimental and can even prevent you from attaining peace of mind. Just take one of the author’s associates, who worked every day until one in the morning, neglecting his wife and two sons and causing himself to suffer from high blood pressure. Why was he such a workaholic? Well, it wasn’t immediately clear. But when he dug a little deeper, he found that he felt remorse for not doing right by his deceased brother, who had passed away many years earlier. Because he was racked by such guilt, he was punishing himself by working ceaselessly and preventing himself from seeing his family. To finally end this suffering and heal himself, he first had to forgive himself. Now, he makes plenty of time for his family and works regular hours. When you were a kid, were you scared of monsters hiding under the bed? If you were, as many children are, you probably remember that feeling of relief when your mom turned on the light, revealing that everything was safe. The truth is, all fears are built upon such false thoughts and terror can be eased by countering them. Some of the most common fears are of failure and powerlessness. Just take the story of Mr. Jones, who couldn’t control his impulse to drink excessively. He would at times remain drunk for two weeks on end. His constant failure to quit drinking had left him feeling powerless, and the fear that he would fail again made him give up trying. Finally, only after losing his family did he decide to face these fears. He put himself into a relaxed state and imagined his daughter praising him for getting sober. Through this process, he was able to gradually give up drinking and eventually reunite with his family. Another common fear is that of aging, which can also be overcome by modifying your thought processes. After all, you only age when you stop dreaming and learning new skills, which means staying young is really just about staying active. Consider an executive who lived close to the author. He retired at the age of 65 after spending the vast majority of his life studying and working. Rather than fearing his later years, he saw retirement as an opportunity to pursue the things he had always wanted to; he took photography classes, travelled the world taking photos and eventually became a lecturer on the subject. His simple enthusiasm for this hobby drove him to continue learning, keeping him young at heart and prompting his mind and body to follow suit. Or take the author’s father who, at 65, learned French and became a specialist on the language by the age of 70. After that, he studied Gaelic, teaching the language until his death at the ripe age of 99. The key message in this book: Your subconscious mind is constantly at work, and you can harness its power for your own benefit. This dormant force can help you tackle any issue in your life, improving the way you feel both emotionally and physically. Ultimately, this entire process hinges on visualizing success and banishing negative thoughts.  Actionable advice: Use a simple technique for overcoming fear. If you struggle with a fear, no matter what it is, try a simple approach to overcome it. Take five or ten minutes, three times a day, to sit down and imagine doing the thing you’re afraid of. Vividly picture the experience as a joyous one, with people cheering you on. By mentally practicing overcoming your fear in this way, the idea will take root in your subconscious mind, even when you’re not imagining it, and eventually the fear will disappear. Got feedback?

Well, you should know that getting a good position at a reputable university is becoming increasingly difficult, as more and more graduates compete to land one of the few available positions. By keeping a few things in mind, however, you can dramatically increase your chances of success. As these blinks show, you must demonstrate to potential employers not only that you’re doing interesting research but that you’re socially adept and know how to collaborate with others.  In these blinks, you’ll learn what’s wrong with your CV; why having a clear academic identity is so important; and why you should avoid fancy vocabulary during your job interview. An academic career can be highly rewarding. But studying at a recognized university has become extremely expensive, and so a life in academia might also mean a life in debt. Here’s why: Under financial pressure caused by a decrease in public funding, American universities have had to increase public university tuition. As a result, more and more students graduate deep in debt. Public colleges, too, have raised their tuition fees. From 2008 to 2014, the annual inflation-adjusted tuition at public colleges went up by 27 percent, an overall average increase of $1,850. In Arizona and California, tuition fees rose by more than 70 percent! And so, during the last few years, student debt has also increased drastically. In 2012, the average debt for a fresh graduate was $29,400 – 25 percent higher than the average debt in 2008. In 2014, the average graduate’s debt was $57,600. What happened? Mainly, it comes down to the state’s spending less on higher education. Between 2008 and 2013, for instance, spending dropped by 28 percent. Additionally, during the last few years, universities have concentrated on hiring administrative personnel like deans and provosts, rather than hiring teachers. According to the US Department of Education, the number of administrators hired by colleges and universities between 2001 and 2011 was 50 percent greater than the number of instructors hired. The sad reality is that teaching work is mostly assigned to hired adjuncts who get paid as little as $1,800 per month for instructing university classes. On top of the paltry pay, most academics at universities end up working in less-than-desirable circumstances. Furthermore, in 2013, only 25 percent were on a permanent tenure track – something especially problematic for graduate students towing hefty debts.  So graduate students face an uphill battle when it comes to finding a job. And most of them don’t even know it! In the next blink, we’ll shed some more light on the situation. Securing a job in academia is no walk in the park, and many job seekers naively start sending out applications, oblivious to the challenges awaiting them. This is particularly true for graduate students, who often entertain unrealistic fantasies about the academic job market. Typically, there are three beliefs graduates hold: the first is that having a well-known advisor guarantees landing a good job; the second is that passion for a field of research suffices to set a candidate apart; and, finally, that good ideas are more important than a good CV. What they underestimate is their competition: there are masses of applicants out there, each of them thinking along similar lines. In the field of English, for instance, one job opening can attract as many as 1,000 applicants. Another hurdle is that advisors often fail to prepare their graduate students for the dog-eat-dog job market. They may say that the placement rates of their PhD program are very good, for example, which might result in students failing to prepare sufficiently. Students may also place less importance on being published in peer-reviewed journals or attending major conferences. Sometimes the problem can be that advisors are simply too kind and don’t warn their students of the harsh job market. But even if graduates are aware of the job market, they sometimes use strategies that do more harm than good. For example, graduates may play down their career aspirations, even stating that they aren’t overly ambitious or that they would prefer to teach at a small college. This approach doesn’t better their chances of getting a good job; if anything, it makes it less likely that they’ll secure one, and increases the likelihood of their not moving beyond the position of adjunct professor. Learning from other people’s mistakes can vastly improve your chances of success, and if you’re looking to land a job in academia, it’s especially helpful to locate where others went wrong. When looking for a job, graduate students unwittingly sabotage themselves in three main ways. First, they babble on about their dissertation during job interviews. In reality, the interviewers are far more interested in knowing what value a candidate can bring to the institution, such as how many papers they are planning to publish and the grants they can get. Another trap graduates fall into is waiting for permission – which never comes – instead of taking the initiative themselves. For instance, sometimes advisors don’t inform students that they must publish if they want to build a competitive resume.  Graduate students also often make the mistake continuing to act like students in interviews, behaving submissively instead of addressing the interviewers as equals. But, of course, those on the interview panel aren’t looking for another student; they’re searching for a colleague. To avoid these blunders, you should clarify your academic identity by answering three questions: First, what is your area and topic focus? Define this to clarify what you are doing. Your research field could be modern Japan, for example, and your topic focus could be gender. Next, what is your research program? This includes the journals you wish to publish in and any upcoming projects you’re working on, such as publishing a book with a major university press. Last, what are your pedagogical commitments? That is, what do you want your students to gain from your classes? For instance, there may be some stereotypes – only poor people live in Africa, for instance – that you wish to eradicate or enlighten students about. Articulating your academic identity will give you the appropriate mindset for your job search. But you must also have the right documents. Let’s look at these next. Everyone understands the importance of a top-notch CV when applying for any job. But one thing that is often neglected is the cover letter. Here’s how to write a cover letter that will put you ahead of the pack. There are four structuring rules for creating a great cover letter. First, include the letterhead from your current academic institution. This simple step will instantly make your cover letter look more professional. Next, your letter should be two-pages long, written in 11- or 12-point type, preferably with Times New Roman or Garamond as your typeface. Also, your margins should be around an inch in width. Third, devote no more than one paragraph to your dissertation. People on hiring committees probably want to hear less about it than you want to talk about it! Also be sure to include a second research project that is somehow linked to the dissertation you’re planning to work on. This will show your interest in continuing to build and expand on your work. As well as these structuring rules, you should list only facts in your cover letter, and avoid using emotive language. Some job seekers love to write about their passion for teaching or their research field, but it’s far better to replace any grandiose statements with facts that show this passion. For instance, you might include a detailed description of the courses you’ve taught or the kind of teaching methods you plan to employ. Once you’ve structured your letter, you should set about tailoring it to the job opening. Start by reading the job description thoroughly. This will help you clearly communicate how you fit into the role. After this, research the department so you can identify potential collaborators, and then explain how you might collaborate with them. Now that you have a focused, professional cover letter, you must accompany it with a quality CV. Of course, quality content is paramount, but quantity also matters. In fact, you should be able to add something of value to your CV each month. It might be a national conference you attended, a talk you gave on campus or a grant you were awarded. You should also be able to identify and highlight the important points in your CV. For instance, a book review is less valuable than writing a book proposal and pitching it to leading publishers in your field. In regards to teaching, working as a teaching assistant is less valuable than creating content for and teaching your own class. Your CV should also be guided by the principle of peer review.  This principle says that anything you have done that has been reviewed by academic peers is more important and competitive than a voluntary activity. A paper published in a peer-reviewed journal is worth more than teaching courses because teaching is voluntarily, while the peer review demonstrates your intellectual prowess from a more objective standpoint. Likewise, campus talks you opted to give are less competitive than being invited to lecture at another campus. Finally, when you write your CV, two sections should take precedence. Education is the first and should also be the first section in your CV. In this section, make sure you use appropriate abbreviations, such as PhD, rather than Doctor of Philosophy, as writing titles out can come across as pretentious. The other most important section is your conference activity. In this part, include any conferences where you organized panels, presented papers or were part of a discussion panel. A credible CV and a strong cover letter will get you off to a good start in your job search. But you should also master the art of the teaching statement, which we’ll look at next. If you’re ardent about working in academia, chances are you’re passionate about teaching. That’s great! But when it comes to writing your teaching statement, you need to be able to communicate this in the right way. A good teaching statement follows three rules. First, it should be no longer than one page, and it should support your cover letter and CV. Second, don’t be overly humble and avoid using emotive words. Too many applicants write about how honored they were to teach a certain class or how passionate they are about teaching – fine feelings, but not a good way to demonstrate your competence. Third, don’t write out the teaching part of your CV in full. No one wants to read about how first you taught this class, then started teaching that one. Be brief! Alongside these rules, you should include the following three elements in your statement: Articulate your ideas on the purpose of university teaching. The teaching statement is sometimes also referred to as a “teaching philosophy,” so think about the inherent value of teaching, such as preparing students to deal with a specific situation. Then, demonstrate how you can achieve this with specific teaching strategies, and back up the effectiveness of these teaching strategies with clear evidence, such as course evaluations. The third core element is your final paragraph – the conclusion. This needs to be strong, and the best way to buff it up is to show how your teaching will impact your students. If you’re asked to include a teaching portfolio, don’t go overboard in an attempt to wow the committee. Just show that you can put a class together, and take a look at some of the university’s current syllabi to get an idea about workload. Remember to tailor courses to the department and campus. If you’re sending out a stack of applications, resist the urge to copy and paste! Now that you have the documents that will land you an interview, what can you do to ensure you interview well? Once you’ve landed a job interview, you need to consider a few key things. Let’s begin with your research. When presenting your research, concentrate on its most relevant aspects. In your presentation, as well as in the Q&A session, aim to tailor your research to the position that was advertised. So, if the position concerns nineteenth-century British literature, don’t babble on about the development of postcolonial film. Focus on the research you conducted on nineteenth-century British literature, or how your research is influenced by it. It’s best to begin your presentation with a strong, single paragraph that clarifies the topic of the talk, including its basic structure.  After you’ve presented your research, be prepared to answer questions in three different areas. The first area will be your dissertation. Here, it’s important to be able to articulate how your dissertation differs from other research in your field and how it affects it. Toward the end of your presentation, during the Q&A session, the interviewer will likely challenge your theories or ideas. If you struggle to answer a question, try to reframe it. For instance, if asked why you didn’t include certain things in your research, say that you had considered those things, but that your findings led you to focus on a different, more important issue, which you did address. It’s also likely that you’ll be asked about your long- and short-term publishing plans. You might get questions about the book you’re planning on writing – if you’ve already spoken with a publisher about it, for example – or about your research plan for the next five years. Not all graduates set their sights on working in academia. So what if business or industry is more your thing? Well, here’s how to get a job in the non-academic world. Since it’s likely that many of your academic activities and accomplishments won’t be of instant appeal to potential employers, it pays to know how to translate your skills to fit a more conventional job market. Holding a degree in political science might not catch anyone’s attention, for example, but companies may be interested in someone who can conduct research or write well, skills you may possess. You can use the following three categories to align your university work with business: The skills category – things like qualitative or quantitative data analysis, or public speaking. The knowledge category – this includes your area of expertise, which may or may not be relevant. If your specialty is postmodern Japanese gender issues, for instance, you could include cultural knowledge of Japan and language skills. If you’re applying to a relatively young company, gender issues are often part of their HR strategy, so including this could be an advantage. The achievement category – which contains any achievement, from organizing conferences to writing a book or running a lab. Remember, too, that your skill set is not determined by your PhD studies alone. You have probably done things prior to your doctorate, so look at your previous jobs, internships or volunteer activities and see how they might contribute to your skill set. Last, you should know your motivation and how it guides what kind of career you want to pursue. If you’re having trouble defining your motivation, think about what makes you angry. Anger can be a powerful motivator. What are you angry about? What do you want to change? You know the adage: it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. Well, this is especially true if academia is not the direction you want to head in. If you’re stepping into the business world, relationships are crucial. Not only will they give you personal support; one of them might land you the job you’re looking for. There is a substantial community of academics who decided to take on positions outside the academic world. As they’re sympathetic to your situation, they’ll usually be generous and can sometimes help you with an email address, a link or even just an idea. One way you can connect with people is through networking events, so be sure to keep your Facebook and LinkedIn profiles up to date and up to scratch. You can also improve your job prospects by developing your skill, and volunteering is a great way to start. Although you might not like the idea, gaining valuable experiences sometimes means working for free. For instance, you could opt for an unpaid internship, as these are often regarded positively in a non-academic CV. Additional training is another option. If you want to improve specific skills, keep an eye out for workshops that interest you at your local chamber of commerce. You should also bear in mind that, in the non-academic world, there are two prejudices that you might run up against, and you need to be able to deal with them effectively. First, employers might stereotype you. If you’re a scientist or a mathematician, they might assume that you’re antisocial. However, you can ease this concern by highlighting your collaborative projects and research. Second, employers might be concerned that you’re unable to hold conversations without using jargon or obscure vocabulary. Therefore, avoid fancy words and phrasing in your letter of application. Taking these guidelines into account will make your transition from academia into industry much smoother. The key message in this book: The academic job market is fiercely competitive. In order to succeed in it, you need to be well prepared: your application documents should be flawless and you have to excel in interviews. If you decide not to pursue an academic position, there is plenty of work out there. However, you must be able to translate your academic skills to the world of industry. Actionable advice: Balance is key when selecting your advisor. If you’re unsure whether someone is a good advisor, ask yourself if your advisor might be too nice. If this is the case, they might not be providing you with the frank, useful feedback you need to get ahead. At the same time, an overly negative advisor can erode your motivation. So it’s important to find someone who is neither unrealistically positive nor unpleasantly cynical. Your future might rely on it!

That’s almost 4,000 days, or just under a decade’s worth of around-the-clock toil. The kicker? Seven in ten workers report that they’re unhappy with their jobs. That’s a whole lot of folks spending a whole lot of time being miserable! But it doesn’t have to be that way. Ken Coleman knows a thing or two about that. Having spent years among the disgruntled majority, he decided to take matters into his own hands and pursue his true calling in the broadcasting business. It wasn’t always plain sailing, but the journey was worth it. Today, he’s one of the best-known radio presenters and podcasters in the United States.  So how did he do it? Call it the “proximity principle,” a tried and true playbook of strategies to get yourself around the right people and in the right places to launch a kick-ass career you love. And the best news of all is that this is something you can start doing right now, wherever you are.  In the following blinks, you’ll learn  why you don’t need to move to Los Angeles to work in the film industry; how to get the most out of your network of friends and acquaintances; and why asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness.  Do you love your job? If your work is challenging, interesting and aligned with your passions and talents, congratulations – you can stop reading right now! If it’s not, you’re not alone. According to a 2017 Gallup study, 70 percent of the global workforce is dissatisfied. Millions upon millions of folks get up every day dreading what’s ahead of them.  That’s not sustainable. Just ask the author. For a long time, he was part of that miserable 70 percent, toiling away in a dead-end job rather than pursuing his dream of becoming a broadcaster. Sitting on the porch looking at the woods behind his house one morning, he was struck by how far away he was from where he wanted to be in life.  It was in that moment that he had a revelation. He was the only person in the world who could make his dream a reality. After all, other people weren’t sitting on their back porches worrying about how they could help him start a new career. Only he could take the first step on his journey. But how?  That’s where the proximity principle comes in. Here’s how it works: If you want to do what you love, you have to be around people who are doing it and in places where it’s happening. Ken looked through his list of contacts and hit up an old buddy who worked for a leadership training company in Georgia called Catalyst.  The firm was just getting into podcasting, and when Ken offered to help develop a concept in return for a chance to gain some hands-on experience in their recording studios, they agreed. Ken’s first “sound booth” was little more than a repurposed broom cupboard, but that didn’t matter a bit – even if it lacked AC to keep the sweltering Georgia summer at bay, it was a start!  Over the next few years, Ken established a reputation for himself in broadcasting. It wasn’t always glamorous, and there were plenty of moments when he felt like calling it quits, but in the end it paid off. Today, Ken hosts The Ken Coleman Show, one of America’s most listened-to self-improvement podcasts.  That’s all down to the proximity principle. So how can you start using it to achieve your goals? Well, that’s just what we’ll be exploring in these blinks!  Pursuing your dream job is like climbing a mountain – you need to be brave. After all, nothing looks quite as daunting as that towering peak when you’re standing at the base looking up. Lots of people, however, never even take the first step.  Why? Put it down to limiting beliefs. These come in two forms – pride, and fear of failure.  Let’s start with pride. That’s essentially the idea that we’re self-sufficient and don’t need anyone’s help. It’s a psychological reflex rooted in the fear of appearing weak. We worry that asking for assistance makes us look incompetent and that others will think less of us than if we’d gone it alone. Take Steve Jobs. He built a multibillion-dollar company and created products that literally changed the world. Look up “ambitious” in the dictionary, and you may well find a picture of Jobs. But he also knew how to ask for help.  In a 1994 interview, Jobs remarked that he’d never known people to simply put the phone down or say “no” when he called. He remembered that when he’d asked Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, for spare parts for a school project, Bill had said yes. Jobs always tried to do the same when people called him. But that, he added, only works if you pick up the phone and make the call!  Fear of failure is the second limiting belief. It’s an instinct, and it can be useful if it reminds us of real risks. The problem is that it often becomes irrational. At that point, we stop focusing on mastering the challenges ahead of us and start ruminating on hypothetical “what-if” questions like, “What if someone gives me a break but I mess up?” That’s a recipe for inaction.  The way to beat that trap is to reframe the way you’re thinking about failure. Just think of great inventors and scientists like Thomas Edison, Marie Curie and Albert Einstein. They didn’t succeed despite failure – they succeeded because of failure. The fruit of their botched experiments? The lightbulb, three Nobel prizes and the theory of general relativity! Then there’s American hockey icon and Hall-of-Famer Wayne Gretzky. If you find yourself worrying about failure, just remember his famous advice: “You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.” The proximity principle has two elements – people and places. Put them together and you get an equation: right people + right places = opportunities. That last word is key. What you’re looking for isn’t a handout but a chance.  Why’s that so important? Well, the people who’ll help you realize your dream are out there right now – but they’re working for themselves, not you. In fact, they’re not even thinking about you – they’re busy living their own lives and focusing on their own jobs. That means you need to get their attention. And how you do that determines the likelihood of success.  That’s something the author’s friend Joy, a publisher, knows all about. Whenever she opens her inbox, there’s someone who wants something from her. That’s exhausting – it’s all take and no give. As a result, she can spot opportunists who want nothing but a free lunch a mile off. When they come knocking, her door stays shut.  But when someone approaches who is genuinely passionate about the industry and wants to learn something, it stops her in her tracks. In those cases, she’s always willing to take some time out of her day and see what she can do.  She’s not the only industry insider who ticks that way. In whatever industry you’re approaching people, remember that enthusiasm is infectious – it makes you the kind of person whom others want to help.  Pure passion, however, isn’t always going to cut it. So what else can you offer? Well, how about giving something back? Take it from Patrick. He hated his accounting job and longed to open a brewery and raise money to build wells in impoverished villages in Africa. There was just one hitch: he didn’t know how to brew beer in industrial quantities.  Patrick didn’t let that stop him, however. He approached a local brewery with an offer: if they taught him the tricks of the trade, he’d work for them for free. He spent over a year working a five-day week without earning a dime, and often even came in on weekends.  Was it worth it? Ask Patrick, now the owner of a successful brewery, who’ll never need to do anyone’s accounts again but his own! The great American poet T.S. Eliot once said that “talent imitates; genius steals.” What he was getting at is that the most gifted people in any field rarely develop in isolation; their craft is a grab-bag of skills and techniques they’ve copied, borrowed and filched from established masters.  So here’s a question for you to think on: Who are the best people to imitate in your industry? Whoever they are, it’s likely they fall into a single category – professionals.  Let’s start with a definition. Professionals have two defining features. First off, they have bags of experience. As a rule, that means they have worked in their fields for at least ten years. If getting to the peak of your dream career is like scaling a mountain, then pros are the guys who’ve already navigated to the summit and know every path, ravine and slope like the backs of their hands.  The second trait you’ll find in every professional is that they learn from each other. Take the actor and Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio. If you watch his performances carefully, you’ll notice that he often copies the mannerisms and timing of another, older actor – Paul Newman, the legendary leading man from classic movies like The Color of Money.  That covers whom to learn from – now it’s time to talk about the how. That’s a two-stage process, and it starts with picking up the tricks of the trade – the skills, hacks and techniques top professionals use to stay at the top of their game.  That’s just what American basketball great Kobe Bryant did. Growing up in a sports-obsessed household, he watched endless videos of contemporary players and older stars as he was starting out. They influenced his own way of playing. His style was a mishmash of techniques learned from others; he used Oscar Robertson’s hesitation moves, Elgin Baylor’s footwork and Jerry West’s quick-shooting release.  That brings us to the second step – developing your own method. Bryant used other players’ signature moves, but his style was greater than the sum of its parts – after all, no one else had ever combined them in the same way as Bryant. And that’s the key: when you’re learning from multiple pros, you’re much more likely to create your own unique approach! Ask any experienced climber and they’ll tell you that scaling a mountain can’t be rushed. Before you even set foot on Mount Everest, you need to set up a camp in the foothills and acclimate. Skipping that step is guaranteed to cause altitude sickness, meaning that when you begin the ascent, you’ll feel dizzy and struggle to keep your focus.  That’s also true when it comes to getting your dream job. Just ask the author. When he started broadcasting, he often longed for a shortcut. No wonder; no one actually wants to intern on a cold Friday night, reporting on a high school game to an audience of 26! Looking back, however, Coleman could see that those evenings prepared him for what lay ahead. If you can’t handle a bit of discomfort early on, you’ll never be ready for bigger challenges further down the line.  Growth, in other words, can’t be forced. Go back far enough and you’ll find that today’s top professionals all have similar experiences behind them. Take Katie Couric. In 2006, she became the first woman ever to present the CBS evening news show solo. That was the product of thirty years of hard graft, beginning with a lowly desk assistant position at ABC. But what about folks who didn’t get started in the industry they now want to work in a good three decades ago – surely it’s much harder for them, right? Well, not quite – in fact, you can start from where you are.  Let’s unpack that. A lot of people put off pursuing their dream jobs because it seems downright unrealistic. Brad, a caller who appeared on Ken’s podcast, was one of them. He wanted to work in film, but there was a problem – to get a start in that business, he’d have to move to LA. That would mean selling his house in North Carolina and uprooting his wife and their kids. He just couldn’t do it.  Ken asked Brad a simple question: How many production studios did he think there were in Charlotte, North Carolina? Brad paused before admitting he didn’t know – he’d never thought to find out. A little research answered the question: there were over 100! And that’s where Brad started his job search. Eight weeks later, he landed a job as a production assistant at a studio just a few blocks from his house.  Call it the law of the zip code. Everything you need to get started is within your reach – you just need to look for it. Landing any job, let alone your dream gig, can be a tricky and time-consuming business. Chances are you’ve experienced what it’s like to send out hundreds of carefully prepared résumés and fail to get a single bite. If you know the right person, however, it’s as easy as pie. When it comes to the job market, connections matter.  So who is the “right” person? Well, it’s not whom you know that counts, but whom they know. That’s the conclusion of a 1973 article by Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter. According to Granovetter, most of the job opportunities that come our way aren’t from family members and close friends – our so-called inner social circle – but from people we don’t personally know in our outer social circle.  That’s hardly surprising when you compare the relative size of these two groups – after all, there are simply far more people in the latter group. But here’s what is surprising: connecting with folks in that second category boosts your chances of getting a job by a whopping 58 percent!  It’s a massive resource, but how can you start tapping into it? The answer is relatively simple. Let’s break it down into three stages.  First, you’ll want to tell friends and family members about your dream job. These are the people who know you best and care most about your happiness and success. If they know someone who might be able to help you, they’re sure to reach out and organize a chat.  Next, you’ll need to make a list of your acquaintances. The easiest way to do that is to create “buckets” into which you can place potential leads. These can be organized into categories like coworkers, schoolmates or people you’ve met at social events. Think back: Could a former colleague hold the key to your search? How about someone at your tennis club? Or does your neighbor maybe work in an adjacent industry?  The last step is the most intimidating – actively making connections. But remember what we said about Steve Jobs – if you don’t pick up the phone, the person on the other end of the line won’t ever have a chance to say “yes.” You can also make things easier on yourself by keeping things low-key. You don’t have to organize a formal meeting – if you think you’ve found someone who can help, invite her for a coffee or a light lunch.  That brings us to the end of our journey – and to the start of yours. Changing your career path and fulfilling your true ambitions are daunting prospects, but it can be done. Start applying the proximity principle today, and there’s no telling where you’ll be tomorrow! The key message in these blinks: Landing your dream job doesn’t mean you have to move halfway across the world – in fact, everything you need to transform your career prospects is right in front of you. The key? Putting yourself around the right people and in the right places. Call it the proximity principle. And that’s something you can start doing right now by making the most out of your social connections, learning from the pros and connecting with your industry’s movers and shakers. Actionable advice: Apply for positions that offer a clear path forward  Reaching the peak of your dream career is a journey that takes time and a lot of personal development work. That means it’s a good idea to plan ahead and focus on positions that can accommodate that future growth. Take the author’s friend Sean. His dream was to be an English scholar. He knew he couldn’t walk straight into a full-time professorship, however, so he looked for universities with professors who were nearing retirement age and that also had growing enrollments, indicating good future prospects.

Wattles","summary":"How do people get what they want? How do they even know what they want? Do you? Even though the specifics may differ – some of us desire to learn a skill, others to start a family and yet others to simply grow and harvest a garden – we still all share an underlying desire for growth and abundance. Most of the time, our desires and wants seem constrained by resources – time, money, opportunities. But what if someone told you that you could create these things for yourself and that there is an inexhaustible amount of them waiting for you if only you’d learn how to think in the right way? According to the author, Wallace D. Wattles, you can. Along the way, you’ll also learn why competition isn’t a viable way to happiness; why cultivating an attitude of gratitude is important; and how all the resources for a happy and fulfilling life are well within your reach. Just about everyone wants to be rich. People who don’t have money want to acquire it and people who do have it worry about losing it. There are those who might try to put this desire for wealth in a bad light, but, actually, it’s only natural. The three core components of your life are your mind, body and soul, and to live a successful, happy life, you need to nurture them equally, which requires certain material goods. For instance, you can’t fully celebrate your body if you can’t afford good food, comfortable clothing and a safe, cozy place to sleep. Similarly, you can’t enjoy your mind without books, education and other intellectual stimulation. And, finally, you can’t celebrate your soul without love and the means to show love to others. This last one may seem odd, but here’s the fact of the matter: love is most often demonstrated by a desire to give material gifts. In other words, someone with nothing to give can’t enjoy love or relationships to their fullest potential. So how can you get rich enough to nurture these three aspects of your life? Well, first of all, you should know that, contrary to what many think, people don’t become rich just because they were born to rich parents or with great talents, but because they behave in a certain way that is conducive to accumulating wealth. Another common misconception is that not everyone can be rich because there’s only finite amount of riches in the world. According to the author, everything in the world is composed of the so-called Original Substance. The different elements we see in nature are just different manifestations of it. Luckily for us, the Substance is always regenerating, meaning that our natural resources will never run out. So with this abundance in mind, it’s only natural for humans to want to acquire and experience more things. This also means that nobody is poor because of any inherent dearth of resources, but rather because they don’t understand their power and the inexhaustible riches within their reach. Simply put, you and every other person has the right to be rich because you’re a part of nature, which abounds with riches. What do you think the first step to getting rich is? Is it buying stocks? Starting a company? Actually, the initial step begins with something much more fundamental: your thoughts. Thoughts are everywhere, and according to the author, by impressing your thoughts upon the Original Substance, you can cause the object of your thought to be created. That’s how everything on Earth was created; everything you can perceive in nature, including the sky and the universe, is the product of a thought in the Original Substance. That’s why, by imagining something using the power of thought, you can bring about its creation. As you do so, remember that God wants you to become rich so that you can better help others. You’re a creator, not a competitor, which means your goal is to get whatever you want in a way that helps and elevates everybody else as well. For instance, God wants musicians to have the best instruments so that they can create music that will also inspire others to strive for greatness. This all being said, it’s not enough to just believe in Original Substance and hope that it will give you all you need. You also need to live by the Law of Gratitude. This is a natural principle that states that the more grateful you are for the Substance, the more you’ll attract good things. So if you’re a talented musician but can’t afford to buy a new guitar, rather than complaining about it, be grateful for the guitar you already have. Know that, in time, the Original Substance will provide you with greater opportunities and better tools. Now that you know that you can attain your desires through the power of thoughts, it’s time to learn how to think the right way. To get started, use your imagination to imbue the Substance with a clear and specific picture of what you want and a strong purpose to obtain it. For example, say you want a house. Picture it in all its detail. How big is it? What are the rooms like? From there, keep this clear picture in your mind, like a sailor who harbors a thought of the port where he intends to anchor. In addition to the image and purpose, you must also have a powerful faith that you can attain whatever you want, that it is there for you and that you need only reach out and grab it.   Once you’ve learned how to think correctly, then you can use your will to maintain this thinking and move forward on your path to riches. But remember: on this journey, the only appropriate way to use your will is upon yourself, not on anybody else. After all, you can’t know what is good for anyone but yourself. Never force someone to work for you, and never take things from others through manipulation. The former is a form of enslavement; the latter, of theft. If you want that big house, your only route is to imagine living in it until it becomes yours. Ignore those who tell you that you’re too poor to afford it and keep the clear image of success in your mind. Alright, so the power of thought is an incredibly powerful tool for creating your own reality. But action is still required to get things moving. While your thoughts can attract the things you want, only your actions will make them truly yours. And because you can’t act in the past or in the future, the present is the only moment you’ve got, so you’d better act now. That means, regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, you’ve got to act to prepare yourself for the future you want. If you merely invest energy in visualizing your ideal future and do nothing to work toward it, success will never actually materialize. It’s common for people to stall here because they believe their environment isn’t right for the action they want to undertake. If you find yourself facing this problem, there’s a simple solution: just change your environment or improve it through your own actions. In other words, use your present environment as a tool to arrive at a more hospitable one.   It’s also important to do as much as you can during each and every day, so you make quick progress, but without overworking yourself. Doing your utmost doesn’t mean completing a ridiculous number of tasks every day, but instead applying all of your faith and purpose to making progress toward your personal goals. Many people make the mistake of spending their mental energy in one place and their physical energy in another. But if you concentrate your whole being, mental and physical, on whatever act you engage in, then every action will be successful. Having such successes will then attract further success and, pretty soon, you’ll get into a rhythm. So if you already know that you want to earn more money, don’t procrastinate. Start working toward your goals today and believe that you will eventually succeed. Have you ever been really good at something that you also really like doing? If yes, you know what an incredible feeling it is, and you’d probably agree that every person should strive for such an experience. Finding the sweet spot where talent and enjoyment intersect will help you perform better, thereby helping you succeed. And what could be better than getting rich while doing what you love? To get started, develop your skills. For instance, if you have a desire to paint, you must first develop the ability and artistry necessary to succeed. But whichever field you choose, you must have faith in it to attain increase, meaning the kind of advancement that everybody strives for. This desire of increase pervades the universe; every little thing seeks advancement and development. And by having faith in what you do, you’ll give the impression of increase, which, in turn, will attract more genuine increase. Therefore, even if your job is something seemingly unimportant, like merely selling candy to children, you should have unwavering faith in its importance in creating increase, not just for you, but for everyone around you too. When you show this kind of faith, it will make people believe that by connecting with you, they too will achieve increase for themselves. This is why doctors and teachers, who are often filled with faith in the importance of their work, will never be without work, and this attracts more increase. Just follow the desire to do what you most love doing and know that you are advancing personally. If you can manage that, there is no end to the success you can enjoy. The key message in this book: The universe wants nothing more than for you to live an abundant and prosperous life, so you should embrace your natural desire to be rich. Material wealth will allow you to nurture your mind, body and soul, while also inspiring and compelling others to do the same.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Moreover, most of us probably have a set of personal goals as well as a list of professional goals. But what we often don’t have are the tools and understanding to create a realistic and actionable plan that will get us from where we are today to our desired destination. This is where the science of Intelligent Achievement comes in. Author Isaiah Hankel presents three tools, Selective Focus, Creative Ownership and Pragmatic Growth, that are designed to get you from point A to point Z with focused determination. The practices related to these three tools will help you block out distractions, use your energy to its fullest and increase your creative productivity. At the end of these blinks, you’ll be on your way to tossing out your to-do lists and charting a practical route to making your dreams come true. In these blinks you’ll find out how many hours of productive energy you really have each day; the wrong way to say no; and how Walt Disney can help you with your productivity.\n If you spend your days interacting with a computer, there’s a good chance you’ve encountered those times when you just feel stuck, staring at your computer screen. The more you try to get unstuck, the less you feel able to make any decisions. This is due to the fact that, when your mind is exhausted, no amount of time or effort spent on contemplation can help. The key to avoiding this kind of exhaustion is to have mental energy, as this is what allows you to be enthusiastic and enjoy what’s going on in your professional and personal lives. But while it may be important, mental energy is also scarce and easily depleted. According to a 2007 study in the Harvard Business Review, the average person enjoys only two hours of peak mental focus every day, along with an additional five hours of relatively high mental focus. At all other times, there’s a good chance your mental focus will be relatively poor. So, how do we make sure our mental energy gets replenished each day? A 2012 study by medical researcher Taeko Sasai suggests that sufficient sleep is what’s needed for this to happen. But even then, with high mental energy and especially peak mental energy being such limited resources, it’s clear we need to treat each minute with care. And that’s where Selective Focus comes in. Selective Focus is about being careful and choosy about how you spend your energy, and the first rule is learning how to say no to certain things that are competing for your attention. After all, you can’t give your time and energy to everyone, no matter how politely they ask. Saying no doesn’t always come easily or naturally. Many of us were programmed as children to say yes to whatever our parents or our teachers asked of us. When you said yes growing up, you were probably rewarded with attention, praise or even a big, welcoming hug. But now that you’re an adult, there are rewards to saying no. Through analyzing over 80 studies that looked into the benefits of saying no, psychologist Martin Hagger found conclusive evidence that it not only helps people avoid wasteful and unproductive activity, it also helps them achieve their goals more efficiently. In the next blink, we’ll look at some more rules for applying Selective Focus. If you’re interested in mastering a new skill, you may have heard that it takes around 10,000 hours of practice. This may be true, but you can’t just pile on one consecutive hour of practice after another and expect to reap the rewards. Those hours need to be filled with Deliberate Practice, which is the second rule of Selective Focus. In 1993, psychologist K. Anders Ericsson used deliberate practice to illustrate the difference between average achievement and exceptional achievement. He found that it was the hours people spent on deliberate, high-quality practice that made the difference. More precisely, Ericsson found that while average achievers worked more hours overall, they would also engage in a lot of non-constructive practice over an entire day. Exceptional achievers, on the other hand, would only engage in deliberate practice, which might consist of one burst of concentrated energy in the morning and another one in the afternoon. This would add up to just three and a half hours of practice a day, but it was more effective than an entire day’s worth of meandering practice. One of the things that keeps us away from deliberate practice and continually engaged in non-constructive or unfocused activities is that we tend to find certain distractions pleasurable. Activities like checking email or tidying up your desk can trigger a dopamine release that makes these usually unproductive tasks seem more rewarding than the ones that are aligned with your long-term goals. While such activities may make you feel like you’re “keeping busy,” they can be highly counterproductive if you’re supposed to be preparing your business plan for that upcoming loan meeting. In fact, rather than keeping busy, it would be better to stop what you’re doing. That way you can think clearly and plan the next steps that will help you reach your goal. Be warned, though, that if you don’t “look busy,” someone may see this as an opportunity to dump work on you. This is why it’s important to protect your free time as well as your Deliberate Practice time. If you’re ever unsure about when to say yes or no to a task, ask yourself: Is this going to bring me closer to the goals I’ve set for myself? If not, then it’s probably best to say no. As the author knows from personal experience, getting a cancer diagnosis can send you searching for answers. He reached out to friends, doctors and therapists, asking everyone for their opinions on how best to fight the disease. While it’s natural to seek advice when things get tough, it’s also important to be selective in this regard as well, because the attitudes and opinions of others can be infectious and sometimes harmful. According to a 2010 study from the Proceedings of the Royal Society, being around someone with a positive attitude can improve your own outlook by 11 percent. However, being around someone with a negative attitude can make your own outlook more negative by a whopping 50 percent. If you don’t want that to happen, you have to be highly selective about the opinions to which you expose yourself, which is why this is the third rule of Selective Focus. This can make a big difference in your achievements, because if the people around you call your dreams unrealistic, or think you’ll never have the skills to achieve your goals, you’ll probably start thinking that there’s no point in even trying. So it’s best to keep such pessimists at a distance while surrounding yourself with an ambitious and upbeat crew. If that’s not reason enough to do so, consider the fact that negative influences can even be harmful to your brain. According to Stanford University biology professor Robert Sapolsky, studies have shown that after listening to 30 minutes of negative speech, the neuron cells located in the hippocampus begin dying. And this is the part of the brain related to problem-solving, so those are definitely neurons worth keeping! A study from 2013, published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, found similar results. After researchers asked people either to ignore or to listen to someone’s four-minute-long negative rant, they found that the “ignoring” participants were better than the listeners at subsequently solving thought and concentration exercises. In the next blink, we’ll move on to the second tool of intelligent achievement. The second tool of intelligent achievement is Creative Ownership, which is about freeing yourself up so that you’re working toward your own goals and no one else’s. One of the primary ways of achieving Creative Ownership is to produce and market your own content. Now, you may be thinking that that sounds great, but that whenever you try to write, the results aren’t so hot. If you have writer’s block, there’s a good chance it’s due to trying to write about something of which you have no experience. That’s why one of the best pieces of writing advice is to write about what you know. Try starting by simply writing about what happened to you yesterday. Then go a little deeper by detailing one or two childhood experiences that have stuck with you. When you start to get the hang of writing from your own experience, you can graduate to hearing stories from other people and trying to write those down, and over time you’ll be able to write comfortably about yourself and others. To help expand your creative side and really get production moving along, you can make use of the Disney method. Named, of course, after the animation pioneer Walt Disney, the Disney system was outlined in a 2015 study by University of Munich media studies professor Sarah Tausch, and it is aimed at helping both individuals and groups to boost their production. An important first step is to turn off the nagging inner editorial voice that says your ideas stink or that last sentence was terrible. You’re going to start off with a first draft, so feel free to write whatever comes to mind, regardless of how little sense it makes. When you move to the second draft, turn your inner editor back on, but only at partial strength. This draft should take the good sections from the first draft, the bits that do make sense, and expand on them in paragraphs that come together in a coherent way. Then there’s the third and final draft, in which you crank the inner editor to full power by streamlining your story, cutting repetitive bits and any parts that ruin the flow. After this draft you should have an engaging and well-formed text. So, first is overcoming writer's block by silencing your editor and letting the words flow freely and easily. Then you hone in and expand on the good ideas before finalizing and finessing your final draft. Eventually, you’ll regularly be able to produce creative content that is interesting and high-quality. In the quest for independent Creative Ownership, one of the most valuable assets to have is a loyal customer base. The question is, how do you gain customers when you’re just starting out? One great tool for getting customers’ attention is lead magnets. A lead is essentially customer information, so a lead magnet is something that attracts customers and compels them to give you their details. If you’re a writer, a good lead magnet might be a site where you post your first book chapter for free and potential customers can provide their email to be the first to know when the rest of the book is published. Let’s say you’re running your own lifestyle improvement business. A good lead magnet may be a blog that regularly provides general tips that show you’re an expert in your field and that you provide quality service. You can also use customer information collected through your blog to send people newsletters and updates when a new post is published. Lead magnets generally offer something of value for free, so in this department you should expect to operate at a loss, but keep in mind that leads may boost revenue in the long run, and can even add up to their own product. For example, all those tips on your blog can eventually be turned into a book. The eventual goal of writing a book can serve as good motivation to update your blog regularly. This is also important because your site’s ranking on Google depends on how often you add written content; the more content, the higher you’ll be ranked in search results. Google can also help you to figure out what customers like most about your business, which in turn can help you to pick the most effective lead magnets for new customers. Google Analytics and other website tools can show you which blog posts or web pages on your site are getting the most views. If you’re putting that book together, this can help you decide which articles to include. It’s also great to know which lifestyle tips people are most interested in, since you can then plan future articles that expand and follow-up on these topics. If you find that all of your popular articles are about one topic, this is a clear sign that you may have found a good niche. For example, if your audience is overwhelmingly interested in tips on how to become a successful businesswoman, then you can focus on such articles and end up with a book called Lifestyle Tips Every Businesswoman Needs to Know. A pragmatic outlook can be useful in many situations. After the author was given his cancer diagnosis, life quickly became stressful, and that’s when he realized that the way forward was to be pragmatic, and focus on small, doable actions that would improve his condition. A pragmatic outlook is not only good for your health, it can do wonders for your success as well, which is why the third tool of intelligent achievement is Pragmatic Growth. Pragmatic Growth is essentially about increasing your ability to be pragmatic. The hallmarks of being pragmatic are being proactive and relying on realistic plans – especially in emotionally charged situations. It’s also a great way to overcome self-doubt and thoughts like, “I’ll never be able to finish this.” In these moments, pragmatism can help you focus on small, doable tasks and get you back on track to reaching your goals. Studies also show that pragmatism is a good defense against stress. In research published in 2008, psychologist Francis Flynn found pragmatists in general to be happier and more emotionally stable than other people. During times of stress, their happiness levels didn’t decline steeply, as was noted in participants who lacked pragmatism. Other studies have also shown how a pragmatic approach can keep the tides of negativity at bay. According to psychologist Rick Hanson, everyone has a negativity bias, or a tendency to focus more on unpleasant things than pleasant ones. His study showed that our brains will immediately store negative information in our memories, whereas positive information requires at least 12 seconds of focused attention for it to be stored. This is why we tend to remember the person who didn’t hold the elevator door open for us, but quickly forget the kindness of the person who did. But once you know about the negativity bias, you can take pragmatic steps to correct it and keep it from interfering with your goals. A 2008 study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin shows that your negativity bias is likely to sabotage your success if you don’t take steps against it. You can set regular small tasks to help with this very purpose, like making sure not to dwell on bad moments, and not only recognizing good ones, but taking at least 12 seconds to appreciate them. How do you feel about to-do lists? Are they a useful tool for staying on top of things? Or are they a daily reminder of all the things you wanted to do but never got around to? Well, if you’re not a big fan of to-do lists, you may be happy to hear that part of Pragmatic Growth is about accepting that to-do lists are often a waste of time. The truth is, making lists rarely leads to the kind of direct action that moves you closer to your goals. In a 2012 study, biologist Mones Abu-Asab found that a big problem with most to-do lists is that they’re made up of unrelated and dissimilar tasks. Some might take a few minutes, while others might take weeks to complete. And since people like the satisfaction of ticking off a completed task, they’ll focus on small tasks, while bigger ones, like preparing your business plan, linger and die on the vine. Staying away from distracting to-do lists filled with small tasks once again comes down to saying no and staying focused on the work that will clearly get you closer to your goal. You can even set your default response to incoming requests to no. Or use the rule of three and only accept incoming requests if the person asks three times, since it probably means you’re the only one who can help. You’ll also find it helpful to say no in the right way. According to a 2012 study by Vanessa Patrick, making excuses while saying no won’t help you in the long run; stating clearly that you don’t want to take on a new task is empowering and shows that you have more important work to do. In the final blink, we’ll look at some common pitfalls to Pragmatic Growth that you can make yourself aware of and avoid. In his role at the helm of countless productivity workshops, the author has worked with thousands of people who’ve helped him identify eight pitfalls to pragmatic productivity. You can think of the tips to avoiding these pitfalls as the ultimate tool kit for keeping you on the road to Intelligent Achievement. The first pitfall is accepting gifts. As the saying goes, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, because chances are the person picking up the tab is looking for a favor. This doesn’t mean you need to be cynical and think everyone is selfish, but if you do get invited to lunch, it doesn’t hurt to question the motives and wonder whether it isn’t, say, just a ploy to get you to work overtime. In short: pay for your own lunch. The second pitfall is not having a morning routine. Having a regular morning routine is great for reducing the amount of mental energy you use, since you don’t have to make any decisions – everything can just go like clockwork. This means you’ll have more mental energy to spend on more important tasks later in the day. Third is the mistake of prioritizing busywork. Always focus on the big goals and taking the steps that get you there. Similarly, the fourth pitfall is prioritizing easy tasks over difficult ones. Don’t do it! Pitfall number five is to be overly reliant on the eight-hour workday. Remember, you only have five hours of high-level mental energy available. So it’s all about being efficient and focused during these hours while spending the rest of the time resting and recuperating. The sixth and seventh pitfalls are the ever-present distractions of smartphones and incoming email. Constantly checking social media, texts and email wastes mental energy. Avoid these pitfalls at all costs. The final pitfall is giving in to requests from others. Again, this is about becoming comfortable with saying that magical two-letter word: No. So there you have it: the three tools for Intelligent Achievement are Selective Focus, Creative Ownership and Pragmatic Growth. Now it’s time to apply these tools to your life and accelerate your career with smart, Deliberate Practice. The key message in these blinks: Intelligent Achievement is about attaining your goals with the use of smart, focused practices, and the tools for doing so are within anyone’s reach. Once you focus your attention on what’s truly important in reaching those goals, you can begin to filter out distractions, including people with distracting requests and negative attitudes. You can then become more independent, creative and productive with tools like the Disney method, and use lead magnets to help you gain customers. The final tool is to be more pragmatic by being aware of your negativity bias, and taking small, realistic steps that will add up to major life goals. Actionable advice: Hone your creative voice by listening to others. Finding a voice that connects with your audience is about combining your interests with things that resonate with the public. You can start doing this today by talking to your friends about a topic that interests you and seeing how they react. Maybe a different but closely related topic is more interesting to them? Take in this information, and try to write a new article that incorporates your views as well as those of your friends and target audience. Got feedback?

We all want it, even though definitions of success differ from person to person. Regardless of what kind of success you want to achieve, however, there are certain things you should focus on. We’re not talking about getting perfect grades or nailing every job interview. Success depends on factors much deeper and more spiritual than that, and they can all be summed up in seven spiritual laws. These seven laws have to do with how you connect with your true self and how you interact with others. They are about the flow of energy in the world, about being in the here and now without struggling against change. So let us take a journey and explore how the seven spiritual laws of success will help you reach your goals. In these blinks, you’ll find out why saving money is ruining your flow with the universe; how letting go of your desires will help you get what you want; and that complaining about where you are makes it harder to get where you want to be. Have you ever been alone in nature and experienced a moment of profound silence? If so, you may have felt a sense of peacefulness and connectedness with the universe. It is in these peaceful moments that you can find your true Self and unlock the potential to fulfill your life’s desires. When you feel connected to your environment and the people within it, you realize you are not a separate entity that is cut off from the rest of the world. You can sense that the world is a connected field of energy that unites everyone and everything on the planet. But not just the planet. Indeed, this field of energy is a boundless source of power for the whole universe. Once you feel this connectedness and realize that you are not merely a solitary human being, but an integral part of the complex weave of nature, you may discover that your true Self knows no limitations. By tapping into the energy within your true Self, you can achieve anything you wish, be it wealth and success or spiritual development. But, in order to connect to your true Self, you must first dissolve the ego. As long as you identify with your ego, you will continue to think of yourself as separate from the rest of the universe – a mere brain inside a physical body, confined and limited. And due to this restricted point of view, you will continue to be fearful, obsessed with survival and focused on external things such as social status and how other people see you. When your ego is in charge, you lose your connection with your true Self and, with it, that endless field of potential energy. Fortunately, you can always reconnect with your true Self by practicing silent meditation. To do this, calmly focus your attention on your breathing and observe your thoughts without judgment. Gradually, you will become peaceful, and when your mind and body become still, your ego dissolves, allowing you to reconnect with your true Self. People spend a lot of time and energy worrying about the circumstances they find themselves in. For instance, a man might fret about being partnerless. But then, when he enters a relationship, new worries arise. Is this relationship limiting his freedom? Is he truly in love? Thankfully, there is a solution to the problem of chronic fretting. You can simply accept your current situation. For example, imagine living with a difficult roommate; she never cleans up after herself yet gets angry with you when the place is a mess. This is a tricky situation, one that might make you consider moving out. But moving takes time and money, so what’s the best way to resolve the issue? The answer: Don’t fight the problem. Instead, face it and accept it for what it is. There is always a lesson to be learned from difficult situations, and the people who make life difficult are usually there to teach you something. In this case, the lesson might be about standing up for yourself or learning how to be less affected by the actions of others. Only by accepting the situation can you begin to learn from it and grow. You can take this acceptance a step further and save energy by practicing defencelessness. Practicing defencelessness essentially means getting rid of the need and desire to convince others that your opinion is right or that theirs is wrong. For example, you’ve probably witnessed diet-related confrontations between vegetarians and omnivores. Before long the conversation can escalate into a full-blown argument about the ethicality of poultry farming. Not only is this a waste of energy; it will inevitably end with both parties more entrenched in their own positions than before. Defencelessness, in contrast, erases the need to convince others of your viewpoint. It allows for a true exchange of ideas about a topic, without anger or dogmatism getting in the way. In the above example, defencelessness would mean both parties could openly share their thoughts on their dietary choices without feeling that the other is judging them, and hence without becoming defensive and hostile. Let’s say you’ve always dreamed of owning a Ferrari. You imagine that, once you’ve saved up and bought your dream car, your life will be happy and fulfilling. Chances are, however, that such ardent attachment to the car will only lead to your feeling terribly distressed. Attachment to material things implies distrust of the universe – and this inevitably leads to anxiety. After all, a life spent amassing wealth and material goods as a means to security will end in a disheartening realization: material possessions can never truly provide safety or security. For example, no matter how much money you save, all can be lost in an economic downturn. Just think of those who lost their homes and savings as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. Real security can be achieved in only one way – by recognizing your true Self. By realizing your true nature, you’ll find that even fear of death disappears. The body and mind dissolve, and your true Self will remain in the field of energy that gives birth to all new life in the universe. While it might sound counterintuitive, you’ll also find that your desires can only become reality when you detach yourself from them. For example, single people are often obsessively attached to finding a mate, keeping an eye out for hours on end every day, whether online, at parties or in their circle of friends and colleagues. Ironically enough, it’s usually only when these people, exhausted and discouraged, let go of their ego and give up, that the universe gets a chance to step in. Then, as if by magic, the right people finally cross paths. This is what happens when you detach yourself from your desires and connect to the field of energy that is the true nature of the universe, which alone has the power to make our desires become reality. If you have a large savings account then you may have received praiseworthy pats on the back from fellow materialists. But rather than saving up, a better path to success is to let your money flow into the world. Hoarding money interrupts the universe’s natural flow of give and take. In fact, the Latin root of the word “currency” literally means “to circulate or flow.” This shows that even ancient Greek and Roman civilizations understood that money must flow for a society and its people to flourish. This is why investments are often more profitable than savings. For example, say you spend your life earning minimum wage, putting the majority of your monthly paycheck in the bank. Even though the balance on your account will increase, you won’t become rich. But if you invest your money in continuing education and take the right classes, you could eventually become the CEO of your own business. By wisely investing in your education, far more will flow back to you, leaving you with more money than a lifetime of petty saving ever could. This spiritual law of giving and receiving doesn’t only apply to money, either. It applies to love, friendship, support and all the things we exchange socially. If you use this social currency to give others what you hope to receive, you’ll be amply rewarded. The more love people give within a society, the more that love will be shared with others and will continue to grow. But, naturally, this only works if everyone is prepared to give as well as receive. For example, most people desire a partner who will love them and take care of them. But many forget that a relationship is also about giving love and caring for someone else. If everyone were focused solely on getting love, and not giving it, we would all end up lonely and unhappy. We all know the advertising slogan, “Just do it!” Live in the moment, it tells us – seize the opportunity! But to truly get the most out of life (rather than just doing something), it is important to consider what the most beneficial choice is when making a decision. This is what it means to be conscious of your choice making. After all, we make choices all the time, sometimes without even knowing we’re doing it. In fact, most of our choices are unconscious. For example, when you’re shopping, you might buy bags full of junk food without considering the impact they have on your health or the environment. Unfortunately, such unconscious behavior comes naturally to us, since our survival instinct tells us to stock up on large quantities of cheap food. So, in order to make good choices, pause and consider the impact your actions have, both on you and on others. How might you avoid habitually purchasing junk food? Well, first off, consider your budget, and then within its constraints choose products that are the most beneficial to your health and that, during the production process, have done the least harm to other people, animals and the environment. To continue making good choices in your everyday life, simply choose the actions that will bring the most joy and goodwill to others. In some cases, the choice might seem obvious. For example, if you’re invited to a birthday party but decide that it is too much of an inconvenience to attend, you should realize that you’re only considering your own needs. So, instead, recognize the pleasure that the host will enjoy by being surrounded by friends on the special day. In other cases, the choice might be more subtle. If someone insults you, you have two options: You can be hurt by the remark and retaliate, or you can refuse to let it affect you. By choosing the second option, you both avoid subjecting yourself to unpleasant emotions and treat the offender as you would want to be treated. Did the previous blink about accepting your current situation make you anxious? Perhaps because you’re unhappy and don’t want to accept how things are? Well, don’t worry. The good news is that your thoughts have the power to change the world around you. You can improve your quality of life by simply introducing positive intentions into your thinking. The positivity that goes into these thoughts is all part of the infinite field of potential energy that governs the universe. So, by introducing an intention or wish into this field of energy, you affect the universe around you. Let’s say you'd like to have a beautiful home, but you often think about this in negative terms: your emotions are tied up in disliking your current home and thinking that you’ll never have sufficient funds to afford a new one. When you do this, you give negative energy to the universe; naturally, this won’t result in the universe giving back positive energy. So, instead, accept and be grateful for the home you do have, and visualize the changes that could make your living situation even better. The universe will pick up on these positive thoughts and turn them into reality. To turn these desires into reality, however, you must give the process your full attention. For example, if you’re dissatisfied with your job, you may have negative thoughts about being incompetent or feeling unworthy. It requires constant attention throughout the day to notice these negative patterns and replace them with positive ones. If you catch yourself thinking that you’re not contributing enough at work, stop yourself and consciously think about your accomplishments to find at least one constructive thing you’ve done. Even if it is as simple as having written a carefully worded and effective email, you can stay with this thought and remain positive. Every human wants to shine. But, as each star has its right place in the night sky, every human must find their right place on earth. Only by doing this, and by helping others find their place, will people flourish and lead a purposeful existence. So, ask not what the universe can do for you, but what you can do for the universe. Let’s say you’ve always dreamed of becoming an artist. After all, it is a wonderful profession, and you admire the special kind of talent it takes to create art that inspires people and makes them happier and wiser. But the truth is, not everyone is artistically talented, and if this is the case for you, you might end up sad or depressed, feeling that you can’t contribute anything of value to society. But don’t despair! Instead of clinging to these dreams, be honest with yourself and discover the truth within you that can serve and benefit others. While a creative person will probably become a good artist or designer, a compassionate person might be better off as a doctor or nurse. It’s never too late to recognize your life’s purpose and plug into the endless source of energy that the universe provides. You might now be wondering whether your current job is providing you with the best way to contribute to the welfare of humanity and the planet. As it turns out, there is an easy way to tell. When you’ve found the right job, you will discover that you have a nearly endless source of energy to complete your work. This is the feeling you get when you align with the cosmic plan that was your destiny from the beginning. The universe begins to support you and provide you with the energy you need, which explains how some people can work effortlessly and happily for long hours, while others feel drained after just a few hours in the office. What do you think? Have you found your true Self? The key message in this book: Human beings are not separate, powerless egos that are lost and alone in a harsh physical world. Every one of us is part of the infinite field of potential energy that gives birth to and governs everything in the universe. When you recognize this, you can use this energy to fulfill your personal and professional dreams.  Actionable advice: Give to everyone you meet. When you are invited to someone’s home, bring them flowers or some other token of appreciation. Your gifts don’t always have to be material. You can give to others by greeting them in a loving and compassionate way. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Suggested further reading: The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle The Power of Now offers a specific method for putting an end to suffering and achieving inner peace: living fully in the present and separating yourself from your mind. The book also teaches you to detach yourself from your “ego” – a part of the mind that seeks control over your thinking and behavior. It argues that by doing so you can learn to accept the present, reduce the amount of pain you experience, improve your relationships and enjoy a better life in general.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Could make more out of your life? Do you envy people who pursue their dreams while you struggle with taking the first step? Many of us are burdened with these questions and concerns but are unsure of how or where to find answers. The Success Principles can help you push through and start making real progress toward success in your life. The following blinks outline timeless and universal principles to help you achieve unprecedented success both personally and professionally. You’ll then discover ways to apply these principles in your own life and witness the difference they can make. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: how you can freeze to death through the power of your own thoughts; why you are solely responsible for your life; and why changing the oil in your car is one step toward realizing your dreams. Are you ready to ditch your unfulfilling daily routine and start living your dream life? Then let’s get started! The first thing you need to understand on your journey to personal and professional success is that you are the director of your own life. When we fail, we often look for an excuse, blaming the failure on things that happen to us. But how these events affect us in the long run depends on how we respond to them. Imagine one circumstance where you receive $400. You could buy something nice for yourself, or invest the money in a mutual fund. If you opt for the former, you have no money left. If you choose the latter, you have made an investment on which you can later build and earn even more money – a much wiser decision. So if you want to start seeing improvements in your life, you need to change your responses. It’s far too easy to just complain about your circumstances. But if you pay more attention to how you’re living and the choices you’re making, you’ll soon see whether you’re on the right path to success. For instance, you’re either fit or out of shape. Ask yourself, what are you doing – or not doing – to make your body this way? If your goal is to lose weight, you’ll need to be aware of your daily calorie intake and your level of activity. Be honest with yourself: Do you eat well? Should you cut out chocolate or junk food? No one says that change is easy. It requires discipline, persistence and some experimentation. In the next blink, you’ll find out how to get a good start on changing your life. What if you’re not sure what personal success would look like for you? Relax – you’re not alone. Slow down and take some time to contemplate. One of the first steps toward personal success is to examine your reason for being: why are you here on earth? The life purpose exercise can help you discover this. To find your purpose, identify two of your strongest personality traits; describe the way you interact with others; and then imagine your ideal world. Once you have done this, combine these into a statement of life purpose. You might come up with: “My purpose is to use my honesty and passion to inspire others to move forward in their chosen profession, to help contribute to a world where people have fulfilling careers.” The next step is to create a vision – a mental picture of what your perfect future looks like. What would your perfect job be? How much free time would you have? What sort of friends? American president John F. Kennedy, who envisioned putting a man on the moon, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, who imagined a free and equal America for all people, were two influential visionaries. They succeeded in making seemingly unattainable ideas a reality – so why shouldn’t you do the same? Once you have your vision in mind, break it down into smaller goals that are ambitious, specific and tangible. What do you want to achieve, and how much time will you give yourself to achieve it? For example, being nicer to your employees may be well-meaning, but it’s not a specific, measurable goal. A clearer goal would be, “I will acknowledge six employees for their help with the latest project by the end of this week.” As you can measure your progress, you’ll know when you have achieved your goal. Defining a goal for every part of your vision will narrow the gap between your current reality and ultimate success. How do you push beyond your comfort zone toward achieving your vision? Two practices – affirmation and visualization – can help you. Affirmation starts when you state your goal as if it has already been realized, in a complete sentence. The most effective affirmations are in the first person, are positive and to the point. For example, “I love driving down the highway in my new yellow Lamborghini” is far more effective and precise than saying, “I want a new car.” You should specify exactly what your goal will look like once you have reached it. It is also important to add to your affirmation sentence how you will feel when you have reached your goal. Researchers have found that ideas stick in our memory better when a thought is coupled with a strong emotion. Thus, “I feel ecstatic when I’m driving down the highway in my new yellow Lamborghini” is a great affirmation! Once you’ve crafted your affirmations, connect each with a vivid image of your affirmation, called a visualization. To do this, close your eyes and imagine your affirmation in as much detail as you can. If your affirmation is, “I enjoy relaxing in the sunroom of my villa in Madrid,” visualize the colors of your house, the furniture in the sunroom, and so on. Add sounds, smells and tastes to your mental picture. What does it physically feel like to sit on the couch in your sunroom? Can you hear the sounds of the busy street, or birds singing? The more you fill your visualisation with emotions and sensory details, the more intensely you’ll feel it, giving you more power and momentum to reach your goal. Now that you’re well on your way to achieving ultimate success, you’ll need to prepare yourself for potential obstacles and, if you depend on others, possible rejection. Rejection is just a speedbump on the road to success. If someone says “no,” just keep trying until someone says “yes,” while keeping in mind your next step. Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Harland Sanders was no stranger to rejection. In fact, he heard “no” more than 300 times when proposing his business idea before someone said “yes.” If he’d quit at the first rejection, there wouldn’t be more than 11,000 KFC restaurants around the world! Best-selling author Stephen King also nearly chucked out the manuscript for his book Carrie after receiving many early rejections. But because he refused to give up, Carrie ended up selling more than 4 million copies, and was made into a film. On your road toward your dream life, you need to excel at what you do. An important principle to focus on is to become an over-achiever. Don’t be afraid to keep trying, and work your way toward your goal one step at a time. Take author Debbie Macomber. It took her five years of hard work before she sold her first book. She wrote for two and a half years while raising her children. To add to the pressure, her husband wanted her to give up her dream and go back to work. However, Macomber knew she could do it and spent a further two and a half years pursuing her dream, despite being tight on cash, never taking a vacation and losing a lot of sleep. In the end, it was worth it: she’s published over 100 books and many have become best sellers. Now that you know perseverance is the key to success, how do you allow success to happen? Now that we’ve explored the fundamentals of success, let’s focus on some work you need to finish before you can really achieve your dreams. First, you need to address unfinished business. Do you have any projects you’ve abandoned or left half-done? Do you need to clean your closet,or finish last year’s taxes? These small things can take valuable energy from achieving your larger goals. View it this way: it’s better to have five completed projects than 15 half-completed projects. One useful method is to schedule a completion weekend, where you take time to clear your slate of all unfinished business. Be clear and decisive: either do it, delegate it, delay it or dump it. Although choosing to delay a project doesn’t sound productive, it differs from procrastination in that you are consciously deciding to relegate the item. This “cleaning up” is not only applicable to tangible stuff in your life, but also to your relationships. How much energy are you wasting, holding a grudge against a colleague who sold your work as his? How about that friend who is never around when you need her? To move forward, you need to forgive. Forgiving doesn’t mean doing someone else a favor, it means that you have let go and released tension for your own benefit. People who have found the strength to fully forgive can experience remarkable results. In some instances, they no longer suffer from ailments such as chronic migraines, constipation or other diseases. One man even dropped six pounds within two days without changing his diet. Picture how fantastic you would feel if you were suddenly at peace with others! One effective technique you can use to help you forgive someone is to write a “total truth letter” to vent your anger. Write down things that have angered you, and you’ll notice that acknowledging your pain and grudges is the first step toward forgiveness. Once you’ve taken care of unfinished business, you’ll hopefully feel like you’re already making significant progress toward your goals. Now, let’s make sure that your thoughts are in order, too. Face it: you’re often your own biggest enemy. Most of us harbor negative thoughts about ourselves, so-called limiting beliefs, where we fixate on the things we think we can’t do. This mentality can be very damaging, as this one example shows. A railroad worker got trapped in a refrigerated freight wagon while carrying out some repairs. Panicked, he couldn’t stop thinking about the possibility of his freezing to death, and decided to write a last message to his family. The next morning he was found dead in the wagon. And although he showed physical signs of having frozen to death, the wagon's cooling system was actually out of order, and the temperature inside the wagon was a temperate 13°C. The man had essentially died through his own negative thinking. To succeed, you need to stem, if not eliminate completely, your negative thoughts. Yet if you look deep enough, self-love is often found underneath self-criticism. You might think, “I’m fat and lazy,” but if you examine this thought, what you’re really saying is, “I’m scared.” You’re scared that you might get sick by being overweight, and in your self-criticism, you’re asking yourself to take better care of your body. You’re really saying inside: “I care about myself. I want to be healthy and strong and I deserve to feel great about my body!” This is an expression of self-love. By transitioning from judgment to admitting fear, to a request for action and then acknowledging love, you’ll start changing your limiting beliefs into thoughts that are positive and beneficial. So stop judging yourself and start talking to yourself like you know your real value! Having personal resolve is crucial on your path to success, but you can’t walk that path on your own. Highly successful people always have others to inspire or mentor them along the way. One thing you can to do is to create a support group. You can do this by gathering a so-called mastermind group, a supportive circle of people with whom you can share ideas and challenges. Consider identifying six people with whom you are close, and hold scheduled conferences or Skype calls where each person takes 15 minutes to pose questions. For you to get the most value from these sessions, each group member should excel at a skill you wish to learn, or have achieved a goal you covet. For example, if you’re a small business owner, it might be advantageous to include one or two successful entrepreneurs from your industry in your group. Other professionals such as consultants, lawyers or investment bankers can also be of great help. Another powerful way you can find support is to identify a mentor. Even though it’s tempting to ask advice from friends or coworkers, it’s far more useful to ask people who’ve already achieved what you want to achieve. You needn’t be shy about approaching successful people, as most will be eager to share their recipe for success with you. For example, when motivational speaker Les Brown started his career, only Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, an acclaimed motivational guru, had faith in him. When Brown approached Peale, the latter was honored to share his experiences and ensured that Brown was well-equipped to become a successful coach and speaker. You can get the ball rolling by writing an email to someone you think would make a suitable mentor, and ask if they could spare 15 minutes per month for you to share ideas and ask questions. To get the most benefit out of your support network, you must first lay a solid foundation of honesty and appreciation to build meaningful relationships. Telling the truth can be scary. But we must tell the truth if we are to create and foster our connections with others. Consider the story of Jack Canfield and Larry Prince and their non-profit, Foundation for Self-Esteem. The two men submitted a proposal to design a training program for job hunters for the Los Angeles County Office for Education. However, when they realized the restrictions of the program, they decided to inform the county officers that they couldn’t comply with the regulations, thus risking losing the competition and the $730,000 grant. But because of their honesty, they actually ended up winning the competition! In addition to honesty, appreciation of others is often undervalued in relationships. In a study of some 200 companies, employees rated appreciation as the number-one motivator of a list of ten motivational themes; managers and supervisors, however, ranked appreciation in eighth place. It’s clear that we want to be more appreciated at work; so be sure you do your bit by showing appreciation for others. How exactly do you do this? It depends on the type of person you are, whether auditory, visual or tactile. The best way to appreciate others is to discover what makes them tick and combine different ways to express appreciation. For instance, you could invite someone for dinner, give them an encouraging pat on the back, praise them over the phone or write them a thank-you card. But crucially, be as authentic as possible. You shouldn’t hide the truth when it needs to be told. But also remember to honor and thank the people who support you. Do you agree that “money is the root of all evil?” If so, you need to redefine what wealth means to you. Most of us think that wealth is only about money, our assets or possessions. However, it’s much more than that: wealth also contains intellectual, human and civic facets. In terms of financial assets, you may ask: what goals do I have for my property, and what stocks and bonds would I like to own? Aside from tangible assets, try to also see how your relationships, health, morals and habits connect with how you create wealth. Also consider your education, your reputation and your skills. Bearing these factors in mind, you can start making your wealth work to your advantage. Many financially successful people consider their human and intellectual assets to be more valuable than their financial assets, as health, happiness and relationships form a foundation for lasting financial success. Another factor that will add considerably to your personal well-being is to offer your time to a worthy cause. Helping others has a remarkable effect on keeping us content and satisfied in our lives. Studies on volunteerism have shown that people who help others enjoy longer and healthier lives. Also, those of us who start volunteering and helping others at a young age are more likely to benefit from a successful career later on. Consider which causes are closest to your heart. For example, if you love to read, you could volunteer to read to the blind. You could even start a business that makes books for blind people. To get the most out of what life can offer, you need to become “wealthy,” which means so much more than just having financial assets. The key message in this book: You can achieve your greatest ambitions, but it takes some know-how. Following and practicing the principles of success will equip you to reach your personal and professional goals and live your dream life. Actionable advice: Cross off a nagging task on your to-do list, today. It may be as simple as filing some papers or getting your car’s oil checked, but completing a neglected task, even if just one per day, will make a huge difference toward achieving your more ambitious goals. Ask someone you admire for 15 minutes of their time. Find someone who has achieved a dream similar to your own and ask for 15 minutes of their time per month to advise and mentor you. The worst they can say is “no,” and in the best case, you might find a person who will be an invaluable resource in helping you live the life you want.

The second door is the VIP door, where the celebrities and billionaires slip straight through. And then there’s the third door. Most people don’t even know it exists, but it does. You have to step out of line, run around the back of the club, bang on the door, maybe sneak through a kitchen. You’ll need a little chutzpah and a little initiative, but there’s always a way. The world’s most successful people went through the third door, ignoring the queue in their determination to get ahead. In these blinks, you’ll follow the path of an ambitious young man on his quest to track down and interview some of the most successful people in the world and learn the secrets of how they got ahead. In these blinks, you’ll learn how braving an important phone call got Bill Gates’s career off to a flying start; how re-engineering your sleeping pattern could give you a competitive advantage; and why biting off more than you can chew isn’t necessarily a bad idea. Alex Banayan was supposed to become a doctor. At least, that was his parents’ plan for him. But at 18 years old, a month into college as a pre-med, he realized this wasn’t the path for him. One day, while reading a biography of Bill Gates instead of studying, Banayan started wondering. Bill Gates had become the richest man in the world and revolutionized the software industry. But how? How did he go from a regular 18-year-old kid, just like Banayan, to becoming the wealthiest man in the world? Banayan started looking into other successful people: How had Steven Spielberg, a guy who didn’t even get into film school, ended up as one of the most successful directors in history? What did Lady Gaga do to pivot from waiting tables to nailing her first record deal in 2006? Banayan couldn’t find a book that gave him the answer to these questions, so he decided to write it himself. Why not? He’d arrange interviews with Bill Gates and of other legends, travel across the US to meet with them, write up his discoveries and share them with his entire generation. Getting the interviews was one thing, getting to them was quite another. The hard part, he quickly realized, would be funding the travel to all those interviews. But as luck would have it, the game show The Price is Right was being filmed a few miles away. Winning the show was how he’d fund his quest. Some googling told him that the wackier the behavior at casting, the more chance of getting selected for the show. So when he turned up on set, Banayan hugged janitors, danced with security guards and flirted with old ladies. It worked, and he got selected. He didn’t actually know how to play the game though, so began chatting to his fellow contestants. One kindly old woman, who said she’d been watching for 40 years, took a shine to him. She advised him to always guess low, as guessing too high would get you eliminated. Hours later, with studio lights shining in his face, Banayan won the final prize – a sailboat, retail price $31,188, which he sold days later for $16,000. His quest could begin. After reading Tim Ferriss’s phenomenally popular book The 4-Hour Work Week (2007), Banayan became obsessed with meeting the author. At a conference where Ferriss was speaking, Banayan hid in a bathroom during the speech, realizing that its location gave him the best chance of intercepting Ferriss as he came off stage. When Ferriss finished talking, Banayan sprung out and snatched a quick chat. Ferriss seemed interested in Banayan’s mission and said he’d get in touch. But time passed with no contact from Ferriss, so Banayan started emailing Ferriss’s assistant. Business books say that persistence is important, Banayan reminded himself. The author was undeterred at receiving no reply, even when Ferriss’s assistant rejected the request. In total, Banayan sent 31 emails, one of which claimed that a one-hour interview with him, a college student, would be one of the best investments that Ferriss, a multi-million selling author, would ever make. Staying upbeat, Banayan always ended his emails with a cheery “Thanks in advance!” Then one day, out of the blue, Ferriss agreed to talk. Persistence works! Or so the author thought. When they met, Ferriss talked a little about persistence. Ferriss got his first big break after he tried to build a relationship with a certain startup CEO. Ferriss had emailed the CEO asking for a job, and was turned down 12 times. Eventually, Ferriss emailed to say he’d be in the CEO’s neighborhood the following week – a total lie – and that it would be great to stop by. When the CEO said ok, Ferriss jumped on a plane from New York to San Francisco to “casually” meet him. Ferriss got the job. But in telling the story to Banayan, Ferriss wanted to be clear about one point: There’s a difference, he said, between being persistent and being a hassle. Ferriss was never rude, and while he was persistent, he got the balance right. He didn’t email ten times a week. He told Banayan not to say things like “Thanks in advance!” because it sounds rude and entitled. Instead, say something like “I totally understand if you don’t have time to respond.” Months later, when reading through old emails, the author realized that Ferriss had been trying to save Banayan from himself. Only then did he understand how much he had to learn. When a contact at Microsoft said he could get Banayan an interview with Qi Lu, Banayan wasn’t sure what to think. Any interview was good news, but he’d never even heard of this guy. But Banayan’s interest was piqued when he learned that Lu was one of the tech world’s rising stars. At 27 years old, Qi Lu was earning just $27 a month. Fast forward to his 47th birthday, and he was a president at Microsoft. Qi Lu grew up in a poor village in China. As a child, he wanted to be a shipbuilder but wasn’t strong enough, so he focused on his school work and ended up studying computer science at Fudan University. There, he had the spark of inspiration that would change his life. He realized that one thing in life is constant – whether you’re rich or poor, you only have 24 hours in a day. That led him to think that sleeping less could give him a competitive advantage over his peers. So he started to re-engineer his sleep pattern, cutting out one hour, then another and another. At one point he slept just one hour a night, forcing himself back to consciousness with an ice-cold shower, but this was too much to keep up. Eventually, he settled on a sustainable four hours a night, and he’s stuck to that ever since. By reducing sleep and working extra hard, Lu managed to publish five research papers on the topic of model checking in computer science astonishingly early in his academic career. One day, a visiting professor from Carnegie Mellon came to give a talk on the same topic. Lu made some perceptive observations and impressed the professor with his research. The professor suggested that Lu try and study in the US, saying he would waive his $60 application fee – $60 that Lu didn’t have. That encounter might feel a little lucky, but it was only by carving out an extra few hours in the day that Lu had been able to deliver his research papers. As he said himself, luck is a little like a bus: If you miss one, another will come along. But if you aren’t prepared, you can’t jump on. These days, Qi Lu is so productive that at Microsoft his colleagues say he works twice as fast as anyone else. They even have a term for it – “Qi Time.” After his initial success in talking to Qi Lu and Tim Ferriss, Banayan hit a brick wall. Qi Lu had helpfully passed on an interview request to Bill Gates, but the message came back that Gates wouldn’t meet. Banayan embraced “Qi Time,” getting up at six o’clock every day to write more cold emails requesting interviews. But the only consequence of more emails going out was more rejections coming back in. Eventually, “Sugar” Ray Leonard, a six-time world champion boxer, agreed to an interview at his California mansion. Banayan had written to the boxer saying that he believed the younger generation could learn from his advice. When Leonard first started boxing as a child, he was skinnier, shorter and younger than the other kids. He knew that he needed an edge. One morning, as the yellow school bus pulled up to collect him, Leonard didn’t get on. Instead, as it pulled away, he chased it, running all the way to school. He did the same on the way home, and the same the next day. Day in, day out, rain, wind or snow, he chased the school bus. Leonard said that, as a child, he didn’t have as much boxing experience as the other kids. But he did have the heart and the desire to improve. Years later, in 1981, twelve rounds into a welterweight world championship fight against the then-undefeated Thomas “The Hitman” Hearns, he was getting badly beaten. His left eye was so swollen that he could barely see. But he was able to summon what he called his hidden reservoir – a buried reserve of strength and determination. It’s the reserve that allows a mother to lift a car off a trapped child, Leonard said. We all have it, and success comes to those who can tap it. When Leonard stood up for the 13th round, he exploded in a whirlwind of adrenalin and concentration. In the 14th round, with his opponent limp on the ropes, Leonard was the champion of the world. Banayan explained to Leonard how he wasn’t getting far with his mission. Leonard told him not to let anyone tell him that his mission, his dream, isn’t possible. Stay in the fight, the boxer said, find your hidden reservoir, and you can do whatever you want to do. It’s always good to have a mentor in life. For Banayan, that mentor was Elliott Bisnow. A 20-something kid who dropped out of school and built a company, Bisnow Media, with his dad, that would go on to sell for 50 million dollars in 2016. In 2008, Bisnow also co-founded Summit Series to provide fun conferences for entrepreneurs and the world’s elite. Impressed at how much Bisnow had achieved so young, Banayan got in touch. They met days later in LA and quickly became friends. Bisnow helped Banayan access a world of entrepreneurs and taught him invaluable lessons. The key one was to bite off more than you can chew. Summit Series began when Bisnow wanted to meet more young entrepreneurs. Most of us in that situation might decide to go to networking events, or perhaps move to a bigger city. Not Bisnow. Bisnow cold-called young entrepreneurs, asking if they wanted to get a group together and hang out for a weekend. He gathered 20 young leaders, including the founders of TOMS Shoes and the websites Thrillist and CollegeHumor, and took them for a weekend’s skiing on his own money. He didn’t actually have the money, instead he put the $30,000 in upfront costs on a credit card. Then he began cold-calling companies to ask if they wanted to sponsor a conference of the top young entrepreneurs in the US. Companies started saying yes, and Summit Series was born. Bisnow was out of his depth. He had to ask his mother what food he should provide. Granola bars? Apples? He had no idea. But he worked it out, and ever since, he’s tried to live by the philosophy that you should bite off more than you can chew – be ambitious, aim high and work out the details later. It certainly worked for Bisnow. Summit Series is now a huge enterprise, and very popular among the business and cultural elite. Attend an event, and you might hear Richard Branson telling entrepreneurial tales in the morning, listen to national poetry slam champion IN-Q in the afternoon and hear Erin Brockovich discuss social justice, all in the same day. Bisnow and his co-founders even bought an entire ski-resort in Utah to act as a base for an exclusive, entrepreneurial community. Bisnow is the living embodiment of what you can achieve if you aim high. When Banayan tried to approach Bill Gates for an interview, he got this message from Gates’s office: he would never get an interview while he didn’t have a publishing deal. So Banayan set out to find a publishing deal. The key to this was finding a literary agent. From that point on, Banayan’s motto was “get a literary agent, get Bill Gates.” Banayan read books about how to get published and approached literary agents by the handful. He’d met plenty of entrepreneurs through Bisnow, and asked those with book deals to introduce him to their agents. He was doing everything right, but only getting rejected. There was one literary agent left on his list, and she such was a superstar – she’d even rejected Tim Ferriss for his first book – that it seemed pointless even to approach her. It was Banayan’s college friend Brandon who changed his mind. Brandon was a bookworm and told Banayan a story he’d once read about Walmart. It was the year 2000, and brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart were being hit hard by online shops like Amazon. Walmart was panicking about losing market-share, so they tried to replicate Amazon’s tech and strategy. But it didn’t work. One day, a new executive tried something: She hung a banner up in the office that said, “You can’t out-Amazon Amazon.” Soon afterward, Walmart’s market share boomed as they focused on executing their own business strategy, not copying Amazon’s. Banayan, Brandon explained, was Walmart. All he’d been doing was copying other people’s strategies for success. He’d been pitching to literary agents as if he was Tim Ferriss, but without the platform and fame that Ferriss had. Since Banayan had started his mission, he’d studied how successful people got ahead. But while that’s a good way to learn, he discovered he couldn’t tackle every problem that way. On this occasion, he needed his own playbook. That night, unable to sleep, Banayan got up and wrote an email to his number-one-target literary agent. Instead of repeating his usual spiel, he wrote out why he believed in his mission. He wrote that together, the two of them could change the world. The email was more like a teenage love note than a professional email, but he sent it. A day later, she offered to represent him. After securing his book deal, Banayan eventually persuaded Bill Gates’s office to set up an interview. Researching ahead of the meeting, Banayan discovered an incident that he felt explained Gates’s early success. It resonated with Banayan, who had always suffered from nerves when he needed to make an important phone call or conversation. The lesson? Sometimes you have to break through your discomfort. Aged just 19, Gates and his partner Paul Allen heard that a computer company, MITS, had released the first minicomputer onto the market. Gates saw an opportunity, and the two of them wrote to MITS proposing to sell software to run on the machine. After getting no response, they debated how to follow up. Neither Bill nor Paul wanted to make the phone call. Both were nervous. Eventually, Bill took the leap. Taking some deep breaths, he told the founder of MITS that they wanted to come in and present some software. It worked, and they got the meeting. There was one small problem – the software didn’t exist. But eight weeks of hard work later, they presented their new code, signed a deal, and made the first of many millions of sales. Having the bravery to make that phone call ultimately kicked off their success. When the interview finally took place in Gates’s office, Banayan asked him for advice on negotiation and strategy in the early days of your career. Gates had two key pieces of advice: Firstly, if you’re young, you need a way to blast through people’s skepticism. When Gates went to sales meetings, he would overwhelm people with his expertise, talking fast and in great depth about programming language and software platforms until it was clear that he wasn’t some dumb kid. Secondly, he surprised Banayan by saying that when establishing Microsoft in the early 1980s, he prioritized strategic positioning over immediate profit. When Microsoft began selling to IBM, he took the decision not to push for too much money to ensure he got the deal. He knew that rivals to IBM would emerge and that the prestige of working with IBM would help Microsoft sell to these rivals as well, securing higher profits. The lesson was clear: when starting out, take the position that will help you in the long term over short-term profits. One day, at a party hosted by his friend, Miki Agrawal, founder of the period-proof underwear business THINX, Banayan saw Tony Hsieh, CEO of online shoe retailer Zappos. Hsieh was walking around with a clipboard that had “Wishes List” written on it, explaining that, for one day, he was acting as fairy godmother. When Hsieh asked Banayan what he wished for, Banayan knew straight away. I want to be the Zappos CEO for the day, he said. His 20th birthday was coming up soon and he wondered if he could shadow Hsieh. Hsieh was a little surprised, but agreed. While giving him marketing advice, Hsieh told Banayan that he should consider his end goals for the book. Most people don’t consider what their goals are, and if they do, they’re often not honest about them. In doing so, he helped Banayan understand that it’s okay to embrace your ego. Hsieh himself had written a bestseller, Delivering Happiness. For Hsieh, when he wrote Delivering Happiness, one motive was definitely vanity and ego. He thought it would be nice to tell his mum and dad that his book was number one on the bestsellers lists. This surprised Banayan, who’d always thought of an ego as a bad thing. But Hsieh went on to explain that it’s worse to have an ego and deceive yourself that you don’t. In reality, it’s better to accept that you can accommodate an ego alongside other goals, such as wanting to inspire young entrepreneurs. The other lesson Banayan learned from his time with Hsieh was the power of asking for help. While shadowing Hsieh in and out of meetings and through a company-wide presentation, Banayan noticed Zappos employees throwing him a few jealous looks. One approached him to say he’d worked at Zappos for years and dreamed of shadowing the boss. How did Banayan get so lucky? Later that day, while thanking Hsieh for his time, Banayan asked the CEO why he didn’t let his employees shadow him sometimes. Hsieh looked blank. He’d be happy to, he said. But no-one ever asked him if they could. Banayan pursued Warren Buffett for an interview for months. He even flew to Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, in the hope of bumping into him, only to discover he arrived at the same time as the worst snow-storm for 30 years. Banayan never met the “Oracle of Omaha,” and instead spent time in his hotel room shivering from the cold. Having read everything there is to know about Buffett, he picked up a few lessons in success. The first was to find out what people need and use that to get access to them. In 1951, after Buffett finished his studies, he set himself up as a stockbroker. But every time he tried to get a meeting with a local businessman, they turned him down. Who wants to meet some young guy with no track record, trying to sell stocks? So Buffet thought of a different approach: He started calling business people, telling them he could help save them from paying too high taxes. Now they finally wanted to meet, and Buffett was able to kick-start his career. Banayan figured out that maybe people don’t want to talk to you for the reasons you want to talk to them, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t talk at all. You just need to figure out what they want. He received a similar lesson when he met Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and the first drug infusion pump, among other innovations. Kamen explained that sometimes it’s best to look at a problem from a different angle. Not so long ago, there’d been something of a crisis in science and technology education in the US. Many people saw this as an educational crisis and tried to solve it by improving the education system – tinkering with course content and training new teachers. Kamen, however, believed that it was a culture crisis. He created a competition called FIRST – a non-profit which treats high-school engineering like sport by running national and international robotics competitions screened on NBC and NASA TV. FIRST has now impacted millions of lives. So, Kamen said, don’t get frustrated if you don’t break through. Reframe the question in a way that allows you to find a solution. After hearing who Banayan was interviewing, one man said he didn’t feel worthy of being on the list. He was also, by some distance, the happiest guy Banayan had met. Steve Wozniak was, alongside Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. But unlike Jobs, or Gates, or Buffett, Wozniak has never been seen as a business tycoon, largely because he left Apple in 1985. When Banayan ate lunch with Wozniak in Cupertino, California, Wozniak oozed happiness. He seemed to genuinely love his life, from his loving relationship with his wife to the cuteness of his dogs and the excitement of his upcoming road trip. Why all this happiness? Wozniak was happy, he said, because he felt he was living life on his own terms and doing what he wants to do, not what society dictates is the right thing. For example, early on in the Apple story, Steve Jobs was the obvious choice for CEO. Where Wozniak was going to fit into the executive team wasn’t so clear. The last thing he wanted to do was manage staff or deal with internal politics, so he told Jobs he wanted to be a simple engineer. This was something he already knew he loved and was happy to continue doing. Maybe society says that you should reach the highest position possible, Wozniak said. But is that really what’ll make you happiest? Wozniak’s determination to live life on his own terms also meant living by his values. This often put him in conflict with Jobs. When Apple was filing its initial public offering in 1980, Jobs and Wozniak were all set for a huge payout. Both would become ultra-rich. But Wozniak discovered that Jobs had refused to give stock options to some employees who’d been with Apple since the beginning. Wozniak saw these people as family. After all, they’d helped make the company what it was. But Jobs wouldn’t budge. In the end, Wozniak gifted some of his own shares to the old employees, so they too could share in the financial reward. The day Apple went public, they became millionaires. Of the two men, Jobs has gone down in history as the more successful. But as Wozniak sat back, opening a fortune cookie and laughing happily, his success seemed obvious too. The key message in these blinks: We all have the power to make little choices that can alter our lives forever – to pick up the phone and make that first sales call, bite off more than we can chew, or simply follow our vision. You have the power to choose. You can accept the inertia in your life and continue waiting in line for the First Door. Or you can duck out of the line, run around the back, and take the Third Door. The choice is in your hands.  Actionable advice: Have a pipeline.  Whatever you’re trying to achieve, build a pipeline of opportunities. Say you want to work in a startup. Don’t concentrate on just one, or two. Build a pipeline and approach them all. You’ll never know which one of your hundred startup CEOs woke up this morning thinking “We really need a new sales guy.” Building a pipeline is one way of increasing the chances that you’ll get lucky.

But don’t blame the job itself. If you take the right approach, any role has the potential to become a meaningful one. In The Truth about Employee Engagement, Lencioni explores the effects unhappy employees can have on the success of a business, as well as the employee’s family and social life. You’ll learn to identify the three root causes of job dissatisfaction and gain the tools you need to improve your own – and other people’s – work lives. No matter what your job, whether you’re managing or being managed, you can benefit from the advice in these blinks. In these blinks, you’ll learn what a withered plant has to do with an unhappy employee; why your boss should ask about your after-work pottery class; and that a garbage collector may well be happier than Madonna. What does it mean when somebody tells you they have a bad job? There are lots of reasons they might feel less than happy with their role. It might leave them physically exhausted or offer low pay. But there are less obvious reasons why people might be dissatisfied. Say you land a job in the sector in which you’ve always dreamed of working or secure a move to a position with an attractive salary. Neither of these things can guarantee job satisfaction. Have you ever found yourself heading to work each morning, dreading arriving at the office? Have you ever counted the hours all day long, waiting for it to be over? Then you’ve had a miserable job that may have left you feeling deeply cynical, without motivation to apply yourself or perform well. It has nothing to do with the job title or the sector; a doctor can be just as miserable as a construction worker. A professional sportsperson might be as disillusioned as an amusement park designer. A wealthy executive might be deeply unhappy in her job, whereas the waiter who serves her lunch may find his job deeply rewarding. You get the picture. Being so unhappy in your job obviously has a personal cost – your general well-being. What isn’t as obvious is the high cost to companies. Let’s look at efficiency. There’s plenty of research to show the negative impact dissatisfied employees can have on a company’s efficiency. When a worker is less engaged and less happy with their work, they’re less likely to perform well, and both employee and company will suffer. Not only that – an unhappy employee’s misery and cynicism will filter into their home life, affecting their partner and children. The same people are also more likely to find it hard to perform their other social responsibilities, such as caring for loved ones and taking part in the wider community. If we’re going to solve job misery, we’ll first have to understand what causes it. Luckily, the next blink has the answer. Picture a plant. If the roots are rotten, no nutrients can be absorbed, the rot spreads to the rest of the plant and the whole thing soon withers and dies. Well, it’s much the same for humans in bad jobs. Three different rotten roots can potentially cause good jobs to wither into dismal ones. The first of these roots is anonymity. People need to have their efforts recognized to feel valued. It’s crucial that somebody – ideally their employer – takes the time to understand their potential and appreciate their abilities. When people feel invisible, and that their presence wouldn’t be missed, they become despondent. The second root problem is irrelevance. When you do a job that makes a positive impact on other people – even if it’s just one other person – you feel your work is worthwhile. If nobody is benefitting from your work, you will feel as though your efforts are pointless. The final root of job misery is immeasurement. This comes about when people have nothing against which to measure their achievements. If you don’t know what your goal is, how can you determine whether you have achieved it? It helps to have a clear idea of what it looks like to perform well, and what can be done to improve. Otherwise, you will end up without motivation and ultimately dissatisfied. It’s not just those at the bottom of the ladder who experience anonymity, irrelevance and immeasurement; even managers can be affected by the root causes of job misery. To illustrate this point, imagine the leader of the marketing section of a software company. Let’s call her Nancy. Nancy has quite a powerful job, but she’s miserable. Why is that? Well, she reports directly to the CEO, who is so busy that she has no time to take an interest in Nancy’s professional development or personal life. She feels anonymous. Nancy also fails to see how the company is of any help to its customers. She’s not even sure her work makes a difference within her team. She feels irrelevant. And even though Nancy recognizes the company is performing well – as shown by performance data – Nancy has no way to measure her contribution to the company’s success. This is immeasurement. All three root causes of job misery have combined to leave Nancy feeling deeply unhappy. Say you’re running a business. It’s not making enough profit – what do you do? Look for cheaper suppliers? Use more efficient production methods? Maybe you should take a look at your staff first – increasing employee engagement can solve many problems. The most obvious benefit of employee engagement is higher productivity. When people feel that their job has meaning, they’re much more willing to take responsibility to get things done. This may involve working longer hours or being more diligent, which will mean more accurate, higher-quality results. The less obvious – but equally important – benefit is that engaged employees will stay loyal to their company. They will even recommend it to other good employees. In the long term, this will save the company time and money on training and recruitment. It’s also worth bearing in mind in these highly competitive times that having a reputation for fostering a positive workplace can boost a company’s profile. This is easily done by looking after your employees and making sure they’re motivated. Doesn’t this all sound like common sense? Well, sadly, there are many obstacles to overcome to achieve such employee engagement. As the employee, you might focus solely on salary and promotion prospects when choosing a role. While these are important, it’s even more crucial to find out if the company will be a good cultural fit for you. Does it support employees’ development? Does it nurture their existing talents? On the other hand, the main obstacle for employers is an inability to communicate. It can be awkward for an employer to ask questions that require an emotional response, particularly questions about how an employee is feeling or whether they’re enjoying their work. Luckily, this is a skill that can be developed if managers work a little harder every day to make sure their employees stay engaged. What do you have in common with megastars like Madonna? More than you’d think. In spite of wealth and success, many actors and movie stars find themselves dissatisfied – under constant pressure to reinvent themselves because of a deep fear of becoming irrelevant. This fear affects office workers just as much as Grammy Award winners. Employers can do a lot to help their employees feel needed. Firstly, by making sure each employee knows what their contribution is. For example, employers might encourage their employees to ask “Who am I helping?” In the hospitality industry, the answer is straightforward: the customer. But even though it’s clear who they’re helping, it’s important to remind employees that their work is having an impact by making sure to relay customer feedback to them. It’s not quite as easy to motivate employees who aren’t working directly with customers, such as secretaries and office assistants. Their work largely benefits just one person directly – the boss. In this situation, it’s a good idea for the boss to motivate employees by acknowledging how their hard work makes her life easier. As well as making the effort to give praise, employers need to get to know their employees. Employees whose bosses take an interest in them will feel more satisfied in their roles. So what’s the best way to make an employee feel listened to? Easy – just take time to sit down and talk. It may be hard to overcome workplace formality at first. When recruiting, managers are trained not to ask candidates personal questions in interviews. However, managers should get to know their staff. This includes their dreams, what motivates them, and important events in their home life. Sadly, managers often neglect to do this, but taking a genuine interest in colleagues and checking in with them regularly is one of the most effective ways to raise employee engagement. “Great job!” That’s the sort of thing you might hear from a manager trying to keep you motivated. It’s nice, but it’s not enough. Employers need to be a lot more specific in their praise. Why? Because employees need to know exactly what their contribution is to feel their work is worthwhile. This often involves playing on the human element of any job. Take a worker at an airport hotel. It may be their job to deliver breakfast trays to guests’ rooms. If they only see their job as delivering food, they won’t find much satisfaction in the task. But if they understand that the guests receiving the breakfast have likely been traveling for hours, are very tired, and that having breakfast outside their door will make a huge difference to their day, the job suddenly becomes much more meaningful. Accounting might not seem like the most caring of professions, but an accountant may have just as great an impact on other humans. Say a sick person has lost the receipt from a doctor’s appointment but needs to be reimbursed as soon as possible. If the accountant helps find that receipt, she’s not only finding a piece of paper; she’s also giving the patient peace of mind. That lets the patient take a break from worrying about their finances and spend their time on something enjoyable. It should be part of the employer’s job to remind employees who they’re helping. As well as having a clear idea of who benefits from their hard work, employees need to be able to measure their contribution. It’s very important that success isn’t measured by how happy a superior is with the work. If success is evaluated subjectively like this, it creates a competitive environment, with people playing politics and sucking up to the boss. Instead, employees should be able to track their progress using clear metrics. It’s no use giving individuals the general company revenue target to aim for; there should be a feedback system. This allows employees – like the hotel worker – to get direct feedback from customers. The hotel worker was just a quick example. Let’s look at some more examples in the next blink. You’ve already heard why a glamorous job isn’t necessarily a happy one, just as a menial job isn’t always miserable. If you need convincing further, here are some more examples of how to make any job more meaningful. What about a box boy? The boy in this example is called Josh. He works at the supermarket packing customers’ bags and carrying them to the car. Josh may be at the bottom of the hierarchy, but the boss would be unwise to treat him anonymously. The boss might start a conversation, find something the two have in common and by doing so increase Josh’s interest in and loyalty to the store. Josh could also make the work more interesting for himself by giving the customers extra benefits, such as a weather report or an inspiring quote while he’s doing his job. Now let’s look at the other end of the hierarchy and consider the job of a star athlete. In this case, he’s called Michael, and he plays American football. Michael’s lucky enough to earn several million dollars each year, but he’s not necessarily a happy man. Major athletes, like Michael, are treated like commodities – traded anonymously by clubs and agents for huge fees. Moving to a new city, working with a new coach, the star athlete risks feeling very lonely, unless the new coach makes an effort to get to know Michael personally. The other occupational hazard is that Michael loses sight of what he’s doing for others. Playing a sport can come to seem irrelevant. Even if Michael and his teammates have thousands of followers on social media, or receive media praise for their playing record, this is no replacement for personal feedback. That means it’s up to the coaches and managers to remind sportspeople how much they’re valued by the fans who watch their games. A win will keep the supporters happy through the whole week, and keeping that in mind can make all the difference. What do you think of when you think of service? An underpaid waiter serving a rich diner? An ordinary worker serving a more powerful manager? Actually, service should go both ways, and managers should aim to serve their employees. When you’re a manager in a corporate organization, it’s easy to feel you’re not as generous or caring as a nurse or a doctor. But don’t forget that managers are in a position to give a great deal to their employees. To do this, they have to make an effort to improve the well-being of their employees – physically and mentally – to ensure they have the best possible working conditions. The great news is that everybody benefits in this situation; the employees feel valued and motivated, while the manager enjoys the satisfaction of having improved the well-being of many people and their families. Making changes needn’t be intimidating either. There are a wealth of simple things managers can do to be of service to their staff. First, a manager should take a look at what they’re already doing to make their employees feel good. They can do this by asking how well they really know their employees, whether they are aware of their hobbies, passions and home life. It’s also the manager’s responsibility to put measures in place that will keep each employee aware of their contribution to the company, so they can keep track of the impact their work is having. But managers shouldn’t just trust their own feelings. They need to ask for feedback to see which areas still leave room for improvement when it comes to helping employees find meaning in their work. If there are shortcomings, then the manager can make a decisive plan of action for changes. This will involve further discussions with individuals and the whole team. If individuals and managers alike make the effort to connect and make each other feel valued, both people and business will thrive. The key message in these blinks: Don’t put up with a miserable job – find a way to make it meaningful. Managers and employees alike have the tools to bring joy and meaning to each other’s work. The key is to focus on your impact on other people, what you contribute to the whole, and have a clear way of measuring your success. The more engaged the employees, the more successful the business.  Actionable advice: Find a meaningful job.  If you’re job-searching, it’s wise to ensure there’s potential for the role for which you’re applying to be meaningful. You can do this at the interview stage. Tell prospective employers that you’d like to know them better and that you want them to know you. Tell them you need a clear vision of what your work is doing for others and a clear way to measure success. If they don’t seem interested in answering the questions, that’s a red flag. Find a company that can offer you a workplace where you’ll look forward to arriving every morning. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Sure, it may seem like wise advice, but is it true? It turns out that success is not just about the trying, but also about the failing. While you might think that failing to meet your goal the first or even the second time makes you a loser, think again! These blinks will show you that failure isn’t a bad thing; in fact, you need to fail to reach your goals. Creating an environment where failure is not just okay but encouraged will help improve how you experiment with ideas to achieve success sooner than you think. In the following blinks, you’ll discover what Swiss cheese has to do with avoiding disasters; the major problem with bankruptcies; and how anchor Dan Rather lost his job at CBS. Sometimes it feels as though some people crash into every possible hurdle, while others never seem to even stumble. The truth is that we all fail. It’s how we fail that separates the ordinary from the extraordinary. One way that we struggle with failure has to do with how we conceptualize it, incorrectly assuming that success comes from an innate talent or intelligence, rather than through hard work and commitment. Take Carol Dweck’s experiment, for example, in which two groups of children took a simple test and all passed. The children then got to choose from a collection of follow-up tests that varied in difficulty. One group was told they did well on the first test because of “how smart they were.” This group was likely to choose an easy follow-up test. The second group was told they did well “because of their hard work.” This group, in contrast, was much more willing to take on a challenge with a more difficult test, and succeed in the face of adversity. When children are praised for their innate skills, they find it harder to face challenges. “Naturally gifted” people will prefer to take an easier road over a bumpy one. Such people can’t fail gracefully. When coddled children finally end up in college or the “real world,” they don’t understand the importance of hard work, how to take criticism or how to fail. It’s not innate talent but graceful failure that leads to success, even if it’s a long and painful process. Those who see failure as normal and surmountable, who have a growth mentality, see that they have nothing to fear from failure. Mark Twain, for example, was a largely unsuccessful writer before he wrote Huckleberry Finn. Isaac Newton made blunders, too. Before his breakthrough discoveries in physics, he was drawn to alchemy, a pseudo-science that is now the laughing stock of the scientific community. When you’re trying to make up your mind to engage in a project, you may try to predict whether you’ll succeed or fail – mostly to see if the effort is worth your time. However, such predictions are often laughable in hindsight. Take the 1995 film Waterworld, for example. With a leading star actor, a grandiose set and a summer release, the film was anticipated to be a phenomenal success. The film instead was a major flop. Two years later, another film with an extravagant water-based set but a less-famous cast, a less-popular release date and a three-hour run time showed all the signs of a critical flop. And yet, Titanic turned out to be one of the most successful films ever made. We’re not always the best at making predictions. In fact, the only way to find out if something works is to try it out, to put the idea into the world. In the 1980s, for example, executives at Coca-Cola were brainstorming ways to stave off competition from their biggest rival, Pepsi. So they spent huge sums of money developing a new product – New Coke. The marketing research, including surveys and taste tests, indicated that New Coke would be a hit. What happened? New Coke was a disaster. Coca-Cola hadn’t understood the limitations of their testing, as people liked New Coke better in trials, but that preference didn’t translate to the “real world.” There were other hidden factors too, such as the strong association between people who lived in the South and the Coke brand. Southerners were absolutely indignant about New Coke. Coca-Cola did eventually rebound, but it learned a valuable lesson. It’s always possible that things will turn out contrary to your best predictions. Have you noticed that the more you rely on spell check, the worse your spelling becomes? Indeed, our reliance on such safety systems, made possible by increasingly sophisticated technology, actually can cause us to make mistakes. What’s more, they also delude us into thinking we’re invincible. Every day, we rely on multiple layers of safety systems to make failure less likely, something psychologist James Reason named the Swiss Cheese Model. Only in rare occasions, when the holes of each layer align, does failure occur. For example, we rely on many safety layers to avoid traffic accidents. We go to driving school, police look out for drunk drivers, our cars are outfitted with anti-lock brakes, and so on. And it’s a good thing that we have so many safety systems, considering that three-quarters of Americans admit to driving while on the phone, while one in five admit they’ve even fallen asleep at the wheel! Despite this, only 0.02 percent of drivers are killed in car accidents each year. Compare this with work in the medical field. Medical staff consult procedural checklists, wash their hands, use antibiotics and so on, and yet an estimated 100,000 people die each year from illnesses contracted during treatment – three times the number of fatalities due to car accidents. Clearly, safety systems aren’t enough to always protect us from failure. What’s worse, failure is unpredictable. Before the Great Recession, economists believed that the Federal Reserve’s expert management of banking institutions and fiscal policy was proof that they had reduced volatility in the business cycle. This belief was vindicated by a low number of defaults and the shrinking severity of recessions. And yet, despite its regulatory power and successful track record, the Fed was powerless to stop the Great Recession and its complicated unraveling. You might have the bad habit of trying to create a reality that matches your expectations, but in the process fail to see what is really in front of you. Just before the 2004 U.S. presidential election, for example, journalist Dan Rather broke the news that George W. Bush had gone AWOL during the Vietnam War. His source was a series of photocopied memos obtained from Bush’s former commanding officer. Although CBS said that experts had verified the authenticity of the memos, they were later found to have been written using technology that didn’t adhere to the standards of 1970s typewriters. But why did CBS’s experts miss the evidence that the memos were fake? Modern psychology tells us that we all have a tendency for showing inattentional blindness, whereby we focus on one thing at the expense of others. As part of an experiment to demonstrate inattentional blindness, students watched a video of people passing a basketball around after being told to count the number of times the ball was passed. In their intense concentration, the students failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit enter the space, beat his chest and then casually leave. The experts hired by CBS might have been so focused on looking for ways to verify the story and the  memo’s authenticity that they missed all the damning evidence against it. Often when we do make honest mistakes, we sometimes act disingenuously to cover them up. After the memos were revealed to be fake, Rather and the CBS team could have easily admitted their mistake. But they didn’t. Instead, Rather defended the memos, leading to his team being fired from their jobs at the station, and eventually, Rather’s departure as well.   The following blinks will offer some tips on how to better cope with failure. Have you ever stayed in relationship you felt was unhealthy, or at a company that you knew was doomed? The reason for doing so lies at least in part in human nature. People often act as if nothing is wrong, even when all signs point to disaster. Consider General Motors, a company which in 1960 finally matched Ford’s stature earlier in the century by commanding half of the American automobile market. Whereas Ford had offered one make of car in one color, GM offered a greater variety while also developing innovations such as the first electric starter and an automatic transmission. GM even paid their workers double the national average! But from 1965 to until the Great Recession 40 years later, GM continually lost market share. The company focused only on the positive aspects of its business, refusing to acknowledge its failures – which ultimately ended in disaster. General Motors was presented with a number of intersecting problems from the 1970s onward that simply weren’t dealt with. For instance, the union ensured workers earned above-inflation wage increases as well as generous health and pensions benefits. What’s more, policy made it almost impossible to punish unexcused absences, so much so that the company simply closed plants on the first day of hunting season, knowing full well that no one would show up anyway. As a consequence, GM’s costs were much higher, making it difficult to compete with cheaper foreign cars. In 1998, GM decided to discontinue its Oldsmobile brand, which had lost 75 percent of sales over 15 years. Adding to this failure was the fact that GM was required by law to reimburse dealers once it closed a brand, costing the company over $1 billion. In the face of such disasters, GM decided to focus on its past successes, the production of SUVs and expanded customer financing. Unfortunately, a spike in oil prices in the 2000s and a rise in the cost of credit threw cold water on the company’s plans. GM lost its advantage because it didn’t address the actual issues the company was facing, instead burying its head in the sand until it was too late to act. Unemployment is the pits. Having less money causes stress; your skill atrophy; and the economy as a whole suffers. So what’s the best way to deal when you find yourself without a job? Try to learn from your mistakes, widen your job search and keep your forward momentum. Follow the example of Harland Sanders, who spent his first 20 adult years drifting between jobs, getting fired from a few and running (and failing at) some independent business ventures. At 65, Sanders found himself unemployed again. But he didn’t despair. Instead, he developed a fried chicken recipe – not because it was a lifelong dream, but because a newly built highway diverted customers away from his restaurant and he needed a new idea. So, he took his recipe on the road, eventually franchising the now global KFC. As a job seeker, you should approach your job search like salespeople approach sales. First, set specific goals for approaching potential clients. Second, make sure to record your attempts so that you can learn from them later. Employ a script that you can hone through your experiences. Finally, surround yourself with people in the same boat who can offer you their insights. Not only will this make the job search automatic, but it will also make it easier to cope with rejection. As a society, we can also work to alleviate unemployment by taking steps to reduce the average unemployment time. One way is to make it easier to hire – and fire – employees. Consider, for example, that U.S. unemployment is near the lowest in the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). While European unemployment benefits are much more generous than in the United States, Europeans are also unemployed for longer periods of time. Likewise, European labor laws often make it difficult to fire employees after a probationary period, which serves as a disincentive to hire. Failure will inevitably occur, and that means that we need to be prepared for it. Our final blinks will deal with approaching wrongdoing and failure in society. It’s only natural that we try to identify the reasons for failure or disaster. Unfortunately, we all too often rush to judgment once we’ve decided who the culprit is or what’s to blame. Take the Great Recession. Some people blame the government, which, by encouraging access to easy credit, allowed people to spend beyond their means, or trade in subprime mortgage bonds. Others blame the financial industry, which, after financial deregulation, took to selling expensive mortgages to naive, low-income home buyers. The reality, however, is far more complex. Banks kept the worst deals on their books, indicating that most had no idea of the catastrophe to come. There was also nothing specific with regard to deregulation that could have been a smoking gun. The 1999 Gramm Leach Bliley Act, for example, did allow commercial banks to own investment banks, as critics claimed. However, the crisis started in investment banks not owned by commercial banks, such as Lehman Brothers. Most crises are made up of many single factors; yet no one event could bring the world to a halt. Yet when trying to grasp how or why things happen, we often prefer an easy-to-understand story to a messy, complex event that is beyond our control. The rising rates of autism in children is another interesting example. It’s easier to believe that the chemicals in vaccines are to blame, rather than a yet-undetermined mix of genetics, pollutants and infections. We must learn to accept, however, that randomness and complexity are what rule the world, not some simple, imaginary puppetmaster. Sometimes people fail in ways that require society to intervene through the criminal justice system. So what is the best way to deal with people who break society’s rules? The answer doesn’t lie in putting more people behind bars. In fact, the U.S. prison system is damaging to society in the long term. We put so many people behind bars that it has become impossible to evaluate whether we’re actually safer as a result. With overzealous prison sentencing, certain communities take it for granted that at some point, one will do jail time. And those who are eventually released are unable to rebuild their lives, which often leads to more crime. Compounding this problem in the United States is the mix of mandatory minimum terms, “three strikes” laws and revolving doors, where offenders are released directly to their old community after imprisonment. Moreover, this system often entails randomized draconianism, where offenders can be handed lengthy jail terms for trivialities, such as missing a probation meeting or drug test. We would be much better served by enacting swift, predictable punishment rather than the seemingly random and drawn-out process we have now. One example of this is a pilot project called Hawaii’s Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE). The program so far has had promising results. For example, people on probation receive random drug tests. After six months, however, only four percent still test positive. In addition, offenders form relationships with probation officers, a feat which is normally impossible due to the ratio of offenders to probation officers. This extra effort means that the HOPE program is more expensive than other handling for repeat offenders, but the cost is easily offset by long-term savings. Indeed, only 9 percent of offenders have had their probation revoked and have returned to jail, compared to 31 percent in the standard probation system. It’s programs like these that make it clear how much better rehabilitation is at curbing crime than the traditional prison system. As a society, we would all be better off with more of such programs. Imagine you’ve been kidnapped by gangsters, who have tied cement blocks to your feet and thrown you in a river. A nightmare situation, for sure! Yet to some financial advisers, this scenario is the legal equivalent of being shackled by long-term debt. The easiest way to avoid this situation is to not get yourself in debt in the first place. But that’s not always easy. Take financial adviser Dave Ramsey, for example, who in 1986 at the age of only 26, was worth $5 million and had a booming real estate business. Unfortunately for him, a new law was introduced that revoked tax deductions for investor-owned real estate. His lenders called in their loans, but he couldn’t pay so he had to sell his assets at a loss. He then foreclosed on his home, filed for bankruptcy, and as a result, lost friends and almost his marriage. Since then, Ramsey has rebuilt his fortune and now advises people to learn from his mistakes and avoid debt and bankruptcy at all costs. His advice is to spend less than you earn and save 15 percent of the difference. Those who can’t adhere to this financial plan sometimes have to file for bankruptcy. However, this isn’t necessarily bad, as it allows debtors to start over, which is absolutely vital for entrepreneurs. Unique to the United States’ Chapter 7 bankruptcy law is the fact that debtors aren’t bound to a repayment plan. Contrast this with Germany, for example, where a stipulation of bankruptcy is continued employment, or in Scandinavia, where your spending is scrutinized. The American concept of bankruptcy allows both labor and money to be reallocated as quickly as possible, which is crucial for a healthy, entrepreneurial economy. Indeed, compared to European countries where bankruptcy comes with punishing stipulations, the United States has markedly higher entrepreneurial activity. The key message in this book: Failure is natural; not just for you, but for everyone. Only by trying out new things, learning from mistakes and sharing risks and rewards with others can you ensure success. Actionable advice: Play video games.  People may think video games are a waste of time, but the opposite is true. Today’s games are realistic and complex, and have just the right balance of challenges and rewards to allow us to learn from mistakes and keep problem solving.

And how can you attract them to you? Enter the second secret of freelancing: the Master Marketing Formula. This formula will lead you right to your desired clients in five steps. It starts with some list-making. Compile 150 to 200 names of organizations and industries where your skills, experience and knowledge will give you the best chance of attracting clients. It’s vital that you get specific with this. Suppose you’re a freelance marketing consultant who is highly experienced in working for marketing managers in midsize, up-and-coming software firms. This narrowed focus will allow you to determine which potential clients suit your skills best. On to the second step, in which you start generating leads. Start working your way through the list of companies that you’ve drawn up and making contact with those parties. If they seem interested, provide them with additional compelling information. Outline your area of expertise and highlight your previous successes in a way that demonstrates just how suitable you are for their needs. If your lead is genuinely interested, then it’s time to make step three happen: turn them into clients. Provide them with any extra information they request, and give them more. Offer as much help and assistance as you can so they can see how great it would be to work with you. Prospect still with you? If so, let’s move on to the fourth step of this formula. Give your client a quote for your services. If you and the client are happy with the agreed price, then close the sale! And what if you don’t get the job in the end? Follow step five and don’t give up! Instead, stay in contact with the prospect. This way you’ll be the first person they think of when they have a new project and need a freelancer. This formula is a powerful tool for finding the work you want to do. But if you want to open up your options even further, then you might want to put the third secret of successful freelancers into action. What is it? Find out next! As we found out back in the first blink, there are inevitably times when work is scarce. If you want to give yourself the best chance possible of always having a project on your hands, then the third secret is something you should consider: writing a buzz piece.  Usually a short report between five and ten pages long, a buzz piece will help you to position yourself as an expert in your industry. You’ve got a whole range of options when it comes to format: a workbook, checklist, toolkit, how-to guide or a simple list of tips are all great choices. It’s choosing the right topic for your buzz piece that is more of a challenge. Take Dave, for example. As a graphic designer, he put time and effort into a buzz piece that described how to design an effective logo. But after sending it to 350 companies, he didn’t receive the response he was hoping for. In fact, he hardly received a response at all! His structure and content were great, so what was the problem? He’d chosen the wrong topic. Think about it: Who’d be interested in a special report on drafting logos? Other graphic designers. Dave had created a buzz piece that did indeed demonstrate his expertise, but he was addressing his colleagues when he should have been addressing potential clients instead. By changing the topic to choosing the best logo for a business, Dave received a far better response from prospects. Of course, a buzz piece with a great focus is nothing without a great title. All you need is a headline that makes a prospect think something along the lines of “Wow, that sounds interesting, I could really use this information.” The title of Dave’s second buzz piece was “A Five-Step Strategy for Selecting the Perfect Logo Design,” a perfect example of how your title can draw clients in. Put time and effort into a well-focused buzz piece with a title that does it justice and you’ll have something to be proud of. Next time you want to give a prospect your business card, give him a free copy of your buzz piece, too. Finding clients is one hurdle for freelancers, but keeping them is a whole new challenge. With the right strategies, however, maintaining existing client relationships while building new ones will be a breeze. One great strategy that every freelancer should be making use of is the Marketing Effectiveness Matrix. By assessing your MEM, you’ll know exactly which marketing strategies are the best for attracting and maintaining your clients. We can think of marketing as comprised of four quadrants. The first quadrant contains tactics that are highly effective and time efficient. This includes encouraging work with existing clients and direct mailing. The second quadrant entails tactics that are effective, but take a little more time to develop, such as public speaking, networking or e-newsletters. Third quadrant strategies require some effort, but give you little in return most of the time. For example, posting on online job boards or developing a social media presence. The fourth quadrant represents tactics that take up lots of time, but don’t give you much in return – cold calling is a typical example of this. Now that we know which quadrants do what, which should you focus on? That’s right, the ones that give you the best returns. A smart freelancer will therefore use a combination of strategies from quadrants one and two. The way you approach quadrant two depends on your specific area of expertise. Techniques from quadrant one, however, can be applied to any discipline. Every client you gain is an opportunity for repeat business, but only if you treat them right. It’s vital that you develop strong personal relationships with clients. For example, let’s say you’ve started working as a freelance copywriter for a company. Instead of just doing your job and saying goodbye as you flee the office, you could ask to be introduced to other employees, then strike up a few friendships. If you stay in touch with coworkers even after your project together is completed, you’ll be the first person they think of when there’s another project on the horizon. If there’s one thing freelancers complain about, it’s the fact that their jobs are either incredibly busy with lots of work, or exhaustingly slow with every prospect out of reach. Little do they know that this problem is quite simple to solve! The easiest way to avoid those slow periods in your freelance work is by keeping in touch with previous clients. That means both email and phone, so you can maintain your relationship after the project is over. But what if you’ve already dropped out of touch? It’s not too late! You can add them to your monthly e-newsletter, or even just drop them a message that looks a little something like this: “Hi, came across this article recently. Thought you’d find it interesting.” Sent with your business card, it’s a gentle reminder to your client that yes, you do still exist! Encouraging repeat clients isn’t the only way you can minimize the time spent twiddling your thumbs. Another way is to use the Discover, Identify and Position (DIP) Technique to focus your work. Imagine you’re a US freelance photographer of Egyptian descent, and with lots of experience. First, discover your passion. What is it that sets you apart? For you, your Egyptian heritage, love of traveling to that country and strong knowledge of its art and culture. Next, identify the market you could work for. In your case, you might want to focus on companies that offer services and products related to Egyptian culture or history. Finally, think of your position in that market. By looking at what you’ve discovered and identified, you can position yourself as skilled freelancer for importers and exporters of Egyptian goods, Egyptian tourism firms and Egyptian-to-English translation services. With the DIP technique, you won’t have to scramble for work, because you’ll already know exactly where and how to get it! How much is your work worth? That’s a question that scares many solo professionals. Why? Well, as an emerging freelancer it can be very difficult to find an appropriate fee. Charging an hourly rate often seems like the easiest option, but don’t be fooled! There are some significant disadvantages to it. Firstly, clients don’t like it. One freelancing expert even noticed that when he told clients that he charged services per hour, they began speaking faster on the phone immediately! When you bill an hourly rate of, let’s say, $45 per hour, your income is determined by the number of hours you work each week. So if you spend 35 hours per week working on projects for clients, your income will be around $45,000 annually. That’s not bad, but you will never get much better, and you have to consider that you won’t get paid for hours you spend on bookkeeping and marketing. Being a project pricer is far more advantageous. Project pricing means that you provide your client with a fixed price for the project work. One of the benefits of this type of pricing is that your client won’t know the amount of hours you spend on the project, and you won’t have to prepare tedious timesheets for him. You can charge far more for your expertise. This means that as you get better and faster at your job, prices go up, instead of going down as your hours shrink. Who wouldn’t want their commute to work to be as short as walking into the room nextdoor? Working from home is one much-coveted benefit of freelancing. But working at home can make it incredibly hard to concentrate. Luckily, your lack of focus is easily solved with two clever techniques. The first of these is the 50 Minute Focus, which will help you structure your workday as efficiently as possible. The 50 Minute Focus means selecting the project you need to work on for the day, setting an alarm for 50 minutes and getting to work. Don’t check your emails, don’t take a break and don’t let your mind wander. If that sounds hard, remember that you only have to do it for less than an hour. When your timer rings, stop working and do something that lets your mind unplug completely. When you’re ready, do it all over again. One freelance graphic designer and mom found that the 50 Minute Focus took her productivity to a whole new level. She used to spend all day working, getting distracted constantly. But after adopting the process she found she could do all her work in just three 50 minute focused sprints! Another invaluable technique to keep yourself productive is the Jigsaw Puzzle Visual. Picture the tasks on your to-do list as pieces of a larger puzzle. Less urgent tasks are smaller puzzle pieces, while more important ones are larger. As you work on these tasks, keep updating how your pieces fit together. For example, suppose your puzzle has four pieces: your direct-mail campaign, a current client project, a commercial real estate opportunity, and preparing the proposal for an article you want to write. After finding out that your proposal has been accepted, you’ll need to reprioritize your time so that you can spend a few hours each week writing it. Thus the article piece of the puzzle will grow, which means other pieces have to shrink. This technique is incredibly helpful, not just because it keeps you aware of your priorities, but also because it reminds you that using your time productively isn’t about working more. It’s about fitting things into the bigger picture, so that you get things done without burning out! There comes a time in your freelancing career when you spend almost all of your time on work, while your personal life suffers as a result. But it doesn’t have to be this way! If you want to maintain a strong cash flow but also catch a break when you need it, then start thinking about how you can maximize your passive income.  Active income is everything you earn while you work. Passive income is money you can earn in your sleep. Sounds crazy? Let’s look at an example. A scout sells lemonade every hot Sunday afternoon. He earns ten cents for each beverage he sells to his neighbors. But when his mother calls him in for dinner, he has to stop selling. As a result, the dimes – his active income – stop rolling in. Now let’s imagine this scout is clever, and publishes a neat little recipe book on how to brew the perfect lemonade. Assuming the book sells well, this scout can earn money even while he plays football with his friends. That’s the benefit of passive income. Start brainstorming what alternative, passive streams of income you can create from your skills, and you’re on the way to becoming a wealthy freelancer. A very common problem freelancers face when it comes to work–life balance is that the more they earn, the less free time they have. Living and working in the Wealthy Triangle means you’re at the point where you have a) great income, b) freedom to choose the jobs you want, and c) the flexibility of a real freelancer. By following all the steps in these blinks, you’ll reach your maximum earning potential. Then compare this with how much you need to enjoy your life. Earn that amount as efficiently as you can, and you can then enjoy the free time you’ve worked for! The key message in this book: Be sure of the goals, income and lifestyle you want to have as a freelancer and stay focused on every project, without losing track of future prospects, projects and streams of income.

We dream of starting a business or learning a new language, of losing weight or running a marathon – but, when dreams come banging up against reality, the going can get tough. No matter how driven we are, there will always be roadblocks on the path to success. It can be hard to stay motivated, to break bad habits, to find an effective routine. Sheer determination doesn’t always cut it. Luckily, these blinks explain how behavioral science can help you overcome common obstacles. They’ll guide you through a seven-point framework that’ll lead you, one small step at a time, to the achievement of major goals. In these blinks, you’ll learn why chasing a monetary reward makes you less likely to persevere; why you shouldn’t obsessively count calories; and why strangers are more helpful than you’d think. Have you ever made a potentially life-changing New Year’s resolution – to quit smoking, for example, or to start running every morning – only to find that, come February, you’ve forgotten all about it? It’s an all-too-common situation. But why do we have such difficulty persevering our big plans? Well, we tend to think that we’ll pursue our aims with focus and thought, but the reality is that our minds are not always in a thoughtful and focused state. Distractions and temptations are constant, and, more often than not, we succumb to them. Let’s say you’ve resolved to follow a diet that entails counting and controlling your calorie intake, day in, day out. Naturally, this requires a lot of focus – a level of focus that’s almost impossible to keep up. People face countless mental demands daily, from the pressures of a tough day at work to the stresses of raising children, so it’s no surprise that many dieters will, at some point, lose focus, give in to temptation and sneak in a snack. So what can we do to stay on track and stick to our goals? Behavioral science has some surprisingly simple answers. We can, for example, make use of the nudge theory, which suggests that small changes, when subtly encouraged, can lead to big results. Maybe you set your watch two minutes early to help keep yourself punctual. Or maybe you’ve joined a running group, harnessing sociability to stay motivated with exercise. That’s nudge theory in action. Nudge theory often makes use of social norms – patterns in our peers’ behavior that we feel compelled to imitate. For instance, one project, conducted by the UK government, tested the impact of social norms by adding a single line to the end of letters sent to citizens with outstanding tax debts: “most people with a debt like yours have paid it by now.” The result? Because people thought prompt payment was the expected behavior, they paid up quickly, generating hundreds of millions of pounds in taxes paid. In total, behavioral science offers seven steps for nudging yourself toward happiness and achievement. And you’ll learn them all in the following blinks. We all think we know what will make us happy. We set ourselves goals and assume we’ll be happier when we’ve achieved them. Maybe your goal is to buy a house or attract a million views on YouTube – but one thing is for sure: there’s a good chance the goal is the wrong one. It’s either unrealistic or won’t really make us happy. That’s why setting the right goals is the first step to nudging your behavior in the right direction. What you shouldn’t do is stake your happiness on gaining material possessions. Studies show that experiences like holidays or days out are much more likely to improve happiness levels. In fact, according to research on happiness, the five top factors that consistently improve well-being are social relationships, health and activity, generosity, learning new things and building curiosity or mindfulness. You’ll notice that material possessions are not on that list. Evidence of this can be seen in a study of people who received a $5,000 bonus. The recipients who spent the money on gifts for friends or family, or who made a charitable donation – that is, those who embraced generosity and social relationships – were happier than those who spent the cash on themselves. So it’s important to pursue the right goals, so you don’t strive for something that won’t make you happy. But remember: those goals must also be achievable. A great way to increase achievability is to set yourself a single goal. That way, you can focus on it and it alone. This was evidenced in a study of people trying to save money in India. The study compared those with one goal, such as funding a child’s education, and those with several, such as saving for education, health care and retirement. The savers with multiple goals were able to save 6 percent of their income, while those with a single focus managed almost 11 percent. Once you’ve chosen a single goal to achieve, you should turn that goal into an unambiguous target, with a fixed deadline. Let's say you want to lose weight. Studies show that setting an unambiguous, measurable target – such as “lose 5 pounds by Easter” – always drives better results than a generic, general goal such as “lose some weight this year.” Imagine you’re on a strict diet. You’re constantly googling where avocados sit on the glycemic index, noting down the calories in your chicken salad (no dressing) and adding up your daily intake. Well, you’d be making a common mistake – because your diet would be far too complex. Humans love simplicity, which is why many people on complex diets eventually say, “Screw it!” and go back to bingeing on ice cream. In fact, researchers have found that “rule complexity” is the main thing that leads people to drop a diet. In general, the easier it is to follow the rules, the easier it is to stick to them. For diets, you could try the 5:2 method, where you count calories two days per week and eat normally the other five. It really doesn’t matter what goal you’re pursuing. If it requires a sustained effort over time, you should make the rules for getting there as simple as possible. In addition to simplifying the rules, you should embrace habits as the powerful drivers of behavior that they are. For example, take one study in which cinemagoers were given old, stale popcorn to eat. Those who rarely bought popcorn tended not to eat much of the unappealing treat. But those with a popcorn habit ate just as much as they normally would have, despite the unpleasant taste. Why? Because being in the cinema triggered an ingrained behavior – snacking. To use habits to improve your life, start by identifying the things that trigger your own bad habits. Once you’ve identified these triggers, try to cut them out of your life. So if you want to quit smoking and only smoke when you drink, maybe cut back on the alcohol for a while. Then form new, positive habits by repeating behavior in particular circumstances. Let’s say you’re trying to write a book. Every morning, right after your alarm goes off, you could write for 45 minutes. It might be hard at first, but if you do it every morning, your alarm will begin to trigger the habit, and writing will simply become part of waking up. Ever made a commitment for the future – say, to train for a marathon – only to find that, when the time comes, you’d rather watch TV than go running in the rain? Here’s a good trick to keep you committed: we’re more likely to follow through on things that we’ve publicly committed to doing. Humans are very aware of the expectations of others. Commit privately to running a marathon, and no one can judge you for that Saturday spent on the sofa. Commit publicly, and social expectations come into play. This is illustrated by the fact that couples that marry in secret are 12 times more likely to get divorced than couples whose wedding was attended by hundreds of guests. Research consistently finds that committing in front of friends and family strengthens your motivation. If you want to go one step further, appoint a commitment referee to keep you focused. A commitment referee is someone who monitors your progress toward a given goal and decides whether you’ve achieved it. Research has found that people with a referee are 70 percent more likely to achieve their goal than those without one. When one of the authors, Rory Gallagher, wanted to go to the gym more, he committed to doing so in front of his colleagues and appointed his coauthor, Owain Service, as his referee. Fear of Service declaring his failure to their coworkers quickly resulted in Gallagher’s making the gym part of his routine. But you should be careful when choosing a referee. For instance, don’t appoint your romantic partner, who may well be far too lenient with the rules. A trusted coworker, or one of your tougher friends, is a better choice. Most of us incentivize certain behaviors by promising rewards. Parents, for instance, may allow their children a certain amount of TV time as a reward for finished homework. But how can you tell whether your incentives will actually work? It’s certainly the case that certain rewards, particularly financial rewards, can backfire. In fact, if you’re already motivated to achieve something, the introduction of a financial reward might even weaken your resolve. A famous study of blood donors illustrates this. Surprisingly enough, introducing a small cash reward for donations reduced donation levels. A weak motivator – a little cash – displaced donors’ more powerful motivation: a sense of moral duty to donate. So it’s important to set effective incentives. But how can you do this? Behavioral-science studies show that it’s best to put something valuable at stake. This was seen in an anti-smoking program. To participate in the program, the aspiring quitters had to deposit a substantial amount of money in a bank account, knowing that they would lose it – all of it – if they smoked a single cigarette. And it worked. Not only were participants 30 percent more likely to quit; a follow up one year after the program, and after they’d gotten their money back, found that they were still more likely to be non-smokers. This study highlights four key principles for effective incentive systems. First, rewards must be explicitly linked to meeting a target. Second, they must be substantial. Third, a reward must be binding, so you know you’ll get it. Finally – and this one is both counterintuitive and absolutely crucial – people would rather not lose something than gain something. For example, the loss of $200 feels worse than the gain of $200 feels pleasant. In short, fear of loss is a better incentive than hope of gain, as those former smokers discovered. In general, if you want to incentivize yourself, the key is to enforce, rather than replace, your personal motivation for achieving your goals. We often keep our goals private. After all, they’re personal. But, as the adage goes, “a problem shared is a problem halved,” and the same goes for the burden of attaining your goals. Asking for help is a simple but powerful tool. People are often more willing to help than we’d think, even if there’s not much in it for them. Imagine you’re in a big city. Your phone is dead, but you need to call a friend. So you approach a complete stranger and ask to borrow her phone. How likely do you think that person is to say yes? According to one study, most people predicted that only 30 percent of strangers would help. But, in reality, 50 percent of all strangers were perfectly happy to share their phone. Humans have a natural desire to help – and if complete strangers will often lend a hand, just think of how much support your family and friends may be willing to give! Working with others, instead of alone, is a powerful motivational tool. It not only helps us stick to our goals; it also pushes us to go further. Researchers explored this effect by testing gym-goers. The control group worked out alone, while the test group enjoyed the company of a virtual buddy over Skype. But here’s the kicker: the digital buddy was actually a looped video. Nonetheless, those exercising with an untiring buddy exercised far longer, motivated to keep up with their digital friend. A similar study looked at the topic of saving up money. When savers teamed up with other savers – to share their goals and monitor each other’s progress – saving rates doubled. Humans are fundamentally social animals. We want to help each other out, and we’re motivated to go the extra mile when with others. Embrace this, tap into your social networks and see where it can take you. If you’ve ever worked toward a big goal, you’ve probably felt a little lost at some point. Should you have improved your running times by now? Have you written enough job applications? The best way to track your progress is through clear feedback. Feedback not only keeps you motivated; it lets you know where you are in relation to your goal. Anyone who played the game “hot or cold” as a child knows the power of feedback. Eyes closed, searching for some object, you’re led by a bystander who says, “cold, cold, getting colder!” or “warm, hot, hotter!” as you stray further from or draw closer to your prize. This feedback on your position nudges you toward the goal. It’s crucial to get feedback like this, no matter the goal. So, if you’re training for a marathon, you could download an app to track every training run. Once you know that your 10K time is developing behind schedule, you can take action to remedy it. This approach can be a little trickier with other goals – say, finding a new job – but it’s by no means useless: if you’ve gotten fewer interviews than expected, reflect on the number or quality of your applications. You can make this feedback even more powerful by introducing a comparison with others. We’ve already seen that humans have a natural desire to conform to social expectations and to compete with others. Well, the authors used this knowledge to create a feedback experiment of their own. In an attempt to battle the overprescription of antibiotics, they wrote letters to doctors who fell within the top 20 percent of antibiotic prescribers. Each letter said, in short, that the vast majority of other practices prescribed fewer antibiotics. Like the rest of us, doctors want to be in sync with social norms – and the feedback led to over 70,000 fewer antibiotics being given out. So feedback nudges us in the right direction In the last blink, we’ll look at the final technique for sticking to your goals. When we’re striving to achieve something, we often fall into the same old routines, such as intending, but regularly failing, to go to the gym after work. We could all be a little more critical about which approaches actually work. Studies show that successful people commonly engage in focused practice. A study of children in spelling bees demonstrated this. It compared practice methods, such as playing fun word games, being quizzed by parents and, finally, focused practice – that is, the unexciting, slow, solitary study of words. The study found that the children who invested time in this last method were much more likely to succeed in the competition. In general, however, you won’t know what approach will work until you experiment. For example, the authors tested eight different web pages, all encouraging people to register for organ donation. One approach included a photo of a group of smiling people and a message stating that, every day, thousands of people who see the page decide to register. They thought it would be successful, but, actually, it decreased registrations. The generic photo seemed to depersonalize things. The most effective web page simply read, “If you needed an organ transplant would you have one? If so, please help others.” The example shows that we can’t predict what will work best until we test it. So, if you’re trying to exercise more, try jogging before work for one month, and after work the next month. Which works for you? Or, if you’re trying to save money, save a fixed sum for a few months, and then try saving by avoiding expenditure (for instance, don’t buy coffee every morning). Being open and flexible will help you find the best approach. Understanding the small details of the way we think and act can help us achieve big things. From setting clear goals to getting feedback on your progress, remember that small tweaks to your behavior and mindset can take you a long way. If you think small, you may well achieve big. The key message in this book: If you’re aiming for big things, you’ll find it easier to succeed if you get the small details right. Behavioral science teaches us many things about how humans think and act, from our desire to meet other people’s expectations to the way we develop habits. Understanding and embracing this will help you take small steps that make a big difference – like setting clear rules that are easy to follow, making your commitments public and creating incentives that really work.  Actionable advice: Turn an intention into an action by stating the when, how and where. Do you sometimes struggle to follow through on your intentions? Next time you commit to do something, create an actionable plan for yourself. Don’t just say, “I’m going to go running tomorrow morning.” Instead, say, “Okay, after the alarm goes off, I’ll get up and go for a 5K run in the park, then I’ll come home for breakfast.” Even if it’s just in your head, planning how, when and where you will do something – turning it into a concrete plan – is surprisingly effective at driving action.

Whether it’s making hasty decisions that you regret just a few minutes later, or blocking all the good ideas out, sometimes it feels like our minds are working against us! Well, thankfully it’s not that extreme. Most of our mind’s evil tricks can be controlled and turned into advantages – after all, if other people have the same tripwires, knowing how to overcome yours can be the key to understanding those around you. Thinking inside the box is a problem that almost everyone struggles with. It’s a cliché that springs from corporate culture in the 1960s and 1970s, but it refers to real phenomena in our minds. These blinks explain what it means to think inside the box and gives a simple and straightforward step-by-step approach to busting out of it. In these blinks, you’ll discover how to avoid tunnel vision; why we’ll have to re-think our image of the world as round; and how pens almost killed Bic. How many times have you been asked to “think outside the box”? While this sage advice has been around for almost half a century, it’s much easier said than done. In part, this is because of the way we think. Mental models – or “boxes” – enable us to process and make sense of our complex reality. Our mind is constantly developing simplified models of the world, sorting information into categories and patterns while also developing more sophisticated constructions like rules and paradigms. Without these models, we would lose our ability to think efficiently. In fact, it’s impossible to reason without boxes – that’s just how our brain works. If you live in Germany, for example, you’ve learned to associate light beige cars with taxis, i.e., you’ve created a “box” for taxis. While you know that not all vehicles of that color will offer you a ride, you can nonetheless rule out numerous non-taxi cars in your search for a ride from point A to point B. If you travel to New York City, however, you won’t linger in a boxless void for long. Almost instantly, you will develop a new box based on the new information from your environment, and thus keep a keen eye out for a yellow car if you need a lift. See, there isn’t just “the box.” Rather, there are multiple boxes, all of which are shaped by your identity – and your identity’s like a series of boxes, too. You can be comprised of an infinite combination of identities – for example, an IT specialist, an Australian, a woman and so on – and thus there is an infinite number of boxes outside your specific worldview. Boxes are the buttress for our capacity to think; you can’t avoid them. Once you step out of one, you’ll simply find yourself in another. So if leaving one box simply means entering another, how can you ever “think outside the box”? Well, you don’t. Rather, innovation requires you to develop entirely new boxes. If you don’t develop new boxes, you run the risk of suffering the damaging side effects of established boxes: tunnel vision. Tunnel vision occurs when you lose the awareness that your individual perception of the world is merely an interpretation based on a subjective sample of information. After all, it’s your perception – you can’t have anyone else’s. What you perceive is not some objective reality, nor is it even the best guess at what an interpretation of our complex reality should look like, and believing your box is the right one constrains the realm of the thinkable. For example, just think about how long it took people to accept the idea that, despite their subjective inference that the Earth was flat, it’s actually spherical. And in 2011, our understanding of Earth as a round globe was once again dethroned, this time by a more potato-shaped model. And that model will also need to be adapted as rotation and gravity change the landscape of the Earth. This tunnel vision can be severely damaging for creative thinking. Just look at Bic, a company that up to the 1970s defined itself as a manufacturer of plastic ballpoint pens. But defining themselves in terms of ballpoint pens was too constricting: their only opportunities for innovation were limited to different colors and designs! If we can overcome tunnel vision, we can create new boxes that offer a range of fresh possibilities. Replacing the “flat Earth” box with the “globe” box meant that people believed it was impossible to fall off the Earth, thus giving them the confidence to sail all around the world and explore other continents. And when Bic altered its self-perception from a pen producer to a plastic products producer, it was suddenly able to branch out into a wider array of products from lighters to razors and even cell phones. So how can we break free from conventional thinking and build new boxes? The following blinks hold the answer. If your “train of thought” were an actual train, would you be a passenger or the conductor? Developing an awareness of boxes and the limitations they place on our thinking is the first step to getting into the engine room and taking control. Start with the simple understanding that sticking to the familiar will always feel right. The human mind tends to cling to its existing set of boxes, unconsciously accepting information that confirms our worldviews and discarding contradictory information. This, of course, makes it difficult to adjust our perspective. For example, when Dick Fosbury set a new Olympic record for the high jump in 1968, he was ridiculed for his unconventional technique. Although jumping backward enabled him to jump higher than anybody else, people simply felt he was doing it wrong. Guess what: Since 1976 no one has won a gold medal in high jump without using the appropriately named Fosbury Flop! Second, realize that the human mind has an unreliable default setting. We’re all routinely fooled by a phenomenon called cognitive bias, i.e., the subconscious programming that causes us to favor simple intuition at the expense of objective analysis. As a consequence, we make logical errors and often miscalculate probability, value or risk. To illustrate this, imagine a frozen pond in winter. Most people would feel more secure skating on the ice if they could see others out there doing the same. Yet their intuition couldn’t be more wrong: it’s less risky to skate alone, without the additional weight. Furthermore, as research in behavioral economics has shown, cognitive biases also affect our financial and business decisions. Investors, for example, tend to hold on to stocks even after they’ve fallen below acquisition price rather than to recognize the loss and cut ties with a losing stock. As we’ve seen, boxes simultaneously enable and constrain our thinking. But once you are aware that all our subjective and collective models of the world, i.e., our boxes, are necessarily incomplete, you can then examine your own boxes. Recognizing and challenging your boxes is the key to creating new ones. Ask yourself and your colleagues about key values, objectives, hopes and fears in order to identify which boxes you’re stuck in and which beliefs and assumptions might be holding you back. There are no “right” or “wrong” boxes. Rather, you must ask yourself: Will this box still be useful tomorrow? For decades, it was understood that male teenagers and young adults were the target market for video games. No one questioned this assumption. After all, why change a winning concept? Well, because a game company could easily triple their customer base by including other demographics such as women, senior citizens and preschoolers, that’s why! But if video game companies aren’t aware of this box, then they can’t transcend its limitations. Even when innovators do create new boxes, these new paradigms won’t last for eternity. Say, for example, that a video game company has successfully tapped into new target groups, such as women and toddlers. Good job! However, in the meantime, the company’s most loyal customers, the male adolescents, have changed: they’ve grown up. What do they want to play now? Answering this question will require a new box. Never forget that even the greatest new idea is destined to become obsolete one day. No matter how thoroughly and deliberately you develop your boxes, you will always have to come back to square one and start all over again. The world won’t stop changing, and we must constantly adapt our mental models of it to keep or even set the pace. The idea that great innovations come from geniuses who find inspiration from within is romantic, but bogus. As we’ve seen, we’re unlikely to come up with any game-changing ideas if we just let our minds run on autopilot. For this reason, we need to be diligent in gathering information to remove the blinders imposed by your old boxes. The authors identify areas where we need to gather information: the global environment (society, economics, science, etc.); your industry, field or area (customers, competitors and so on); and your company, team or context (things like products and organization). The goal of this step is to generate questions, not find answers. To illustrate this process, let’s take another look at the video game industry, this time following the fictional company Ultragames. Concerning global trends, Ultragames is affected by an aging consumer base along with the evolution of the internet and mobile technology. The company always operated under the assumption that gamers were predominantly male teenagers and young men, yet after investigating new data on their industry, they’ve discovered that the average gamer’s age has risen to 37 and that women now comprise 42 percent of the industry’s customer base. Then, to gather data in the company sphere, Ultragames conducts a survey on its products. It reveals that the emerging adult gamer demographic is less concerned with price, and more interested in Ultragames’ “no sex, no violence” policy, as it makes it easy to find and purchase games for their kids. Now that they’ve got the data, it’s time to develop some questions. One such question Ultragames might ask after pondering this new information is: How can we develop products that appeal to all ages without compromising our family-friendly values? Imagine you’re a gold digger in Yukon in the nineteenth century. You wouldn’t expect to find a nugget in your first 30 pans of sand, would you? The reality is that you’ll be standing over the water for a long time before you catch gold. The same goes for finding innovative ideas. At this stage, your objective is to come up with a wide range of possible new boxes. It’s important not to limit your creativity by discarding ideas before they have a chance to develop. Go into this exercise with the assumption that there are no such things as bad ideas, and encourage your team to look at your problem from all possible angles, even if they might seem crazy or far-fetched. For example, when NASA was trying to develop a way to land on alien planets with minimal contamination from terrestrial chemicals, they surely didn’t envision their multi-billion dollar spacecraft landing on the planet by bouncing around in a shell made of airbags. Yet that’s how Pathfinder ended up landing on Mars in 1997. Once you have a sizeable collection of ideas, it’s time to evaluate them using clearly defined criteria. Your assessments should never be made on intuition, but rather by means of a methodology that prevents the cognitive biases that limit your imagination. But which criteria should you use? Some, such as budget constraints, technological feasibility or government regulations, are relevant for all businesses. Others are more individual, like your brand image, your areas of expertise, the targeted timeframe, and so on. Ultragames, for example, might feel that developing individual games for each new market segment is too costly. They need an idea that would satisfy their financial criteria and also compliment their family-friendly corporate identity, such as educational games for all ages. You may have to repeat these two steps several times before you hit gold. Once you have, remember that you should doubt even your winning ideas! Now that you’ve learned how to break free from confining boxes, our final blinks will show you how to create the most innovative ideas for your business. Imagine your business as a house of cards: if you want to remodel, your mental programming limits you to only working on the upper floor for fear that the whole house will come crumbling down. This comes at the expense of radical transformation, as you are not able to touch the foundations upon which your company was built. But it is in challenging the most fundamental aspects of your business that you find the most creative potential. Think back to Bic’s defining moment. They could have created more superficial boxes, for example, by manufacturing all kinds of pens instead of just ballpoint, or even plastic office supplies. Instead, they went for an even bigger box: any disposable plastic item. Other companies have made similarly grand transformations by creating new, big boxes. Nintendo, for example, made playing cards before switching to video consoles, and LG evolved from an industrial chemical producer to a manufacturer of high-tech appliances. When you dare to fundamentally shift your perception, it unleashes a cascade of new ideas, and you’ll discover that each box is a box within a box within a box. For example, Bic’s new concept contains all the boxes we mentioned previously (pens and plastic office supplies), including its original product. Once they created a new big box that defined who they were as a company, they could fill it with medium-sized boxes, and fill those with smaller ones, thus generating a whole range of new products. Similarly, Nintendo’s shift in self-perception opened the door to video game production, merchandising and even a movie. Thinking big isn’t easy when it comes to building new boxes. Nevertheless, if you can create big enough boxes, you will significantly broaden your scope of possibilities. What’s the difference between companies that get left behind by revolutionary changes and those that profit from or even spearhead them? In short: Their ability to change boxes in real time. Long term success in business requires you to keep your mind open to many possible futures. Beware of the ever-lurking trap of tunnel vision: all too often, we plan for one vision of the future – one that is likely based on our present understanding. In other words, we use predictive thinking to prepare for the future. We should, in contrast, employ prospective thinking, which asks: What could happen? What could I make happen? By imagining multiple possible scenarios, your business can stay flexible and well prepared with not only a plan A, but also plans B and C. When planning for the future, there are two kinds of reasoning available: deduction and induction. With deduction, we take an existing box and sort information into it. For example, you might ask: “What are the most important trends that will affect our industry?” The problem with this type of reasoning is that the range of possible answers is limited, and focuses too much on what is presently known. Induction, in contrast, works the other way around: you take information and try to find a box for it. Inductive thinking asks questions that have an unlimited set of answers, inspiring creativity by moving away from commonly shared associations. For example, you might ask: “How could scenario XY become the most important trend affecting our industry in the future?” This approach allows you to discover opportunities other competitors simply don’t have on their radars, i.e., truly innovative approaches. As an example, consider that executives from the high-quality glass industry would likely agree that developing screens for mobile communication devices would be among the most important market innovations in the foreseeable future. But wouldn’t it be better to start a technological revolution while everyone else is competing for a piece of that pie? Like developing materials that make glass obsolete? Or something entirely different? The key message in this book: It’s exceedingly difficult to see beyond our own limited perspective. But we’ll have to if we want to think creatively. To stimulate creative thinking, we must constantly challenge our worldview – the “boxes” that encapsulate what we believe to be possible – and apply methods that keep our subconscious from sabotaging us.  Actionable advice: Dare to err!  A fear of failure will limit you to only obtaining the low-hanging fruit – the safe, obvious and ordinary ideas. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes! It’s the only way you can break out of your current, confining boxes and develop new ones that inspire innovation!

This commercial savvy has often been presented in a negative light; however, in spite of these goyish aspersions, the ability to produce wealth that’s often ascribed to Jewish people is now generally recognized as a positive and enviable attribute. But why have Jews become successful in business and how can it serve as inspiration for others? Jewish prosperity in business is rooted in the books and oral history that make up the Jewish religious canon. In combination with Jewish traditions, the Torah, Talmud and other sources have inspired and guided Jews for millennia. These blinks reveal how you – or anyone who wants to succeed in business – can draw inspiration from these sources as well. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a minyan is a good way to make business connections; that a good leader must first be able to follow; and what the Star of David teaches us about change. If you’re familiar with Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, you know that the Jewish character of Shylock is portrayed as a greedy and vengeful loan shark who’s only interested in money. Unfortunately, this derogatory portrayal of the Jewish businessman has persisted. In addition to this negative image, there are many false theories about why Jews have tended to have business success. One absurd theory suggests that Jews evolved in such a way that moneymaking is simply part of their DNA. Jews have survived countless periods of persecution, so it’s been suggested that only wealthy Jews survived these ordeals since they could buy their way out. Therefore, the future generations of Jews were born with a so-called “money gene.” Another nasty theory is that all Jews are cheaters. However, this enduring myth is refuted by the Torah, the holy book that defines Jewish law. It specifically calls for people to maintain an honest reputation when doing business. Any instances of cheating would be a direct offense against God. Then there’s the conspiracy theory that Jews are part of some secret society. While it’s true that community is an important part of Jewish life, Jews also tend to be very argumentative, so it’s ridiculous to think they could keep some secret organization together and under wraps. People also often think of Jews as possessing superior intelligence. But intelligence generally doesn’t increase monetary gain since people with higher IQs tend to become academics and scientists, not business leaders. When Jewish people do become successful, it’s because they’ve received a good education at home and in the synagogue. A Jewish home is often filled with books, and the centrality of education in Jewish life is why Jews throughout history have had high literacy rates. This is also why, even though Jews only comprise 0.2 percent of the world’s population, there is a disproportionately large number of books published every year concerning Jewish themes. In addition to the Torah’s teachings, there are also oral traditions that continue to be passed down. A common lesson is to sacrifice present pleasures for future benefits – a reminder that putting in hard work today may well lead to a successful business tomorrow. It’s not uncommon for corporations and businesses to be demonized by politicians and the media. And this can turn people’s attention away from the job creation and the charitable work that comes from the private sector. On a more personal level, a healthy business venture can also make people feel better about themselves. It’s not unlike someone being part of a clinical trial and being given a placebo: the patient often ends up feeling better just by being part of the program. The same can happen when someone is part of a noble business pursuit. Due to the teachings of the Torah, Jews will apply this kind of morality to doing business and earning money. Jewish wisdom teaches us that success only comes if the business has the approval of our friends; it’s this approval that creates the passion and drive behind the endeavor. We’re also urged to be virtuous and ethical. When we see ourselves as morally upright, running our business in an honest and ethical fashion, we’re less likely to enter illegal or immoral territory. Of course, if someone gets away with cheating, they’ll probably be tempted to cheat again. However, this can be prevented by atonement. Atonement – being “at one” with God – is an important part of Judaism. By atoning, one can “reset” after committing a bad deed. But to reset one has first to learn from what one did wrong and diminish the temptation to repeat the behavior. Here’s a little-known fact: Jews joined the banking profession in an effort to perform a noble service and help others. Jewish tradition views lending money, as opposed to giving money away, as a charitable act. By lending, others can start their own business and retain their independence and dignity in the process. This goes against another misconception: that Jews became bankers to escape oppression. Christians and Muslims tend to subscribe to a literal interpretation of the Bible that prohibits charging interest. But the oral traditions that were passed down – the Jewish laws that were not written in the Torah – taught Jews that there were moral circumstances that permit charging interest. Now that you know some of the noble reasons for getting into business, let’s take a look at how tradition can lead to successful business relationships. In a traditional Jewish workplace, coworkers are not unlike friends and family. But for these kinds of relationships to develop, they have to be genuine. People can sense false intentions, so it won’t work if a friendly environment is forced. You might think of friends and family as being separate from business, but they can actually be a good source of inspiration. For Richard Simon, his personal relationships lead to him becoming a pillar of the publishing world. As a child, Simon saw how much his grandmother and her friend loved doing the Sunday crossword puzzle together. But they would always finish it by Tuesday, which left them with four puzzleless days. Sensing a market for a book full of puzzles, Simon took the idea to his friend Lincoln Schuster, and, before, long the publishing giant Simon and Schuster was born. The communal nature of traditional Jewish life also provides a helpful network of connections. Traditional Jewish prayer requires a quorum of ten men called a minyan; every synagogue in every city has one. So whenever a Jewish businessman is traveling, he can join a minyan and find a number of opportunities to form new relationships. And since this kind of network is always growing and evolving, there are always new possibilities. There are also teachings that can help form successful new relationships by allowing people to better understand themselves and how others perceive them. Once we clearly understand how others see us, we can change things about ourselves that might be hindering a successful relationship. These lessons about self-change are taught by Mussar, a body of ancient Jewish literature. In this context, “change” doesn’t simply mean changing how you appear; it also means changing who you really are. And with this understanding, relationships can take on a deeper, even spiritual, meaning. Are you a perfectionist? Do you end up working longer and harder than others because you’re never satisfied until things are absolutely flawless? Well, trying to be perfect is a fool’s errand because, in fact, nothing is perfect – especially when it comes to business. There is a Jewish belief called “ethical capitalism,” which reminds us that people are taught the ways of business by others and that this, in turn, can lead to corruption. It also reminds us that it’s wrong to blame capitalism for the mistakes of a few capitalists. It helps to look at business as an inanimate object. You can’t blame an object for causing problems; you can only blame the people who misuse it. Bernie Madoff is a perfect example. His Ponzi scheme cheated people out of millions of dollars by means of fraud and false trust. So we must hold Madoff accountable, rather than blaming capitalism. Being moral in your business practices is a challenge since most actions can have both good and bad effects. When we look at the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and the railroad tycoon George Pullman, we see two people who improved society at a great cost to others. Carnegie is considered to be one of the biggest robber barons of the nineteenth century. And though Pullman pioneered US railway expansion, he exploited his workers by charging them higher rates for housing and food. Some workers for the Pullman Company owed more than they ever earned. But business, though far from perfect, doesn’t have to be evil, and there are Jewish traditions that show how one can work morally within the business system. They say business is driven by greed. But Jews are taught that you must provide for yourself before you can help others. By turning people into customers, business is considered dehumanizing. But Jewish tradition offers a different perspective: business emulates God’s creativity by being a source of growth and inventiveness. Business is also sometimes blamed for creating inequality. However, without business, there would be no wealth to sustain the economy. And it’s the government – not business – that’s responsible for just redistribution of this wealth. What comes to mind when you think of a great leader? There have been many great leaders over the years, and Jewish tradition shows us that there are certain characteristics that they all share. One of these characteristics is the ability to follow. Leaders often are, or were, followers. Even Moses, one of history’s greatest leaders, had a mentor: God. Leaders also have a vision and a goal, and they are persuasive in telling people how they’ll achieve it. God’s vision was the world we see before us, and his goal was the Sabbath. That’s why Jews celebrate the Sabbath every Friday night. And leaders aren’t afraid of necessary confrontation. The necessity of confrontation is driven home by the tale of Joseph. Joseph’s brothers, envious of the favor shown him by their father, plotted to kill Joseph. One of these brothers, Judah, instead of confronting his brothers, compromised and suggested they sell Joseph into slavery. This cost Judah his role as leader. If he had stood up to his brothers, it’s likely they would have listened to him and never attempted to kill or enslave Joseph. Leaders also use the power of faith. The power of faith can come in different forms. The most obvious is perhaps daily prayer. Less obvious is the ability to have faith in oneself and to instill that personal faith in others so that goals are achieved. And leaders carry themselves with a respectful presence. There’s a reason the Talmud, an ancient collection of rabbinical doctrines, calls the lion the “King of Beasts.” It’s not the biggest or strongest animal, but it earns its respect through its regal posture and careful movements. Another thing to consider is that there is no single definition of a leader, and that they fill many roles: guiding people through change, being an inspiring role model or helping people develop, for example. More often than not, people don’t become leaders by learning these skills; the role is thrust upon them under extraordinary circumstances. Many believe that New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani would never have been considered a notable leader if it hadn’t been for the chaotic and tumultuous events of 9/11. But this event brought out the leader in Giuliani, and he did an able job of guiding the city out of crisis. Many people fear change. Yet, as we grow older, we’re always learning and changing, even if we’re not aware of it. Judaism teaches us to embrace the fact that all humans are unique and that they continue to change throughout their lives. Once we learn to accept this change, we can then learn to profit from it. The Star of David provides clues for us to follow. The star is comprised of two triangles. The three points of one triangle represent three fixed entities – God, humans and the physical world. The other triangle’s points represent openness to change. Change, though often initially painful, is beneficial in the long run. Some companies go out of business when faced with change. For example, many companies went under when steel replaced cast iron as a construction material in the nineteenth century. But for those that hung on, innovations were soon introduced that allowed them to switch over to the new material, get rid of expensive equipment and retrain or replace employees. In the end, the change brought profits that outweighed the initial loss. Judaism shows us that change is easier to accept when it arrives gradually, which is why events that honor a marriage or a death take place over several days. Moving forward is a matter of staying connected to the parts of your life that will never change and remaining open to the things that should or have to change. This applies to successful business, too. Stay rooted to the company’s core values and mission statement, but don’t close yourself off to other opportunities. Disney does this well. It maintains a commitment to wholesome family entertainment, but that doesn’t stop it from buying other companies like Miramax to produce more adult-oriented fare. But be sure that you’ve actually set your roots in the company, and not, for instance, in capital from investors. Here’s a cautionary tale: there was once a successful family of jewelers in Montreal, and, in the late 1990s, the sons moved the business to Los Angeles to take advantage of the dot-com boom. The economy soon tanked and the jewelry business started losing money. This prompted the sons to move the business back to Montreal, to their roots, and, sure enough, success returned when they did. People also fear the uncertainty of the future. However, you can minimize uncertainty by making accurate predictions – something that’s not really that hard to do. The Talmud is explicit about how the wise are different from the prophetic: While a prophet can look into the future, the wise can look at today’s events and see what consequences they’ll have tomorrow. You don’t have to be a genius to see what the future has in store. You can actually train yourself to figure it out, but, to do that well, you must keep your ego and ambitions out of the equation. Ego can obscure the obvious. For instance, the crucial difference between Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill, two of history’s most intelligent British politicians, is that Chamberlain’s ego prevented him from seeing Hitler for who he really was. Churchill’s sight, on the other hand, remained unclouded by ego and ambition. To make an accurate forecast, you don’t need to become an expert on every business trend in the world – just the ones that directly affect your business. So, if you work for a tech company, stay informed on regulations that might change how people use the internet. And if you’re in the auto industry, pay attention to trade regulations, which might change the price of materials. Foreseeing the future comes from careful interpretation of both the present and the past. Generally, a steady and stable economy will stay that way unless an outside force brings change. The price of gold, for example, usually remains steady when inflation and civil unrest are at a minimum. However, investors recently noticed that gold prices were remaining stable despite inflation, which is when they realized that Russia was selling off its reserves to counteract inflation and keep investors buying. When Russia stopped interfering, the price of gold went up as predicted. Other things to keep an eye on are patterns and trends. These can be especially helpful in industries like fashion, where trends can help predict what will sell next year. The old adage that \"time is money\" is certainly true. However, there’s more to the equation than that. In the Talmud’s story of Joseph, we also learn that we are money and that money is part of us; it’s impossible to separate the two. Everything we possess – time, dignity, persistence, creativity energy – can be quantified in terms of money. And once we accept this notion, we can move forward and have a healthier relationship with money. Money can also create a bond of trust. This happens every time someone receives a check after performing a service. Money serves as a symbol of reputation as well. For instance, Ford paid nine billion dollars to purchase Jaguar and Volvo not because the companies’ assets were worth that much. Ford was buying their reputations. One of the Jewish terms for money is “zuz,” which, in English, means “to move.” Therefore, money is something that naturally moves between people; when it doesn’t, economies can go into recession or fall apart completely. So money isn’t meant to be kept hidden away or stashed under a mattress. It’s far better to follow Jewish wisdom and use that money for charitable purposes, which can spark the creation of even more wealth. Jewish tradition holds that giving money to charity is more spiritually beneficial to the giver than to the receiver. There’s no rational explanation for this – it’s just the right thing to do. The United States even bases its tax laws on this principle, which is why donations to religious and charitable foundations are not taxed. In fact, one of the best ways to increase your income is to give your money away. No one likes doing business with someone who seems desperate to cling to every penny. It’s better to have a reputation as a giver since most people want to be involved with charitable causes. But remember: though charitableness can come with rewards, you should mainly give because it’s the moral thing to do. Here’s another apt adage: “Life is a journey, not a destination.” One should learn to regard business the same way. This means that we shouldn’t be counting the days to retirement. There’s no reason to stop earning money when we hit a certain age. To retire is to stop providing value to society. It’s also to limit your potential. So pretend you’re an Olympic athlete running the 400-meter dash. You don’t come to a full stop once you hit the finish line; you keep going, even though you’re slowing down. And don’t fixate on the end goal. Focusing on retirement can give you a distorted view of life that may cause you to slow down before you even get there. Instead, be one of the many people who’ve remained active and productive in their later years. At age 65, Harlan Sanders was virtually penniless. He was tired of trying to survive on a small monthly retirement check from the government. And so, for the next 15 years, he sold fried chicken and began the empire known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, now known as KFC. Many people are fooled by three lies that get told about retirement. The first is that work has no real value – that it’s just a means to an end. From this perspective, the only reason to work is to one day no longer have to. Jewish tradition teaches us otherwise. Work has value for the worker and humanity. It gives them dignity and transforms the world around them. Another lie is that we become weaker and less productive in old age. But unless you have an extremely physical job, you’re likely to become more productive as you get older. As you continue to grow your network of contacts, you’ll have more and more opportunities to generate wealth. The third lie is that people are meant to be consumers, not creators. But as we’ve seen in these blinks, spirituality and creating wealth can go hand in hand, and as we get older our connection to our spiritual selves only gets deeper. The key message in this book: We can create success and wealth in business by looking to the ancient teachings and wisdom of Judaism. These principles can be applied to many business situations in the modern world. Actionable advice: Be a numinous networker. It’s easy to think of networking as a way to make quick connections to improve your business. But try thinking about these connections in a deeper, more numinous way – in other words, as deeper, more spiritual relationships. Your business networks should be treated like long-lasting and fruitful relationships that benefit both you and the people you’re working with. Got feedback?

Kiyosaki Rich Dad, Poor Dad (1997) combines autobiography with personal advice to outline the steps to becoming financially independent and wealthy. The author argues that what he teaches in this New York Times bestseller are things we’re never taught in society, and that what the upper-class passes on to its children is the necessary knowledge for getting (and staying) rich. He cites his highly successful career as an investor and his retirement at the early age of 47 as evidence in support of his claims.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

These blinks won’t teach how to tip a cow, but they will show you how we must overturn our “sacred cows,” virtues such as fairness, passion and perfectionism that we strive for everyday. The truth is, although these virtues may benefit us in many ways, they have to be used in moderation. For example, being fair to everyone can lead us to reward the weakest, less deserving members of our teams, to the annoyance of the best ones; perfection and fear of failure can keep us from innovating. These blinks will show you better ways to operate in business. In these blinks you’ll find out how far away Ritz-Carlton staff are told to stand from customers; why being passionate can be bad for your health; and why perfectionism is bad for your health. The desire to live in a fair world is hardwired into our brains. When we see someone experiencing an emotion, our brains mimic it. In fact, one study of this phenomenon showed that if you see someone getting an electric shock, your brain reacts as if you've been shocked. This natural tendency toward fairness isn't always a good thing, though. In our quest for fairness, we sometimes confuse it with sameness. We form empathetic connections with others, but sometimes project our own thoughts onto them. Have you ever caught yourself buying someone a gift that was actually something you wanted? When we want something, we often assume others want it too. In business, this conflation of fairness and sameness often leads people to make the mistake of treating every customer the same. We imagine our customers must all want the same things we want. This can make us accidentally shut out any customers who are different. So what's the better alternative? Well, you need to constantly remind yourself that everyone is different; strive to treat everyone as an individual. The Four Seasons hotel implements this doctrine well. It encourages employees to make their guests feel at home, and give them any service they desire. By contrast, the Ritz Carlton have specific rules; e.g., they have to stand at least ten feet away from all guests and greet them with, “How may I help you, [sir or ma'am]?” Of the two hotels, the Four Seasons has a higher customer satisfaction rate, and a growing market share. It may be because people prefer to be treated as individuals. “Balance” and “passion” are both buzz words in the self-help industry these days. Many people strive to be passionate at work, while balancing the different aspects of their life. This isn't really a healthy attitude, however. Consider the idea of “work/life balance.” People often think this means they should limit their daily working hours to spend more time at home. In many cases however, that only amounts to the person working at home rather than spending time with their family. Instead, be bolder with your balancing. Don't “balance” things by constantly making trade offs and compromises. Work hard at one important thing at the time. If you need to work, work. Don't compromise. When you need to spend time with your family, give them your full attention. In the long run, things will still balance out, and you'll be much happier and more productive. Obsessive passions can also lead to burnout and poor health. In fact, one study of professional dancers found a correlation between passion and chronic injuries. When the “passionate” dancers got injured, they just kept dancing and made their conditions worse, rather than taking the time they needed to recover. So don't become obsessed with your work. Practice harmonious passion instead. This means showing passion for the things that make you happy, even if they aren't your main focus in life. Serena Williams, for example, is one of the most successful tennis players in history, but she also has a great passion for fashion and nails. She's actually a qualified nail technician. She still devotes time to nails, even though it isn't the focus of her career. That balance makes her happier and healthier. Many people assume that excellence is the key to success. If you do each little thing perfectly – by keeping your desk tidy and delivering everything on time – your output will be perfect too. Actually, that isn't true. Aiming for excellence throughout the entire work process won't produce excellent results. If a leader pushes his team to be excellent at all times, the team will get worn out. The team members won't strive to be creative or think differently because they'll be afraid of imperfection. Demanding excellence at all times will ultimately prevent the team from making any serious progress. The key here is to understand that your end product should be excellent. The path to it, however, almost certainly won't be. Consider the success of the golfer Bubba Watson. He's won several majors, but his golf swing is far from perfect. He learned to golf from his father, not a professional coach. His imperfect training helped him develop a perfect technique. To ensure that your staff are freed from the pressures of excellency, lower the stakes. Don't overstate the importance of any single role. If a person feels like her role is absolutely vital to the team, she’ll be afraid of doing anything wrong, so she won't be creative. An experiment on a group of women in the American military illustrated how much the pressure of perfection can affect a team's performance. Participants in the study were tested on their ability to shoot. One group was told that the purpose of the experiment was to see why women were worse shooters than men. These women felt pressured not to let their gender down, and their results were worse than the control group. Pressure doesn't help people – it diminishes them. When you free your employees from pressure, they'll inevitably perform better. Our world is changing rapidly. People often assume that the more innovations they produce, the more successful they'll be. That’s a common fallacy, though. When you produce new things just for the sake of it, you're innovating for the wrong reasons. Narcissistic creativity is a case in point. Narcissistic creativity means wasting resources creating something that just shows off the company's skill, rather than filling an actual market need. Sony, for instance, has unleashed thousands of new products – like TVs, video games and music – in an attempt to outdo its rival, Apple. Apple's collection of products is tiny in comparison, yet the iPhone alone generates more revenue than Sony's entire annual sales. So instead of innovating for no reason, innovate sensibly. Here’s how: First, try rechanneling your creative energy. When you find a problem, you may be tempted to attack it with your full force of creativity. If you find a flaw in one of your products, you might want to design a new one. But take a step back – sometimes a small problem can be fixed with a simple tool. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. If you don't fully unleash your creative energy on each little thing, you'll save it for more important times. So wait until your innovation can produce something people really need. That's how you transform the market. Another way to be creative in a constructive way is to repurpose ideas. Use tools that already exist instead of struggling to come up with something completely groundbreaking. This is how Pinterest has become so successful. Pinterest simply repurposed the idea of the pin board, and put it online so people could collect interesting images and share them. This simple concept has allowed the site to experience huge success. Key message: The “sacred cows” aren't sacred at all, so don't let them hold you back. Re-examine your definitions of “fairness” and “balance”; let your process be imperfect, and only innovate when the time is right. When you stop following the sacred rules of business, your organization will prosper more. Actionable advice: Work and innovate when the time is right. When you need to devote yourself to your work, do it. Don't cut your work short, but also don't work when it's time for the other important things in your life, like family. Similarly, when you need to innovate, innovate. Don't innovate just for the sake of it – you'll only waste your creative energy. Save it for when it has the potential to yield something great.

Young","summary":"Have you always dreamed of speaking fluent French, but dismissed the idea as unrealistic? Would computer programming give you a professional edge if you could only find the time to take a course? Whatever your personal or professional aspirations might be, ultralearning can help you realize them in record time. Ultralearning is an aggressive, self-motivated approach to learning that enables people to quickly and efficiently master difficult skills. By taking this approach to learning, they become ultralearners. Their feats can seem intimidating at first – think along the lines of learning a new language in less than three months. But the truth is that anyone can adopt the ultralearning strategy and see results. These blinks will outline the key principles of ultralearning and give you the specific strategies and techniques you need to start your own ultralearning project and successfully pull it off! Along the way, you’ll discover why all your learning should begin with metalearning; why ultralearners succeed where many educational institutions fail; and what common memorization mistake you’re probably making, and how to fix it. Benny Lewis is a polyglot who takes an average of three months to learn a new language. That makes him an ultralearner: a self-directed learner who can acquire new skills in a short time frame, through adopting an aggressive and strategic learning approach.  Ultralearning projects are self-directed, challenging and time-consuming. Just look at the ultralearning project devised by Eric Barone. Most successful computer games are created by teams of professionals with huge budgets. Barone, an IT graduate working as a theater usher, decided to create one completely on his own. Over five years, Barone refined his game’s mechanics through intensive trial and error. Along the way, he taught himself pixel art, music composition, sound design and story writing.  The finished game, Stardew Valley, was released in 2016. It sold over three million copies that year and landed Barone on Forbes’ ‘30 Under 30’ list. Your ultralearning project might not land you in the pages of Forbes magazine, but it can bring ‘unrealistic’ dreams, like learning French or mastering watercolor painting, within reach. Beyond being a path to personal fulfillment, though, ultralearning can help you hone your professional edge. And staying competitive professionally has never been more urgent.  As medium-skilled jobs are threatened by automation, workers need to adapt, upskill and retrain to stay competitive. In the new professional landscape, the most desirable workers have hybridized skill sets: librarian/data analyst, architect/textile designer, accountant/Mandarin speaker. Ultralearners can diversify their skill sets without taking time off work to pursue further education or qualifications. If ultralearning sounds appealing, you’re probably already wondering how it works. The following blinks will break down the principles of ultralearning, and outline how to implement them in your own ultralearning project. Whether you’re teaching yourself stochastic calculus or perfecting your tennis serve, your ultralearning project should always begin with metalearning: the process of learning how to learn. The idea here is that you shouldn’t start by absorbing information at random. You should first establish how information is structured in your chosen field.  For example, the writing system of Mandarin Chinese isn’t just a bunch of random characters. Instead, the characters are organized by radicals, which are visual markers that express the relationships between those characters. So if you were learning Mandarin, you’d want to start with organizing principles like radicals, rather than just memorizing each character individually.  Metalearning is all about looking for the big picture, then using it to devise your optimal learning strategy. That’s easier said than done, though. Many learners take years to arrive at a big-picture understanding of their subject. Fortunately, there are some simple strategies you can use to create a metalearning shortcut.   First, create a metalearning map by breaking your topic down into three categories: concepts, or what needs to be understood; facts, or what needs to be memorized; and procedures, or what needs to be done. Some projects, like learning a new programming language, will involve a mixture of the three. Working on that tennis serve, however, will mostly involve perfecting a procedure. Focus your energies on the most heavily-weighted categories. Next, use this map to identify which aspects of learning might prove challenging, and then brainstorm techniques for overcoming them. If your breakdown reveals you’ll need to commit a lot of facts to memory, for example, you might consider acquiring spaced-repetition software, which produces randomized memory tests, to optimize the memorization process.  Finally, establish how you’re going to learn. To do this, try benchmarking: research people who’ve acquired a similar skill or institutions that offer accreditation in your field of study. Use these as your benchmark. Replicate their methods and equipment. Use online course lists or syllabi to find the resources, tools and texts that are considered essential in the field. Time invested in metalearning sets your project up for success. As a general rule, allocate 10% of the total time you expect to spend on your project to metalearning.  Through metalearning, you can draw a roadmap for your ultralearning project. Once your map is ready, you should strengthen your powers of focus to make sure you don’t go off-road. We’ll look at how to do this in the next blink.  From constant email notifications on your phone to the temptation to binge the latest Netflix series, modern life is full of distractions. But you don’t have to let these distractions stop you from reaching your ultralearning goals! There are some simple techniques you can use to overcome the challenges of finding your focus. The first challenge to finding your focus? Getting focused in the first place. Trick yourself into getting started by setting a timer for, say, three minutes. Promise yourself that you can stop working when the timer goes off. But at the end of three minutes, you might have found the momentum you need to keep working.  You can build on this strategy with the pomodoro technique: set a timer for 20 minutes and work without stopping during this time. When the timer goes off, take a five-minute break, then get back to work for another 20 minutes. Once you’ve found your focus, the challenge becomes sustaining it. External interruptions can evaporate your concentration. Control your work environment by eliminating them. Put your phone on airplane mode and switch off your Wi-Fi.  The challenges don’t stop when you’ve found your focus, either. Once you’ve started your task, it’s easy to slip into ‘autopilot’ mode. You might feel you’re getting a lot done, but if you’re not fully engaged with your task, you’re less likely to retain new material. Combat autopilot with interleaving: deliberately alternate between materials and modes of learning. Ideally, interleave by tackling your project in short, regularly-spaced sessions. If you have ten hours in your week to devote to Russian, aim for five two-hour sessions rather than one ten-hour session. Focus on a different aspect or skill set, like vocabulary or grammar, in each session. Finally, make the most of your study sessions by paying attention to your mental arousal, or your level of energy and alertness. High arousal generates intense, yet narrow, focus – perfect for repetitive tasks, like practicing musical scales. Low arousal generates a more relaxed and wide-ranging type of focus, best suited to lateral thinking and forming connections, which are necessary for creative tasks such as music composition. Match your arousal level to your task – perform simple tasks when your focus is more aroused and complex tasks when it’s less aroused – for optimal ultralearning results. Honing your focus will ensure you have the mental stamina to complete your ultralearning challenge. In the next blink, we’ll look at how to tackle that challenge as efficiently as possible. Imagine learning French all through high school, then not being able to hold a simple conversation when you take a trip to Paris. It’s a common situation, and it all comes about through a failure to transfer. Transfer is the process of learning something in one context (like a French class), then transferring it to another (like Paris). Despite its importance, formal education often fails to optimize transfer. The problem with formal education is that it sets up an indirect path between the learning context and the target environment – the context in which learned skills and knowledge are actually applied. Rote learning French vocabulary in a high school classroom is a far cry from asking the nearest Parisian how to get to the metro station. Ultralearners know to keep the path between their learning environment and their target environment as direct as possible. By doing this, they cultivate a quality of ultralearning called directness. How do you practice directness in learning? The most direct way to learn something is to do it. The most effective way to learn a language is to speak it. The most effective way to learn coding is to write code. This learning-by-doing approach is called project-based learning. It situates the skill you’re learning directly in your target environment – no transfer necessary!  One of the most extreme but effective modes of project-based learning is immersive learning: total immersion in the target environment. A student of French who decides to spend three months in Paris is deploying an immersive learning approach.  Of course, not everyone has time for immersive learning. Moreover, some skills don’t lend themselves to this approach. There’s a reason that trainee pilots don’t immerse themselves by flying Boeings on their first day of training. Instead, they learn in flight simulators.  If immersive learning isn’t within your reach, use the flight simulator method by replicating the conditions and pressures of your target environment as closely as possible. If you can’t spend three months in France, for example, try a Skype tutorial with a French speaker.  Whatever you’re learning, establish a direct path between your learning context and your target environment. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to drill down and perfect your technique, which we’ll look at in the next blink. What do elite athletes, piano prodigies and successful ultralearners have in common? They all rely on drilling to perfect their techniques and maintain their competitive edge. So, how can you drill strategically to achieve the best results? Crucially, you should never begin your project by drilling. Instead, use the direct-then-drill approach. To do this, start with direct practice, whether you’re writing code or weaving tapestry. Use this direct practice to identify the areas where you wish to drill. After drilling, go back to direct practice until it becomes necessary to drill again. To make the most out of your drilling, apply it to a rate-determining step. In chemistry, the rate-determining step is the part of the process that precipitates a chain reaction; in ultralearning, it’s the step that unlocks the next level of knowledge or opens up the broadest range of applications. For example, you may have a great grasp of the principles of accounting theory, but lack the Excel expertise to put these principles into practice. In that case, learning Excel would be your rate-determining step, so you’d focus your drilling in this area.  How should you design your drills? That depends on the area you want to drill. Can it be easily isolated from the rest of your project? If so, try time-slicing, where you isolate one step in a more involved process and repeat the step until you’ve perfected it. If you want to perfect your golf game, for example, you could time-slice by drilling your drive shot. Or, separate your desired skill into different cognitive components and drill each separately – for example, in language learning, you could drill vocabulary, pronunciation or spelling. If you’re working on a more creative or complex project, you might find it challenging to drill in isolation – it’s hard to drill creative writing, for example. In that case, try the copycat method instead. Choose a piece of work that you admire, whether it’s a painting by Cezanne or a passage by Dickens, and emulate it as closely as you can. Pop quiz! Which ultralearner developed Stardew Valley? Why is transfer so important? What’s the interleaving technique? If you had trouble answering these questions, you may need to work on retrieval. The next blink will tell you how. Learning color theory is a great way to improve your artistic skill and know-how – but only if your hard-won knowledge doesn’t desert you when you’re at your easel. It’s pointless learning new skills, concepts and procedures if you’re unable to retrieve them quickly and efficiently. There are two methods you can use to improve your retrieval rate. But be careful! One of them is far more effective than the other. The first is review: going back over the materials you’ve just studied. The second is recall: trying to recall facts and concepts from memory.  A 2011 study from Purdue University shows recall is far more effective for long-term learning retention, yet most learners opt for review strategies over recall strategies when trying to consolidate their learnings.  There’s a reason we prefer review over recall and it all comes down to a concept called judgment of learning. Essentially, when we’re able to process or understand a concept without difficulty, we judge that we’ve learned that concept. Reading back over something we’ve already learned creates the impression that we’ve grasped this new information. That’s why we gravitate towards passive review strategies: they confirm our perception that we’re learning successfully. But perception isn’t everything. Struggling to recall something in the short term means you’re far more likely to remember it in the long term. Experts call this desirable difficulty – the difficulty posed by recall is ultimately desirable, as it maximizes our chances of retaining what we’ve learned.  Here are some fun ways to make your study sessions more recall-focused.   The first is to test yourself on what you’ve learned using flash cards or, better yet, free recall: after a study session, sit down with a piece of blank paper. Challenge yourself to write down everything you can remember from what you’ve learned, in as much detail as possible. Another approach is to avoid making notes when reading – pose questions that force you to recall the answer. Instead of writing “The Battle of Hastings took place in 1066,” write “When did the Battle of Hastings take place?” Every time you go over your notes, you’ll be forced to recall what you’ve learned. Finally, for a more concrete recall-based challenge, set yourself a task that will test everything you’ve learned in your ultralearning project so far. The advantage to this approach is that you don’t need to waste time recalling general aspects of your subject that don’t apply directly to your intended learning project; rather, you’ll recall specific skills and concepts in a targeted way, as you need to use them. Nailed retrieval? Then it’s time to get on friendly terms with feedback. No matter what level of expertise you’re at, you need to seek out feedback on your progress if you want to improve. Moreover, you need to learn how to distinguish between different levels of feedback and acquire strategies for eliciting feedback. Almost all feedback is useful, but not all feedback is created equal. It’s helpful to divide feedback into three different categories. The first and most basic form of feedback is outcome feedback. This feedback can confirm whether or not you’ve reached a desired outcome. Imagine you’re giving a public talk and the audience applauds at the end. That’s outcome feedback. It can be encouraging, but it’s hard to glean any more information from this type of feedback. Informational feedback gives you more to work with, by alerting you to the fact that you’re doing something wrong. If you give a public talk and audience members walk out at a particular point, they’re giving you informational feedback. This kind of feedback is useful for highlighting problem areas and isolating your mistakes. By far the best kind of feedback is corrective feedback: feedback that tells you what you’re doing wrong and how to fix it. Imagine giving a public talk where there’s a professional speechwriter in the audience, who gives you notes on what went well, what didn’t land and how you can improve. The speechwriter is giving you corrective feedback, and this is far more instructive than outcome feedback.  When sorting through your feedback, focus on corrective feedback over informational feedback, and informational feedback over outcome feedback. How do you ensure you’re receiving enough feedback in the first place? Start by remembering to fail for feedback: if you’re not extending yourself to the point where you fail, you stop yourself from getting useful informational or corrective feedback. Pushing beyond your limits will elicit helpful feedback; acting on that feedback will, in turn, extend your limits. Don’t neglect to seek meta-feedback, either. It’s important to seek feedback on how well your learning methods are working. A simple way to test your learning methods is to track your learning rate – try timing how long it takes you to correctly complete a math problem, for example. If your learning rate isn’t tracking upward, act on this negative feedback by revisiting your learning methods. By eliciting feedback and prioritizing corrective and informational feedback, you can constantly adjust and improve your performance. In 2016, Nigel Richards won the World French Scrabble Championships, despite not speaking French. There are 386,000 French words approved for Scrabble, and Richards committed them to memory. That’s extreme ultralearning! Your ultralearning project might not require so much memorization, but you’ll probably need to memorize some facts, formulas or procedures.  So, how do you learn things so that they ‘stick’?  The most productive strategy you can employ is to settle on a memorization system and incorporate it at regular, closely-spaced stages throughout your project. The key is to use a memorization system that’s both easy to integrate into your project and well-suited to the type of project you’ve decided to tackle. It can be tempting to commit things to memory in one burst. If you do this, you may see short-term results. For long-term retention, though, it’s best to avoid cramming. Make sure you space out your memorization sessions. But don’t space them too far apart – if you leave it too long between memory-building sessions, you’ll start to see diminishing returns. Ideally, make time for memorization a few days per week. If you’re memorizing facts or simple concepts, deploy a Spaced Repetition System (SRS). Try flashcards, which test your knowledge of discrete chunks of information in a randomized way. Alternatively, use SRS software where ‘randomization’ is optimized by an algorithm. For more complex concepts, spaced repetition can be equally effective. Here, your focus should be on regularly repeating key processes rather than recalling information. To do this, switch out the flash cards for a refresher project: test your retention by regularly putting your skills into practice. You could even try overlearning: pushing yourself beyond your skill level. Let’s say you want to nail the basics of algebra. Pushing yourself to learn some intermediate formulas could actually help you retain beginner-level formulas more effectively. A 1991 study from Ohio Wesleyan University demonstrates that extending your learning into a higher skill set not only challenges your abilities, it also improves your retention of lower-level skills. For more procedural projects, the most effective retention method is to simply remember by doing – repeat a procedure enough times and your body will start to automate it.  Now that you’ve learned the key principles of successful ultralearning, it’s time to level up! Start by following your intuition. Physicist Richard Feynman was known for his uncanny intuition; he had the knack of looking at a complex problem and seemingly plucking the solution out of thin air. The technical term for this ability is intuitive expertise, and it can seem rather mysterious to outside observers. But there’s a perfectly rational explanation for Feynman’s flashes of brilliance: his deep understanding of physics enabled him to intuit unexpected connections and patterns. Whatever subject you may be studying, it takes time and patience to build up the level of deep understanding on which intuitive expertise is built. But by employing a few simple strategies, you can accelerate the rate at which you acquire it. Start by getting back to basics. Feynman was famous for asking ‘stupid questions’ and would frustrate his students by bombarding them with questions about basic concepts. However, Feynman knew something his students had yet to learn: it’s possible to progress to complex concepts when you only have a vague understanding of foundational concepts. On the other hand, it’s impossible to become an intuitive expert until you know the foundational concepts of your field inside-out. A challenging learning experience can lead to a deeper grasp of the subject. That’s why you should try and embrace the struggle. Resist taking shortcuts in your learning; if there are two ways to arrive at a solution, choose the longer, more involved one. Learning a few classic chess moves will probably improve your win rate in the short term, but a lengthier study of chess strategy is a better route to a deep understanding of the game.  Try not to give up immediately when things get really challenging. Instead, implement a struggle timer. Force yourself to sit with every challenge or obstacle for at least ten minutes before you look for a simpler solution. Finally, deepen your understanding of core concepts by proving them for yourself. Look at the theorems, ideas and processes that expert practitioners in your field have formulated, then try and prove them or replicate them for yourself. You’re not trying to disprove those practitioners’ work; you’re trying to understand the procedure and thought patterns behind it.  Accepting the truth of ideas just because experts say they’re true gives you a shallow understanding of your subject. To achieve deep knowledge and intuitive expertise, it’s better to work through those ideas for yourself. That way, you’ll become one of those experts! How did Vincent van Gogh go from an art school dropout, whom classmates recalled as an ‘unremarkable’ painter, to the innovative artist who painted masterpieces like Sunflowers and Starry Night? Through sustained, relentless experimentation. Look back over van Gogh’s full oeuvre and you’ll see he didn’t hit on his distinctive aesthetic immediately. Instead, he tirelessly tried different styles and techniques until he mastered his craft. Then, he experimented even more, finally arriving at a unique style. Experimentation is ultralearning’s secret ingredient – the technique can take you from accomplished practitioner to true innovator. But experimentation can seem a little overwhelming at first. If you’re wondering where to begin, one technique you can use is to copy then create: emulate someone else’s work, then use this as a stepping-stone towards testing your own ideas.  Say you’re learning how to cook Korean food. Find a great recipe and follow it exactly, learning its processes and concepts as you go. Once you’ve got a handle on it, you can start to improvise with the process and flavor profile.  Another thing you can do to jumpstart your experimentation is to impose some constraints on it. This might seem counterintuitive, but limiting your creativity can actually help it blossom. That’s because working within strict limits can help you shake off your working habits and force you to try something new. For example, if you’re a budding artist or poet, you might try painting a picture using only shades of green or writing a verse without using the letter ‘e’: you might be surprised by how your creativity flourishes when it’s circumscribed. Finally, aim for the unexpected by hybridizing your materials, techniques or skills to find your hidden superpower. Combining two seemingly disparate elements can lead to great results. Before Scott Adams created the office comic strip Dilbert, he was an engineer with a passion for doodling. He wasn’t the best engineer or artist, but when he found a way to hybridize his unique skill set, he ended up creating one of the world’s best-known comic strips. Experimentation pays off! The key message in these blinks: At first glance, ultralearners can look like outliers. But in reality, anyone can adopt ultralearning’s aggressive, self-directed learning style to master difficult tasks in a short time. Want to successfully complete your own ultralearning project? Start by laying the groundwork: apply metalearning strategies and refine your focus. Optimize your learning by focussing on directness, drilling, retrieval, feedback and retention. To take things to the next level, cultivate intuition and experiment intensively. Actionable advice: Pick the brain of an expert.  Interested in taking on an ultralearning challenge to hone your professional edge? Before you commit to a time-consuming project like teaching yourself the basics of a coding language, make sure it aligns with your career objectives.

Regardless of her true passions and talents, she was supposed to stay at home and care for the children. Happily, things have improved, and these days women can have it all – a loving partner, children and a career. So why are so many successful women single? And why do the careers of many married women take a nosedive once children come into the picture? In these blinks, you’ll learn about the many injustices that women still face today – and how your own behavior may be contributing to the situation. After grasping what’s still holding women back, you’ll be better equipped to work toward change – both generally and in your personal life. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how striving to be Superwoman can actually make you weaker; about the impact your way of speaking has on all the women in your country; and why spending more time with family means getting fired in Washington. Men can have it all – a thriving career and a happy family. But if you’re a woman, these two goals might seem completely incompatible.  To thrive in any highly competitive field, you have to commit the lion’s share of your time and energy to your work. And if a couple has children, it’s much easier for the man to do this. That’s because most people still adhere to traditional gender roles: the man is supposed to provide for the family financially and the woman is expected to raise the children and be warm and nurturing. Consequently, most women are willing to support their husband’s decision to substitute time with the family for time at work. But even if they make a concerted effort to commit to their job and meticulously plan every move of their life, women still can’t control the fate of their career and family. Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, thinks that anything is possible if you just lean in to your career. But it doesn’t matter how much you’re leaning in when you have two kids back home and an inflexible work schedule; the unpredictability of life will eventually force you to shift your focus away from work. Some women hope that marrying a progressive partner will result in a fairer distribution of domestic responsibility – thus enabling them to pursue their career. However, this rarely works out. In reality, most men are reluctant to set aside their career goals. For instance, a woman whom the author met at a conference shared that just a fraction of her intelligent and driven female friends, all graduates of Harvard Business School, had met their career goals, despite marrying peers who had pledged they’d be equal partners once married. Once they started a family, the men were unwilling to scale back on their own career, so the women had to sacrifice their goals and assume primary responsibility for childcare. In a way, women aren’t the only ones who struggle to have it all. Indeed, many men would love to spend more time with their family, but there are huge obstacles between that dream and their lived reality. Men also struggle to maintain a work-life balance. And many men regret not making more of an effort to be with their family. Working in palliative care, writer Bronnie Ware discovered that as people (men especially) approach death, they regret that they weren’t around more when their children were growing up, and that they didn’t take more time to enjoy their partner’s companionship. Despite this widespread regret, men are considered to be somehow unmanly if they ask for a flexible job or decide to give up their career to spend more time with their children. That was the case for the young lawyer Ryan Park. He recalls that, after leaving his job to stay home with his daughter, most of the moms he encountered at the park didn’t believe that he could possibly be doing this by choice. Instead, they assumed that he must have been a failure in his professional life.  This is unfortunate, as, despite the popular myth of the primacy of a mother’s love, children need their father around just as much as they need their mother.  Children need a mother, but not more than they need a father, grandparents, siblings and so on. The only time a child literally can’t do without his mother is during pregnancy and while he is being breastfed. Afterward, it doesn’t matter whether mom or dad is in charge. This has been verified by numerous studies, which have shown that children raised by gay parents turn out as well-adjusted as children raised by straight parents. Children need love, stability, care, nurture and consistency; they don’t necessarily need a parental arrangement that includes a mother. If a woman’s career stalls once she becomes a mother, maybe it’s her own fault: she simply lacked the necessary ambition! Or maybe she was just incompetent, incapable of juggling a career and a family. Obviously, this is nonsense. Nevertheless, it’s a commonly held belief – one even peddled by women’s leadership groups!  The problem isn’t a lack of capability or ambition, however. Rather, employers simply fail to accommodate mothers. Even worse: they actually shortchange them. Most workplaces fail to provide sufficiently flexible schedules. As a result, mothers may revert to jobs far beneath their level of qualification, where they can compensate for time-consuming contingencies – like taking their sick kid to the doctor – by simply working faster.  Furthermore, working mothers are not only paid less than men but less than single women, too. In 2013, for instance, an average single woman with no children earned 96 cents to the male dollar; married mothers earned just 76 percent of their male peers’ earnings. Additionally, society overwhelms working mothers with a crazy expectation: they should be perfect mothers and perfect employees. This social pressure is reflected in what women expect of themselves. For example, a physician with two children once wrote to the author professing a feeling of guilt for not being a good enough mom due to her 80-hour workweek – but also for being less than 100 percent devoted to her work. As a working mother, you may feel guilty if your colleagues are able to work all the time and you aren’t. But there’s no reason to feel guilty! After all, overwork actually results in inefficiency.  Studies show that long working hours also have a negatively impact on productivity and focus, while periods of free time stimulate creativity. The author experienced this while working at a law firm. Sleeping merely five hours per night, she was constantly nervous and forgetful. It eventually got so bad that she’d literally forget what she and her research assistant were talking about mid-conversation. In today’s world, Mother Theresa would probably have earned more respect working a prestigious, competitive job than caring for the sick.  Not all parents aspire to be like Mother Theresa; however, they do have to provide care, and anyone who has to do that, whether for days or decades, is immensely disadvantaged in the job market.  No matter how successful a woman is in her career, once she quits her job for a period of time to stay home with her kids, all current and prospective employers cease to see her achievements as having any relevance. For instance, if a young female lawyer on a promising career track decides to work part-time or even take time off in order to care for her children, her career in law is essentially finished. It’s even worse for single mothers, who typically can’t afford to even think about quitting their job to stay home with their children. That was the case for Maria, a single mother from Rhode Island, who worked at a factory for $7.40 an hour. When she missed her shift because her son was ill, she was suspended from work for two weeks, and upon returning was greeted with a pay reduction. African American women have it even worse. For generations, staying home to take care of their own children was an unimaginable luxury for African American women. The only way to provide for their kids was to leave them alone at home and go off to look after other people’s children. And while caring for others may be rewarding in many ways, it’s also the most underappreciated job on the market. The easiest way to gauge how much we actually value caregiving is to look at how much we pay for it. And as it turns out, caregivers are the lowest paid workers in America.  Next, we’ll look at how we might improve things – for women and men alike. When we look at magazines or TV shows from half a century ago, it’s easy to laugh at all the absurd and blatant gender stereotypes. But even today, though in subtler ways, these same stereotypes greatly affect our lives. Gender stereotypes and role expectations limit women’s (and men’s) choices, so it’s a good idea to question them in everyday life. Assumptions and expectations can influence our behavior, sometimes resulting in self-fulfilling prophecies.   For example, if a woman assumes that she is much better at caregiving than her partner because that’s what she’s been told by society, she’s more likely to shoulder most of the caregiving responsibilities, thus confirming her initial assumptions about her role and capabilities – no matter how erroneous those assumptions might have been.  Moreover, as long as women believe that they are fundamentally better at raising children or doing housework, they’re likely to control and criticize their partner's parenting style and ability to do chores. But no partner likes to be policed, and being critical takes a lot of energy, too.  And if a man is told time and time again that he’s somehow unfit to care for his children, he might start believing it. As a result, he’ll avoid spending time with them and consequently fail to acquire the necessary child-raising skills. In order to let go of these stereotypes, you’ll need to drop the superwoman image. Many women think that perfection is just around the corner, and that getting there is just a matter of working harder, sleeping less and putting on a smile. But as long as you hide your exhaustion and carry out your responsibilities without complaint, your partner will never know that you need help.  Superwoman may be in control of everything, but you're not superwoman – nor do you need to be. If you truly want your partner to be equal at home, then let him do the chores as he sees fit. We’ve all heard the rhyme sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me! In actuality, words are very powerful.  Indeed, what we talk about and how we talk about it greatly influences gender-role expectations. The words we use and the topics we discuss all reflect our attitudes, and influence other people’s judgments. Working mothers, for instance, are invariably asked how they manage to juggle work and family. But this seemingly neutral question implies that it is a woman’s responsibility to take care of the kids. Tellingly, men are rarely asked the same question. You have the power to flip this trope on its head. For example, if you’re interviewing a man for a job, ask him how he’s going to manage his responsibilities at home and work at the same time! Then there’s the Washingtonian expression “leaving to spend time with your family,” which is really a euphemism for getting fired! This phrase delegitimizes people who choose to spend more time with their family. Besides combatting this kind of subtle sexism, there are some practical things you can do to strike the right balance between work and family.  First, when you start a family, it’s vital to decide whether you want to keep your job. After quitting their jobs to be full time mothers, many women find that it’s extremely hard to reenter the job market. So, if you do decide to keep your career, you need to strategically prepare for your comeback by doing things like, for example, keeping your career network up to date. If your work environment is tough and inflexible, then you’ll have to speak up to improve the situation. One way could be to take inventory of how your working environment enables or hinders qualified women’s careers, map it all out and present it to your boss. The key message in this book: It’s an unfortunate reality that working parents, both mothers and fathers, face undue discrimination and injustice at the workplace. In order to have both a career and a family, we have to work to change our culture and create life partnerships that are truly equal. Actionable advice: Don’t let work be a competition. The next time someone starts telling you loudly and proudly how many hours she worked last week, encourage her to talk more about other things, like how she likes to spend her spare time, or what good movies she’s seen recently. This subtle technique is a great way to remind people that a good life involves more than slaving away at the office.

Bolles","summary":"The job search. Probably, it’s not your first rodeo; that dreaded and exciting process – finding a job – is something you’ve done before. But perhaps a few things have changed since the last time you were an applicant. Or perhaps this is your first rodeo. In either case, knowing how to navigate today’s post-social media, post-recession landscape is essential to finding a successful match. Because that’s what it is, after all – a match. It’s not just a lottery, where you buy a ticket and hope for the best. You, like any potential employer, have a lot of control over what information you share, how you communicate that information and what your expectations are. So take a deep breath, brush up on your interview and negotiating skills – and enjoy the ride! In these blinks, you’ll learn why being a good listener is just as important as being a good talker; why it might be wise to take down those spring break photos; and how online transparency can work to your advantage. If you’ve been having a tough time finding the right job, don’t despair. The job market can be an unfriendly place, which is why it’s crucial to have great tools in your toolbox. Today, we face an ongoing economic recession that has changed the way employers look for candidates. During times of economic prosperity, it can be a challenge for employers to find the perfect employees; as a result, the employer has to adapt to the needs and preferences of the person seeking employment. This is when résumés will be thoroughly read and company websites will be regularly updated with job postings. But 2017 is not such a time. Since the economic meltdown of 2008, it’s been rough times for job hunters. These days, employers are the ones in control; with a much larger pool of unemployed people to choose from, they care much less about the résumés and needs of prospective employees. As a result, it generally takes much longer to land a new job. Between 1994 and 2008, it would have only taken around five weeks for half of all unemployed people in the United States to find a job. Post-2008, it would take more than a year for just 22 to 33 percent of unemployed Americans to find a job. Plus, with the struggling economy, employers are on the lookout for ways to cut costs. So jobs are generally short-term since businesses prefer to offer part-time and freelance positions. These jobs are usually project-based, and they’re cheaper for employers, because they don’t have to cover health benefits or paid holidays. According to a 2015 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 69 percent of people aged 18 to 24 had been working at a job for less than a year, and 93 percent for less than five years. And it wasn’t much better for people aged 40 to 48. Thirty-two percent had been working at their job for less than a year, and 69 percent for less than five years. With so much information just a click away, everyone’s details are easily accessible. It used to be that when someone was looking for a job they had complete control over how they presented themselves, especially when it came to their résumé. There were all kinds of methods for tweaking a job history and picking and choosing what gets mentioned in order to make the best impression. And for the most part, the potential employer had few ways of challenging this information, unless they went out of their way to hire a private investigator. Since that wasn’t a very practical option, the résumé remained a powerful tool for presenting yourself in the most flattering light possible. But these days, you have to be much more careful since there’s a lot of online information that could contradict the image you’re trying to create. So take a moment to do what any potential employer will do and use Google to search your name. You might see a LinkedIn profile, a Facebook profile, perhaps a blog and some pictures. The point is, everything is a simple Google search away, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use the internet to your advantage. But first of all, check to see whether there’s any information there that obviously contradicts what you’ve put on your résumé. For instance, do your graduation dates match up? Now look for any red flags, like a photo of you at a party looking wildly intoxicated or an unsavory Twitter comment that could be construed as racist or sexist. Remove these as soon as possible. Studies show that 91 percent of US employers will check a candidate’s social-media profiles and that nearly 70 percent have rejected people due to what they’ve found. So take control and delete the unpleasant stuff – untag yourself from photos and manage your appearance so that it looks consistent and professional across all your social-media accounts. Overwhelmed? Don’t panic. As we’ll see, there are plenty of remedies to help manage your online appearance. Much of the internet is based on keywords. After all, you have to type in something to start a Google search, and it’s the search engine’s job to find the best and most relevant results. Now, you can use the power of keywords to control and improve the search results that appear when someone Googles your name or searches for someone with your specific skills. So think about which keywords you want associated with your name and what kind of recruiters you want to attract. You can even put yourself in the shoes of a recruiter and ask, “Which job titles and descriptions would I use to find the best candidates?” Naturally, these would be the keywords to associate with your name by adding them to your online profiles. So make a list of the best words that come to mind, such as proactive, hard-working, friendly, honest, enthusiastic and efficient. These words can then be added to your LinkedIn account and incorporated into your bio to describe both your professional and nonprofessional activities. To make sure your accounts are noticed, you can also take steps to increase your visibility. If you want to be seen as a specialist or expert in your field, start a blog about your particular subject to show off your knowledge and interest. If you’re a graphic designer, start a blog that highlights interesting articles and interviews. This will show that you’re engaged with the field and on top of the latest developments. You could then add commentary and examples that provide insight into your own background. Increasing your presence in LinkedIn groups is also a way to get noticed in your field. Search for different graphic-designer groups on LinkedIn that you can join and make sure to occasionally check in, provide comments and share posts. You can also use Twitter to share posts and comment on developments in your field, just be sure to use the relevant hashtags so that potential employers can find your activity. Dating and job-hunting aren’t all that different from one another; they can both be boiled down to two questions: “Do you like me?” and “Do I like you?” And despite the changes that have occurred over the past decades, job-hunting is essentially the same as it’s always been. The process is still about bringing together two parties who want to form a mutually beneficial relationship. For your part, it’s about making yourself likeable and attractive to the employer, which you can do by demonstrating that your skills, experience and personality are a perfect fit for the company and the position being offered. But don’t forget, it’s also about finding out whether the employer is the right fit for you. So ask yourself, do they provide an appealing environment that will allow you to use your skills efficiently? And will you be able to develop your skills and talents in this environment? When making your decision, remember that, even in today’s market, there are probably more opportunities than you realize. The media has a habit of exaggerating the state of the job market and making it seem like there’s absolutely nothing available. As a result, you might feel overwhelmed and hopeless, but you really shouldn’t. In reality, the situation is not completely out of your control. There is always something you can do to maximize your odds. You can change the wording and improve the language in your résumé and cover letter. You can research the job market and focus more intensively to uncover new areas that may also appeal to you. Keep in mind that the odds are in your favor. According to the Job Openings and Labor Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, every month there are 10 million job openings, a mere half of which are filled on a regular basis. Next, we’ll take a look at what you can do to improve your chances of acing that job interview. To continue with the dating analogy: having a strong résumé and web presence is like taking care of the flirting stage. And we all know that flirting is just a prelude to what comes afterward – which, in the hunt for a job, is the interview stage. Once again, there are steps you can take to improve your chances at this stage, and the first step is to prepare yourself with some good knowledge about the company’s culture. Even if you’re the perfect candidate with the right skills, intelligence and experience, you don’t want to show up to a date wearing the wrong outfit, right? So make sure you know what you’re walking into by researching the company and finding out what culture and values they embrace. You can do this by going to their website, checking their recent corporate guidelines and press releases, and finding out what’s been said about them in the media. You can also check business blogs and online publications such as Gizmodo and TechCrunch, which will tell you about any recent developments. Whatever you do, don’t come across as arrogant and patronizing in your interview, which can sometimes happen when people talk too much and don’t come prepared with good questions. It’s natural to feel nervous about promoting yourself in an interview. And nervous self-promotion, in addition to making you seem self-absorbed and unfocused, can lead to a lot of aimless rambling. So don’t forget to let others talk and to listen carefully to what they have to say. The best interviewees are precise; they focus on the answers they provide. They’ll also ask questions about the company, such as, “What kind of people will I be working with?” This shows that you’re aware of different personalities and curious about how yours will fit in. Now, if you want to go above and beyond expectations, you can bring some evidence that backs up your experience and skills. This is standard practice for creative jobs, such as graphic designers, architects and artists, people who are expected to bring models and portfolios with them. So think about what kind of portfolio you might be able to provide. It could even be an iPad that is loaded with some details and examples of successful projects you’ve worked on. A salary negotiation is pretty much the same as haggling over a price, whether it’s at a car dealership or a flea market. But that doesn’t make it any less stressful. So give yourself an advantage by getting the employer to deliver the first proposal. You can do this by being patient and waiting until the interview process is winding down. When it sounds like they’re interested in hiring you, then it’s time to ask them to propose a salary. If there are multiple rounds of interviews, then this should be saved until the final round. However, they know that making a counterproposal has it’s advantages, so they might beat you to it and ask you to propose a salary. If this happens, you can try to turn the tables by saying something like, “Well, since you created this position, I would imagine you have a specific number in mind, right?” Otherwise, you’ll need to come prepared with a good estimate by finding out how much people in similar positions are currently earning. This is usually something you can Google, though there are also online platforms that compare salaries across industries, positions, geographies and ages, such as salary.com and jobstar.org. With enough information, you can identify the range that employers will be willing to pay. Then you can determine how low you’d be willing to go and how high you believe the company will go. So if there’s an average range of $34,000 to $42,600, you might want to start off the negotiations with a number that falls somewhere between $42,000 to $50,000. Now, you can improve your chances of landing within this range by telling them how your skills and expertise will both save and earn them money in the long run. With these tips at your disposal, and some good insight into the hiring process, you’ll be on your way to being a well-prepared job hunter. So go forth and enter the job market with confidence. That perfect position is out there waiting for you! The key message in this book: To improve your chances of landing the job you’re after, always prepare yourself as best you can by doing ample research before your interview. Keep in mind that there are actually a lot of jobs out there that need to be filled by a qualified professional such as yourself. So think of yourself as a great resource for your potential employer, and never think of yourself as being desperate. Actionable advice: Sometimes it’s easier to change a career in two steps. If you’re after a career change, aim for a job that could help you transition there. Often, our dream job is a highly exclusive position that’s near impossible to get in the usual fashion. So think of a job that will get you in the door and working in the right field, or one that will bring you closer to the title you’re after. This is a strategic approach to actually getting that dream job. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Most days, there’s so much to do that you can’t even think about the things that matter most to you. By the time you’re done packing lunch for the kids, answering emails at work and picking up groceries on the way home, you’re drained. So how on earth are you supposed to find the energy to spend some quality time with your friends and family, let alone make a start on that book you’ve always dreamed of writing? Well, best-selling author and renowned time-management expert Laura Vanderkam has a solution. There’s always time to do what you really want to, she argues. The trick is knowing where to look. And that’s something the world’s most successful highfliers know all about. Ask any one of them where they find the extra time to nurture their careers, relationships and personal dreams, and they’ll give you a three-word answer: in the morning. All it takes is careful planning, mindfulness about how you spend your time and bit of self-discipline. Master that, and you’ll be amazed by how much you can fit into your daily schedule. In the following blinks, you’ll find out how to use a time log to keep track of how you spend your time; why early nights and early starts will make you more productive; and how to apply your new time-management skills to other areas of your life. Mornings are hectic and often pass in the blink of an eye. You jump out of bed, bustle about getting the kids ready for school and then rush out the door and off to work. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Rethink your mornings and they can become an opportunity to do the things that matter most. The key is to stop postponing important tasks. Do them now rather than waiting for the perfect moment later on. Everyone wants more time to do the things they care about. For some, that’s exercise; for others, it’s reading or putting in a few hours on a long-term work project like writing an annual report. It’s all too easy to let daily chores and obligations distract you. And, by the time you’re done responding to work-related emails and doing the laundry, all you want to do is collapse in front of the TV. That makes mornings the perfect time to accomplish your goals. Take it from James Citrin, the leader of the headhunting agency Spencer Stuart’s North American Board and CEO Practice. He interviewed a group of high-flying executives about their morning routines, and 18 out of 20 of them had this one thing in common: they were up before 6 a.m. every day. Citrin is also an early riser, and he uses the morning hours to work out. The world is still calm in the wee hours – a perfect time for some quiet reflection! Then there’s Steve Reinemund, the former CEO and chairman of PepsiCo and the current dean of the School of Business at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. He gets up even earlier, starting his day at 5 a.m. with a four-mile run. After that, he takes some quality “me time” and either reads or prays. Next on the itinerary is a good breakfast with his kids. If he’s traveling, he makes sure he can stick to his tried-and-true routine by only ever staying in hotels with treadmills. Perhaps you’ve also tried to develop a morning routine but fallen prey to the temptation of grabbing some extra sleep. That’s a common enough problem. As we’ll see in the following blinks, it can be overcome. The secret? Willpower. What exactly is a good morning routine? Well, it doesn’t mean doing the laundry. That’s going to get done at some point anyway. The same goes for conference calls or anything else that you can do later on in the day. The best morning routines are about doing things that matter to you but require a little bit of extra self-motivation. These are the kinds of activities that don’t have an immediate payoff but might just change your life in the long run. Think of a creative project like writing a book or networking to support your career. It’s not something that you can finish in one go. But stick to it and you’ll build something that really makes a difference. This is exactly what the most successful people do every day. They spend their mornings nurturing one of three things: their careers, their relationships or themselves. Let’s start with your career. Nurturing your work life isn’t about quickly responding to emails as they land in your inbox. It’s about attending to activities that you rarely have enough time for over the course of a normal day. Take Debbie Moysychyn, an organizational health care executive who’s helping Brand University build up their health-care education department. She wanted to foster a collaborative, open-door culture in her office. That meant literally keeping her door open and letting people know that they were free to pop in at any time for a chat. It was a great idea, but there was a problem. Constant, short meetings with her colleagues ended up distracting her from other tasks. In the end, she just didn’t have enough time for projects that were important to her. Her solution? Setting aside her mornings to get her work done. That gave her the time and space to fully focus her mind on the task at hand without constantly worrying about interruptions. More importantly still, it allowed her to contribute to a better office culture over the rest of the day while still finishing her own projects. So that’s how your morning routine can help nurture your career. In the next blink, you’ll learn a bit more about how to nurture yourself and your relationships. Your career is important, but it’s just one of the pillars that support a fulfilling life. Relationships are another pillar. How often have you come home from work and found yourself too tired to spend quality time with your friends and family? Well, that’s why it’s time to start using your mornings to nurture your relationships! When you think about it, mornings are actually the perfect opportunity to spend time with those you love. After all, you won’t be drained after a long day in the office or longing to vegetate in front of the TV. There are all sorts of ways you can start getting the most out of the early hours. Why not have sex at dawn with your partner? Or you could make breakfast the new dinner – a time to gather round the table with the whole family. Whatever you do, it’s a great way of staying in touch with the most important people in your life. Take it from Kathryn Beaumont Murphy, a busy tax lawyer whose punishing schedule involves plenty of late nights. She decided to make a change when she noticed how her work life was preventing her from spending time with her daughter. After talking to the author, she realized that her law firm rewarded late hours rather than early starts. Mornings were usually calm, and there was little that required urgent attention. Beaumont decided to start going to bed earlier so she could add a couple of hours onto her day in the morning. Her new routine proved infectious. Now the whole family rises early and makes an effort to make breakfast special! That brings us to the third pillar you need to take care of if you want a more balanced life: self-care. “Me time” is usually one of the first things to be sacrificed when life gets hectic. Responsibilities, work and social commitments often trump the time you’ve earmarked for yourself. The answer is to free up time for self-nurture in the morning. Ask yourself what it is that really matters to you. Some people want to train for a marathon, others to read more, write poetry, meditate or paint. Whatever it is, you can take a cue from the executives James Citrin interviewed. By getting up early, they make time to do what they love. Now that you’ve seen just how much you can get done in the morning, it’s time to ask the all-important question: How do you start putting your new morning routine into action? There are five key steps. In this blink, you’ll learn about the first two. Start making your morning more productive by recording how you spend your time over the week. A week has 168 hours. If you want to get the most out of that and improve your time management, you need to know where all that time is going. The problem isn’t usually how you spend your mornings but what you do with the rest of the day. Late nights are especially detrimental to your ability to make an early start, but it’s easy to fall into the trap. Maybe you’re writing emails or just watching TV. Whatever it is, burning the candle at both ends isn’t viable in the long run. Eventually, you’ll be too tired to get up early. That said, you might be able to free up an hour or two early on in the day once you start recording how you spend your time. Maybe you can give your kids lunch money rather than packing their lunch boxes yourself. So that’s step one – grab a notebook and start tracking your time! Step two is simple: picture your ideal morning. To do that, ask yourself what your perfect start to the day would look like. Now that you’ve made a record of how you use your time, you can start envisioning how things could be different. Consider the author. Her dream morning starts at 6:20 a.m. That’s when she gets up, unless she’s in the mood for early morning sex. Otherwise, she hits the road ten minutes later for her 45-minute run. After that comes a hearty breakfast with the whole family together around the dining table. That’s the perfect chance to catch up and have a meaningful conversation. Finally, when everyone else has left the house, she sits down to work on her book and write an entry for her blog. That doesn’t have to be your perfect morning, of course. The key is to start picturing what an ideal start to the day looks like for you! Now that you have a better understanding of how you spend your time over the week and have pictured your perfect morning, let’s turn to the third step. This is all about logistics. Put differently, it’s about figuring out if your ideal morning routine is doable. Start by calculating how much time you’d actually need for it. Can you make changes in other areas to accommodate your new plans? Say you want to free up some extra time to prepare breakfast. Well, you could spend five minutes in the shower rather than fifteen. Remember, forewarned is forearmed. If you want your new plan to succeed, you’ll need to map everything out. If you’ve made it this far, you’ve reached the most exciting step – creating your new habits! It takes time to cement new habits. So start slow and be patient. Sometimes it takes weeks to get into the groove of a new routine. Taking your time is especially important, because you don’t want to feel overwhelmed by the end of the first fortnight. That’s the crunch point, when sticking to your regimen gets tricky. Not taking on too much will help keep your motivation levels high enough to get through this rough patch. So if you’ve decided you want to spend your mornings running, meditating and writing, start by doing just one of those activities. You can always add others later on. Rewards, or what the author calls “bribes,” are also useful when it comes to motivation. If you’ve done well and stuck to your plan, give yourself a treat. That could be something like opera tickets or a meal in a nice restaurant. Finally, step five. This is essentially about fine-tuning your routine. Life is full of sudden changes. If you want your new routine to stick, you’ll have to be adaptable and learn to make constant adjustments and readjustments. Take it from the author, an avid morning runner. When she was expecting her first daughter, she had to change her regimen. Running just wasn’t possible as her pregnancy progressed. So she put it on the back burner and devoted more time to nurturing herself. But now that her children are older, there’s more time for running again. Today, she’s back to her old routine and spends three quarters of an hour running before sitting down for breakfast with her family. Weekends are your opportunity to get some well-deserved rest and recharge your mental and physical batteries, which are integral to your well-being. But it’s all too easy to waste these precious hours on a random hodgepodge of activities. By the time Monday rolls round, you realize you haven’t gotten as much out of your time off as you could have. There’s a simple way of making weekends more meaningful: planning ahead. Rather than spontaneously deciding what to do come Saturday morning, make a list of between three and five anchor activities a couple of days in advance. That’s a good way of avoiding one of the classic ways of wasting a weekend – “doing nothing,” something that’s always an attractive option at the end of a draining week. The problem is that there’s no such thing as doing nothing in the digital age. In the past, people might have spent their time lounging on a lawn listening to the birds and watching the clouds go by. Today, you’re more likely to be watching TV, surfing the internet and checking your social media. Having a plan cuts all that pointless low-key activity out. There’s no need to go overboard and decide what you’ll be doing every minute of the day; you just need a couple of activities to structure your weekend around. What those are is entirely up to you. You might want to go on a picnic with your family or go to the movies. And there’s one more thing to keep in mind. If you want to get the most out of your weekend, make sure to plan out-of-the-ordinary activities and learn to savor the sense of anticipation as the week winds down. The point of weekends is that they’re not like the rest of the week. What you need is a break. That’s why it’s so important to do things you wouldn’t do on any of the other five days. That takes a bit of thought, which is why you’ll need to plan ahead. But planning has its own benefits. Knowing that you’ve got something fun penciled into your diary gives you something to look forward to. You should take pleasure in that. Just think of the way anticipation is such an essential part of Christmas. Waiting to open your presents is what makes the occasion so special! So now you know how important planning is. In the next blink, we’ll explore some practical tips to help you go about doing that. There are lots of different ways of planning your weekend. Let’s take a look at a couple of strategies you can start putting into action today. The first tip is to make a list of your top one hundred dreams. That might sound like a lot, but there’s a good reason to jot down so many. If you only listed your top ten dreams, you’d likely end up with extravagant wishes like visiting the ancient ruins of Mexico or having a private dinner in the Louvre. There’s nothing wrong with dreaming big, of course, but you’re unlikely to do anything as extravagant as that on an average weekend! Once you start extending the list, however, you’ll get to the things you can do on a regular Saturday or Sunday. That might be something like drinking a huge strawberry milkshake while your kids are busy playing in the park. So grab a notebook and start writing! Even better, get your partner or family members to do the same. You can see where you overlap and start coordinating a fantastic weekend together. But remember, planning doesn’t mean accounting for every second. Loose plans are fine, so keep it simple. You don’t need more detail than “Sunday lunch with Anne and Peter” or “Take the children to the beach on Saturday afternoon.” Finally, there’s downtime. Weekends are your chance to rejuvenate. If you want to get some rest, plan it in. That’s even possible if you have a house full of exuberant young children. The key is to let your kids know that rest is important to you. So if you want an hour’s nap, tell them that’s what you’re planning. Soon enough, that’ll become part of your household’s routine. You can make that even easier by accounting for their needs at the same time. Why not pencil in an hour of screen time for them while you’re dozing? Follow these tips and you’ll soon be enjoying restful and pleasurable weekends that set you up for the week ahead. Which brings us to our next topic – work. In the next couple of blinks, we’ll take a look at how improving your time management can help your career. How much time do you spend working, sleeping and doing chores? Tally it up and then ask yourself a question: Are you really sure that’s right? Most people think they know where their hours go, but it’s common to overestimate some things, such as sleep, and underestimate others, such as housework. Work falls into the first category. People generally overestimate. That makes getting a realistic overview of how you spend your time key. The trick is to learn to mind your hours. This technique will help you optimize your time management at work. Pay careful attention to your hours and you might realize that you actually work a 50-hour, not an 80-hour, week. There’s a simple enough reason for these kinds of assumptions: people overestimate the time it takes to do things they don’t like and underestimate the time they spend doing things they do like. That’s why chores or writing emails seem to take an age, but you never feel as though you’ve gotten enough sleep. The former are unpleasant activities while the latter is something everyone loves. Keeping a time log will give a much more realistic overview of your days. Aim to record your allotment of time over an entire week, making a note of all the hours spent working, tidying and so on. You can use a spreadsheet or an app, if it helps. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready for the next step. This is all about using your time log to help you plan your week more wisely. That will make your work much more productive. Take it from Michael Soenen, the mind behind EmergencyLink, a website that stores personal information such as your medical history for the use of emergency first responders. He uses his Sunday afternoons to think about EmergencyLink’s priorities over the coming weeks. Once he’s worked them out, he shares his insights with his team. That means everyone knows exactly what they need to do on Monday morning, which enables them to use their time effectively rather than running around like headless chickens. So pencil some planning time into your calendar. You’ll find that when you plan for things to happen, they usually do. You might just get around to writing that annual report you’ve been putting off for so long! Success is the fruit of planning. To be successful, you first have to make success possible. That sounds like a tautology, right? Well, there’s actually more to it than meets the eye. Laying the groundwork for success is all about carefully choosing your priorities for the day ahead – every day. To do that, you need an accountability system that won’t let you down. Let’s start with the first part. Setting lofty goals is all well and good, but it means you’ll often end up falling short. That’s because there’s no way for you to achieve them on a daily basis. Take the well-known American fitness entrepreneur Chalene Johnson. She sold two of her businesses to the fitness company Beachbody and became one of their consultants. Her long-term aim was to make the firm more profitable. But that’s just not something you can do on an average day in the office. Johnson’s solution was to set herself smaller and more achievable daily goals. By hitting her targets every day, she worked, slowly but surely, toward fulfilling her bigger ambition. For example, she’d aim to arrange a teleconference with her CEO to talk marketing one day and set up a meeting with a project partner to discuss strategy another. Achieving these smaller goals kept her motivation levels sky-high. Accountability is the second key to achieving success. It’s all about sharing your aims with someone else. Call them an “accountability partner.” Their role is to check in and let you know whether you’ve met your daily or weekly targets. So much for planning. The next step on the road to success is to cut out tasks that feel like work but don’t actually achieve anything. Think of emails. Writing and answering a hundred messages is part and parcel of today’s digital world. Some of them are essential, of course, but it’s easy to end up feeling utterly swamped while not really getting anything done. Sometimes it’s better to shut your inbox and get down to what really matters. That might be working on a presentation or preparing for an upcoming team meeting. Cut out distractions and you’ll find that the really important tasks actually take far less time than you’d imagined! There are things we’ve all heard a million times before and yet still find hard to put into action. In this final blink, we’ll take a look at some time-honored truths it might be useful to remind yourself of. First off – practice makes perfect. One of the great obstacles to improvement is running on autopilot. Consider driving. You get into your car, turn the ignition key and hit the road. By the time you’ve arrived at your destination, you can barely remember your journey. That’s a handy skill, but it doesn’t make you a better driver. If you want to improve, you need to practice deliberately. Think of an aspiring author. Would she be better off writing endless reams of prose or asking one of her peers to read and critique her work? The second option is the harder of the two. After all, criticism stings, even when it’s well meant. But it’s also the only way forward. The writer who asks for help and adjusts her style to take on board the critique she’s received will simply be a better stylist than the hermit working on autopilot. Next up is learning to keep a deposit of career capital you can use for future opportunities. Career capital is basically everything you’ve earned so far during your work life – your experience, networks, skills and professional personality. Think of it as a currency you can use to buy new opportunities, such as a promotion. Keeping your account well-stocked means that you’ll be able to afford more. One of the best ways of making sure your account is in the black is to nurture your relationships. That’s all about establishing trust. When people know they can rely on you, they’re much more likely to pass on tips and throw in a good word for you. Finally, there’s happiness. The more attentive you are to signs of success, the happier you’ll be. That’s backed up by a study carried out by Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile and developmental psychologist Steven Kramer. In their book The Progress Principle (2012), they looked at 12,000 diary entries by different teams in several organizations across the United States. They found that 76 percent of the days on which employees were happy were also days on which they made a breakthrough. Noticing the signs of success – like positive feedback or a eureka moment during a difficult project – is sure to make you happier, too! The key message in these blinks: Proper time management won’t just make your mornings less hectic and keep your stress levels down, it’ll also boost your productivity in the office and help you get the most out of your weekends. The key is learning how to keep track of time. Once you know where all that time goes, you can start making plans to use your hours more efficiently. And that’s great for your career and your personal life! Actionable advice: Take it slow and go easy on the to-dos. Weekends are all about rejuvenation. They’re your chance to take some time out and recharge your batteries. That doesn’t just mean getting rest, though. Like a holiday, they’re about doing the things you don’t have time for in your everyday life. So don’t spoil them by working through an endless list of chores! Think about what you’d really like to do. Maybe it’s a day trip or just enjoying a coffee in a café. Whatever it is, make your plans and stick to them. The laundry can usually wait until Monday evening! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You don’t know any of the other attendees; your heart begins to pound, your hands go clammy and you retreat to some inconspicuous corner, pretending to be occupied with your phone. How to break the ice? How to start a conversation? Or maybe you’re baffled by yourself: Why do I act so awkwardly, you wonder – I’m not even shy! Well, there are perfectly reasonable answers to such questions, and these blinks lay them out. You’ll learn why people often feel uncomfortable in new situations and, perhaps more importantly, what you can do to be more at ease. You’ll also discover that anxiety is part of evolution; why having a script for new situations isn’t the best approach; and how to properly introduce yourself. We all have to be the newbie at some point: we change jobs, change residence, sign up for new classes and so on. But no matter how often we’re the new person in the room, most of us feel anxious about it. And for good reason. Throughout our biological and cultural evolution, we came to naturally fear the unknown. In prehistoric times, we didn’t meet many new people. According to evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar, it was normal, back then, to interact with only around 150 other people, and to encounter no more than 300 or 400 others in a lifetime. If we happened to meet strangers or enter unknown territory, it made more sense to be anxious and aggressive, as it was unclear whether one would be stolen from or even killed. There was no evolutionary incentive whatsoever to remain calm in new situations. According to experts on child development, we’ve retained this fear of strangers; infants, for instance, begin to show anxiety around unfamiliar people at six months of age. This feeling is then reinforced by parents and teachers, who constantly warn their children against talking to strangers. At the same time, however, we have a fear of being excluded from groups. For more social species, like humans, there are powerful incentives to be part of a group, as exclusion can be dangerous. For example, when male monkeys are kicked out of their birth group and into the world, half of them will either be killed or die of starvation before they are able to find a new group. These days, belonging to a group isn’t crucial to survival, but we still tend to long for inclusion. Modern culture fuels this by stating that only losers are incapable of finding a community. So, we feel anxious in new situations and yet still want to fit in. How to solve this paradox?  Think of the new situations you’ve been in recently. Did you feel comfortable? If, instead, you felt stressed and anxious – as so many of us do – you might be wondering why. Why haven’t we learned to relax? Blame a lack of mindful reflection. Without it, we don’t improve over time. Once people reach a certain level of performance, they start paying less attention to how they perform. Take driving, for instance. Once we’ve learned the basic skills, we cease paying conscious attention. Similarly, most people have developed a certain “script” for dealing with new situations, and they blindly follow it. For example, when meeting somebody new in the office, you might simply say your name, your position, how long you’ve been at the company and then ask about your conversation partner’s position. Although these scripts can prevent us from becoming overwhelmed, they can also make us feel anxious, as they prevent us from really thinking about how to handle new situations. Therefore, if you want to get better at being new, you must adopt a different mindset. You can try, for example, various ways of seeing new situations as opportunities to learn. Here are three approaches you might try: The first is the coach mindset, where you think of a new situation as training so you can get better with practice and feedback. You could also adopt a gamer mindset and think of new situations like a social video game, where you try to win by improving each time you’re in an unfamiliar situation. Our approach to life is often too serious, so why not turn it into a fun challenge now and again? Lastly, you may want to try the beginner’s mindset and walk into each new situation anticipating the excitement of learning something new. This also lets you accept any mistakes as those of a beginner, rather than as signs of personal failure. Successful and effective communication begins with a proper introduction. In new situations, people are often reluctant to introduce themselves, preferring to wait for others to make the first move. Perhaps you’re afraid of bothering others. But you should let that go. Think about it: have you ever gotten angry at somebody for disturbing you in order to introduce themselves? No! Still, people worry that a weak introduction will create a poor first impression. This is an understandable fear; however, making a bad first impression is far better than not introducing yourself at all. One way of overcoming such worries is to create an introduction strategy. Here’s how it works: At an appropriate time, offer a greeting. Give your name, say who you are and why you’re introducing yourself. It’s often wise to ask if now is a fine time to introduce yourself, thus ensuring that you’re not disturbing something important. Then you could say, for example, that you’re the new marketing assistant and you sit in the opposite room, so you’ll probably be running into each other often.  Remember to be brief, respectful and acknowledge the prospective relationship by saying why you should know each other. Later, you can follow up your introduction with a chat, which will establish the basis of your relationship. The goal here is to learn about each other, find out what you have in common and how you can connect in the future. If you get stuck and are unsure how to navigate the conversation, ask questions about the other person. This is effective as it shows respect and interest. It’s also a good idea to write down what you have learned about the other person. You may think you’ll remember all the details, but it’s far too easy to mix up people’s names, roles or backgrounds. By writing down everything as soon as you can after the conversation, you’ll be in a far better position to avoid awkwardness and anxiety in the future. Remembering names is crucial to social interaction. So why is it such a struggle for us to recall them? Blame it on evolution! Our prehistoric brain wasn’t designed to remember names. In prehistoric times, we interacted with a very limited number of people. Only relatively recently did remembering many names become a necessity. Additionally, a person’s name is stored in a different brain region than the other information we associate with that person. That’s why it’s easy for some people to remember faces, occupations or hobbies, but not names. Furthermore, a psychological phenomenon called context-dependent recall might also hinder name recollection. Context-dependent recall is when your memory for something or someone is tied only to the associated context or environment. For example, you may recall someone’s name easily at the office, but if you meet that person during the weekend in a shopping mall, their name may suddenly escape you. But don’t panic. There are some useful name-recall strategies you can use to prevent such embarrassing situations. Here are a few of them: Imagine that the person whose name you’re trying to remember is standing next to a friend of yours with the same name. Say you’re introduced to a guy named Peter; if Peter is also the name of one of your friends, then visualize your friend standing next to the new Peter.  Another trick is to imagine the new person’s name written across their face.  Repeating the new name during the conversation is also a good method. You can ask how it’s spelled or correctly pronounced, or say something like, “Hello, Brian, nice to meet you.” And then repeat the name at the end of the conversation to help your brain process it. To become a swiftly integrated newbie, you’ll need to get information, help and advice from others. The problem is, this is precisely the time when you’re most reluctant to ask questions. Why is this? Well, when asking a question, we often experience an irrational fear. We tend to overestimate the possibility of being refused when asking for help, worrying that others are going to judge us or think us incompetent. Fortunately, there are some simple rules you can follow when asking questions that can help you assuage these irrational fears. People often appreciate questions if you approach them with an I want to learn mindset – as opposed to a solve my problem one. The first attitude gives people the impression that you want to do something yourself, but just don’t yet know how; the second one basically says that you want someone else to do your job for you. So, instead of asking someone to, for example, enter data into the system for you, ask them to show you how to do it. It also pays to be concise and avoid multi-part questions. Don’t ask, in one breath, how a system works, who is responsible for it and what happens when you click here instead of there. Bundles of questions create confusion and only one part tends to get answered in the end. Lastly, the best weapon you have when asking questions is saying that you’re new. If you say this, people are more willing to help you out and less likely to consider your question (or you) stupid. They’re also more likely to forgive you when you make mistakes. Do you ever catch yourself thinking, “I really hope this person likes me,” but doubting that they actually do? Well, you’re not the only one! Most of us are preoccupied with how others feel about us. Unfortunately, this also causes us to misinterpret social signals. Fearing rejection, we become so sensitive to anything that might signal it that we tend to interpret all ambiguous or even neutral behavior as evidence of dislike. Let’s say it’s your first week at work and you’re worried that nobody will like you. On your second morning, one of your new coworkers hurries past you in the hallway without saying hello. It’s easy to interpret this as their not liking you or not wanting to talk to you. In reality, however, they were probably just late to a meeting. So, when trying to start a new relationship, always put yourself in the other person’s shoes. If you were a long-time employee and a newbie approached you, would you be happy to talk to them? Most people would, so there is no reason to be worried. Aside from worrying less about ambiguous social signals, it’s important to be positive and focus on giving others energy when starting a new relationship. Make sure that people feel energized by your interactions. People gain energy when they feel understood, when their ideas and opinions are validated and respected and when others show genuine interest in them. So listen to people! This encourages people to talk about themselves, and communicates that you appreciate and understand them. Conversely, attempting to impress others with your own accomplishments tends to sap energy. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t talk about yourself, but just keep it balanced by also talking about your conversation partner. Finally, it’s vital to stay positive. When you talk positively about others, people will automatically attribute those sentiments to your personality, too. Feelings of unfamiliarity can breed a whole host of problems. You may be reluctant to contribute or share creative ideas at work; you might quit your new hobby after just two classes. This is what happens when we’re afraid to perform in front of people we don’t know. But what is the reason behind this reluctance? In one study, educational researcher Carol Dweck found that, at an early age, we develop a certain mindset called talent is fixed. We subconsciously believe that we’re born with certain talents and when something doesn’t immediately come easily to us, we conclude that we’re bad at it. To make matters worse, parents and teachers strengthen this fixed mindset by labeling us as smart or good at particular things. A healthier approach is the getting-better mindset. This focuses on talent being developed through learning, effort and practice. To open up to this mindset you must understand that your first performance says very little about your talents, so there’s no point in worrying about imperfections. All you need to do is focus on getting better by learning and asking for help. Another benefit to this mindset is that people perceive it positively. It shows respect when you ask for help or feedback, and you show humility by acknowledging that you still have a lot to learn. A getting-better mindset means you must maintain a realistic view of your mistakes. We tend to grossly overestimate how much others notice our screw-ups. The fact is, however, that other people are generally far more preoccupied with their own performances or thoughts than with what you’re doing! If they do notice your mistake, they’re more likely to attribute it to inexperience than incompetency or a lack of talent, so don’t beat yourself up about it! Keep in mind that you’re learning. Your first performance isn’t an accurate representation of your talent, worthiness or abilities. The key message in this book: Being anxious in new situations is natural. In order to overcome fear of the unfamiliar, you must change your mindset, put yourself into other people’s shoes and practice some simple techniques for introducing yourself. Ask questions and remember names. And don’t forget: we all make mistakes at first.  Actionable advice: Experiment with energy exchange. To build healthy relationships, employ what scientist call reciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism is when other people help us and it sparks an instinctive urge to help them in return. You can use this to your advantage by giving energy to others through listening to and appreciating them. When you do this, they’ll be inclined to pay you back by being ready to listen you, appreciate you or help you out. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Even in today’s supposedly woke world, many women are still playing by the old rules of the patriarchy. These rules tell girls not to venture off the beaten track. They tell women to be thankful for what they’re given and not to ask for more. Worst of all, they tell females that other women are the competition, and they must be in a constant battle for scarce feminine power. Thankfully, Abby Wambach is here to give you some new rules. Drawing on nearly two decades of teamwork and sporting successes with other women, Wambach will show you that, far from being your adversaries, other women are your wolf pack. With them at your side, you can achieve bigger goals, overcome any obstacles in your way and unleash your true potential. In these blinks, you’ll discover why women need to embrace failure; how gratitude can hold women back; and the qualities a great leader really needs. Society likes to remind us that disobedient girls pay a high price for their waywardness. Just consider the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, the young girl who ignores clear instructions to continue along the path and avoid the woods. What happens to her? The Big Bad Wolf, that’s what. The moral of this fairytale is obvious – rules exist to be followed, and little girls shouldn’t get too curious. And yet, as she reflects on her life and career, Abby Wambach can’t see a lot of truth in this old story. In fact, the best things in her life happened when she followed in Little Red Riding Hood’s footsteps and veered off the beaten track. As a teenager, for example, Wambach dated boys. Why? Because it seemed to be what every other girl her age was doing. But something was missing from these early encounters, and during high school, she realized she was gay. Scared of her family’s judgment, Wambach initially hid this part of her identity, even from herself. Toward the end of high school, though, she fell in love and finally embraced her sexuality. This was her first taste of what it meant to step off the beaten path and go against the grain, following her heart rather than the status quo. Wambach’s most cherished role models are women who have chosen their own way in life, too. Indeed, Wambach’s incredible sporting career couldn’t have happened without the trailblazing female soccer players that came before her, who refused to accept the status quo and the idea that soccer was a man’s sport. These were the women who went into battle to bring about Title IX, the federal law dictating that no one, whether male or female, should experience educational discrimination, including on the sports field. It was these women who created leagues for professional women’s soccer and fought for a living wage for professional female soccer players. Given how much of her career and happiness has come about by her and other women’s refusal to do what society tells them to do, or stay on the designated path, Wambach now believes that all women should strive to be less like Little Red Riding Hood, and more like the wolf – powerful, courageous, and hungry for more. When Wambach retired from professional soccer in 2015, ESPN honored her incredible career with an Icon Award at their glamorous awards show, the ESPYS. Standing on the stage that night, Wambach was filled with gratitude toward the sporting world for allowing her to experience this moment. But as she lay in bed that night, her ears still ringing with applause, the gratitude melted away and was replaced with a darker emotion – anger. Wambach’s rage stemmed from a moment earlier in the evening when she had shared the ESPYS stage with two more retiring athletes who also received Icon awards, Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning. As she, Bryant and Manning left the stage, it suddenly struck Wambach that, though all three of them were world-class athletes with equal amounts of grit, commitment and dedication to their sports, there was one inescapable difference between her and them. They were men, and she was a woman, which meant that while they could look forward to a leisurely retirement, she would have to think about her next career move. Bryant and Manning had financial freedom, something rarely afforded to female athletes. Even a brief glance at the numbers highlights the frustrating inequity between male and female sports stars. For instance, the male winners of the 2018 FIFA World Cup collectively took home a staggering $38 million, nineteen times more money than the Women’s World Cup winners were awarded in 2015. This inequality is even more shocking when you consider the fact that the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team brought in over $6 million in revenue, while their male counterparts made less than $2 million. Of course, the gender pay gap isn’t just a problem in sports. It’s an issue for women everywhere. In 2018, American women in every age group and industry made just 81% of their male equivalents’ earnings. What’s the cause of this continuing inequality? Wambach believes that part of the problem is gratitude, that fleeting emotion she experienced on the ESPYS stage that night. Specifically, women are often so overwhelmed with gratitude at just being included, recognized or given a paycheck at all that they’re fearful of asking for more. To close the gender pay gap, women must learn to use their voices and demand equality. As a promising young player on the Youth National team, Wambach was given an exciting peek into her idols’ lives during a tour of the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team locker room. As she tried to take in everything around her, one item stood out – a photograph. Someone had put up an image from the 1995 world cup match between the U.S. Women’s Team and their Norwegian counterparts. But something didn’t make sense. Wambach knew that this was a game that her heroes had lost. Why, she wondered, was a photo of their defeat taking pride of place in their locker room? Five years on, when she joined the national team herself, Wambach finally plucked up the courage to ask about that photograph. The answer she received would change her outlook on failure forever. Veterans on the team told her that although their biggest priority was to win games, that didn’t mean that they were scared of losing them. Far from rejecting the idea of failure, the team was determined to remember every single setback they had endured. Why? Because to these players, failure meant one thing – fuel. Fuel to get out there and prove to themselves that they could come back stronger than ever. Did this strategy work? Well, Wambach’s teammates said the year after they put up that photograph, they won their first gold medal at the Olympics. This story taught Wambach to harness the potential of failure. Unfortunately, many women are never able to do that. They believe they must do everything perfectly, an old expectation imposed by the patriarchy. This means that when women experience failure and realize they aren’t perfect, they lose their nerve. They start to believe they were imposters all along. In contrast, men are more comfortable with their own imperfections and don’t see any reason why they shouldn’t succeed and lead despite them. Just consider the fact that imperfect men have been given permission to rule the world throughout history – from the Roman emperors to every single U.S. president. So, when it comes to failure, take a page out of the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team’s book – or simply do as men have been doing for thousands of years. The most exhilarating moments of any soccer match come when a goal is scored. During her extraordinary career, Wambach has been responsible for many of these moments herself. In fact, in international games alone, she’s scored 184 goals! But if you get a chance to see her score, take a closer look at what she does in the seconds after the ball hits the back of the net. Look carefully, and you’ll see that as her ecstatic teammates run toward her, Wambach is always pointing at them. What’s behind this trademark gesture? Recognition. She’s pointing at the other players in recognition that it was they who made her success possible. That’s the thing about soccer. Even though you might be the one who scored the goal, you couldn’t have done it without the protection of your team’s defenders, the boundless energy of your midfielders or the players on the bench who spurred you on with their tireless cheering. When players celebrate a goal, they’re not really cheering themselves – they’re celebrating their teammates above all else. Of course, in soccer and in life, there are times when it won’t be you who scores. It will be the woman beside you. In these moments, it’s crucial that you start running in her direction, celebrating her achievement. On the field, this sort of behavior is commonplace. But in real life, women can find it harder to praise each other’s successes. Society gives women the message that they are competitors against each other, instead of champions for one another. Women have been told that female power is a scarce resource. Wambach believes that this scarcity is nothing but an illusion. Female power, happiness and achievement aren’t zero-sum games or a cake in which a larger piece for one of us means a smaller piece for the rest. Instead, we should be thinking of female empowerment as an infinite fountain from which we all can drink. Once we realize we have nothing to fear from each other’s success, we can all help each other to drink from this fountain. We can stop fighting each other for that one token chair at the table of patriarchy. Instead, we’ll work together to construct a bigger, better table, with a seat for every one of us. When Wambach was just eighteen years old, she had the chance to test her mettle against one of her heroes. The hero in question was Michelle Akers, one of the world’s greatest soccer players. As luck would have it, Akers needed to get some extra training in, and she agreed to play a match against Wambach’s youth team. By the end of the game, Wambach’s view of herself was permanently changed. Despite the exciting circumstances, the game started in a relaxed fashion, with Akers giving her younger opponents plenty of coaching tips on how to improve their game. However, as the match headed into its final minutes, Akers realized that her own team was three goals down, and in serious danger of losing. That’s when Akers took control. Without a second thought, she screamed at her teammate to give her the ball. Once she had it in her possession, Akers dribbled it confidently down the pitch, effortlessly bypassing Wambach’s whole team, and kicked the ball into the back of their net. Then she did exactly the same thing again. Three more times, until she had won the game. Seeing Akers demand to be passed the ball that day, not just once, but four times, changed Wambach’s outlook forever. Until that match, Wambach had been afraid to showcase her talents. Deep down, she worried that her teammates would resent her for outshining them. Thus, in an effort to be humble and avoid offending anyone, she had only been playing at around three-quarters of her capacity. But then she witnessed Akers demanding the ball. Here was a woman who burned with power and competitive spirit. Here was a player who shamelessly shouted out her desire to win, and who clearly believed she was the woman who could make that win happen. When Akers screamed at the goalie to give her the ball, she was announcing her confidence in her own ability and giving the game her full talent – not just some of it, as Wambach had been doing. Seeing Akers deploy every bit of her power that day freed Wambach to unleash hers, too. Even now, whenever she feels unworthy or incapable of doing something, she thinks back to that game, and Akers’s unabashed determination to win. Sometimes it’s easier to be aggressive than vulnerable. In 2008, the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team knew all about aggression. They were the world’s best team, and the secret of their success was physical dominance. Under Wambach’s co-captaincy, the team unashamedly won games by intimidating and strong-arming their opponents. So imagine the team’s horror when their new coach, Pia Sundhage, produced a guitar during their first training session together, and gently sang a Bob Dylan song to them. What was the rationale behind Pia’s singing session that day? Well, she wanted to show Wambach and her teammates that leadership doesn’t always have to resemble power and dominance. By reaching for her guitar, Pia gave the players an example of an authentic, vulnerable leader who wasn’t afraid to reveal her true personality. Through this eccentric performance, Pia demonstrated that the best leaders don’t imitate society’s ideas of how a leader should behave – they simply strive to be themselves. Interestingly, Pia’s unconventional leadership style led to positive and permanent changes in how the whole team interacted with each other. Before her arrival, the team was run like a dictatorship. Wambach and other senior figures issued instructions, while more junior players had little input into decision-making. But under Pia’s tutelage, the team’s ideas about leadership all began to change. Wambach and the other captains permitted themselves to be more vulnerable and began listening to what others had to say. And the more junior players saw that if Pia could make herself vulnerable and still be a leader, maybe they could also find ways to lead. Gradually, the team’s leadership structure became more democratic. Newbies like Alex Morgan gave Wambach tips on how to play better, players on the bench gave the starting players advice and even the team’s physiotherapists started to make suggestions. Wambach believes that all teams, even beyond sports, can learn a lesson from this shift in how we define leadership. Specifically, we can learn that the best teamwork occurs when leaders aren’t afraid to discard old hierarchies and listen to their followers’ voices. If you’re a leader who’s humble and authentic enough to do this, you may just find that everyone in the team has a valuable contribution to make. After seventeen incredible years of professional soccer, Wambach finally retired. And with retirement came rest. In fact, she gave her body a full three years to recover from decades of physical exertion. When that time was up, she got back into exercise by starting a running program. This should have been easy for a former professional sportswoman, right? Wrong. Every time she ran, Wambach’s whole body ached. After years of doing far more exercise than this, Wambach wondered, why was she suffering so much now? Eventually, her friend Michele hit on the problem. When Wambach pushed herself to the limit on the soccer pitch, she was part of a team of other women who were all doing the same. Physical pain and suffering were part of the job, but hardship was softened by plenty of jokes and words of encouragement shared by teammates. Now she was a lone wolf, without the support and camaraderie of her wolf pack. It’s not just in sports that we need a wolf pack to share tough times with. In fact, women in all walks of life need sisterly support and encouragement. Wambach discussed this need for greater female solidarity in her commencement address to Barnard College, one of America’s most prestigious women’s universities. To her surprise, the speech went viral. Ordinary women reached out to Wambach, saying they were reading her speech to their young daughters at bedtime and telling their girlfriends about it. Some were even hanging wolf pictures in their homes to symbolize the need for more female wolf packs. As one woman who wrote to Wambach poignantly put it, men have always had their clubs, while women tend to feel alone. Whether we’re the token woman in the boardroom, the single mother at the playground or the housewife home alone, we are often isolated. So, how can we start building these wolf packs in our lives? Wambach believes that all you can do when attempting something new is to get out there and try. When it comes to building your wolf pack, this means seeking out women you trust and respect. It’s this philosophy that enabled Wambach and her teammates to win the World Cup in 2015, and to take gold medals in the Olympic Games – not just once, but twice. In fact, running with her pack of fierce and courageous women has rewarded Wambach with an extraordinary career and a lifetime of making her own choices, rather than following other people’s rules. Though you might not lead your wolf pack to sporting fame and glory, you can still gather women together, form unbreakable bonds and agree to go forward in a spirit of sisterhood, connection and joy. The key message in these blinks: Life in a patriarchal world convinces many women that they should color within the lines and never allow themselves to be powerful. But women like Abby Wambach and her teammates have learned to reject these limits by ditching the old rules of female animosity, womanly perfection and staying on the beaten track, and you can, too. Seek out brave, fierce females, and hold them close. Celebrate their wins, reach out for their love and support and show them the full force of your talent and power.  Actionable advice: Captain your own ship. Sometimes life leaves us on the sidelines. Instead of managing that big project at work, you’re stuck at home with the kids. Rather than being promoted, you’re still in the same job you’ve been doing for years. But just because you’re not front and center, this doesn’t mean you can’t be a leader. In fact, there’s ample opportunity for leadership in all of our lives – no matter our role. Whether you’re helping your elderly parent through their illness or cheering on your child as they play their first soccer game, it’s important to remember that leadership isn’t something that someone else gives to you. It’s actually the inherent right of women everywhere to determine their own future and to guide those whom they love. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The chances are that you too are one of them! And yet only a lucky few “make it,” becoming powerful leaders, sports champions or rock stars.  Who doesn’t want to be a winner? The question is, what’s the secret recipe? What do winners know that no one else does? These blinks take a close look at the success stories of winners, and in the process, give you the inside scoop on what it takes to make it to the top. In these blinks, you’ll learn how an entrepreneur launched an airline on a whim and won; why losing big once can turn you into a winner for life; and how you can benefit from living a life under pressure. If you’re reading this, you’ve decided you want to be a winner. Whether you’re shooting for the corner office or dreaming of rock ’n’ roll fame, there are a few essential things to know. First is strategy. Strategy is the how of winning. A strategy paves the way toward your goal; thus it is the most important aspect of becoming a winner. Former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov says that if you don’t commit to a strategy, you’re doomed to react to your opponents, allowing them to control the game. The what of winning is your objective. You need to determine what you want to win before you can lock down a successful strategy. For instance, if you want to lose weight, your objective might be to lose 10 pounds. Once you’ve defined your objective, then you can create a strategy to help you reach it. Yet a strategy is useless if your objective is essentially unattainable. Remember: winners set goals they can reach. In November 2013, Tony Pulis started managing the British soccer team Crystal Palace, a club struggling to stay in the Premier League. Pulis didn’t shoot for the stars and try to make the team Premier League champions in his first year. Instead, he set a realistic objective of securing the team’s position in the league – and he succeeded. However, don’t confuse your strategy with tactics, or the little steps in between that help you realize your strategy and ultimately, your objective. If your strategy to lose 10 pounds is to start dieting and perform exercises daily, your tactics will include things such as monitoring your caloric intake, taking the stairs instead of the elevator and joining a diet group. In the holy trinity of winning, strategy is just one aspect. The other two components are leadership and “teamship,” or the elements that make a winning team – let’s explore those next. So what does it take to become a great leader? There’s no one specific trait; each leader is outstanding in a different way. German Chancellor Angela Merkel possesses the ability to see what works in a given situation and to stick with it. Instead of offering grand gestures, she acts pragmatically. Because of these skills, Merkel is a winner, leading one of the European Union’s most powerful nations. During the recent eurozone crisis, for example, Merkel was steadfast even when politicians such as British Prime Minister David Cameron or US President Barack Obama pushed her to act faster or more boldly. Despite pressures all around her, Merkel would not be rushed, staying true to a time-proven strategy of being cautious and sticking to long-term goals. Winston Churchill became a great leader by recognizing Nazi Germany as a major threat early on, and he addressed this issue with a laser-like focus. In fact, his record as a winner wasn’t very impressive until World War II rolled around. Here’s his story: In 1899, Churchill as a young man tried his hand at politics but lost an election. After working as a war correspondent in South Africa, he returned to Britain and finally became a member of parliament (MP). Yet still he lost subsequent elections, eventually fighting his way back into government. By the 1920s, he was Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, leading the country’s return to the gold standard – a disastrous move that resulted in deflation and unemployment. Despite all this, Churchill is still one of history’s great leaders. Early on he saw the danger of Adolf Hitler and the aspirations of Nazi Germany. He channeled all his energies into finding ways to defeat the Nazis. It was this insight and determination that resonated deeply with the British people and made Churchill the great leader the world now remembers him to be. Next, we’ll explore the building blocks of successful teams, the third element in the holy trinity of winning. Do you think a soccer club composed of 11 athletic clones would be a winning team? Definitely not. A team with members who all have the same skills just won’t win. If you want to be a winner – in sports or business – you need to find a team with talents that complement your own. A team brings together people with different strengths – a winning strategy. As a winner, you need to find people for your team who excel in areas in which you struggle. For instance, you might be a great striker but a terrible defender. Naturally, you’d bring someone on your team who can defend the goal! Remember that a leader’s job is to define a team’s goals, strategy and tactics, ensuring that everyone on the team knows what to do. For example, a cycling team comprises athletes, mechanics, sports therapists, and so on. But in the follow car, the person with the walkie-talkie who is directing team tactics is the leader. After a leader comes the warriors. They’re not the “stars” of the show, but they make the engine run. For instance, consider the role of a bus driver during an election campaign. This person drives the bus, carrying a politician from meeting to rally. If a driver were unreliable, the whole campaign would collapse! The talent refers to people who make all the difference, the rare personalities who have something extra, who are more capable or knowledgeable than the pack. In politics, the talent is often the leaders themselves. Consider Hillary Clinton, who challenged Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primary in the United States, but lost. She then was named secretary of state, a preeminent “talent” on the president’s team. But being a winner isn’t just about strategy, solid teams and leadership. It’s also about what's on your mind. It’s often said that winning is all about mind-set. But what exactly does this mean? Are winners merely people who really want to win? Doesn’t everybody want to win? Of course, most people want to win, but not everyone fears losing. Many people are winners simply because they’re too scared to lose. Many winners have experienced the pain of defeat and will go to great lengths to avoid repeating the experience. Olympic gold medal swimmer Michael Phelps has won more gold medals than any Olympian in the history of the games. His motivation to win goes back to the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. That year, he was ready to compete but didn’t win a single meet. It was this failure that pushed him to work harder, and he never lost a race again! Winning isn’t just about motivation, however. It’s also about getting out of your comfort zone. While things that are familiar and easy might make you feel good, staying in a place where you’re comfortable will prevent you from winning big. For years, Garry Kasparov won chess tournament after chess tournament. His successes kept him firmly in his comfort zone and, certain that he’d win, he stopped testing new strategies or making bold moves. He thus stopped growing as a player, his skills stagnating. Finally, Vladimir Kramnik, an opponent, beat him and claimed Kasparov’s world title. To win, you’ve got to push yourself and get out of your comfort zone. In other words, you need to put yourself under pressure. Pressure influences both your body and mind, improving your ability to focus and think, and in turn, unlocking new heights of performance. Want to stand out from the crowd? You could always dress up like Superman. But for those who aren’t into costumes, there are other ways to get noticed – a key aspect of being a winner. To get noticed, you first have to be bold. When you act boldly, you’ll stand out because you’ll accept challenges that those people who are more reserved just wouldn’t. Being bold also helps you push past the fact that in many areas, you might be a novice – but still have the drive to achieve. Entrepreneur Richard Branson, for example, was just 17 years old when he launched a student newspaper. A few years later, he founded Virgin, a record business. Branson went on to found several other companies, including Virgin Airlines. All these projects had one thing in common – Branson committed despite a lack of experience in each field! Branson is dyslexic, a potential impediment when running a news organization. He also knew nothing about the music business but was, as a consumer, frustrated with the lack of labels for great music. What’s more, Branson also knew next to nothing about the airline business. His foray into aviation was launched when he was bumped off a flight to the Virgin Islands. Annoyed with the delay and poor service, he decided to launch his own airline. A bold move that made him a winner! Boldness will set you apart, and similarly, a hunger for innovation will help you win. But remember, innovation doesn’t necessarily mean invention. Instead, to innovate, you take a product, service or process and make it better. Thus a winner pays attention to the details and finds opportunities. Apple, for example, took an existing product like the mobile phone and improved it – a classic innovative, winning strategy. Have you ever noticed that so many events today are called a “crisis”? From minor disagreements between heads of state to a blogger’s bad hair day, “crises” seem to be everywhere and define everything. But none of these examples represent a real crisis – a situation that could overwhelm if you don’t make the right decisions. A soccer team losing a few matches isn’t a crisis. On the other hand, issues involving people potentially abusing power, such as US President Bill Clinton’s affair with intern Monica Lewinsky, could be considered a crisis in politics. Let’s examine this a bit more deeply. When a true crisis strikes, you need to stay focused. If you find yourself in a crisis, remember to keep your mind on what truly matters – the things over which you have influence. This is a key point. When Clinton’s relationship with Lewinsky was revealed, Clinton kept himself focused on the political issues at hand. When the media published the revelations, Clinton was on the phone with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, talking over concerns regarding Russian nuclear arms. Clinton knew the prosecutor’s report would be published that same day, but he didn’t know what it would say. He also wasn’t sure how friends, family or colleagues would react to the report. He did know, however, that he couldn’t control these things. What he could do was focus on doing his job. In the end, it was Clinton’s constant focus that earned him the respect he needed to make it through the crisis. The key message in this book: Winners come in all shapes and sizes. While winners share certain traits, such as boldness or innovation, their ability to beat the competition is also a result of the teams they build and their focus amid crises.  Actionable advice: When dealing with a crisis, be honest. If you find yourself in the middle of a crisis, you might feel like closing your eyes and wishing it to disappear – or worse, pointing the finger at someone else. These are not the best solutions and certainly not the easiest. Instead, do something radical: be honest.

Can you see them? Can you feel them? OK, relax, we’re not talking about invisible aliens. We’re talking about systems. Unlike invisible aliens, these systems really do influence so much of what we do every day. Whether it’s driving to work or running errands with the family, think about all the systems that affect you. The traffic on the highway, parking lots, fossil fuel prices, your company’s administrative processes, even the social systems of communication and language. Systems are everywhere. Once you start to see systems everywhere, you can start to think about how you can flip the script: Instead of them just affecting you, how can you work them? These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to be a better systems manager; why 100-percent-perfect systems aren’t the goal; and how systems are just as prominent at home as at work. Do you ever feel like you are just a helpless grain of sand in a dust storm of chaos beyond your control? Well, it’s not chaos that rules the world, but an underlying inherent order, even if we can’t always see it. Think about it: No one is in charge of running the world, yet everything works fine 99.9 percent of the time. How can this be? This is because systems, i.e., multitudes of diverse parts all working together to accomplish a single goal, are inherently inclined to stability and efficiency. There are all sorts of systems that work together perfectly every day without you even noticing. In some faraway place, for example, oil is extracted from the earth using carefully engineered methods and machinery. That oil is then transported to refineries by sea, road, rail or pipeline, and finally delivered to a myriad of gas stations for your convenience. When there is chaos or dysfunction within a system, it is largely the result of human flaws. Whereas systems tend to run smoothly, human beings are inclined to make mistakes. Unsatisfactory outcomes aren’t the consequence of fate or bad luck, but rather are proof of our ability to exert our influence on processes. The global financial crisis, for example, wasn’t blind bad luck. It was the result of a series of bad decisions made by people. Moreover, our assessment as to whether systems are functioning as they should is largely subjective, since what qualifies as a “positive outcome” depends so heavily on our perspective. For example, you may personally find it scandalous that gas prices are so high. An oil-exporting nation, however, will view the situation somewhat differently. The situation, however, is not unchangeable. For instance, governments could negotiate a better resource sharing scheme that benefits everyone. You see, you’re not just a grain of sand; you have influence, and can work the system to your advantage. Nearly everyone has at some stage sunk to a point where they felt that they’d never achieve their dreams because the game is simply rigged against them. This mind-set ensures that you’ll never get the change you want! It’s true: no one person has total control over all the systems that affect her life. There’s nothing you can do about it, so just accept it and move on. While you can exercise your right to vote in a democracy, for example, the overall result will be out of your hands. Your vote is just one among many, and complaining about it does nothing to change this fact. But that doesn’t mean you should scorn democracy. After all, you can still participate, and even though your vote might not singlehandedly swing an election, that doesn’t mean you are without influence. There are, however, many systems which are under your direct command. You have only to take charge of managing them to make things work in your favor. Most things don’t go the way we want because we don’t even try to change their outcomes. Consider democracy again: If you believe that you are truly powerless, then you might stop voting. That’s definitely not going to advance your cause. Or, to take a more day-to-day example, if you want to lose weight, you won’t shed any pounds through intention alone. Leaving it to chance won’t do it either. Rather, you’ll need to develop a plan – a diet, an exercise regimen or something similar – and set it in motion. So, let go of the circumstances that are out of your hands and focus instead on the systems that you can influence. This is the hand you’ve been dealt. Start playing it. How easy is it to miss the forest for the trees? It’s too easy, in fact. And yet we so often forget the obvious solution: distance. Indeed, you can only hope to understand the systems that steer your life and your position in society by stepping back and gaining the perspective of someone on the outside looking in. A cogwheel in a machine only knows about the other cogwheels that it touches. Only by seeing the cogwheels in relation to the rest of the machinery can you hope to understand how the mechanism actually works. Similarly, we often drift through our daily routines without any awareness of the different systems that we pass through and participate in each day, which can make it difficult for us to see our own role in these systems. But once you look at them from the right vantage point, you are in a better position to dissect these systems and see their interworking parts. Every system can be broken down into subsystems, and each subsystem into multi-step processes. By breaking systems down in this way, we can deal with manageable pieces and uncover the mechanisms that cause problems. Think about it this way: your mechanic would be useless if he didn’t know that a car is made of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems, and understand that these systems work together to set the car in motion. Every system is only as good as its components, so if you can step back and see the individual parts, then you’ll have a better idea of what problems need fixing. Now that you have a better understanding of what systems are, it’s time to look at how you can apply this knowledge to improve your professional and personal life. But first we have to set some ground rules. Start by defining your objectives and corresponding strategies in detail. If you don’t know what your objectives are, it becomes impossible to make decisions, as your choices will have no clearly motivated purpose. Like a ship without a compass, you won’t be able to tell whether you are drifting further away or getting closer to your goal if you don’t have a clear idea of what that goal is supposed to be. Second, realize that today’s problems are tomorrow’s opportunities. You don’t want to get into the habit of tackling problems as they arise. You want to pull out the problems at the root, thus pre-empting future difficulties. That means identifying which problems are symptomatic of flaws in your system. Your goal as a systems manager is to make systems work more smoothly. In this way, the problems that you discover are actually opportunities to improve the functionality of your systems. For example, breaking up with your partner might seem like the obvious solution for your dysfunctional relationship. That is, until you find yourself in the exact same situation with someone else a year later. You could have instead looked at your relationship as a system and identified the cause of the problem within that system. Maybe then you could have figured out what it was about yourself or your relationship style that made your relationship dysfunctional to begin with. You can influence all the systems that you belong to, whether they’re professional, personal, financial, social or biological. In the next blink, you will learn more about how to apply this to your business. A business isn’t a monolith. Rather, it is a complex organization comprised of various interoperating systems. So how can you hope to manage such complexity? Like every system, your business can be broken down into subsystems. By delegating the supervision of departments, that is, subsystems, you save yourself valuable time that can be invested in leadership instead. The head of human resources should deal with HR, the logistics manager with logistics and so on, drawing on your instructions but not requiring your input for every single decision. How could you possibly attend every HR, logistics, or sales meeting while also plotting the strategic course that each system should be following? When you are plotting this strategic course, you will need to be specific in defining objectives and guidelines. Remember the sailboat without a compass? You don’t ever want to find yourself in that position. If you don’t plot a course, then your business has no hope of producing the outcomes you want. This is your responsibility, i.e., the responsibility of a leader: setting the strategic course that guides these interoperating systems. Early in the author’s career he had set only vague goals for his company – things like making more profit – before finally discovering business mechanics. After internalizing the systems mind-set and appreciating the different systems around him, he was able to create more specific objectives and strategies that were actually useful in assessing his progress. For example, he set the specific company goal of becoming one of the top five players in the US market by increasing quality while reducing quantity. His new approach paid off almost instantly. Most people want their business to run like a well-oiled machine. But even a rusty old machine is a good starting point. By repairing the subsystems within your business, you have an opportunity to find huge value. Dysfunctional parts of your business essentially represent hidden profits waiting to be unlocked. So how should you approach their repair? Start by tackling the biggest problems – or dysfunctional parts – first, and work your way down all the way to the tiniest details. As your problem-solving becomes more specific, you’ll need less and less time to cope with dysfunctional parts, thus ensuring that you optimize your processes and increase profits as quickly as possible. But in order for your machine to run smoothly, your workers will have to know how to manage that machine. A consistent outcome is not the product of chance, but of detailed instructions. Involve your employees in writing step-by-step guides for every process, so that tasks are always carried out in the most efficient way possible. One reason computer programs are so efficient is because they perform a process the same way every single time, following a step-by-step protocol. Use this as a guide in making your systems as consistent and predictable as possible. Once you’ve put your systems in place, you can’t forget to maintain them. Every machine needs to be oiled, serviced and tuned. Don’t make the mistake of resting on your laurels. Even the best client relationship will turn sour, for example, if you neglect to give it the necessary attention. If you manage systems in a way that prevents problems and maintains a consistent quality of outcome, you will not only make more money, but also do so more efficiently. What is the right goal? Is it getting everything right? All 100 percent? When it comes to business, we’ll have to use a different logic. Here, 98 percent is good enough. Don’t waste time and money on trying to get things 100 percent right. In fact, 98 percent could be considered perfect, as achieving that last two percent requires so much additional effort that it would render the process inefficient! For example: How much time and energy would it take you to paint the fence? And how much extra time and energy would it take to paint it perfectly, without any streaks or imperfections? And would it even be worth it? Take this into consideration when you’re determining how you will maximize the efficiency of your systems. They don’t have to be perfect; they just have to be great. In the process of achieving your near-perfect system, be sure to never stop communicating. Indeed, the communication system is omnipresent in business as well as your personal life. Misunderstandings and conflicts arise from silence. If there is a problem, address it immediately. You can take steps to institutionalize communication and dialogue in your business by providing various opportunities for one-on-one and group communication, such as meetings. Beyond business, so many problems arise from a simple lack of communication. Even conflicts as huge as the Cold War were largely a result of poor communication. And it almost led to atomic war! Conversely, states that interact regularly through shared trust improve their cooperation, as is the case in the European Union. Aim to be more like them no matter whether it’s at home with your spouse or at the office with your colleagues. The key message in this book: Hard work doesn’t automatically lead to success, especially if you waste your efforts working on the wrong things. To make the most out of your work, you have to identify the systems within which you operate, and then discern, analyze and improve the dysfunctional parts in them.

Maybe speaking in front of strangers terrifies you. Maybe you break out in cold sweats during job interviews. Or maybe just choosing an outfit for the day is a daunting task. Well, it doesn’t have to be that way. All those potentially awkward, scary or embarrassing situations are actually pretty easy to handle – if you master a few basic tactics and techniques. These blinks will lay them all out. In these blinks, you’ll learn why wearing a bright tie can make you feel more confident; why you shouldn’t BS your way through a job interview; and how to give a toast that all the guests will remember. If you’ve applied for a job lately, you’ll know it’s common practice these days for companies to use an external recruiter to determine who gets an interview with the hiring manager. But sitting down for a meeting with a recruiter doesn’t have to be a stressful situation. With the right mindset, you can ace the meeting and get that call back. First off, it’s important to understand what a recruiter is looking for in an interview.  Contrary to what most people think, recruiters are more interested in building a relationship with you than in helping an employer fill a vacant position. If they don’t find something for you today, they might still come across the perfect job down the line. So think of the meeting as an informative conversation, an opportunity for the recruiter to learn more about you and your career goals. A good technique is to put yourself in the recruiter’s shoes. Imagine you are the one who has to find a new employee for a company. You’ll meet a lot of well-educated and motivated people who may not be the right fit for this position, but might be perfect candidates for the next business you start recruiting for. So, with this in mind, how should you act in front of a recruiter? First of all: Don’t be late! Tardiness makes a bad first impression that is always difficult to overcome.  Second: Don’t lie! If you really are right for the job, being truthful about yourself will prove it. And third: Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Find out as much as you can about the position and what the company is looking for. By learning what qualities they’re seeking, you can emphasize those traits in yourself during your interview with the hiring manager. Finally, after the meeting, send a thank you note to the recruiter. It’s a simple gesture that leaves a good impression. Everyone knows the importance of making a good first impression, and nowhere is this more important than in a job interview. Right when you walk into the room, the outcome of the entire interview is at stake. That first impression is made within the first few seconds.  So what’s the secret to making a positive first impression? Eye contact. People form judgments within milliseconds of meeting someone. And when you make eye contact you are instantly sharing a lot of information: you are communicating your social skills, friendliness and emotional stability. Avoid looking at the floor, the ceiling or off to the side when you walk into the interview room. If there are multiple people in the room, be sure to make eye contact with each of them. Studies have even shown that candidates who maintained a good level of eye contact were considered far more favorably than those who didn’t. So keep your eyes on the prize and stop staring at the interviewer’s tie! If you’re skeptical about this, try this experiment: find a mirror and make eye contact with yourself for just a second before glancing away. Okay, reset. This time, hold your gaze for at least five seconds. Doesn’t that second, steadier version of yourself seem more trustworthy? And that’s the magic of eye contact: if it’s consistent, you’ll come across as both more trustworthy and more competent. Conversely, the more you shift your gaze and look away when asked a question, the less confident you’ll seem. That said, don’t go overboard! It’s not a staring contest and you’re not trying to plumb the depths of the interviewer’s soul. So now that you’ve aced the interview and landed your dream job, how do you maintain your professionalism? Well, part of being a professional is talking like one. That means ditching some of the phrases and words that you might use outside the office and sticking to what is appropriate in a professional environment. One quick and easy way to improve your professional vocabulary is to drop the habit of apologizing.  If you’re confronted with a mistake at the office, avoid saying, “I’m sorry.” The more appropriate response would be, “I understand what went wrong and I’ll make sure it won’t happen again.” Apologies carry an emotional weight that can be uncomfortable in a professional environment. By acknowledging the problem and offering your willingness to take corrective action, you’re speaking in a helpful and professional manner.  Another phrase to remove from your vocabulary is, “Does this make sense?” Saying this suggests that you yourself are unsure of the intelligibility of your statements and that you’re hoping someone will endorse your nonsense. Obviously, this is not a good professional impression to make. Keeping things professional means keeping colloquial phrases like “grab” out of the workplace.  How many times have you heard someone say, “Let’s grab a coffee” or “Can I grab you for a quick meeting?” Using “grab” can imply that you’re not valuing the other person’s time in a professional manner. Instead, show respect by asking, “Can we have a meeting?” or “Let’s have a cup of coffee and discuss this.” As we move through our day, talking to friends, family and coworkers, it’s easy to forget to adjust our vocabulary to our environment. But if you want to maintain a high level of professionalism, it’s important to use professional language. Whether you’re celebrating a business breakthrough or a friend’s wedding, a thoughtful toast can be the perfect gesture. But a successful toast isn’t a ramble or an unending recitation of names and acknowledgements. A successful toast is a powerful moment – a taut, punchy speech that people will remember for a long time. So how do make your next toast a successful one? Ask yourself, what do you expect when someone gives a toast?  There are a lot of options, right? It might be funny and light or touching and poignant. Use this flexibility to your advantage the next time you raise a glass at a party or a business lunch. But don’t make the mistake of forgetting an important name. Everyone expects someone to raise a toast to the bride and groom at a wedding or to the guest of honor at a birthday party. But when you’re giving a toast at a Christmas party or a business celebration, it can be easy, and embarrassing, to accidentally leave out an important name. A simple and easy way to ensure that no one gets left out is to avoid extemporizing. When you know the event is coming up, take the time to write some notes and make sure every deserving individual gets honored. Here’s another smart way to avoid a bad toast and to keep yourself from merely listing off name after name: incorporate broad phrases like, “Here’s to all of you” and “It’s your work that made all of this possible.” Such sweeping statements make everyone feel included and ensure that there are no hurt feelings after your toast. Everyone thinks about what they wear for important occasions. But you might be surprised to learn how much of an impact the right outfit can have. Even if you usually don’t pay much attention to your outfit, you probably know that clothes are a powerful tool. What you wear instantly tells people a lot about who you are. The right attire can convey assurance and provide a sense of individuality. For example, a bright colored tie or a loud sweater can signal self-confidence to the people you meet. That’s why clothes are crucial to making a good first impression.  Your choice of clothing can even make you stand out as the right candidate at a job interview. By wearing your favorite Star Wars shirt to an interview with a start-up, you can communicate your style and that touch of geekiness that means you’ll fit in perfectly. On the other hand, say you have a big interview at a bank. Wearing a nicely fitted new suit will give you a feeling of confidence and show the bank that you’re a serious and trustworthy individual. And of course, if you're applying to be a drummer in a heavy metal band, you should probably wear something else entirely. So remember, consider all the options and give yourself the advantage by dressing accordingly. To complicate matters, your choice of attire may actually affect your psychology, too. Researchers at Columbia University refer to the effect clothing may have on the wearer’s mood and behavior as enclothed cognition. The data shows that people who wore a lab coat showed a higher attention to detail compared to people in street clothes! This is the power of clothing: bad outfits can make you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious; quality clothes, in contrast, can make you feel smart, sexy and confident. Just think about your favorite shirt or dress. It’s not really about how it looks; it’s about how it makes you feel! The key message in this book: The business world is full of social landmines. Whether you’re being interviewed by a recruiter, trying to dress appropriately or giving a toast, you can give yourself the advantage and avoid embarrassing yourself by keeping some simple tips in mind. Remember: You’re in control of your professional success! Actionable advice: Never be late for job interviews You’ve heard it many times, but it can’t be stressed enough: When it comes to job interviews, be on time! Sure, events out of your control may slow you down. There might be heavy traffic or a public transportation breakdown. So always give yourself enough time! That way, even if something unexpected happens, you’ll still be punctual.

After all, you are the author of your own story. Imagine if you took that idea literally, and started listing your deepest wishes and aspirations, and started getting them on paper. These blinks will explain why that’s not such a crazy idea. In fact, pinpointing your dreams can help bring them closer to reality. You’ll be amazed at what happens once you start writing down your dreams. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a self-written check earned Jim Carrey his first $10 million; why almost all cars are silver Toyota Yarises; and how learning to ride a unicycle can help you with your French classes. A lot of people only have vague ideas about what they really want. They desire more money, a better job, someone to love or the chance to travel somewhere exotic. You may have similar desires of your own. But if you want to make them a reality, you need to be precise. So rather than saying “I want money,” say, “I want exactly enough money to open a restaurant.” And when it comes to love, figure out exactly what you’re looking for. Maybe it’s someone who is funny, kind and doesn’t mind that you don’t want to have kids. Being so specific might sound extreme, but if you want to reach your goals and not veer off course, you need to know exactly what it is you want. Once you’re clear on your goals, write them down on paper. There are a number of success stories that show the power of writing down our dreams. Jim Carrey has a famous story of writing himself a check for $10 million, when he was just an aspiring actor. Sure enough, years later, he was earning $10 million per film! Then there’s the football player Lou Holtz, who had not one but 107 different goals for his life – and he wrote down each and every one of them. He did this in 1966, when he was unemployed and just 28 years old. Among his goals were to meet the president of the United States, coach a football team and hit a hole-in-one golf shot. Amazingly, now 50 years later, Holtz has fulfilled nearly every goal. On his website, you can see photographs of him shaking hands with both the president and the pope; as the coach of the University of Notre Dame football team, he won the 1988 national championship; and as for his luck at golf, he’s managed to hit not one, but two hole-in-one shots – so far. When you set concrete goals for yourself, there is no limit to what you can accomplish. But you may harbor some doubts, so let’s take a closer look at the power of pen and paper. See if this sounds familiar: your mother calls to say she’s bought a new car – let’s say it’s a silver Toyota Yaris – which surprises you since you’ve never heard of this car before. The next day, however, you start to see this car everywhere you go, and many of them are silver, too! How is this possible? This is the magic of your brain's filtering system, known as the Reticular Activating System, or RAS. The RAS is what allows us to sharpen our attention, and it can be primed to notice, or not notice, certain things. Parents of newborns are familiar with the RAS, as it is what allows them to sleep through just about anything, like traffic noise or a blaring television, yet wake up at the slightest peep from their baby. This is due to their RAS being biologically primed to hear when a child is in need. This is the same mechanism that will allow you to hear when your name is mentioned across the room at a loud party. Despite the music and dozens of simultaneous conversations, when this happens your ears will perk up and you’ll find yourself suddenly being able to overhear a conversation that was mere background noise just seconds earlier. What’s more, the RAS can also help you achieve your goals. When you write those clearly defined goals on paper, you’ll prime your brain to begin its unconscious work on the project. After you write down your goals, your RAS filter will constantly be on the lookout for messages or information that will help your quest. So, after writing down that you want enough money to open a restaurant, you’ll be primed to overhear someone at a party who says they have a history of investing in restaurants. Otherwise you never would have noticed. In the next blink, we’ll learn how you can deal with the fears that prevent you from realizing your dreams. The RAS is a great example of how unconscious activities in our brain help us realize our dreams. But we all also have unconscious fears, which are often tied to our goals, like big obstacles. However, by doing the same thing and writing these fears down on paper, you can help yourself recognize and conquer what stands in your way. For aspiring writers, the biggest obstacle is often the fear of being rejected by a publisher. Because of this fear, many writers will send their work to a small number of publishers and give up hope when those two or three rejection letters come back. Immediately, they start to believe they aren’t good enough and should let go of their dream of being a writer. This wouldn’t happen if they had acknowledged their fear of rejection ahead of time by writing it down. If they had, they’d know that a few letters would only be a temporary setback. They would also remember that countless brilliant and best-selling authors, like Frederick Forsythe and J.K. Rowling, received dozens of rejection letters before becoming wildly successful. Of course, the fear of rejection and criticism isn’t isolated to writers. Many of us share those fears, and they’re a primary reason we end up pushing our dreams aside. When fear goes unacknowledged, it sits in the gut, where it festers and acts like a spell that keeps you from being creative or having confidence in your power to follow through with your ideas. Writing down your fears can break this spell, but again, you have to be as precise as possible so that you become conscious of these fears and they gradually lose their power over you. Once you do this, you’ll see how well you’ll be able to recognize a fear for what it is and begin to unlock your true potential. In the next blink, we’ll look at other techniques to help identify and work through these worries. Once you’ve identified your fears, you can move on to dealing with the worries and concerns that might accompany them. One of the best ways to get rid of worries is to express them through a technique called rapidwriting. This technique is outlined in detail in another of the author’s books, Writing on Both Sides of the Brain, but it’s essentially a method to access the deep recesses of your mind. As the name suggests, rapidwriting involves quick, nonstop writing as way to power through a problem and work through worries, anger or issues that might be causing a mental block. In this technique, you never stop to look back at what you’ve written and just keep going. Your first sentence might be something like, “I don't know what to write and think this is stupid . . .” But a few sentences later you’ll likely be pouring your heart onto the page. Rapidwriting is a lot like the Jewish tradition of kvetching, which is a way of talking through your feelings and getting rid of anger or resentment. It might start as a bitter diatribe, but by the end you’ll have rid yourself of your negativity, will likely feel much better and will often have found a solution to your problems. The same thing happens with rapidwriting. After writing a few pages and releasing all the bottled-up negativity, the solution will start to present itself clearly. One of the author’s friends, Nan, was worried about having to do a “desk audit” at work, which is when your boss visits your desk and listens as you talk about your work and justify its importance. Naturally, this can be stressful, so Nan prepared by rapidwriting. She started out with the words, “I can't believe this is happening, after all my time here . . .” But by the end, she had three pages of examples that clearly showed how vital she was to the company and how her work contributed to its financial success. So, now that we have tools for getting past our mental roadblocks, let’s look at how we can stay focused. It might sound counterintuitive, but staying on top of your goals also means being flexible. Think of reaching a goal as flying a plane to a destination. Statistics show that 90 percent of the time, an airplane will have to fly slightly off course in order to avoid bad weather or to get out of the way of another plane’s flight path. But these detours don’t change the fact that pilots are continuously focused on getting to their destination. The goal remains the same, but in order to reach it safely, they have to be flexible. This is the same philosophy you need to apply to achieve your goals, so that when life inevitably throws something unexpected your way, you can remain focused and stay on track. For instance, let’s say your goal is to find a new apartment. First of all, set your budget and write down precisely what you’re looking for, such as two bedrooms, a garden and a location that’s walking distance to a shopping district. In this case, being as precise as possible will allow you to quickly filter out all the apartments that don’t have two bedrooms, a garden and nearby shops. Now, let’s say you find an apartment that meets all your requirements – but there’s something you didn’t expect: it's near a railroad track. While the proximity to the train track is what gives the apartment such an attractive price, and the train only goes by twice a day, you might start ignoring all the good things and focus on this one negative. And even though you don’t mind the train tracks, you might start imagining how other people will react. This is exactly how you can get off track, lose sight of your goal and end up worrying about someone else’s dream. So don’t get lost in hypothetical fears about what other people might think. You’ll miss your opportunity to enjoy something that would have been perfect for you. It’s nearly impossible to eat just one french fry. Even when they aren’t that great, after you eat one you’ll be tempted to eat another – and this is exactly how conquering your goals works as well. One of the best motivators to help you achieve your goals is to successfully reach one of them, and then use the resulting psychological boost to your advantage. The most obvious strategy is to start out with small goals and work your way up to the biggest one. So, if you want to swim across the English Channel, start with a series of smaller lakes that gradually get bigger, building your strength and confidence in the process. The best part is, the goals don’t have to be related at all. The momentum from completing one goal will still help you conquer another, even if it is completely unrelated. Edna is another friend of the author, who saw someone riding a unicycle on television and decided she would teach herself how to ride one. Sure enough, she applied herself to this goal and was eventually unicycling to school. This accomplishment was a clear sign of what she could do when she became determined, and it motivated her to successfully accomplish more difficult tasks, such as learning French. Another way to boost the likelihood of reaching a goal is to align your desires with a greater good, such that they’re not purely about personal gain. This doesn’t have to mean changing your goals, but rather thinking of ways that meeting a personal goal can put you in a position to benefit your community or society as a whole. For example, say your goal is to publish a novel. Instead of making that the final goal, add to it by promising to donate a portion of your profits to your favorite charity. By adding this sense of altruism, you’re adding a big motivator, because now you’re no longer the only one who will miss out on the rewards if you don’t follow through with your plans. Humans were using fire and water in their rituals long before pen and paper were invented, and these basic elements still have a primal power to influence us and help us succeed. Water is an especially powerful source of creative power. Julian Jaynes was an influential psychologist who pointed out that we often make our most groundbreaking discoveries while we’re in bed, in the bath or on the bus. Of these three Bs, the author is especially impressed with how powerful the bath can be. This is due in part to how many sacred religious stories, poems, myths and paintings depict the powerful forces of water. It’s no coincidence that it was while stepping into the bath that Archimedes had his famous “eureka!” moment that led to Archimedes' principle. When he entered the bath, he noticed that the water level rose, and suddenly realized that you could measure this rise to determine the precise volume of an object. And just as water can cleanse the body, being in or around a body of water can also cleanse the mind, which is one of the best ways to promote creativity. Fire, on the other hand, can be used in rituals to give power to your intention. Indeed, Native American tribes have been using fire rituals for this very purpose for generations. At the start of a new year, certain tribes build arrows from sticks and feathers, and each of these arrows is made to represent a specific hope for the year ahead. They then burn the arrows as a gesture of offering this hope to the universe. This is a wonderful ritual because it helps them be clear and precise about their hopes, thereby helping these hopes become a reality. You can do the same thing with paper by writing down three goals you hope to achieve and three unwanted things that you hope to get rid of. Then, find a safe place and set fire to the paper to give a powerful intention to your desires. With all these tools at hand, it will soon be clear that you have what it takes to turn dreams into reality. The key message in this book: No dream is too big for you to achieve, as long as you have the right attitude. Too often, our fears get in the way of what we hope to accomplish. But this can be remedied by writing down all that we desire and fear, thereby unlocking the power of the subconscious mind and putting us on the right path. The simple act of writing is a powerful one that is not unlike a prayer, and it can turn us into a magnet for the things we want most in our lives. Actionable advice: Start your day off by writing down your intent. Take some quiet time at the beginning of your day to write down what you’d like to accomplish in the hours ahead. This is not for practical stuff like doing the laundry or going shopping. It’s to provide emotional and spiritual guidance for the day, such as “being the best mother I can be.” Just writing your intent down will keep you feeling grateful and positive throughout the day.

Improving your life isn’t as simple as staring up at a firework-lit sky and whispering a couple of sentences to yourself. Sure, the intent is there, but you also need to follow up on your verbal promises with some solid planning and action. This is where these blinks come in: Michael Hyatt guides you through the necessary steps to make your New Year’s wish a tangible reality, so you’ll never spend another year regretting all the things you could’ve or should’ve done. Full of historical examples and personal anecdotes from the author, Your Best Year Ever will show you that reaching your goals is never an impossibility. In these blinks, you’ll discover why it’s good to develop an addiction; the author’s greatest failure; and who was first to run a mile in under four minutes. Let’s start by picturing where you want to be in 12 months. What do you see? Some of the more common desires are to be free of debt, physically fit, a happy family life, a good relationship, master a hobby and feel spiritually well. The good news is that you can have all of this. Measuring your progress in ten areas of your life will allow you to see what you need to improve. These interrelated aspects are mental health, physical health, spirituality, intellectual life, marriage or partnerships, parental life, friendships, job, hobbies and personal finances. These components are key to living a fulfilling life, which is why it’s important to work consistently on improving them. To begin, rank yourself from zero to ten on each of the aspects previously mentioned. This way you will be able to identify the areas in greatest need of improvement and regularly mark your progress by comparing the results. Moreover, it will give you a clear indication as to where you should be focusing your efforts. These ten aspects are connected to and influenced by one another, and therefore improvements in one area will most likely result in growth in other areas as well. For instance, a relaxing home life will allow you to concentrate better at work, while a rich social life will lead to a higher chance of meeting a partner. Likewise, performing poorly on certain aspects could have negative impacts on other areas too. You may lack energy in the workplace if you’re not physically healthy, while not having any hobbies could negatively affect your marriage. Working on all these aspects might seem like a daunting task, but the following blinks will show you how to overcome your worries and devise a practical plan to bring about change in your life. Most of us lug around a lot of baggage, or mental blocks, that determine what is and isn’t possible for us to achieve. One such mental block is false assumptions. Humans continuously make assumptions about the world and themselves. These are often wrong and create a barrier to our progression. These assumptions can be thoughts, such as “You’re not the creative type,” “You’re ugly,” “You can’t hold down a job,” or “The recession means nobody will buy your product.” These are almost always self-inflicted and objectively untrue in most cases. What’s more, we also set up physical barricades with our minds. Pilots once thought it impossible to fly faster than the speed of sound, and athletes believed that no human could run a mile in under four minutes. The ones that broke through and achieved the seemingly unthinkable are those who dispensed with the negative narrative and went about proving that it was, in fact, possible. This is the mentality that former United States Air Force general officer Charles Elwood “Chuck” Yeager had when he broke the sound barrier in 1947. In 1954, athlete Roger Bannister also ignored the impossible narrative by running a mile in three minutes and 59 seconds. By dispelling common knowledge about physical limitations, both Yeager and Bannister succeeded where others had failed. Since then, numerous airplanes have broken the sound barrier, and many runners have recorded one-mile runs in under four minutes, now that the perceived limits have been surpassed. By revising the perceived limits, not only can you improve yourself, but you can even change the world. In 1963, it was the belief of many that the civil rights movement wouldn’t amount to anything. Most said that non-violent efforts would never achieve change and that racism was far too deeply ingrained in American society for anything to be done about it. Dr. Martin Luther King, however, refused to take these perceived beliefs as undeniable truths and led a peaceful protest march of 200,000 people to Washington, where he gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. With this speech, King replaced the taken-for-granted worldview with an alternative perspective – knocking down the mental blocks in many American minds and opening them up to change. It might’ve been a primary school teacher who told us we’re hopeless at art, or it could’ve been last month’s failed attempt at dieting. Whatever the case, past experiences can contribute to our negative thinking and keep us from moving ahead. A bad experience in the past can affect our confidence in future circumstances. A good example of this is comparing the 80% of teenagers who make New Year’s resolutions to the 30% who do so aged 60 and older. This discrepancy is because the older people get, the more failures and setbacks they’ve experienced, and so they are less optimistic about their desires coming true. But this is a false assumption, and you shouldn’t let past experiences affect your actions in the future. Instead, use those previous failures as useful advice. The author’s greatest failure occurred when he was working all year for a client – an up-and-coming author working on landing a big publishing deal. Toward the very end of the year, the client stopped taking his calls, and just like that, the author had wasted 12 months on someone who’d decided to go with another publisher at the last minute. Now, the easy choice would’ve been to give up and look for another job. Instead, the author used what he’d learned over those 12 months to improve his company in a number of ways. For instance, he realized that he should never focus on just one client, and instead spread his net wide. He also learned never to assume that a client would be appreciative of his work. To minimize the risk, he now asks his clients to explain exactly what it is they want out of the partnership. As important as it is to set future targets for yourself, it’s also critical that the goals you set are attainable. Let’s take a look at how you can achieve this in the next blink. Some targets that we set for ourselves are so unrealistic that even the world’s greatest geniuses wouldn’t be able to attain them. On the flip side, sometimes the goals may be so easy that we lose motivation to try and achieve them because so little effort is required. The key to ensuring high enthusiasm levels is striving for a goal that’s within your capabilities, but one that also requires a reasonable amount of effort. To set the right goals, you need to find the discomfort zone. Let’s say you’re planning to write a book. Winning the Nobel Prize for literature is a desirable goal, but it’s also quite unreasonable for a first-time writer. Furthermore, such an ambitious target could prevent you from starting altogether. Conversely, if you set your sights too low and allow yourself to finish your first draft in 6 months, you’ll end up taking too long and probably never get around to finishing. Instead, find a happy medium, which the author calls the discomfort zone. For example, give yourself three months to finish the first draft, and then another three to complete the second. Setting goals is important, but don’t be delusional. It’s possible to exceed the discomfort zone and break into the delusional zone, if you’re not careful. Just as an athlete who overtrains will end up pulling a muscle, setting delusional targets will result in you undermining yourself. One example of this is the automobile company General Motors. In 2002, they set a target to obtain 29% of the US market. This absurdly ambitious goal almost bankrupted the company. Employees were required to wear badges with the number 29 on their lapels so that they were constantly reminded of the goal. The staff became so fixated on sales numbers that they sold cars with zero-interest loans – costing the company money and affecting its bottom line. It effectively undermined the business and put the 29% target even further out of reach than when they started the initiative. If General Motors had considered it more thoroughly, they would’ve realized that the goal was delusional and this misadventure would’ve been avoided. Imagine you had to read a long book like the Bible. That’s almost a million words – a rather daunting task. To make this a more attainable goal, break up the task into 20-minute chunks every morning, and you’ll have read the entire Bible in a year. When you split up mammoth tasks into short-term goals, the rewards can be very satisfying. Humans get addicted to daily tasks, particularly if they’re done over an extended period of time. This also applies to tasks that were born from the discomfort zone. A task that we enjoy can turn from a stick to a carrot, that is from a punishment to a reward. People who intend to read the Bible might find it daunting at first, but once they get started, they’ll enjoy the spiritual and peaceful moments that accompany the task. The key action, though, is to work on the task until you become addicted. Some of you may have heard that it takes 21 days to get addicted to a habit, but some tasks only take a few days before an addiction forms, while more complex ones can take over 200 days. According to researchers from University College London, the average number of days for a task to transition into an addictive habit is 66. To make it easier to become addicted to a task, you need to introduce rewards into the system. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean buying yourself a new suit once you shed those 20 pounds. Rewards for completing discomfort zone tasks are more like feelings of gratitude and pleasure, and simply noticing your progression toward your long-term goal can be rewarding enough. You can also increase your enthusiasm levels by turning your task into a game: Tick off a daily task on your calendar, and try to see how many days in a row you can achieve it. Phone apps can be very handy here. The author uses an app where you’re instructed to drink a glass of water before watering a virtual plant. By turning it into a game, the app takes the mundane task of drinking water throughout the day and makes it more enjoyable. To stick to a task and remain positive, you need to form an emotional attachment to it. In other words, you need to understand why that task makes you a better person. Start by identifying your main motivations. Jot down a list of reasons for doing a particular activity, then pick out the strongest points. If your goal is to work out more, some of the reasons could be “I’m sick of being fat,” “I want to prove to myself that I can succeed,” and “Exercise makes me more productive and happy.” It’s important to disregard how other people might value your reasons. What’s most significant is that they resonate with you. Once that’s done, you need to constantly remind yourself of your main motivations. Say you find yourself heading to the fridge. In a situation like this, it’s useful to have your list of reasons at hand. As you reach for a snack, remind yourself why you want to be more healthy. Looking at the list will divert your attention away from your temporary desire and prompt you to consider your longer-term, more meaningful targets. To motivate yourself even further, let your reason define you as a person. Anders Ericsson, a researcher of psychology at Florida State University, studied the motivation behind the many hours of practice guitarists and other musicians put into honing their craft. He discovered that a crucial element of their dedication was that when they perform well, and their talents receive recognition from their peers, their actions became part of their identity. In other words, identifying as musicians drove them to become better at making music. This is no surprise, as humans are social beings, and the way we identify ourselves is in relation to others. In the following blink, you’ll learn how to benefit from this group identification so that you can experience your best year yet. In addition to identifying your primary motivations, one key factor to living a successful year is having a good group of people around you. This means finding individuals who can support your goals – either those who have the means to see them come to fruition or those on a similar path who can offer encouragement and advice. People are a readily available source of knowledge and experience that we can tap into. They could be a member of a community or a mentor, and many are more than happy to pass on their skills and lessons to those who seek it. Joining a community is one way to find supportive people to help you with your quest. For example, people who want to lose weight join dieting groups such as Weight Watchers and are more likely to drop the pounds than those who go it alone. Similarly, alcohol and drug addicts have a higher chance of staying clean if they go to supportive meetings, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. According to psychologist Henry Cloud, this is because positivity is contagious. We are more likely to succeed when part of a community due to four key reasons: firstly, we can learn from other group members; secondly, competition within the group helps our performance; third, we are held accountable to the community; and fourth, we motivate and encourage each other. Another avenue from which we can seek help is through tutoring. It’s easy to conclude that if we want to improve at the piano, we should hire a piano teacher. If we want to learn Spanish, we should find a language tutor. But when it comes to improving our lives, many of us wouldn’t consider hiring a life coach, or even a fitness instructor. The author was guilty of this oversight. For a couple of years, he was stuck on a particular level of fitness and didn’t know how to improve. His friend suggested he get a fitness instructor, and since then, not only has he gained new and invaluable advice on different exercise techniques, he also gained a new gym buddy. Through this new avenue of support, he broke his personal records and reached new levels of fitness. Creating your best year requires individual effort, but it’s equally important to make sure you have a good network supporting you. The key message in these blinks: To have the perfect year, you need to take a holistic approach to improving yourself and distribute your efforts equally over ten different aspects. The goals you set for yourself must be realistic and clearly identified so that you have the motivation to change. Finding a strong support group and becoming addicted to daily tasks will also help you achieve a fulfilling life. Actionable advice: Express gratitude. The first thing you should do when you wake up in the morning is take a few minutes to yourself to thank the universe, God, yourself or anyone, for everything that you already have. Say thanks for being healthy, for having people who care about you, for having access to clean water. Being grateful will help keep you positive and hopeful and remind you of the small victories you’ve already made. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

With all these people sharing the same view, you might be fooled into thinking that there is only one economic path to take. But you’d be wrong – there is plenty wrong with free market economics. Far from being a perfect, scientific approach, it contains many false ideas about how the economy and society works. And there are other approaches to take, even though they are largely ignored by the media. In these blinks you will find out just what is wrong with free market capitalism and what we can all do to find better alternatives. After reading the following arguments, your understanding of economics will be changed forever. In these blinks you'll learn:  why government planning won’t always lead to Soviet Russia, why economists think you should avoid paying your cab fare and why winning the Nobel Prize for Economics doesn’t make you a financial expert. You will probably remember the huge financial crisis which swept the globe in 2008. You may also recall that in the months that followed, economists were – bankers aside – the most mistrusted professionals in the world. Yet this backlash was far from unfair to economists – it was a perfectly reasonable response to their arrogant attitude in previous years. Quite simply, economists had grown far too big for their boots. One sign of economists’ overconfidence was their belief that only they could fully understand the complexities of economic theory. This led them to dismiss any criticism of their beliefs as too simplistic. Yet this was, and is, simply not the case. Instead of being too complex for outsiders, 95 percent of economics is simple common sense. You can think of it in this way. When you go to a restaurant you know what standards of hygiene you desire even though you are not a qualified epidemiologist. And it’s the same for economics; the basic principles of the subject can be appreciated by anyone. After all, you don’t need to be president of a central bank to know that a country shouldn't gamble all its money on risky investments. This arrogance also led mainstream economic teaching to discount any alternative theories. For the last few decades, one particular economic theory has dominated: neo-classical free market theory. This belief assumes that every individual in society acts as a rational, selfish agent, who only makes an economic decision by calculating how much it will benefit them. The economic profession came to regard this theory almost as a natural science. This led them to focus too much on a normative theory rather than on its application in the real world. But rather than being an objective science like physics, economics is a social science. This means that there are many potential alternative theories – each just as provable as the free market approach. In the following blinks we will discover the central faults in free market economic theory. Way back in 1997, two economists called Robert Merton and Myron Scholes were awarded the Nobel Prize in their field. Their theories built mostly on the idea that when making economic decisions – such as where to invest their money or which product to buy – humans made completely rational choices. After winning such a prestigious prize, the two economists applied their theories to the real world. However, instead of going on to make huge piles of cash, they found their companies bankrupt, not just once, but twice in little over a decade! The failure of Merton and Scholes teaches us one important point. You cannot expect human beings to always act rationally. Why? In order to make rational decisions, individuals need to take every possible detail into consideration. For example, when deciding where to invest our life savings, we need to know about every possible scenario, every alternative possibility, and so on. Only when we have all this information can we make the best choice. Yet in the modern world one cannot possibly hope to process every speck of information before making a decision, and so our choices cannot be rational. However, this does not mean that we act completely irrationally. Instead we are subject to bounded rationality. We try really hard to be rational, we just lack the intellectual capacity to make the perfect decision. But how can we change our economic thinking to accommodate this? To help us make the best possible decisions the government needs to step into the marketplace to limit our economic choices. If we are only presented options whose effects we can understand, we can start to make better decisions. The government already acts in this way in other areas. For example, the authorities stop us from getting hold of drugs with unknown side effects, or cars with poor safety standards. Why shouldn’t they apply the same rules in the financial world? Have you ever been tempted to run off without paying for your taxi ride? The chances are that, as long as the driver isn’t Usain Bolt, you could easily get away with it. Yet although the thought may sometimes cross your mind, you always ignore it and pay your fare. But, as reasonable as paying for your cab may seem, free market economists would argue that you are acting irrationally. They claim that we are all programmed to only act selfishly and therefore we should always run away without paying. To explain why we don’t seem to follow their theory, free market economists point to our actions’ hidden rewards and sanctions. These are the costs and benefits that, while not being immediately clear, will have an impact in the long term. So the reason we pay for taxis is that we don’t want to build up a reputation as a fare dodger. A person with such a reputation would be completely shunned by taxi drivers, and would never be able to get a cab again. However, the theory of hidden costs and sanctions doesn’t work in a selfish society. Let’s return to the taxi example. If we ran away, the role of sanctioning us would fall to the taxi driver. He would have to chase us down, get our fare from us, and probably take our picture to show other taxi drivers in the area. And while he was doing this, his cab would be left completely unattended, at risk of theft or damage. If he were to only think of himself there would be no benefit for him – the fare he’d reclaim would be small and why should he help other taxi drivers out by tracking us down? The fact is that we pay for our taxi ride because we have other concerns, like honesty, honor and respect, and not just pure selfishness. Would you agree with the statement “we should all earn what we deserve”? Sounds reasonable, doesn’t it? However, if you are from a rich country then you might want to think twice about desiring this. If you were to be paid what the market thinks you deserve then you’d probably find your income levels dropping at an alarming rate. How can this be? This is because the wages of workers in the developed world are protected from the pressures of the market, which means they remain high, no matter how valuable the work may be. For example, whatever your job, there will be people in other countries who will do it for less money. You aren’t subjected to this competition because the government protects your job. They use strict immigration controls to prevent people from poorer countries entering the workforce. Safe from these workers, your wages remain artificially high. This example also shows that it is not your skills that determine how much you earn, but purely the society you live in. If you happen to live in a prosperous, productive society, your wage will be pulled up by everyone else. Even if you happen to be the laziest, most unproductive worker, you will still earn more than a hard worker in a poor country. And this unfairness in wages can also be seen in individual societies. Those whose incomes place them toward the top of society will find themselves earning far more than they deserve compared to those at the bottom. For example, in the early 1990s top executives found that their wages increased by 100 times the salary of the average worker. 20 years later this gap had rocketed up to 400 times. Is this because the executive is worth more than the worker every year? The evidence would suggest not; the average executive is simply not 400 times more productive than the average worker. Thus in market terms their increase is not deserved. What do you think when you drive past an abandoned, crumbling factory? If you live in the developed world you may connect it with media stories about the decline in domestic industry. Together these might make you think that manufacturing is nearly dead in the West – yet you’d be wrong. People often think that industry is in decline because they misread statistics. For example, people see that fewer people are employed in manufacturing than in the past. Yet it doesn’t mean there is less industry, just that it is more efficient. Nevertheless, many policymakers have suggested that developing countries should think seriously about moving away from manufacturing to the service and knowledge economies. Yet this move would be bad for the overall economy. Take services, for example. The service economy, such as retail work or the IT sector, has grown in size over the last few decades. Yet it would be risky to grow too dependent on this sector. One problem with the service sector is its slow rates of productivity growth. It most cases an increase in a given service’s productivity will lead to a lower quality end product. For example, a performance of Macbeth that lasts ten minutes would be a more productive one, yet its quality would be seriously compromised. Therefore an economy reliant on services will find itself growing relatively slowly. Then there is the knowledge economy, which relies on the creation and spread of information. Since the creation of the internet people have suggested that the knowledge economy has enormous potential. Yet this is massively overrated. Far from being a revolutionary invention, the internet has had far less impact that previous developments in communication. The telegraph, for example, reduced the speed it took to pass a message from two weeks to 7.5 minutes, bringing the time down by a factor of 2,500. Yet the internet only improved efficiency from ten seconds (from a fax machine) to two seconds, a drop of only five times. The financial crisis of 2008 hit the entire global economy hard. It ended over a decade of economic growth and brought some of the biggest financial firms to their knees. However, many of the companies most affected by the crash – for example, the insurance giant AIG or the investment bank Lehman Brothers – actually played a large role in their own downfall. How? In the years before the crisis the financial system had grown more complicated. In order to find new products to trade, bonds called financial derivatives were created. Although these were highly profitable at first, their sheer complexity hid high levels of risk. In order to create these derivatives, pools of securities such as mortgage loans were used to create more and more types of financial derivatives. And the more of these that were created from the same security, the higher the risk climbed. Imagine building a house on a tiny piece of land. As you can’t build outward you decide to build upward and so add storey after storey onto the house. What do you think would happen? With every new storey you add, the stability of the house decreases, and it becomes more and more wobbly. And added to this was another problem. Each new financial product that was created was of a poorer quality than the last. Let’s return to our narrow, yet tall house. Imagine building each new level out of increasingly shoddy material, such as paper or plasticine. It is clear that such a structure could not last long before collapsing. And although countries across the world suffered from the crash, those hardest hit were the ones who had most liberalized their markets. For example, Ireland and Latvia, which had both opened up their markets in the years before the crash, suffered greatly; the Irish economy shrunk by 7.5 percent and the Latvian by 16 percent. Should the government ever interfere in the running of the economy? Free market economists would be quick to answer no. They would argue that when a state meddles in the economy the result is always chaos. These economists point to the complete failure of controlled economies such as those in the Soviet Bloc, declaring this is what will always happen when the state interferes. Yet despite what free market theory suggests, governments can and do play a crucial role in economic growth. For example, the state often has a better knowledge of the whole economy than individual companies. And this knowledge can be used to support the most profitable industries. This is what happened in South Korea. The huge electronics firm LG originally wanted to focus on the textile market, but the government disagreed. They knew that the firm would have more success focusing on electronics and so pushed it into that market. And this isn’t just government policy in the developing world. The US government also carefully supported the early development of the now massive internet, biotechnology and aircraft industries. But why did government planning work in these cases but not in Soviet Russia? The key is not trying to control too much. If the state tries to control every aspect of the economy, as it did in the communist world, it will come unstuck. However, if it merely helps guide the system by setting loose goals, such as inflation targets and controlling interest rates, then it can achieve success. In doing this the state acts a bit like a company CEO. The goal of a CEO is to set strategic goals to ensure that their business travels steadily in the right direction. The goal of the state is to do the same thing for the whole economy. Across the developed world free market economists are calling for governments to cut their social welfare benefits. They argue that paying people benefits like unemployment allowance or holiday pay rewards them for doing no work. Yet despite what their theories suggest, evidence from the real world shows that far from being a drain, social welfare is vital for economic growth. We can see this if we look at labor markets. Countries which provide lots of help for the unemployed have more dynamic economies than those who limit support. The reason for this is clear. In countries with little assistance for the unemployed, people are terrified of losing their jobs. Therefore they look for work in areas of the economy where they feel safest. They often gravitate toward stable professions such as healthcare and law. While these may be socially important, they do not deliver high levels of economic growth. In order to achieve growth, you need to encourage people to enter riskier, more entrepreneurial areas of the economy. Not surprisingly, the nations who offer support for those that try, but fail, will always do better than those where the cost of failure is poverty. And while evidence shows that social welfare helps growth, the opposite can be said of the free market alternative, called the trickle-down effect. Free market advocates suggest that if the government spent less money on welfare it wouldn’t need to collect this in taxes. Rich people would then be free to invest their money directly in the economy. This money would then trickle down the economy as investments create more growth and jobs. Yet where it has been tried, the theory has not produced the desired results. In countries which adopted free market policies in the 1980s, such as the United States and United Kingdom, growth actually slowed as a result. And as growth stuttered, the money stopped trickling down and stayed at the top. For example, between 1979 and 2006 the top one percent of earners in the United States more than doubled their share of national income from ten percent to 22.9 percent. Many politicians, economists and popstars in the West are sure they know what policies will help end poverty in the developing world. Yet despite their confidence, it seems that much of the developed world’s thinking towards poor nations is based on false ideas. One fallacy popular among Western policymakers is that the causes of poverty in the developing world are structural. Structural causes include an inhospitable climate, being landlocked, or having difficult terrain. However, if this were the case then wouldn't the landlocked, mountainous countries of Austria and Switzerland struggle economically? Another misplaced Western theory is that developing countries lack the dynamic entrepreneurial spirit of the developed world. Yet this is simply not the case: self-employed people in developing countries make up 30–50 percent of the workforce. Whereas in the rich West only ten percent of the workforce are self-employed. You cannot possibly argue that non-Western countries lack entrepreneurial spirit. Westerners who question why developing nations remain poor should look for their answer closer to home. The fact is that the Western free market policies imposed on the developing world are a huge reason for their poverty. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa were experiencing decent growth. This was because their governments protected their economies: domestic industries were subsidized and protected from outside competition. However, as soon as Western governments in the 1980s forced them to open their markets, their domestic economies stuttered and failed. If we want to reverse this trend and get developing countries moving forward, we need to remember how we in the West became rich in the first place. It happened because in the nineteenth century Western countries protected their economies from foreign competition. In the United States, for example, foreigners were forbidden from becoming financial directors and custom tariffs on goods coming into the country stood at 50 percent. Wouldn’t it be better to let developing nations follow this path? After reading these blinks you might be starting to get really angry with capitalism. Yet before you sign up as a member of the Communist Party, you need to realize one thing: it is not capitalism itself at fault, just one type – free market capitalism. In fact, capitalism can be be a very effective way of managing the economy. For example, the profit motive, or the desire to make money, is a powerful driver. A great many inventions and innovations have resulted from people’s desire to create a successful enterprise. And capitalism is also an efficient method of coordinating the economy. The market is a great way to ensure that labor and capital quickly gets to the areas where it is needed the most. Without the market directing people where they are needed, we might end up with hundreds of rock stars and not enough plumbers! However, despite the advantages that capitalism can bring, it can be incredibly dangerous if not regulated properly. We should think of the capitalist economy like a car. If you produce a car without any safety features, such as brakes or seatbelts, then the chances are that eventually the vehicle will crash and people will be injured. Unfortunately, the current dominant approach to capitalism suggests that we should create a largely unregulated system. But there are alternatives. It is possible to move away from the free market and build a better, fairer, and safer capitalist system. One way we could do this is to apply the idea of bounded rationality – the idea that we make better choices when we have a limited range of options. To follow this approach we would need to give the government a little more power in the economic system. It would then use this power, for instance, to remove the ability of bankers to make risky investment choices. This would allow society to make more informed and safer choices. The key message in this book: Don’t believe professional economists who tell you that the free market is the only way to manage the economy; there are other, fairer options for us to chose from. We all need to focus on these alternatives to build a better, more stable and equal world. Actionable advice: Be careful whom you vote for. Often politicians try to encourage votes by telling the electorate they will give them tax cuts. Although this might sound positive at first, try and remember what will have to be cut to provide this rebate. If you value public services, then it may be better for you to vote for someone else.

Generally speaking, the word “lobbyism” refers to any attempts of citizens and groups of citizens to influence the political process – for example, meeting with a senator to convince her to fund your social project. But for most people, lobbyism has a negative connotation: first and foremost it is associated with big business, corruption and secretive scandals. However, the issue is more complex. Some say that because most of the time lobbyists represent commercial interests, lobbyists shouldn’t be heard by the government at all. This suspicion follows from the fact that most lobbyists work for big companies like Nestlé or Google, and industries like the tobacco or the sugar industry. Seen in this way, lobbying seems to necessarily undermine good government, because most companies don’t care about the common good – the issues important to the society as a whole – they only care about profit. For example, tobacco industry lobbyists fight regulations that might prevent people from smoking, because this would reduce their profits. However, at least in theory, lobbyism can actually help governments do a good job. Despite its bad reputation, lobbyism can still bring about good governance by keeping politics and outside interests in touch. To make intelligent and informed decisions, politicians require insights from external actors such as businesses – and lobbyists can provide just those insights. For example, lobbyists can provide information about the current problems and threats companies face, and thus help the government adapt accordingly to support the economy. Furthermore, lobbyists are often experienced in legislation and politics themselves, which allows them to reduce the workload for politicians by helping them with tasks like drafting the paperwork for a new law. Lobbyism, for many people, basically means bribery: corporate agents pushing money-stuffed envelopes into the hands of politicians under the tables of fancy restaurants. While this may have been true in the past, today lobbying is a much more complex industry. In Britain, a very influential and professional lobbying industry has emerged during the last century to drive forward business interests. And just like in the United States, the UK lobbying industry originally emerged to tackle the dangers democracy poses to the interests of industrialists. Simply speaking, during the twentieth century, more and more people got the vote, and started to demand social change – including the redistribution of wealth. So the rich industrialists created lobbying to ensure that the politicians would write laws defending the right to their riches. This has made lobbying an essential part of British politics: today, London has the third largest lobbying industry after Washington and Brussels. So what is the lobbying business actually made up of? Britain’s gigantic lobbying business today consists of a variety of actors who help push forward the interests of businesses and companies. One main group of actors are the lobbyists paid to influence politics through personal relationships to politicians. Lobbyists meet with politicians in order to convince them to enforce or stop policies that could help or harm their interests of their clients. For example, lobbyists for the meat industry might try and convince politicians that looser slaughterhouse rules are good for the economy. But it’s less well known that on top of the lobbyists, there are other powerful players in the lobbying business. There is the public relations industry, which works to improve the public image of big businesses. And then there are the think tanks that companies pay to do research that will support their interests and indirectly influence public debates. For example, the International Policy Network is an institution funded by the oil giant Exxon in order to misrepresent scientific knowledge about climate change, support climate skeptics, and discredit environmental regulations. One might argue that in a democracy big companies have the same right as anyone else to campaign for their interests. However, a closer look at the problem reveals why professional lobbying has become a threat to democracy itself. Firstly, by using lobbyists, big companies and industries have privileged access to the government and its decision-making powers. This is because professional lobbyists spend much time and energy bonding with politicians. For example, they will first try to get in contact by sending a congratulatory email after an election, or approach politicians at public events like party conferences in an attempt to form a relationship. The lobbyists can then use these personal connections to influence the government to pass laws and policies in the interest of the businesses and companies that pay them. This means that those who can’t afford lobbyists – like the public or poorer NGOs – are more or less evicted from the decision-making process. Secondly, think tanks and public relations companies undermine rational democratic discourse to the benefit of commercial interests. For a society to be truly democratic, the decision-making process must operate through a public discourse where every voice is equal. However, big businesses and corporations use think tanks and public relations strategies to manipulate public discourses for the benefit of their financiers and clients. Through funded research institutions and questionable media campaigns, corporations ensure their interests are represented and protected in public discourses – again, something the public and less wealthy NGOs cannot afford. A striking example: the sugar industry has spent much money in recent decades to raise public doubts about the risks linked to excessive sugar consumption. The industry paid scientists, funded research and even academic journals in order to fight other studies and critical arguments. In the following blinks you’ll learn how exactly the lobbying business works in more detail. Even though it sounds like something out of political thriller, the clichéd scenario where lobbyists cunningly influence politicians at dinner parties is an actual phenomenon. This is because personal relationships are the best way to ensure that the interests of a lobbyist’s client are represented. This makes networking and socializing with government advisers or important politicians a lobbyist’s main task, because this allows them to gain a direct influence. For example, lobbyists often invite politicians to expensive dinners or other high profile social events, like a football cup final. And once lobbyists have a connection to politicians, they can try to convince them of their position. For example, they could attempt to get the politician to oppose tax increases which would hurt their employer’s profits. But many lobbyists don’t have to go looking for politicians to meet – often they’ve already formed personal relationships with government officials by working or having worked within the government themselves. For example, it is not uncommon for active politicians, their advisers and other ministry officials to work as lobbyists on the side. Furthermore, many former Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom today work for lobbying agencies, and can prove to be effective lobbyists thanks to their personal connections to the government. As seen in the previous blink, most lobbyists rely on personal relationships. However, big businesses also have to use less direct ways to promote and defend their interests. When personal lobbying can go no further, because a politician is starting to worry about their perception in the eyes of the voters, lobbyists turn to more subtle methods. Instead of using direct influence, they attempt to get other parties to argue their side: they finance scientists and think tanks, for example, to do biased research. For example, Frederick Stare, the founder of the Harvard School of Public Health – which was funded by companies such as Coca Cola – was paid by lobbyists to advocate the interests of the sugar industry in the media, and tell politicians that sugar is healthy. On top of professional researchers, businesses also use certain groups of society to surreptitiously campaign for their interests. In 2009, for example, the Labour government in Great Britain wanted to impose stricter rules on selling cigarettes. In response, the tobacco industry – and particularly Philip Morris International – mobilized shopkeepers to fight the new regulations. These third parties are useful because they are more credible than lobbyists. This is because corporations and businesses can't credibly claim to be fighting for anything other than their profits. On the other hand, third parties – like the thinks tanks and scientists doing seemingly independent research, while actually being paid by big businesses – appear much more credible to the public. The same is true for the shopkeepers who appeared to be merely representing their own interests against the government. If Philip Morris had challenged the legislation themselves, citizens and politicians would have perceived their protests as a manifestation of corporate greed. By contrast, small shop owners seemed far more sympathetic, and their objections were therefore considered more carefully. So before you believe that latest piece of research, google its origin and find out who funded it! The lobbyist industry is not just about promoting certain goals. Another central task is dealing with all those who pose a threat to the interests of big businesses. And lobbyists don’t always fight fair. One reason for this is that critics can be very dangerous for large corporations, for whom profits come first, and ethical considerations second. For example, Nestlé has been widely criticized for its promotion of baby milk formula to impoverished mothers in developing countries – despite the fact that, most of the time, breast milk is better for children. The main critics of corporations like Nestlé are social movements and NGOs – non governmental organizations – created to criticize immoral business practices. By raising public awareness, they can damage a company’s reputation and lead boycotts – which means reduced profits. So to maintain high profits for their clients, lobbyists need to find the best way to effectively deal with opponents and criticism. For this purpose, companies such as Nestlé and Shell have developed subtle public relations strategies to manage criticism. When Shell, for example, planned a project in a sensitive area of the Peruvian rain forest, it pretended to be ready for dialogue, and invited NGOs to an open table. The catch, however, was that Shell was only willing to talk about how best to proceed – from the very beginning there was no possibility that the project would be cancelled. The more moderate critics accepted Shell’s invitation, whereas the more radical critics did not. The result? A divided and less powerful group of critics – which was exactly what Shell had intended. However, if these methods do not work, the lobbying industry doesn’t hesitate to aggressively threaten critics. For example, whistleblowing filmmakers and scientists get intimidated. After making a critical movie about the banana company Dole, the filmmaker Fredrik Gertten was not only threatened by legal action, but also by aggressive bullying and scare tactics from Dole lobbyists and PR campaigns. Gertten documented this in his later movie, Big Boys Gone Bananas! In the following blinks we’ll find out what can be done about lobbyism. As we've seen in the previous blinks, lobbying activities are far from democratic and fair – and this is particularly true in the United Kingdom. Even though the lobbying industry’s impact in the United Kingdom is not as big as in the United States – the motherland of the lobbying industry – it is still growing every year. However, even compared to the United States, Britain’s lobbying activities lack transparency. For example, in Britain, almost nothing is publicly known about who is a lobbyist, who she or he is working for, and how much money has changed hands. This is because for over 40 years now, the lobbying industry has managed to hold back governmental regulation and stress that “self-regulation” suffices. And yet transparency is a necessary condition for an open and honest debate about the interests and issues that lobbyists represent. How could this be achieved? A register for lobbying activities would force businesses and lobbyists to declare who is lobbying the government and how much money is being spent. Then the public would be informed of the scale and impact of lobbying activities. In the United States, for example, the public knows how much money the financial industry spent on lobbying from 1998 to 2008 – $3.4 billion – and who worked as a lobbyist fighting against increased financial regulation (i.e., many ex-US government officials). But for the lobbying activities of the City in London, no such information is available. This lack of information is dangerous because as long as we don’t know the impact and size of lobbying activities, we cannot hold abusive lobbyists accountable and, as a society, discuss the consequences of lobbyism. More transparency would therefore make more democratic a business that has so far operated in the dark. Despite the lobbying system’s hidden methods, the British public is both aware and concerned about their consequences. Polls show that a majority in Britain believes the government care less about the British public’s concerns than the concerns of big corporations. In recent years, this has led politicians and the government to recognize the need for greater transparency. And many politicians and ministers in Great Britain seem to indeed realize that the impact of lobbyism and the lobbying business as it works today threatens faith in the democratic system. For example, at the end of his election campaign, British Prime Minister David Cameron gave a speech criticizing the lobbying industries’ methods: the invitations to expensive lunches, the ex-ministers and ex-advisers’ use of political contacts to find work as lobbyists. Cameron continued, saying that lobbying in the United Kingdom had gotten out of control, with the rich and powerful able to buy too much influence. Unfortunately, the government has so far failed to effectively regulate the lobbying industry. As mentioned in the previous blink, an effective register would force all lobbyists to reveal their activities. In September 2013, the British government finally came up with a proposal for such a register. It would force lobbyists to divulge who they worked for, as well as how much cash they spent. However, by the time the final register passed into law, it proved very ineffective: only a couple of lobbyists were actually affected, and they only have to name their clients, and not how much money changes hands. It seems the fight for more transparency must go on. The key message in this book: Lobbying has become a huge commercial industry that uses various tactics to influence politics and the public for the benefit of for-profit corporations. This poses serious risks to our democracy, as big businesses have more influence over the government than individual citizens. Therefore we must become aware of the influence of lobbyists, and develop effective rules to make the industry more transparent.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Bernstein","summary":"These days, the marvel of trade is often taken for granted. Take the device you are reading these blinks on; it is almost definitely a result of global trade. Companies like Apple design their products in the United States, gather parts from all around the world to be assembled into devices in China and sell the finished products on the international marketplace. Global trade is a simple fact of life, linked to countless aspects of our daily lives. However, global trade has not always been this easy or ubiquitous. Before the Industrial Revolution, long travel times and primitive technology hampered efforts to expand international markets. However, since World War II, free trade has blossomed and, in many senses, has become indispensable for modern societies. It has produced both winners and losers, though, and many aspects of free trade indicate some possibly worrying times for the future. In these blinks, you’ll learn that the history of long-distance trade stretches back thousands of years; how a desire to speed up trade led to the discovery of the Americas; and why protectionism helped exacerbate the Great Depression. At your local supermarket, you might find fruit and vegetables from places as far away as Peru, New Zealand or Portugal; at Western appliance stores, you’ll see TVs from Japan or Taiwan; and at the clothing store, you’ll find shirts made in China or Bangladesh. Today’s globalized trade touches every part of our lives – but we hardly notice it anymore. To get the full story of how we reached this point, we have to rewind several thousands of years to Mesopotamia, where commerce began. Some of the earliest trade routes formed around the Persian Gulf, where agriculture was being developed and basic manufacturing methods were being used to create advanced tools. One of the earliest goods to be traded was obsidian, a black volcanic rock that was valued in prehistoric times because it was easy to turn into a razor-sharp weapon or tool. Archeologists have found obsidian flakes in the Franchthi Cave in Greece that date back over 12,000 years. And the only way for that obsidian to have ended up there was by having been transported from somewhere else, most likely from Mesopotamia. The region of Mesopotamia is often called “the cradle of civilization.” The ancient and fertile land was located between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, two waterways that connect to the Persian Gulf. Mesopotamia was rich in many goods, including barley, fish and wool. But it also lacked some vital resources, including the timber, metals and stone needed to build weapons, boats and shelters. The benefit of trade thus quickly became clear, and the Mesopotamian nations of Sumeria, Assyria and Babylonia used their surplus goods to trade for metals from Oman, marble from Persia and lumber from Lebanon. This is how the Persian Gulf became an early center for trade and commerce by 3000 BC. As civilization slowly spread westward to Egypt and Greece, new trade routes emerged in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Greece exported wine and oils in exchange for the grains it lacked, like the wheat it imported from Egypt. The Pleistocene is better known as the Ice Age, a period of millions of years in which massive glaciers formed. It ended around 10,000 years ago, but not before humans were able to migrate over the ice that formed to connect east Siberia to the American continent. Humans weren’t alone in using this ice bridge; species such as horses traveled in the opposite direction, from North America to Asia. These early horses were the evolutionary predecessors of camels. They developed a unique ability to preserve water and became perfect for Asia’s driest regions, especially Arabia. Prior to 1500 BC, camels were kept primarily for their milk, and donkeys were the pack animals of choice. But then, nomadic tribes began using camels for transportation, and it was soon clear that their huge padded hooves made them superior for carrying cargo, as they could handle twice as much weight. Not only that, they were twice as fast as donkeys when moving over the unfriendly, barren desert terrain. The introduction of camels was revolutionary to the ancient trade systems along the Arabian sands and Asian steppes. Luxury goods such as frankincense and myrrh, as well as precious aromatics, were soon moving throughout the Arab peninsula and the Mediterranean Sea. As trade progressed into the medieval era, China and the Muslim world began to increase their business with one another. The Prophet Muhammad, born in 571 AD, was raised by a prosperous trader, his uncle Abu Talib. So, as he grew into adulthood, Muhammad helped his uncle’s business, which handled trade in leather, raisins, textiles and frankincense. Chinese sources suggest that Muslim traders first arrived in China around 620 AD, and they came carrying goods such as copper, ivory, incense and turtle shells. Upon their return to Arabia, they brought back gold, pearls, silk and brocade. These were perilous journeys through dangerous waters and over treacherous terrain, but the promise of great wealth was tempting enough for many Muslim traders. Even so, shipwrecks were common, and many lives and riches were lost at sea. When a Westerner buys a pair of sneakers, chances are they only have a vague idea of where it was produced. China? Maybe India? The same thing applied to the spice trade, as European merchants in Genoa or Venice would be at a loss to name the precise origin of cinnamon or nutmeg. All they knew is that it came from the East. The insatiable appetite for spices first took hold in Europe around 1000 AD, during medieval times, when the demand for exotic spices soared. Since spices were so ravenously desired by wealthy Europeans, merchants could charge a pretty penny; in fact, their profits were usually well over 100 percent. Even physicians and pharmacists fell under the spell of spices, prescribing them for all sorts of ailments and adding them to their remedies. It wasn’t as if these spices cured anything, but their presence made the drugs attractive in a mysterious and exotic way. But there was a far more sinister side to spices: the slave trade. European merchants purchased their spices in Arab markets, like the ones in Cairo or Alexandria, Egypt. As payment, the merchants often sold slaves, mostly from the Balkan region, who would then be turned into Muslim soldier slaves. Unbeknownst to the European merchants, the spices they were buying were usually obtained in China by Arabs who traded ivory and incense for the sought-after ingredients. Before long, another danger of global trade would appear: disease. The worst disease by far was the plague, or the “Black Death,” as it became known, and the most gravely affected areas were port cities like Venice, Genoa or Bruges, where a lot of trade happened. Venice lost 60 percent of its population when the plague’s first wave hit in 1348. The disease is believed to have originated somewhere in China’s Himalayan region. From there, infected rats crawled onto ships headed to Arabia, and their fleas found their way into textile goods that were sent to Europe, where both humans and pets became infected. By the fifteenth century, the rising star of the trade world was Portugal. Having developed a new and improved cargo ship called the caravel, the Portuguese perfected the maritime technology that would allow Europeans to open their own trade routes in the Indian Ocean. Portuguese merchants set up strategic ports along the east coast of Africa, and they were the first to make it all the way around South Africa and back up toward the Indian Ocean. Spain was also growing in power, and a Spanish-Portuguese alliance moved boldly westward, into the vast open waters of the Atlantic. By this time, educated people no longer fooled themselves into thinking the world was flat, but heading westward in the hopes of finding a quicker route to India or China was still considered a dubious plan. Nevertheless, the Italian explorer, Christopher Columbus, was able to sell this idea to Spanish royalty. While no one knew what the exact length of the western route to India would be, one could estimate by subtracting the length of the eastward route from the Earth’s circumference. This was a distance that ancient scholars like Ptolemy had already calculated, and they were surprisingly accurate in showing it to be several thousand miles longer than the eastward route. Despite these predictions, Columbus was determined to pursue a westerly route. In 1492, he reached the Caribbean, where he was greeted by natives that he assumed were Indians. The New World of the Americas was now on the European map. In 1519, a Portuguese explorer named Ferdinand Magellan would further expand the known world with the first complete voyage around the globe. Setting out from Spain, Magellan sailed around the southern tip of the Americas and reached the Philippines, where his voyage was cut short by an angry native with a sharp Filipino spear. However, the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano became the ship’s new captain and continued the journey, sailing along the coast of Africa and back up to Spain, completing the circumnavigation of the world. With the amazing sea voyages of the sixteenth century, including those of Columbus and Magellan, humanity’s understanding of the world was expanding, along with the business of trade. It was now possible for a truly global economy to take shape. We can trace today’s globalized market back to the seventeenth century. The first global-minded traders were the Spanish, the Portuguese and the Dutch. Their powerful governments had experienced sailors with a thorough understanding of how to use the oceanic winds to their advantage. This useful knowledge is what allowed their trading vessels to cross the world’s oceans with ease while others struggled. By 1650, goods from all corners of the globe were crisscrossing through global marketplaces. It was now possible to find products such as corn, wheat, coffee, tea and sugar far from their native regions. After the voyages of Columbus, sugar cane from the Spanish Canary Islands was brought to the Caribbean, where large-scale cane production began. These efforts were undertaken purely for the eager European merchants back home. With the increase in global trade, some nations began looking to the mutual benefit of corporate mergers. The two greatest powers at the time were England, which operated the English East India Company, and Holland, which operated the Dutch East India Company. Over the course of the sixteenth century, both of these nations grew to become global superpowers, with Holland becoming the most financially advanced European country. By 1600, Holland’s interest rates were at a mere 4 percent, which spurred widespread borrowing and tremendous economic growth. By comparison, England’s borrowers were paying 10-percent interest on their loans. What helped Holland’s economic might most of all was the fact that Dutch capitalists were eager to invest that money in trade corporations like the Dutch East India Company. While Holland may have been top dog in the 1600s, as the years went on, European economic supremacy shifted toward England. By the eighteenth century, the world’s biggest corporate enterprise was the English East India Company (EIC), which had supreme control of the highly profitable cotton trade between India and Britain. The EIC was a classic example of a powerful monopoly, so it’s no surprise that it was an early target of scorn from free-trade advocates like the economist Adam Smith. It seemed clear to Smith that the British government should be supporting a variety of enterprises to promote healthy competition, instead of running a state monopoly. At the time, however, the prevailing economic theory was mercantilism, which adhered to the belief that international commerce was basically a zero-sum game. This meant that the EIC operated on the idea that there was only so much wealth to go around. So if they were going to prosper, everyone else had to suffer. The theory of mercantilism also held that a nation’s gold and silver reserves were a direct reflection of its wealth. In turn, this led mercantilist nations like England to prohibit any spending on imports, while encouraging exports. In 1721, if you were caught wearing imported cotton garments in England, you’d be subject to a £5 fine. Meanwhile, free-trade advocates like Henry Martyn tried to convince people that it was actually the amount that a nation consumed, not possessed, that defined its wealth. It wasn’t until the nineteenth century that free trade theories began to take hold. Adam Smith’s economic treatise, The Wealth of Nations, became highly influential and led England to encourage a multitude of businesses to compete in order to provide the best product and price. David Ricardo’s Principles of Political Economy and Taxation from 1817 also helped lay the groundwork for a new economy based on the law of comparative advantage. Ricardo recognized that a nation should focus on manufacturing goods that it can produce efficiently, while importing what it can’t. In 1860, England’s Cobden-Chevalier Treaty removed import tariffs on goods like French cotton and helped spread the spirit of free trade across Europe. Today’s manufacturing industry is like an elaborate dance with multiple partners. Different nations produce various pieces of cars, computers, TVs and stereos, then they’re shipped off and assembled somewhere else entirely. Sections of certain products might cross and recross two or more oceans before they become part of a final product ready for purchase. You might think this is a new way of doing business, but global manufacturing actually dates back to the nineteenth century. At the heart of this development were several breakthrough technologies that made long-distance transport and trade far easier. One of these technologies was the steamship, which became increasingly efficient until it finally surpassed sailing as the preferred means of shipping in 1890. The next development was the railroad, along with steam-powered locomotives, which revolutionized transport over land, especially in the United States. Railroads made it possible for a wide range of goods to be transported from one coast to the other regardless of the weather conditions. And then, in 1830, came refrigeration, which allowed cargo ranging from cut flowers to beef to be kept fresh on long journeys. By the late 1800s, the United States was sending several hundred thousand tons of beef to Britain each year, thanks to refrigerated compartments. By 1900, shipping costs were so cheap that transcontinental trade made good business sense. American grain could now compete with European grain and people around the world could buy tulips and eat strawberries year-round. These developments were perhaps most important for bulk trade goods, like coal and ore. England’s smelting factories imported ore from all over the globe, including Spain, Cuba, Australia, Chile and Arizona, and sent back coal to each of these destinations. Heading into the twentieth century, free trade appeared healthy and harmonious. But then came the events of the 1920s that sank free trade into an abyss that eventually led to the Great Depression. It all began in 1922, with the Fordney-McCumber Tariff, which set off a wave of protectionism in the United States. Signed into law by Republican President Warren G. Harding, the tariff was designed to protect American factories and farmers by setting import tariffs for various goods at over 40 percent. When it was first enacted, the new law seemed to work, leading to the happy-go-lucky times known as “the Roaring Twenties.” But those highs soon became crushing lows. The 1930s ushered in the Great Depression, and Republican politicians initially responded with even harsher protectionist efforts in the form of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised import tariffs to even higher levels. Now, the average tariff on imported goods was close to 60 percent. To understand why the United States went in this direction, we need to look at the trade developments of the nineteenth century. In 1870, the price of meat was 93 percent higher in Liverpool than in Chicago. But in 1913, that difference had shrunk down, like a piece of beef jerky, to a mere 16 percent. This was the result of shipping costs becoming so cheap. The prices for imported goods were converging with the price of local goods, and local competition was suffering, particularly where American food products were concerned. So, to protect their local businesses, merchants were calling for protectionism. What made matters worse was the reaction in Europe, which was one of pure horror. European nations enacted their own import tariffs on American goods, including cars or radios, which were well in excess of 50 percent. Economists now look to the Smoot-Hawley Act as one of the primary triggers for the Great Depression. But, as it turned out, the trend of protectionism wouldn’t last long. While the United States may have put the kibosh on free trade at the start of the twentieth century, by the 1950s, it was embracing it with open arms. This change of attitude happened in 1945, as World War II came to an end. Since the United States was the last man standing at war’s end, the nation had little to fear in terms of foreign competition, so the doors to the free market were once again open wide. Also helping matters were the advances that had been made in global transportation. With the introduction of the combustion engine and improved airplanes, as well as new shipping containers, free trade was not only beneficial – it made economic sense. The prevailing attitude in the United States now held that if American t-shirts could be produced at a slightly cheaper cost in another country, production should be moved there tomorrow! And this was a strategy that brought a great deal of wealth to the United States in the post-war years. Statistics show that all free-trading nations experienced high growth rates during the twentieth century – higher than non-free-trading nations. Data also shows how free trade can allow a developing country to join the ranks of world powers. However, free trade has not benefited everyone. Throughout the developed world, low-skilled laborers have seen very little of the rewards from free trade that people in management and high-skilled positions have experienced. Currently, the salary of the average worker in the West has remained stagnant for a full generation, while executive salaries are soaring. It is patently clear that this income disparity and general inequality are among the leading causes of social and political turmoil, which is why closing this gap needs to be a big priority. But instability isn’t just an issue of social and civic responsibility; it also discourages investment and slows economic development. So it really is in everyone’s best interest to close the wage gap, and soon. The key message in this book: Humans have traded with one another since our ancient ancestors first began to harvest crops and manufacture basic tools. As we continued to explore and expand, so did the trade routes, and nations that controlled the exchange of goods eventually became the global superpowers. History shows us that free trade has offered more rewards than isolationism and protectionism have, but it has also led to widespread inequality, and for this reason must be refined and improved.

There’s also little debate around the fact that the US and China currently have the largest concentration of bright minds working to develop these applications. China is so determined to become the world superpower in AI that they’re doing whatever it takes to pave the way for a booming AI industry. This includes heavily subsidizing the rent for AI-tech start-ups, and setting up one-stop-shops to make it easy to launch a new start-up. The Chinese government is even securing placements at competitive schools for the kids of start-up executives. Is it enough to topple the giants of Silicon Valley? Author Kai-Fu Lee has spent years in both Silicon Valley and its Chinese equivalent, Zhongguancun. He believes China is in a great position beat Silicon Valley, reign supreme in the new AI-based economy and thereby change the world order. In these blinks, you’ll find out how the Chinese version of Groupon became one of the world’s biggest start-ups; how WeChat became the world’s biggest super-app; and how a cancer scare made the author rethink our relationship to AI. Until recently, if people were talking about artificial intelligence (AI), it was likely in the context of science-fiction. But these days, everyone from schoolkids to CEOs are wondering what kind of changes AI has in store for us in the coming years. In fact, when the author gives talks at schools and executive conferences, he’s found that Chinese kindergarten students ask him the same questions as CEOs, such as, “Are we going to have AI teachers?” and “What kind of jobs are we going to have in the future?” While the emergence of real-world AI can seem like a relatively new thing, it’s been brewing for decades and has only now started being a major business tool thanks to a breakthrough in deep learning. The story of how we got to deep learning stretches back to the 1950s, when researchers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy had a goal of imbuing computers with human intelligence. And when the author started getting involved in this field in the early eighties, there were two camps working toward this: the rule-based people and the neural network folks. Rule-based AI believed that the best results would come from programming machines with one rule at a time, such as “cats have triangular-shaped ears.” The neural network camp, on the other hand, preferred to let the machine learn on its own, much as humans do, through experience. This way, a machine can analyze a picture of a cat and respond incorrectly, but this error will become data that it learns from. What neural network-based AI really needed was loads of data to analyze and faster computing power, which finally arrived in the mid-2000s. With the improved conditions, AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton was able to finally add the right amount of layers to the “neurons” and essentially multiply the AI processing power to a whole new level. When this happened, neural network was rebranded to deep learning. The big breakthrough was made public at a 2012 contest when Hinton’s new AI algorithm blew away the competition at visual recognition. Suddenly, AI was capable of processing complex problems, recognizing patterns and coming up with amazing results. It was clear that this technology was now applicable to a whole array of everyday functions, including visual and audio recognition, making complex financial decisions and even driving a car. Thanks to deep learning, an AI economy was on the way. In China, artificial intelligence had what the author calls a “Sputnik moment” in 2016. It happened when the AI program known as AlphaGo beat the champion Go player, Lee Sedol in a three-game tournament. These games had 280 million Chinese viewers glued to their TVs, and many were heartbroken when the visibly emotional Lee admitted defeat. But rather than breaking the people’s spirit, the people of China became inspired to harness the power of AI to their advantage – much like the launch of the Russian satellite, Sputnik, rallied Americans to be the first on the moon. And just as John F. Kennedy declared US intentions to land on the moon, following the Go tournament, the Chinese government issued a rallying cry declaring their ambition to become the global leader of AI innovation within the next ten years. This is particularly remarkable since just a few years prior, China was known more for being a hub of copycat technology than for its innovation. Indeed, in the early 2000s, China was copying every successful Silicon Valley product. This caused many in the West to write off China’s abilities as an innovative competitor. What the doubters failed to recognize though is that by being copycats, Chinese entrepreneurs were actually learning how to make their own world-class products. The best example may be Wang Xing, who made copycat Friendster, Facebook, Twitter and Groupon sites. In doing so, Wang not only learned how to design seamless products, he became a battle-hardened competitor who knew how to thrive in the cutthroat Chinese market. So by the time he turned his attention to his group discount service Meituan, he was ready to outperform Groupon itself. This time around, Wang didn’t copy the interface. He made it Chinese-friendly with densely-packed page designs. He also held back from overspending early on to woo customers and instead spent money for the long-term win by signing exclusive deals with vendors and creating a fast and reliable payment system. Unlike Groupon, Wang didn’t try to coast on one idea, either. He expanded and offered new products based on whatever was popular at the time, including movies, food delivery and local tourism. So, by 2014, Groupon was on the decline, selling for less than half its IPO, while Meituan was becoming the fourth most valuable start-up in the world. There are some fundamental differences between Silicon Valley’s and China’s start-ups, and a big one is having what’s known as a light or heavy touch. When a business has a light touch, it does one thing and leaves a lot of the particulars surrounding that service for others to deal with. This is the style of Silicon Valley companies like Uber, which connects people with a ride, but doesn’t deal with gas and car maintenance. The Chinese equivalent of Uber is Didi, and Didi also owns the gas stations and repair shops that keep their rides in service. This heavy touch approach is preferred in China since it generally makes it more difficult for a copycat start-up to fully duplicate a service. Having a heavy touch and controlling all aspects of a service can also lead to more data, which is vital to a good AI product. Already, China is sitting on the world’s biggest data goldmine. This is especially true when it comes to Tencent, the company behind WeChat, a certifiable super-app that people use for just about everything. To understand the phenomenon of WeChat, it’s important to understand that most Chinese people are mobile-first internet users, which means that their first internet experience was through a cheap smartphone, rather than a PC. With this in mind, WeChat has become the mobile app that lets you do everything you’d want to do with a PC. Thanks to mini apps within WeChat, you can not just chat with friends, but you can also order food for delivery, unlock a shared bike, buy groceries, buy movie tickets, purchase plane tickets, book a doctor’s appointment, order a prescription, and secure some stocks – all without leaving WeChat. Many of these functions are made possible by another mini app: the WeChat Wallet, which was introduced on Chinese New Year 2014. Every New Year’s Day, there’s a tradition of sending loved ones a red envelope with money inside. WeChat allowed users to do this electronically, with no transaction fees, and it was such a success that upon launch, five million people linked their bank accounts to WeChat and sent 16 million electronic red envelopes. Since the introduction of WeChat Wallet, China has become an increasingly cash-free society. That’s a lot of data under one roof, making it increasingly clear what people like to buy, where they travel and a whole lot more. The arrival of AI in our everyday lives is coming in four waves. The first is internet AI, and it’s already here. YouTube recommends the next video for you to watch based on an AI algorithm, and services like the Toutiao app not only recommends articles, it automatically generates them as well. As for who is the leader in internet AI, the author sees the US and China as neck and neck for now, but in five years, he predicts China will have a 60-40 advantage in terms of being able to dominate the market. This is thanks to China having more internet users than the US and Europe combined, and a population ready to make mobile payments to content creators. Already apps like WeChat Wallet allow people to send micropayments of a few cents to online content creators they like, and this type of environment is going to lead to innovative content from empowered creators – giving China the slight edge. The second wave is business AI, and this is the category where the US really has an advantage. Business AI is already emerging, with algorithms making decisions on financial portfolios and bank loans. China does have some impressive mobile services already, like Smart Finance, which makes loans without taking into account financial history or your zip code. Instead, it uses unique metrics like how long it takes you to answer certain questions and how much battery power your device has. In doing so, it’s proven to be a reliable loan service for migrant workers and other populations underserved by traditional banks, and the percentage of defaults is only in the single digits. However, one area of data China lacks is business records. Compared to China, the US has an impeccable history of record keeping, with databases full of banking, hospital and other business transactions. For this reason, the US is in great position for business AI and the author gives America a 90-10 advantage here. The five-year prediction is slightly better for China, with the US advantage cut to 70-30. The third wave of AI is perception AI, which includes voice and facial recognition programs. China has an advantage here, due in part to cultural differences. Americans have many “Big Brother” fears about their image and voice being captured, while the Chinese are more agreeable to the idea of giving up some privacy in return for more convenience. Perception AI has the potential to be an exciting area as it blurs the boundaries of online and offline. This is why this technology often falls under the category of online-merge-offline (OMO). One OMO application we’ll be seeing more of is the smart grocery store. Imagine grabbing a grocery cart that scans your face, recognizes you and brings up your shopping list. In doing so, it greets you in the voice of your favorite actor. And since it scans everything you put in the cart, it can stop you before you reach the checkout counter if you forgot anything. It could even remind you of your loved one’s favorite brand of wine as you approach that section. China is already making the Xiaomi line of products, which turn your home into a voice-activated, AI-enhanced environment. Due to a local manufacturing hub in Shenzhen, these products, which include speakers, refrigerators, rice cookers and vacuum cleaners, are very affordable. China’s manufacturing advantage and US privacy concerns, give China a 60-40 lead now, and the author expects it will grow to 80-20 in five years’ time. The fourth and final wave is autonomous AI. So far, we haven’t even gotten close to the kind of technology that gives robots human-like intelligence, and it’s possible that we never will. But we do have drones, which are becoming more advanced and machines that can recognize the color of a ripe strawberry and gently pick them. Google and Tesla are also transforming our motorways with driverless cars, which will be rolled out in years to come. So, the US currently has a big lead in autonomous AI, which the author puts at around 90-10, but China is eager to catch up. In fact, the Chinese government is very proactive in issuing AI-friendly policies and regulations, so it will be easier to implement this technology on a wide scale. Already, China is building a highway and an entire city the size of Chicago especially designed for AI vehicles. So in five years’ time, it’ll be closer to a 50-50 split. These days, when economists and researchers debate about what a world with an AI economy looks like, they tend to fall into two camps. Famed geneticist and researcher, Ray Kurzweil, is in the utopia camp. He sees machines as being the supreme tool for humans to enhance our bodies and minds, allowing us to become smarter and live longer. Similarly, AI researcher Demis Hassabis sees AI as the tool that will allow us to finally cure disease and solve problems like global warming. In the dystopia camp, there’s entrepreneur Elon Musk and physicist Stephen Hawking, who think AI’s potential represents a very serious threat to humanity. For example, an AI program could be asked to solve global warming and see wiping out humans as the best option. Opinions differ among economists as well, and much of the debate has stemmed from a 2013 study by Oxford University, which found 47 percent of US jobs to be at risk over the next 20 years due to increasing automation. Of course, most companies will be eager to cut costs and increase profits if they can automate certain tasks. And this brings us to an important difference in the reports that came after the 2013 Oxford study: Most of the automation that AI is currently capable of allows for certain tasks to be automated, but not entire jobs. For example, an automated tax advisor could do certain tasks, like calculate tax returns and check for inconsistencies, but it can’t have nuanced conversations with clients. With the difference between tasks and entire jobs in mind, more reports followed. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), only 9 percent of US jobs were at risk due to automation. In a 2017 report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC), 38 percent of US jobs were at risk, while McKinsey Global said that around 50 percent of tasks worldwide are “already automatable.” This is quite a range, and it’s a big reason why economists remain divided on the issue. The author tends to agree with the PWC report while thinking that the actual number of displaced workers may even be higher. This is because the reports didn’t take into consideration ground-up displacement, which will come from businesses like Smart Finance and Toutiao, which don’t employ any loan officers or editors. So these businesses won’t be adding automation and firing employees, rather they’ll displace loan officers and editors from the ground-up by not offering them a position in the first place. In 2013, the author was diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma. Up to this point, he was something of a workaholic, but that all changed. He realized that so much of the effort put into his career was meaningless now. Facing up to his own mortality, he now understood that being productive wasn’t what made him human – in fact, that was more like being a machine. What made him human was his relationships with his family, friends and those close to him. Thanks to a course of chemotherapy, he’s currently in remission, but the experience changed how he envisioned AI and humans working in harmony. The emergence of AI presents us with an amazing opportunity to hand over much of our unpleasant mechanical tasks to algorithms so that we can focus on the human aspect of our lives – interacting with one another, being part of a community and making the world a better place. However, this would require a fundamental shift in the value we place on certain jobs. Currently, highly-paid jobs are usually ones that generate profit, and these are also the jobs that can often be carried out by AI. Meanwhile, jobs that can’t easily be automated, such as caregivers and personal aides are undervalued and underpaid. Sure enough, this is a booming field in the US with 1.2 million home health aide and personal care jobs to be added within the next ten years. However, these jobs come with an average salary of around $20,000. If we can raise that salary while letting AI generate profit in the corporate sector, we could simultaneously ease the job displacement issue and better care for our communities. There are a lot of ideas for how to cope with displaced workers, like taxing the wealthiest people in order to issue a universal basic income, which would see that everyone received enough money to get by. And while some form of a basic income may be necessary, relying solely on this solution would be a shame. Doing so would be avoiding the opportunity to enact real social change that could benefit the entire world by creating human-centered labor markets not as driven by profit. Instead of focusing entirely on money, maybe we should be more like Bhutan, which looks at “Gross National Happiness” as the real sign of progress. The key message in these blinks: China is poised to become an AI superpower in the AI economy that is expected to be worth $15.7 trillion worldwide. Thanks to a government that is eager to help push new tech businesses forward, a robust manufacturing hub, and a goldmine of personalized data at their fingertips, China has what it needs to start making amazing AI products and applications. While some worry that an AI economy will result in devastating job losses, if we shift our values toward rewarding human-to-human jobs such as caregiving and community-based work, we may emerge as an even better society and improve the world we live in.

Lo","summary":"Even if you’ve never invested a dime in stocks or bonds, your life is still affected by the market. If you were looking for a job in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, you know exactly how reliant banks and everyday businesses are on a healthy economy. So it makes sense to have at least a basic understanding of how things work – and that’s exactly what these blinks provide. You’ll learn about the prevailing ideas regarding the stock market and the new ideas the author has put forward as to how things can improve. There’s no reason something as powerful as today’s financial system has to be stuck in an old way of doing things; it’s time we started thinking big and putting the system to work for the betterment of the whole world! In these blinks, you’ll find out how mortgage debt caused a worldwide crisis; how gambling addiction can teach us about the dangers of investing; and that the market could be used to help cure cancer. If you’ve taken an Economics 101 course, you’ve probably heard about the predominant theory about how the markets work: the Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH for short. In a nutshell, EMH theory suggests that the price of stocks, bonds and similar investment assets will always provide an accurate reflection of the health, profitability and general value of a company. In recent years, it’s become widely accepted that the EMH isn’t perfect, but academics and leading experts in the investment sector still regard it as the best theory out there. To see the EMH in action, let’s look at the company Morton Thiokol, which helped make rockets for NASA in the 1980s, including the faulty piece of equipment that was found to cause the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion in 1986. It made perfect sense that the value of Morton Thiokol shares plummeted in the minutes following the Challenger disaster because the company had just encountered a serious setback. The EMH works because it takes into account the collective wisdom of all the investors who are constantly analyzing the market and reflecting their best assessments of how well businesses will do in the price they’re willing to buy and sell their assets at. It’s generally agreed that by putting together all these active financial minds, you’ll get a fairly accurate reflection of a company’s value. Now, given this high regard for the EMH’s accuracy, it is also considered highly unlikely that anyone can “beat the market,” which would involve spotting something that everyone else has missed. And since you can’t beat the market, the standard advice is to “join the market” by investing in long-term, low-risk index funds, or mutual funds, which comprise a collection of stocks that will remain more or less untouched over time. By sticking with index funds for a long period, a patient investor can expect to take advantage of the stock market’s gradual increase in value over time. It was these standard principles of EMH that led John Bogle to create the Vanguard Index Trust, the first mutual fund, in 1976. Since then, the index and mutual fund businesses have become a multi-trillion-dollar staple of the finance industry. You might be thinking, if the Efficient Market Hypothesis is so accurate and simple, why do huge financial crises where assets are grossly misvalued, like the one in 2008, keep happening? The answer to this question has to do with human nature and the fact that those in control of the market are prone to making decisions based on irrational emotions. So, even if a company is by all accounts healthy, if the price of its stock takes a momentary dip, this can trigger a panicked response among traders worried about losing too much money and, in turn, will cause them to sell. This is known as behavioral economics. Therefore, what we need is a paradigm that takes into account both the logical rules of EMH and the illogical rules of human nature, which is exactly what the Adaptive Market Hypothesis does. Essentially, the Adaptive Market Hypothesis looks at the market from an evolutionary standpoint to recognize that everything happens for a reason. For example, when John Bogle introduced a new feature to the Vanguard Index Trust known as market cap weighted indexes, this was a response to increased competition and a way for Bogle’s mutual fund to require even less work from portfolio managers. Since mutual funds using Bogle’s new feature require less oversight, they cost less time and money to maintain, which in turn makes them more attractive to investors. So, if we look at market cap weighted indexes through the lens of evolution, it’s no wonder that this feature can be found in just about every one of today’s mutual funds; they’re the result of competition, innovation and natural selection, all taking place within the environment of an efficient market. Likewise, we should also consider seemingly illogical human characteristics, like overconfidence and fear of losing money, as natural parts of our own evolutionary desire to survive within the environment of the economic system. As the Adaptive Market Hypothesis shows us, all of these things can help us understand changes in the market. One of the limitations of the Efficient Market Hypothesis is that it assumes the rational investors will outweigh the impact of irrational investors. Even if we all agree that humans are bound to make mistakes and use poor judgment, the question remains: how adversely can these behaviors affect the market? First of all, it helps to understand just how irrational humans are when it comes to taking risks, determining probability and making financial decisions. Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have conducted insightful research that shows how mistaken we can be when it comes to high-risk economic decisions. Their findings show that people tend to be more concerned with avoiding losses than making gains, which means we will generally take greater risks in order to avoid those losses than we will to hit the jackpot. This tendency is known as loss aversion, and it is an important concept to keep in mind since it plays a significant role in how financially inefficient we can be. How bad can loss aversion get? Take Jérôme Kerviel, a junior trader at the French investment bank Société Générale. In 2008, Kerviel found himself with €4.9 billion in losses after he tried to cover up some relatively small losses through one reckless trading decision after another. The psychological pressure of loss aversion caused him to repeatedly “double down” instead of simply cutting his losses. Another irrational tendency is known as probability matching, which occurs when we’re trying to predict what’s going to happen next. Let’s say we’re at a roulette wheel, and after watching the last few spins, we’ve noticed that red has been coming up more frequently than black; in fact, red has been coming up 75 percent of the time. Due to probability matching, most people’s instinct would be to bet on red 75 percent of the time. However, if the trend continued and the result was indeed red 75 percent of the time, and we only bet on red 75 percent of the time, our probability of winning would only be 62.5 percent – not such great chances after all. The smarter, but less human, choice would be to bet on red 100 percent of the time and win 75 percent of the time. So, what is it exactly that makes us so prone to reckless and irrational decisions when dealing with money? Neuroscience suggests that the answer lies in how inextricably linked our decision making is to the emotional part of our brain. For example, sex, gambling and cocaine all provide the same result in our brain: the release of the neurochemical dopamine, which provides an extremely rewarding, pleasurable sensation. Through extensive research, neurologists have concluded that dopamine plays a central role in causing people to take irrational risks. This is something that the gambling industry is well aware of, as slot machines are designed to keep dopamine levels pumping so that gamblers will keep at it even as their money disappears. The machines have the added psychological manipulation of framing a loss as almost being a win, which has also been proven to trigger the release of dopamine. So, even if a player only hits two out of the three cherries needed for a jackpot, they get more pleasure than they would if the game was a strict win/lose scenario. With enough repetition, dopamine-related activities like this can easily become habit-forming and lead to a destructive addiction. But what’s also important to consider is the state of mind we are in during emotional situations where dopamine is involved. In these moments, we are far more likely to make decisions based on impulse instead of rational consideration. This is something pilots have to be repeatedly trained to understand. If the engines of an airplane were to fail and cause it to fall from the sky, it would be natural for the pilot to panic and instinctively pull up on the controls. However, this would actually cause the plane to reduce its speed even further and thus make a safe landing much less likely. What the pilot should do is angle the plane downward in order to gain speed such that it can level out for a smooth landing. Since this is such a counterintuitive response, airline pilots go through hundreds of hours of training in order to overwrite their natural instincts. Unfortunately, when dealing with money and trying to make the right decisions, we’re often in a fearful state of mind and experience the heightened emotional state of panic that accompanies it. This, in turn, is how we end up making irrational mistakes and piling up avoidable losses. You’ve heard the phrase, “survival of the fittest,” right? It’s a simplification of Darwin’s theory of natural selection, which states that only those with optimal traits will survive within certain species and environments, and over time, we will see these traits become more dominant. As the Adaptive Market Hypothesis shows us, economies function in much the same way, and it’s the regulators, investors, insurance companies and hedge funds that are trying to survive. However, rather than “survival of the fittest,” in the environment of financial markets, we can see that the law of the land has become “the survival of the richest.” This is perhaps best illustrated by looking at how hedge funds have developed over the years. Hedge funds are partnerships between wealthy investors, and they’re the brainchild of Alfred Winslow Jones, a statistician and sociologist. In 1949, with $100,000, Jones started the first hedge fund as a way to buy favorable stocks he expected would grow in value while selling short the weaker stocks he believed were ailing. By doing so, he was essentially hedging his bets and lessening some of the risks inherent in investing – hence the name hedge fund. Over the next two decades, this first hedge fund was making annual returns of over 20 percent, and Jones was featured in a Fortune magazine profile. Even though the exact methods used by hedge funds are still kept secret, they were soon popping up everywhere. This is the evolutionary nature of the adaptive market in action: a new, superior species is introduced and soon begins to multiply and dominate. Of course, not all hedge funds make the right decisions, and the weak ones can quickly die out. But the effective ones are often wildly successful and, to this day, many new ones emerge each year as the market’s process of natural selection continues. As we saw in the previous blinks, when the efficient market is working properly, all stock prices accurately reflect their true value. This is known as a state of equilibrium. According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, prices tend to fluctuate from time to time, but the market will eventually return to equilibrium. And this is why long-term investments make sense, as they allow you to wait out the fluctuations, safe in the knowledge that it’s just a matter of time before your investments attain their true worth. It sounds good in theory, but there might be an even better plan that emerges from the Adaptive Market Hypothesis. After all, there are some markets that will go through downturns longer than any investor can reasonably expect to wait out. For example, the Japanese market crashed in 1991 and remained stagnant for the next 20 years, a period known as the “lost decades.” No investor should be expected to wait that long for equilibrium to arrive, which is why staying passive isn’t always the best idea. Instead, it’s sometimes best to adapt to the changing conditions of the market. Let’s say a stock’s price dramatically decreases as a result of a few irrational investors who want to sell at all costs. The efficient market approach would be to ignore this downturn, comfortable in the belief that the price will eventually bounce back. However, in some cases like this, what’s known as a behavioral premium may arise. This is when the irrational action becomes the dominant train of thought and more investors start pushing to sell, thus adversely affecting the long-term value of the company. In this scenario, relying on the efficient market would be unwise. The better reaction would be to take a dynamic approach and always be ready and willing to change your investments according to whatever situation may arise. In the above example, this would mean also selling the shares that are plummeting in value. Following the 2008 financial crisis, when investors were faced with the tough decision of how to react, many of them started casting blame and looking for explanations. So what happened? Most financial crises are an example of what happens when a market changes faster than investors can adapt. In most situations, adaptation happens over long stretches. For example, the great white shark has had 400 million years to become one of the ocean’s deadliest animals. But if you take it out of the water and place it on land, it wouldn’t be able to adapt to the radically different conditions and soon perish. Many financial institutions are just the same: they’ve spent decades doing things one way and struggle to adapt to radical change. In the 1990s, the financial market underwent a series of unprecedentedly rapid changes, and at the heart of it all were new adjustable-rate mortgages. To make the most of these new mortgages, a number of new business options emerged, like collateralized debt obligations, which packaged the mortgage in a fancy new securities bundle, and credit default swaps, which could be used to buy and sell insurance against debt, thereby encouraging even more investors to join the fray. When these new possibilities took off, a housing bubble was created. By 2003, over $3 trillion worth of mortgage-related securities were issued in the United States; meanwhile, with a few exceptions, economists continued to be largely oblivious to the potential consequences surrounding these mortgages. Then, in 2006, housing prices peaked and began to fall while interest rates were on the rise. As a result, many homeowners were forced to default on their mortgage payments, triggering a chain reaction where the value of banks’ investments plummeted, dragging share prices down and resulting in a full-on panic. By the time people realized what was happening, it was too late; the entire mortgage industry was collapsing, and the financial industry was going down with it. By looking at things in light of the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis, we can get a better understanding of what happened. But could the theory even have prevented the crash from happening in the first place? If the Adaptive Market Hypothesis can help us see what went wrong in 2008, can it perhaps also point us to a better way forward, with more reliable markets? What history tells us is that we need better legislation to help prevent greed and fear-based decisions from ruining and damaging our economy. Robust legislation can play a central role in keeping our financial systems in check. After the crash of USAir Flight 405 in 1992, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash was not caused by faulty technology or any wrongful action on the part of the crew; rather, it was the result of systemic flaws within the aviation industry. Since it is an independent organization separate from the airline industry, the NTSB was able to conduct an effective investigation and offer its unbiased findings, which allowed them to point the finger at irresponsible airlines and inadequate regulations. If we really want to prevent future financial crises, we need a financial equivalent of the NTSB to investigate and analyze current problems and determine better regulations. Ultimately, what the industry should strive for is a way to make the world a better place. There’s no reason why the financial industry should remain synonymous with greed and selfishness when it could use its power for the good of all humankind. For example, there’s currently very little private investment being made in the field of biomedicine, since it’s considered a high-risk field in which rewards usually take ten years or more to arrive. But if we gave this field the kind of attention we’ve given others, we could very well cure cancer within our lifetime. For example, there could be a “CancerCures” fund, managed by a panel of biomedical experts and experienced healthcare investors. Within it could be 150 independent research projects funded by public investors through the use of bonds, similar to the kind that helped fund the allied war effort during World War II. These research projects could be organized in a diversified manner to reduce risk and offer a high likelihood of good returns. With 150 independent projects looking at a wide range of treatments, we can estimate a 98-percent probability that at least three of them would be successful. This would combine mass investment with a nearly guaranteed payday! And it needn’t stop at cancer. With this kind of model, there’s no limit to the possible advances humanity could make. The key message in this book: We’re long overdue for a new approach to our financial markets, one that acknowledges the human flaws of those participating in the system and recognizes the great potential the system has to do good.

Naylor","summary":"How many electronic gadgets do you own? Well, you’re reading this on at least one of them, but it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume you have more! And when the tech companies come out with another edition, what do you do? Are you still satisfied with what you have? Or would you prefer to have the newest model? Society as a whole has become addicted to consumption. Our sheer desire for more stuff is inhibiting our lives. It makes us work so much that we don’t have time for things that matter in life, and we’re destroying our planet in the process. In these blinks, you’ll learn about our current affliction with affluenza, and what we can do to solve it. You’ll also learn why Americans are so eager to buy and consume more and more products; about the damage overconsumption does to our physical and mental health; why our overconsumption is destroying the planet; how you can cure your affluenza and lead a simpler life; and how schools and governments can help reduce and end overconsumption. Imagine if the history of Earth was compressed into just seven days. How much time do you think human civilization would take up? Well, the development of agriculture would take two seconds. The Industrial Age – the last 200 or so years – would take just one hundredth of a second. In this brief blip since the Industrial Revolution, we’ve consumed more resources than all people in Pre-Industrial human history combined. Americans now spend 71 percent of their $15 trillion economy on consumer goods. This vast increase in consumption can mostly be attributed to technological advances. The Industrial Revolution dramatically increased our productivity: we can produce a great deal more, with a smaller workforce and lower costs. People used to think that this increase in productivity would allow us to be more relaxed and have more free time. In fact, in 1965, the United States Senate estimated that by the year 2000, the working week would only be 14–22 hours long. Instead, we’ve continued to work long hours, and some people work even more now thanks to laptops and mobile phones. Rather than enjoying society’s increase in production, we’ve become afflicted with affluenza. Affluenza is our addiction to consumption, and it’s taking over our lives. Nowadays, we spend most of our brief free time buying products or consuming them. Affluenza prevents us from giving proper attention to things that make us truly happy, like relationships or exercise, for example. The United States essentially reached a “happiness plateau” in 1957. Since then, the number of Americans who consider themselves “very happy” has steadily declined. People think consumption brings them joy, but affluenza is actually lowering our quality of life. Do you have kids? If so, what do you do when you’re not looking after them or working? Do you go out, or are you too exhausted? Do you find you prefer to spend your free time just flopping down on the sofa? You aren’t alone if you answered yes to that last question – most people would prefer to flop. Because we spend most of our time working to raise money to buy things, we scarcely have time left for our family, friends and communities. Even our time with our children is often not spent well. Most often, we’re simply driving our kids from one class or activity to the next. In fact, the number of hours families spend together on holidays or at meal times has declined by one third since the 1930s. Most of our precious time away from work and children is spent wearily watching TV. Couples no longer socialize together, but stay at home. This process of social withdrawal is called cocooning. We try to compensate for this unhappiness by buying things. In our society, cocooning is prevalent and people often lack the time to form meaningful relationships. We end up trying to buy our social lives. For example, one compulsive American buyer who spoke to the authors bought several expensive TVs and stereos in the hope of feeling less lonely. He knew his neighbors would regard him as an expert in electronics and come to him when they needed advice. Our addiction to work and shopping leads to a vicious cycle. We buy more stuff to fix the problems caused by our desires to buy stuff in the first place. This cycle prevents us from seeking out things we truly need – connections to other people and nature. The social cost of affluenza is massive, but something else is being destroyed at an even greater rate: the environment. After decades of rapidly increasing consumption, we’ve mined most of the world’s easily accessible resources. This means we have to turn to more dangerous and complicated mining procedures. Copper, which we use for a wide range of products, has been extensively overmined – yet we continue to extract it. In fact, it’s estimated that more than half of all copper ever used in history has been dug out of the Earth in the last 24 years. We have to keep digging deeper to fulfill our needs, and we take big risks by doing so. One copper mine near Salt Lake City was three-fifths of a mile deep and 2.5 miles wide before it collapsed after a landslide. Our desire for oil has also led us to mine in dangerous areas. The Deepwater Horizon oil mine was an unfortunate example of this. It ran a mile deep into the ocean, and when it accidentally exploded, oil gushed into the sea for 87 days. It released about 4.9 million gallons and caused great damage to the wildlife around it. Our overconsumption has a massive impact on the Earth’s ecosystem. Each year, the average middle class family is indirectly responsible for the movement, processing and disposal of four million pounds of material. This has dire consequences for nature. In fact, we might currently be on the verge of the most high-impact species extinction since the dinosaurs: Coral reefs are dying off at alarmingly rapid rates. Huge chunks of reef in the Americas have died off in this decade, due to environmental changes like rising ocean temperatures and increased pollution. Our affluenza isn’t just harming us – it’s harming the planet we call home as well. It’s probably not a surprise to anyone that the worst problems caused by overconsumption are felt most by the poor. In our quest to have cheaper and cheaper products, we’ve shifted a great deal of our production to developing countries like Bangladesh, where wages and working conditions are abysmal. At least 1,800 workers have died in factory fires and building collapses in Bangladesh since 2005. Cost-cutting strategies that hurt the environment also disproportionately affect the poor. One manufacturing area of Louisiana, for example, has been nicknamed “Cancer Alley” because there are so many carcinogens in the air and water. Not surprisingly, the area is mostly inhabited by the poor. The standards for consumption set by the media only exacerbate our affluenza. Countless popular TV shows, like Desperate Housewives or CSI, are set in wealthy neighborhoods. Viewers see these affluent areas, and internalize them as the standard they want to reach. As American shows become more popular in developing countries, viewers in poorer nations also internalize American standards of consumption, however unrealistic they might be. This is illustrated very sadly in cities like Manila. One of Manila’s most luxurious shopping malls sits next to an enormous garbage dump called “Smokey Mountain” where thousands of people live. Rising income inequality hurts everyone, not only the poor. Of the 22 leading industrial nations in the world, the United States is ranked last in income equality. Countries with high income inequality have lower standards in health and greater crime rates across all classes. Although rich Americans are happier (on average) than poor Americans, they have the same life expectancy as poorer people in more egalitarian European states. When people criticize affluenza, they’re often told that overconsumption is inevitable. The desire for material things, people say, is “human nature.” But is there any truth to this claim? There isn’t. Affluenza is not a part of human nature. In the Stone Age, humans spent about three to eight hours a day “working.” Even today in remote tribes, people follow similar patterns. Allen Johnson, a UCLA anthropologist, lived with the Machiguenga tribe in the Amazon rain forest for two years and observed this. He described the Machiguenga as “people who always have enough time. They’re never in a hurry.” This sort of lifestyle is arguably more “affluent,” in the sense of being truly fulfilling. In the West we perpetually need more material things to feel satisfied, but the Machiguenga know that as long as they can survive, they can spend time enjoying their life. Time spent socializing or making crafts brings much greater happiness than overconsumption. Even before the current onslaught of affluenza, intelligent thinkers throughout history have criticized the desire for material things. Aristotle, for instance, denounced people “who have managed to acquire more external goods than they can possibly use, and are lacking in the goods of the soul.” The Stoic philosophers also spoke against materialism. Seneca once said, “A thatched roof once covered free men; under marble and gold dwells slavery.” Many religions also encourage their followers to stay away from overconsumption. In the Garden of Eden, for example, Adam and Eve had everything but still wanted more. Their greed led to the fall of mankind. In fact, Jesus himself was one of the strongest opponents of affluence. He encouraged his followers to let go of all their possessions. The Bible preaches that you should be content with what you have. One reason that affluenza is so difficult to escape is that it’s actually built into our economy. Many companies have a planned obsolescence for their products. That means the products are designed to only last a short time, or else be continually upgraded. Gillette's disposable razors are an example of this. Planned obsolescence means that customers are forced to continuously buy a new version of the same product. Products are often upgraded only in style rather than quality, so consumers buy them even when they don’t function differently to the old version. This idea was first promoted by General Motors. After the Great Depression, they began introducing a new model every year to boost the demand for cars. After World War Two, this became commonplace for many more products. Just think about how often a new iPhone comes out to make you feel yours is old. To feed our desire for consumption, we have low-interest loans and credit cards so we can put off paying until later. Few people can afford a new car every year, so the masses needed another way to increase their purchasing power: cheap personal loans. Personal loans allow people to buy whatever they want and worry about paying for it later. A TV advert by Bank of America crassly illustrated how easily Americans could be seduced into getting loans. “Do you have money jitters?” it asked, “Ask the obliging Bank of America for a jar of soothing instant money. M-O-N-E-Y. In the form of a convenient personal loan.” When credit cards became popular, the problem only got worse. Now people can carry their personal loan in their pocket, without even having to ask Bank of America. How long do you think you can walk down the street without seeing an advertisement? Probably only a few seconds, if that. Adverts are everywhere. We see them constantly: two-thirds of newspaper space and half the mail we receive is advertisements. Nowadays, there are even adverts in some student textbooks. You might see a math problem for children that reads, “If Joe has 30 Oreo™ cookies and eats 15, how many does he have left?” Naturally, it will be next to an enticing photo of Oreos. Adverts are highly effective, and their ubiquity deeply impacts our lives. In fact, the average American can identify fewer than ten types of plants, but hundreds of corporate logos. Alongside the adverts, PR strategists also try to manipulate us into affluenza without us noticing. One PR tactic for getting people to consume more is funding front groups. Front groups are organizations with scientific-sounding names that endorse the companies that create them, to make them seem more credible. For example, “The American Council on Science and Health” may sound like a respectable organization, but it was actually created by fast food companies and petrochemical firms to defend their products against criticism. The “Heartland Institute” is another front group. It supports energy companies in their campaign against climate change awareness. The Heartland Institute even launched a billboard campaign that featured a photo of the Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, an anarcho-environmentalist who killed three people. The caption below his picture read, “I still believe in global warming. Do you?” Unfortunately, campaigns like this are quite effective: about two-thirds of Americans still believe that global warming is controversial within the scientific community, when in fact it’s widely acknowledged. So now that we’ve learned about affluenza, how can we move on? How can we cure ourselves of it? Well, the first step is to identify its main symptoms. Recognize that consumption can’t buy satisfaction, while reducing your consumption can lead to greater happiness. One former stockbroker, Joe Dominguez, for example, remarked that his rich colleagues on Wall Street were just as unhappy as people in the ghetto where he grew up. Clearly, happiness must be determined by something other than money. In 1995, a survey conducted by the Center for a New American Dream concluded that 86 percent of Americans who voluntarily decreased their level of consumption were happier afterward. So, to increase your quality of life, find ways to consume less. Try to get more out of what you already have, rather than trying to have more. Some young professionals in Seattle have found an interesting way to break away from cocooning. They move into tiny apartments called “apodments” which are only four by four by ten square metres. Having a tiny apartment means you have to spend more time outside, in nature or with friends. We also need support from others to cure our affluenza, just as an alcoholic needs support to stay sober. Cecile Andrews’s book The Circle of Simplicity offers good advice on this. Andrews describes how anyone can start voluntary study circles where members help each other live well on a lower income. She’s started hundreds herself, and thousands of people have benefited from this. Today, finding like-minded people who also want to cure their affluenza is even easier – you just have to look online. Arranging to meet in person, or even just meeting online, can be very helpful in your battle against affluenza. Affluenza is all around us. Every street, every TV and every newspaper we see compels us to buy more and more things we don’t truly need. As with any other disease, we need a kind of vaccination to protect us. And that means we need to use the virus itself to generate the resistance. Anti-ads have thus far been a good implementation of this idea. They seem authentic at first, until viewers realize that they’re seeing the exact opposite of an advert. That moment of realization causes the viewers to really think about what they’ve seen, which is the opposite of what regular adverts want. One anti-ad, for instance, featured two cowboys similar to the Marlboro Man, riding horses into the sunset. Below them, the caption read, “I miss my lung, Bob.” Anti-affluenza efforts like this are especially important for children. While children spend 40 minutes a week outside, they now spend about 50 hours a week with electronic media. Many schools nowadays teach children to analyze the media and question the advertisements they see. This is called “media literacy” and in our digital age of growing affluenza, it might be just as important as literacy itself. A good documentary for increasing your media literacy is The Story of Stuff, directed by a former Greenpeace activist. It details the director’s 12 years of experience studying waste disposal and its effect on the environment. The authors consider The Story of Stuff one of the most important tools for immunizing against affluenza. So if you’re interested in learning more after these blinks, why not look it up? We need to educate ourselves about our affliction if we want to rid ourselves of it.                The key message in this book: In the Post-Industrial age, our society has become afflicted with a serious disease: affluenza. We’re obsessed with consuming, and it’s ruining our lives and planet. We urgently need to cure ourselves if we want true happiness, and want to save our home. Actionable advice: Make more out of your money, not more money. We’re stuck in a rat race where we chase money all our lives – try to resist it. Don’t expect that more money will mean more happiness. It won’t, and in fact, you’ll be happier if you buy less stuff. Suggested further reading: Manufacturing Consent by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky Manufacturing Consent takes a critical view of the mass media to ask why only a narrow range of opinions are favored whilst others are suppressed or ignored. It formulates a propaganda model which shows how alternative and independent information is filtered out by various financial and political factors allowing the news agenda to be dominated by those working on behalf of the wealthy and powerful. Far from being a free press, the media in fact maintain our unequal and unfair society.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Blinder","summary":"Do you remember what watching the news was like back in, say, 2004? There may have been some gloomy items about terrorism and climate change, but the economy was looking better than ever: jobs were ripe for the taking and that house you’d just bought was getting more valuable by the day! So what exactly happened in 2007–2008 to transform the economic news into near uniform gloom? In short: one of the biggest financial crises of all time. In these blinks you’ll find out exactly what caused it and what the US government did to rescue the economy from going into a complete tailspin. If they hadn’t pulled it off, you wouldn’t have needed to worry about bad economic headlines as you wouldn’t have been able to afford a computer, television or a newspaper to learn the news. In these blinks, you’ll find out: Why some people thought their house values would quadruple in just seven years. What caused the collapse of a 150-year-old prestigious Wall Street icon. What links banks to Wile E. Coyote, the cartoon coyote who falls off vertical cliff faces. Let’s start off by looking at why the financial crisis happened in the first place. Before the financial crisis first became evident in 2007, buying a house or investing in bonds seemed like a very profitable investment. (In case you’re wondering, bonds are financial instruments for which the issuing company pays you an annual fixed rate of interest). But underneath this positive outlook both markets were in fact in serious trouble. First of all, a price bubble developed in the housing market, meaning that the prices had risen to wholly unsustainable levels. Indeed, between 1997 and 2006, house prices had risen by an average of 85 percent. Despite this rise, or perhaps because of it, people kept investing in houses, naively believing that the prices would just keep rising year after year. This was shown by a survey of Los Angeles’ home buyers, many of whom believed that their house values would rise by 22 percent each year, so that if they were to buy a house for $500,000, it would be worth over $3.6 million in ten years. Clearly these expectations were delusional. Meanwhile, the bond market had also developed a price bubble. To bounce back from a slump in the economy in 2001, the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates at which banks could borrow money from each other to just one percent. The idea was that banks themselves would begin paying lower interest on people’s bank accounts, thus encouraging people to spend rather than save money. At the same time, the cut was reflected in the interest rate that investors got from buying government bonds, so they looked for more profitable investments. What they found were bonds known as Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) – essentially pools of mortgages from which the investor buys a slice as a bond and then earns money from the interest payments homeowners make on their mortgages. At the time the housing market was booming, so MBSs were highly profitable, and hence desirable. This fuelled a price bubble in the mortgage-bond market too. The price bubbles discussed in the previous blink did not just magically appear in the housing and bond markets. Rather, they developed as a result of poor regulation by both the banks and the government. The housing bubble, for example, was partly caused by banks approving people for mortgages for which they did not qualify. These subprime mortgages were issued to borrowers even when their income levels and credit history should have given lenders cause for concern. But for the banks, the main thing was to sell lots of mortgages to fuel the housing boom. For example, one married couple in California who picked strawberries for a living and made a combined annual income of $27,000 were given a $720,000 mortgage! It was clear that in the long term most borrowers like them would eventually default on their loans. As for the bond market bubble, it was partially due to the government’s poor understanding and regulation of a new type of financial instrument: the Credit Default Swap (CDS). CDSs are basically an insurance policy that an investor can buy against a bond defaulting. For example, if they bought a mortgage bond, and the homeowners defaulted on their mortgages, the bond would default as well. In this case the investor who bought the bond is normally left with nothing. However, if they have taken out a CDS for the bond, they pay an annual fee to the CDS issuer, but then receive compensation should the bond default. This is analogous to car insurance: you pay a premium, but the insurance company pays you if your car is totaled. So why was this instrument a problem? Without proper regulation, CDSs became so popular and widespread that if people had started defaulting on their mortgages en masse, so many bonds would have defaulted that the CDS issuers wouldn’t have been able to pay out. And this is what happened to AIG Insurance, one of the biggest CDS-issuing insurance companies in the world: when many bonds defaulted, AIG was essentially bankrupted. In 2007 it was time to pay the Pied Piper: the bubbles began to burst. In the following months and years, shockwaves traveled throughout the financial system, bringing some of the largest financial institutions in the world to their knees. Perhaps the biggest shock was the downfall of Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest American investment institution, which had been around since the 1850s. Lehman Brothers failed primarily because it had invested heavily in subprime mortgages, and was stuck when all these borrowers defaulted on their loans. In 2008 the company filed for bankruptcy, an event which panicked Wall Street. If a Wall Street icon like Lehman’s could fall, who’d be next? This panic spread throughout the market, and banks simply stopped lending to each other, worrying only about holding on to enough capital themselves. This development put several financial institutions in a precarious position of potentially facing huge losses but being unable to raise funds to cover them. One such company was the giant AIG Insurance. The company had half a trillion dollars worth of CDSs, and would have to pay out on them should the mortgages underlying them default. Exactly one day after the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, AIG was in trouble: major international credit rating agencies – companies that judge the financial health of other companies – downgraded AIG’s credit grade. This indicated that it was considered less solvent, meaning less capable of paying back its debts. To prevent this huge company from failing, the Federal Reserve was forced to loan AIG $85 billion. This was done because the government feared that should AIG also collapse, the economy would slide from a mere recession into a fully fledged depression. Thus it was the taxpayers who ended up rescuing the financial system after the two toxic market bubbles burst. In the following blinks you’ll discover exactly how the US government managed to rescue the financial system and the economy. As the financial system collapsed, governments around the world decided to take action. The US government started the ball rolling by enacting the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) in 2008. The program’s main goal was to help revitalize the big banks, because their failure would have affected the entire economy. TARP helped banks by providing them with capital. This capital injection made them more solvent, so they could better pay their creditors and bills. The first banks to receive money were the major Wall Street banks like Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, who received $125 billion in total. After this, smaller banks got their share too, and overall, nearly $205 billion was allocated to 700 different American banks. But in addition to this, TARP funds were also used for other purposes. They were used to guarantee the assets of Citigroup and Bank of America. This meant that the banks’ loans and bonds were guaranteed by the US government should they fail, thus assuaging the fears of creditors. TARP funds were also used to bail out the failing American auto industry, which was on the verge of collapse thanks to high gas prices, superior foreign competition and the recession that followed from the financial crisis. All in all, TARP is considered by some economists to have been one of the most successful economic policies in the history of the United States. Although it’s hard to say what would have happened if TARP had not been enacted, one thing is for sure: a depression was avoided in the years that followed the crisis. After the financial crisis, one of the most immediate concerns on the mind of the American public was the lack of job security. This is because a financial crisis usually causes the economy to contract, resulting in fewer jobs. The US government resolved to do something about this and enacted the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) in 2009. This fiscal stimulus package bill was meant to inject funds into the economy to boost and stabilize it, and it was one of President Barack Obama’s first big moves in office. In essence, the ARRA used the principles advocated by twentieth-century British economist John Maynard Keynes: One of Keynes’ main theories was that the government could increase demand for goods and services in the economy by increasing government spending or decreasing taxation. For instance, if the government creates a job for you through its spending, you would have more money thanks to your wage. Alternatively, if the government were to decrease taxation, the amount of money you would take home would be higher. In both scenarios, you’re likely to spend the excess cash on goods and services. This in turn stimulates employment, as businesses would need to hire more workers to churn out more goods and services. To achieve this effect, ARRA comprised both elements: tax cuts and aid to state and local governments to help them keep their taxes low, and increased spending on things like unemployment benefits and work projects to create new jobs. The ARRA spending continues to this day, but it hit its peak during the second quarter of 2009, at $100 billion per quarter. One report estimated that this translated into a cost of $100,000–$170,000 per new job created. Whether or not this can be considered a success story is still debated by Republicans and Democrats today, but if anything ARRA showed the government’s willingness to support the private sector to save the economy. After the financial crisis, the government realized it couldn’t just focus on damage control. Much as doctors aim to prevent diseases rather than just cure them, the US government wanted to safeguard the sickly financial sector, and in 2010 signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law to reform America’s economic regulatory policy. The law aimed to change the way the financial system is regulated by placing limitations to prevent the get-rich-quick behavior that was endemic in leading financial institutions, as well as by ensuring that the government had a more advanced legislative “lookout tower” to detect potential future economic crises. Some of the other laws in Dodd-Frank aimed to: Prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts in the future by stating that troubled financial institutions would no longer be saved by the government. Regulate the way Wall Street’s biggest executives were compensated so that they would not be rewarded for taking huge risks. Create a new regulatory body – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – to protect the interests of consumers in the financial system. Unfortunately, it’s too early to gauge the effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank Act, because although it was signed into law in 2010, it hasn’t been fully implemented and is still working its way through the machinery of Senate and Congress. This slow roll-out comes because some policy changes can’t be pushed too quickly, as drastic changes could once again cause panic and confusion. Of course, the true effectiveness of the act in preventing or alleviating financial crises won’t become apparent until another crisis presents itself. In the last blink, you’ll discover the main lesson learned by governments and private institutions in the aftermath of the mess. Hopefully, new legislation will help purify the financial system. First of all, the government must regulate the financial sector more strictly, and indeed this is one of the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act. One of the causes of the financial crisis was the attempt by some banks to evade the law by, for example, lying about their debts to regulatory authorities. Increased regulation will help prevent this, as well as enabling price bubbles to be spotted sooner. But secondly, financial institutions must also regulate themselves by instituting better banking practices. Too often they chase growth and profits in booming markets without giving any thought to the risks to which they’re exposing themselves. This foolishness calls to mind the antics of the cartoon character Wile E. Coyote. He’s usually in pursuit of the Roadrunner, an ultra-fast bird he wants to eat. In his fervor to catch his prey, Wile E. Coyote often runs so fast he shoots off the road and over a cliff. He doesn’t immediately realize this and keeps running in midair without falling. It is only when he glances down and realizes that his feet are no longer on solid ground that he plummets several hundred feet. This behavior is actually analogous to the way the banks operated during the crisis: they kept chasing after profits that came from sources that were unsustainable in the long term. When they finally realized the problem, it was too late: they had already run off a cliff. Rather than continue this behavior, financial institutions should tread carefully, working to identify bubbles and avoiding actions that inflate them further. All in all, while the government has a role to play in regulating the financial system, private financial institutions must also try to ensure that similar financial meltdowns never occur again. The key message in this book: The financial crisis stemmed from two toxic price bubbles in the housing market and the mortgage-bond market. When they burst, several major financial institutions were in such dire straits that the US government had to support them. Thankfully, the measures were successful and prevented the economy from sliding into a full-blown depression. Actionable advice: Think long and hard before taking on a mortgage. Many people dream of homeownership, and when large mortgages are easy to get, it often seems one would be foolish not to seize the chance. But before you take on a mortgage, think carefully about the long-term obligation it carries, often lasting decades. Many things can change in that time span. What if you lose your job? What if interest rates quintuple? What if house prices tank and your neighborhood becomes a deserted dust bowl? Aim to get a mortgage that is sustainable even in a worst-case scenario, not one you can barely handle when everything’s stable. Don’t get carried away by the crowd. In the early 2000s many people were extolling the virtues of bonds and houses. “Enter either of these markets and it’s a sure-fire winner,” they said, “the prices will go up and up forever.” People believed their optimism and rushed to join in. They put all they had into buying bonds and real estate, thinking that the good times would last forever. It is important that you don’t fall into this trap – when lots of people say something is a good idea, don’t blindly follow them. Do some research and find out how good it is for yourself.","headers":["What’s in it for me: find out how the US government saved you from unemployment and abject poverty.","After the year 2000, enormous price bubbles developed in the housing and mortgage-bond markets.","Poor regulation by banks and the government was partially responsible for the housing and bond market bubbles.","As the bubbles burst, major financial institutions found themselves in or near bankruptcy.","To avoid a depression, the US government invested in the economy’s lynchpins.","The US government also increased spending and cut taxes to boost employment.","The US government passed new economic legislation to prevent future financial disasters.","Stricter government regulation and better banking practices are needed to avoid future financial meltdowns.","Final Summary"],"category":"Economics","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/5360d40c6233360007c10000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"After The Music Stopped explains and analyzes the causes of the last decade’s great financial crisis.

China – once seen as a rural, poverty-stricken and paranoid nation – has become the world’s largest exporter and one of its biggest industrial nations. Its population is becoming richer by the year. What’s behind this rapid turn around? These blinks show you just how China has managed to become one of the world’s leading economies. They also show you how this growth is having huge knock-on effects for Chinese society as a whole. Perhaps most importantly, the nation is moving from its traditionally centralized and autocratic roots to a more individualist and open society. In these blinks you’ll discover why the Chinese department which controls media doesn’t officially exist; why the Chinese Communist Party employ professional internet trolls; and how Chinese officials use gift shops to funnel their bribes. The Chinese economy has become an incredible success story: over the course of only a few decades, the country has leapt from poverty to economic domination, and become one of the biggest players in the world – its rapid growth continues to this day. In fact, over the last 30 years China’s economy has grown at a rate of approximately eight percent per year in terms of GDP. In other words, it has doubled in size every seven to eight years! That makes China the fastest-growing economy worldwide. Between 1989 and 2014, China’s annual GDP growth rate averaged an astonishing nine percent, while the United States’ grew only three percent during the same period. Coupled with China’s amazing GDP growth is an equally impressive rise in income – one that continues to soar today. Consider, for example, that in 1978 the average Chinese per capita income was a meager $200 per year. In contrast, the average Chinese citizen today brings home 30 times that amount – around $6,000. What’s more, wages, just like China’s overall economic conditions, continue to improve. In addition, China has become increasingly important as an exporter over the years. Back in 1999, China’s exports amounted to less than a third of those of the world’s largest exporter, the United States, placing it at number nine on the list of top global exporters. However, a mere decade later China had launched itself into first place. Clearly, China’s economy is booming. That only leaves us asking: Why? In the 1950s China was still a very poor country. Even as late as 1979, the People’s Republic of China’s per capita income was still a mere third of those in sub-Saharan Africa. So what changed? What triggered this enormous growth? Let’s start with what didn’t work: when Mao Zedong tried to lift China out of poverty in the late 1950s, he was far from successful. In 1958 Mao initiated a program called the Great Leap Forward, which, among other things, prohibited private farming and attempted to jump-start Chinese industrialization to modernize the economy. Initially, his plan seemed to work, and China saw production rise. Soon, however, the Great Leap Forward wasn’t going forward, but backward: China was hit with both a recession and a terrible famine, killing 30 to 45 million people – more than the combined military and civilian casualties of World War One! Faced with destitution, desperate farmers turned to other means to survive. In the village of Xiaogang, 18 impoverished farmers made a secret pact to divide the land of the collective between them and cultivate it separately, and promised to protect each other’s families in case of arrest. While farmers were required to hand over a large portion of their harvests to the state, these farmers decided to sell their surplus yield secretly at the market for profit. By the following year they were earning 20 times what they had been earning before. The farmers’ scheme served as a model for others and, eventually, the markets began to thrive. The government discovered the scheme, but allowed it to continue because it was successful. They started gradually expanding it to 800 million Chinese farmers from 1979 onward, and China enjoyed a major boost in GDP. In the years that followed, China’s leader Deng Xiaoping extended the freedom to start private or semi-private businesses to other sectors. As a result, innumerable small enterprises began popping up, and the economy boomed. In 1966 Mao Zedong initiated a radical sociopolitical movement, the Cultural Revolution, which aimed to create a state based on total equality. The military, for example, eliminated rank, and the Party banned competitive sports in order to imbue their culture with greater solidarity. However, once the Chinese were allowed to start their own businesses, their ambitions became more apparent. This drive to achieve success is still a characteristic of many Chinese people. For example, the Chinese have their own equivalent to the American dream, the “bare-handed” fortune. Chinese newspapers are full of stories of people getting rich through nothing more than their own hard work. One such success story is that of Gong Haiyan. Growing up in a small, remote village with illiterate parents, Haiyan nonetheless received a great education. In 2003, she founded a free online dating site that would later develop into China’s largest. By 2011, she had made roughly $80 million. Unlike Gong, many of these self-made millionaires have started out without even a good education, such as one street food vendor who later became a Chinese fast-food tycoon. What’s more, many Chinese strive for a decent education, if not a prestigious one. Many of the country’s nouveau riche, whom urban intellectuals consider to be rubes, came from peasant families who could only provide them with a mediocre education. They compensate for this by enrolling their children at prestigious American high schools and colleges – a trend which continues to grow. While only 65 Chinese students attended American private high schools in 2005, the number skyrocketed to 7,000 over the next five years! In addition, the demand for higher education is so great that the government has doubled the number of colleges and high schools in just ten years. Despite this, only one in four aspiring students can hope to matriculate each semester. Many Chinese biographies read like incarnations of the American dream: with increasing privatization and a booming market, it seems as if everyone could “make it,” provided they are willing to put in the hard work. As it turned out, however, that pervasive sense of endless possibility was overly optimistic. Despite unprecedented prosperity, the People’s Republic is experiencing enormous disparities in income and life expectancy. The gap between China’s richest cities and poorest provinces is striking; in fact, it’s comparable to the gap between the United States and Ghana. In terms of raw numbers, the top ten percent of urban Chinese earned 9.2 times the amount earned by the poorest ten percent in 2007. To grasp the severity of this disparity, consider this: if an average Chinese citizen wanted to buy a typical apartment in a Chinese city, they would have to pool their entire income with eight to ten others for a year. What’s more, income disparity has a major effect on the life trajectories of Chinese citizens. We can see this in a study conducted by the scholars Yinqiang Zhang and Tor Eriksson, who discovered that Chinese children’s career opportunities depended primarily on their parents’ social connections. In other words, if you’re the child of an average worker and your social circle is composed of similar workers, then it is highly likely that, no matter how great your education, you’ll struggle to attain social and economic mobility. In surveys of China’s emerging middle class, sociologists have found that citizens are increasingly aware of and unhappy about this lack of equal opportunity. The result is public discontent in the form of protests and even riots. Between 2004 and 2009 the number of strikes, riots and other forms of rebellion doubled, reaching almost 500 incidents per day. Clearly, the economic prosperity brought by opening up enterprise has not been spread equally among Chinese citizens. The following blinks will look at how the Chinese state manages the disruption that results from this disparity, and what citizens are doing to fight back. China’s constitution, like most in the modern world, guarantees its citizens freedom of speech and of the press. Yet the constitution has no legal authority over the Party, which has led to massive civil rights abuses. Here are only a few examples. Writer and civil rights activist Liu Xiaobo, for instance, was arrested simply for launching a civil rights initiative that aimed to collect signatures for Charter 08, a declaration on civil rights signed by thousands of Chinese intellectuals. Half a year after his informal arrest in December 2009, he was formally charged with “subversion of state power” and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Chen Guangcheng is a blind, self-taught lawyer, a strong supporter of women’s rights and an advocate for land rights. He, too, was arrested after organizing a class-action lawsuit in 2005 against local authorities who he claimed had excessively enforced the one-child policy. In preparation for the suit, Chen collected the accounts of women who had been forced to abort their child or undergo sterilization against their will. Following the suit, local authorities placed Chen under house arrest. Six months later, Chen was implausibly charged with “destruction of property” as well as “assembling a crowd to disrupt traffic,” and sentenced to four years in prison. What’s more, even participating in a peaceful demonstration can get you into trouble with Chinese authorities. In 2011, for instance, pro-democracy activists organized the protests called the Chinese Jasmine Revolution via social networks. Small crowds answered the call, gathering in 13 cities across the country and shouting slogans. The authorities responded by sending in the police to beat and arrest protesters. The following week, similar protests – this time silent – took place, during which police made arrests, confiscated cameras and beat several foreign journalists, including one American reporter who was dragged by the leg, kicked and punched in the face. Following these protests, 200 people were questioned or placed under house arrest, and 35 “dissidents” were either sent to prison or simply disappeared. Many people know that the Chinese media isn’t exactly free. But few know about a specific department that heads China’s media control system: the Central Publicity Department. This is partly because the Department operates in the background, thus evading public scrutiny. The Department doesn’t appear in public charts outlining the Party structure, and its headquarters has no address. Officially, its central offices don’t even exist, despite being located right next to the central government building. Though it “doesn’t exist,” the Department is still very much in control of the media and many public events. In 2008 its control extended to over 2,000 newspapers and 8,000 magazines, films and TV programs. Its power is extensive. For example, chief media representatives throughout China are required to attend a weekly priming session at the Department’s headquarters, where they are instructed on how to approach the week’s news – what to leave out, what to emphasize, etc. In 2003, for example, when the SARS epidemic began to develop in Guangdong, local newspaper editors were ordered to publish only reassuring stories about it – no panic, and certainly no criticism of the response. In the past the Department controlled the largest endowment for the social sciences, enabling it to ban unflattering words like “totalitarianism” from all research concerning the Chinese political system. It has the power to ban books and films, as well as fire editors. Even beauty pageants and amusement parks are subject to the scrutiny of the Department! In recent decades the Department has both expanded and grown more sophisticated. By studying the works of American PR specialists like political scientist Harold Lasswell, and those of international firms and foreign governments, they hope to further refine their own strategies. What’s more, the Department has grown so large that experts estimate there to be around one propaganda officer per 100 Chinese citizens today. The Central Publicity Department gives the Chinese government considerable influence over traditional media, but the internet does not lend itself to such clumsy controls. Nevertheless, the Party tries to restrict the information and ideas that are exchanged over the internet. Censors block influential international news sources such as the New York Times and Facebook, while the Chinese version of Google, “Baidu,” automatically blocks search results that include politically sensitive words. So if you wanted to access sites that discuss Tibetan independence, freedom of speech or police brutality, for example, you’ll find yourself out of luck. The Department is even directly involved in online political discourse. As a means of quelling the spread of unwanted ideas on the internet, the Party actually pays people to influence the direction that social media discussions take. These so-called “ushers of public opinion” infiltrate social networks and discussion boards as seemingly ordinary users in order to derail unwanted conversations. For example, if users are lamenting rising oil prices, an “usher of public opinion” will post a provocative reply, like: “You’re too poor to drive a car! Peasants like you shouldn’t be on the road anyway!” The idea is to enrage – and thus distract – the other participants. Yet despite the government’s efforts, the internet continues to enable the exchange of ideas and information on an unprecedented scale. Blocked sites like Facebook, for example, can be unblocked with a little tinkering by users. People can also get around digital filters, e.g., by replacing a Chinese character with another, similar sounding one in their search queries. The internet also allows people to easily publish texts and photos online without waiting for governmental approval, allowing users to download and share content before censors have the opportunity to block it. That’s exactly what followers of the famous dissident artist Ai Weiwei did with his many blog posts before his blogs were shut down and/or deleted in 2009. With the rise and spread of the internet, ordinary people are turning into media experts who have the tools to identify and expose the Party’s propaganda ploys. For example, whenever photos have been doctored by Party propagandists, bloggers are likely to notice – and to point it out. They’re sure to comment on images that have been altered in such a way as to make officials look more physically imposing, for example, or make a crowd appear larger. Take, for instance, a photo op set up for President Hu Jintao, who was supposedly visiting a low-income family. Bloggers were able to prove that the entire scenario was staged, and that the alleged mother of the family was actually a well-to-do civil servant. In another case, a blogger revealed that a news report supposedly showing China’s newest fighter jet actually showed a snippet from Top Gun with Tom Cruise’s character destroying a Soviet MiG! Once exposed, these attempts at manipulation are met with great outrage and ridicule, which of course doesn’t help the Party’s credibility. Furthermore, the internet offers great opportunities to witness and expose censorship. On the internet, users witness acts of censorship in real time: with a simple click of the “Refresh” button, they see subversive posts manipulated or removed entirely. The disappearance of posts from best-selling author Han Han’s blog, for instance, was witnessed by his followers in real time. Even censorship orders get leaked from time to time, and are then posted on overseas websites where censors can no longer delete them. Of course, despite all these opportunities to expose government manipulation, criticism of the government remains unsafe. As we saw above, repression and persecution are still a favored tactic for the Chinese state. The juxtaposition between a modern, booming economy and a repressive government is striking. The reality is, however, that the boom and the authoritarian nature of governance are interrelated: the more the economy grows, the more public servants strive (successfully) to get rich through bribery. Indeed, corruption began to mushroom as soon as the government began allowing private ownership of land and factories, and opened up the distribution of capital to investors in 1992. This cracking open of the market meant that officials had plenty of opportunities to accept bribes in exchange for licenses for private enterprise. And there was plenty of money to be made: in the first year of privatization alone, the average bribe tripled from $2,000 to $6,000! Bribery is hard to prove, however. Still, there are strong indications that public servants receive plenty of backhanders. Conspicuously, the headquarters of China’s mighty planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, is surrounded by gift shops. Day in and day out, citizens enter the agency with bags in their hands, only to leave empty-handed later. And when the public servants leave the building, they have bags tucked under their arms. Similarly curious is the fact that, whenever the National People’s Congress is in session, Beijing’s high-end boutiques run out of stock – even though, officially, public servants earn an annual income of only $30,000. Individual politicians have also amassed suspicious amounts of wealth, as was the case with China’s former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. Wen did not come from a wealthy family. His father was a pig farmer and his mother worked as a teacher. But in the years that he was a high-ranking politician, his family amassed assets worth $2.7 billion – enough to put them on the Forbes list of the richest families worldwide. Chinese political institutions do their best to control certain aspects of life in China. Despite this, as you’ll see in our remaining blinks, the Chinese are nevertheless becoming more and more intent on making their own choices. Until very recently, the Chinese defined themselves above all else in terms of the groups they belonged to – families, work collectives, etc. We even find this reflected in the lyrics of older popular songs: very rarely would you find the word “I” in place of “we.” But times have changed. China’s younger generation is very individualistic. The Chinese call the generations born since the 1980s the “Me” generation. These young people, in contrast to their grandparents, focus on their own experiences and are intent on making their own choices. We can see this reflected in pop culture – for example, the success of glamorous young writer Han Han’s autobiographical novel Triple Door. The book focused primarily on his personal experiences as a high school student who suffers from the school’s insistence on uniformity, and it hit a nerve: the first 30,000 copies sold out in only three days, and the book went on to sell more than two million copies. So where does this sudden individualism come from? Likely, it coincides with Chinese citizens’ increasing freedom of choice. More people today have access to higher education than ever before, and the internet offers a multitude of options regarding both culture and ideas. What’s more, the Me Generation has benefitted from changes that allow them to start their own enterprises instead of working in a collective. Social life is also very different for the Me Generation. For example, since the 1980s people have had more choice regarding their life partners. Traditionally, Chinese marriages were arranged by local matchmakers. Even after Mao banned the practice, marriages were nonetheless arranged by family elders, factory bosses and Communist cadres. Contrast this with today, when Jiayuan, the giant online dating site founded by Gong Haiyan, had 56 million registered users as of 2011. Still, this newfound freedom of choice doesn’t seem to extend to anything beyond heterosexual marriage: even today 98 percent of all Chinese women eventually marry. For some Chinese today, a weasel in the house is nothing to fret about. In fact, it’s an omen of imminent wealth! For decades, however, admitting to such a belief would have been ill-advised. This is because, in the past, Chinese communists actively fought religious belief systems. Before China adopted Communism, several widespread belief systems coexisted: most people were Buddhist (many among them Lamaist), Daoist, or adhered to one of many folk religions. But in 1966 Mao’s Cultural Revolution set out to destroy or forbid old customs and ideas, and especially religious belief systems. Most forms of religious life were thoroughly stamped out, and religious officials were likewise persecuted. At Mao’s command, the Red Guard demolished temples and smashed all sacred objects. Then, paradoxically, Mao Zedong stepped into the vacuum left behind, and was treated like a god. The media trumpeted, “Let Mao Zedong’s thoughts control everything,” and his Little Red Book of quotations was thought to have magical properties. It was this book, for instance, that was said to have enabled surgeons to remove a gigantic tumor in one famous case. People confessed their sins at the foot of his statues, as if they were shrines. Things took a turn for the strange in 1968, when a Pakistani delegation gave Mao a basket of mangoes, which he then re-gifted to some workers. These workers wept and placed the fruit on altars around which crowds would later gather to worship. When Mao died in 1976, he left behind another great spiritual void – one which people wanted desperately to fill. Eventually, old temples were once again erected and new ones were built. Now, in today’s China, there are a multitude of religions and cults. This has led some to become rather eclectic in their faith, worshipping, for example, in the Confucian Temple, a Catholic church, and a Lama temple before important exams – just to be sure. The key message in this book: In today’s China, people have lots of opportunity and choice – but not when it comes to politics. While the people are adopting individualism as their defining philosophy, the government’s authoritarian practices create great tensions.

But only a few decades ago, things looked very different. And this was when Jack Ma entered the scene with his remarkably innovative mindset, founding what would become one of the world’s most valuable companies: the e-commerce platform Alibaba. In these blinks, you’ll learn the story of China’s consumerist trend, trace Jack’s journey from being a modest English teacher to becoming the emperor of Chinese consumerism and discover what made his e-commerce empire so remarkably successful. You’ll also find out how Alibaba uses webcams and free toys to go the extra mile in customer service; what Jack Ma expects from his employees in return for offering free bikes and a beautiful artificial lake in their workplace; and why China’s internet firewall was a godsend for Alibaba. It’s not unusual to have conflicting thoughts about China. Many products sold in the United States have a label that reads “Made in China,” so many recognize the country as a giant of retail manufacturing. But the country is also recognized as having a powerful communist government.   Even so, there is a new trend emerging in China as its economy steadily shifts toward consumerism. Traditionally, the people of China aren’t very consumer-minded. Even today, household spending only accounts for a third of China’s economy. Meanwhile, in the United States, consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the economy. But the times are changing in China, and a good illustration of this is the country’s November 11 national holiday. This day marks a celebration for single people in China, a sort of twist on Valentine’s day, and has become a hugely important day for Chinese retailers. Back in 2009, only 27 shops were offering Singles’ Day-related sales; but only six years later, in 2015, 40,000 retailers and 30,000 brands had joined in on the festivities. One of the participating retailers was Alibaba, a Chinese company that specializes in online commerce. Remarkably, during the first ten minutes of Singles’ Day in 2015, $1 billion in purchases had been made through Alibaba. Alibaba has been at the forefront of online commerce, which has experienced tremendous growth in China as the country comes to embrace consumerism. But few people could have predicted just how successful Alibaba would become. Alibaba has received its fair share of comparisons to Amazon, the popular shopping website based in the United States. Much like Amazon’s reputation as “The Everything Store,” Chinese customers like to say you can buy anything on Taobao.com, one of Alibaba’s many popular subsidiary sites. But the impact Alibaba has had on China’s economy far surpasses Amazon’s status in the United States. In fact, as of 2016, Amazon is the twelfth-most popular retailer in the United States, while Alibaba is China’s number one most popular. Alibaba became such a commercial giant that when it became a publicly traded company in 2014, it generated the greatest global initial public offering, or IPO, ever. Alibaba has taken the retail market in China by storm – but you’re probably wondering what sets it apart from any other online retailer. Alibaba has found a great competitive edge by providing a basic amount of free services to the merchants who use the company’s sites. Essentially, it costs absolutely nothing for a small business or merchant to use Alibaba’s website, Taobao, as their online storefront. In fact, over 9 million businesses are doing just that. However, if merchants want to have their product prominently displayed on the site, they can then pay an advertising fee to get the spotlight treatment. This is basically how Alibaba makes money, and the system is a bit like how Google’s AdWords work. At the end of the day, merchants will end up paying a price that corresponds to the number of clicks their advertisement received and how many times their product page was visited. So, for a small business with a small advertising budget, this is quite cost efficient. But that’s not all Alibaba has going for it; it also offers great customer service.   The site is monitored by a group called the “xiaoer,” a Chinese word meaning “servants.” What these people do is act as mediators for any conflicts that may arise between customers and vendors. They also perform routine monitoring and can delete the profile of any vendor who doesn’t follow the website’s code of conduct. Taobao’s popularity is also due to the highly interactive shopping experience it offers. The site has an advanced chat feature that allows customers and vendors to use their webcams and haggle in real time over the cost of a product. Competition is indeed fierce on Taobao, so merchants will bend over backward to increase sales by offering free samples or perhaps including a free toy in every package they send out – a practice that is unheard of on Amazon. A company doesn’t just have great customer service by accident. In the case of Alibaba, making sure each customer has a great experience is something that the founder, Jack Ma, was determined to achieve. For this purpose, Jack Ma made sure that every Alibaba employee knew the company mantra by heart: “customers first, employees second and shareholders third.” Jack Ma refers to Alibaba’s small customers as “shrimps,” but this isn’t a derogatory term. Jack loves his shrimps and is determined to work on their behalf to give them the kind of exposure that they won’t find anywhere else. This means he’s always working hard to make sure Alibaba doesn’t lose its basic free services. The love for his customers contrasts somewhat with the relationship Jack has toward his shareholders, who often pressure him to generate short-term profits for their benefit. Even when Alibaba’s share prices take a dip, as they did in 2009, Jack refuses to compromise and do anything that might adversely affect his commitment to customers and small businesses. Jack Ma has a strong commitment to his employees as well, and his leadership style is focused on generating motivation and maintaining loyalty. As a result, many Alibaba employees have been working there for many years and have no plans to go elsewhere. Alibaba employees also enjoy the perk of having their own campus, which Jack sees as a well-deserved gift to his employees. At 2.6 million square feet, with exercise rooms, coffee shops, organic food stalls, a giant man-made lake and complimentary bicycles to cruise around in, employees have every reason to feel well taken care of. The campus doesn’t come at the expense of employee benefits, either; if a worker needs money for a new car or home, they can get an interest-free loan for up to $50,000. What Jack Ma expects in return are committed and loyal employees who are willing to put in long hours to make Alibaba a continued success. Jack Ma wasn’t born into his business; in fact, he began his career as an English teacher. One day at work, Jack watched as a peer, who had been teaching for decades, rode home on an old bicycle with a basket full of inexpensive vegetables – the only kind he could afford. Jack realized then and there that if he wanted a different future for himself than his older coworker, he needed to come up with an innovative plan and create a better life for himself. Before long, he was looking to the relatively new technology of the internet. Jack Ma’s first company, founded in 1995, was called Hangzhou Haibo Network Consulting and was among China’s very first internet businesses. Jack’s company created home pages and simple websites that listed contact information for other Chinese businesses that were looking to establish a web presence. Since anyone with internet access had the potential to be a customer, Jack wanted to increase the visibility of Chinese businesses in the United States. So, along with his business partner He Yibing, Jack purchased the US internet domain chinapages.com. Still, being ahead of your time has its drawbacks, and since very few people in China had internet access in the mid-90s, it was hard to convince businesses to invest in an online presence. But Jack was able to get some friends to use his service and even had some early successes. After he created a website for a hotel in Hangzhou called Lakeview, American travellers began to show up in droves – it was the only Chinese hotel they were able to find online! Nevertheless, there were far more challenges, such as unreliable internet connections that crashed as often as they worked. Connections were so faulty that Jack sometimes had to show his clients printouts of their websites, and some people took this as a sign that they were being ripped off. Since the cost for web service was $2,400 back then, this was an understandable suspicion that Jack had to work hard to overcome. With so few internet-savvy businesses in China, Jack Ma looked to the United States and Silicon Valley for inspiration. And it was on one of Jack’s trips to California that he stumbled up on the name with which he would one day be so closely associated. By 1999, Jack was nearly ready to launch his next big idea: an online retail store. He had the concept and a team in place – but what he didn’t have was a good name. Then, on a visit to San Francisco, Jack was in a restaurant when the Arabian Nights folk tales came to mind. One of the stories, “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” involves the titular character using the secret password “open sesame” to enter a secret cave full of treasures. When the waitress came to his table, Jack asked her if she knew the tale of Ali Baba. She did – and she even remembered the secret password, “open sesame.” Throughout the day, he continued to ask everyone he met if they knew about Ali Baba and, amazingly, everyone did. Surely, Jack thought, this was a sign that he’d found the right name. But there was a catch. Alibaba.com was already owned by a man in Canada, who was asking $4,000 for it. At the time, online money transactions weren’t very secure and this person could easily have taken the money and run if he had wanted to. But Jack had a feeling this Canadian was honest, so he went through with the deal. Thankfully, his hunch proved correct; the deal went smoothly and he soon had his domain. With everything in place, Jack Ma launched Alibaba in February of 1999 and proved he had a clear vision, right from the start. Alibaba was conceived of as an international competitor that could rival any Silicon Valley company, but it was also clear that Alibaba was a service designed for small businesses. Jack Ma’s nickname of “shrimp” for his small-business customers is a reference to the movie Forrest Gump, in which the main character gets rich from a humble shrimp-fishing business. In 1987, the very first e-mail to be sent from China travelled to Karlsruhe, Germany, at the painfully slow rate of 300 bits per second. Things sped up quickly, however, and just a decade later this same technology was revolutionizing the world economy; investors were lining up to get on board. In the late 90s, US investors were particularly interested in Asian technology companies.   Jack Ma knew that he needed some of these big investors to grow Alibaba into the global competitor he envisioned. Jack was all too familiar with how little interest Chinese investment firms had for internet-based businesses. Luckily, there was an employee at Goldman Sachs by the name of Shirley Lin who was keen on investing in Chinese internet companies. There were some complications, though. Due to cultural differences, Shirley Lin had a hard time getting Chinese businessmen to accept her as a legitimate investor. In fact, some were so confused they kept asking if she was the wife of Mr. Goldman. Alibaba’s connection to Shirley Lin actually dates back to 1989, when Ma’s business partner, Joe Tsai, first met her on a flight to New York. At the time, Joe was still a student at Yale University, but he had held on to her contact information for the years since. In 1999, Shirley’s contact information was like gold. As luck would have it, when Joe called her up, Shirley was seeking investment opportunities just like Alibaba. In no time at all, she was in Hangzhou being introduced to the Alibaba team. At the time, Alibaba’s headquarters was actually Joe’s small apartment. Crammed full of guys, the place was undoubtedly a stinky mess, but Shirley was more impressed with how committed and hard working everyone was. In the end, Goldman was a bit hesitant, but Shirley convinced the firm, along with some smaller investors, to give Alibaba $5 million in start-up funds. Jack Ma was a happy man. But as we’ll see in the next blink, a crisis was on the horizon. Jack Ma’s ambitious plan to build a retail empire was like building a house of cards; it’s a delicate and thrilling operation that could fall apart at any moment. The important thing to remember is that when the cards come crashing down, you can take it as an opportunity to reshuffle before starting over. This is the kind of optimism that Jack Ma had to maintain when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. In March of that year, the Nasdaq stock market collapsed after years worth of investments in internet start-ups. Many Silicon Valley businesses were wiped out in the process – but Jack Ma celebrated the crash. Some Chinese internet companies were hit hard as well, losing 20 percent or more of their value. Jack predicted that 60 percent of Alibaba’s competitors would shut down as a result. Suddenly, things were looking pretty good for Alibaba. They’d only spent a fraction of what they had raised in funding, and they now faced far less competition in the marketplace. But still, one problem remained: profits. By the end of 2000, Alibaba still wasn’t making any money. They had half a million users and a lot of money in the bank, but their revenue fell short of $1 million. To generate some income, Alibaba had been charging fees, mostly for site-building services, but these didn’t come close to covering their expenses. Making matters worse, Jack Ma had spent a small fortune hiring more people in an effort to expand Alibaba’s presence in the United States and Europe. Even so, Ma knew the time was right to make the move and grow the brand. But it didn’t change the fact that the company needed help in 2001. As a result, Ma and his partner Joe Tsai brought in a new Chief Operating Officer, the seasoned specialist Savio Kwan. Kwan was given a mission: turn Alibaba into a profitable and healthy business. And Kwan did just that by cutting costs and narrowing the company’s scope within the Chinese market. In the early 2000s, Alibaba was still fighting an uphill battle to secure its place in the retail market. But things would change after they faced one of their biggest challengers yet: eBay. In 2003, eBay made an attempt to take the Chinese market by storm – but they hadn’t counted on Alibaba’s presence. eBay’s strategy was to buy an existing Chinese company that offered a service similar to its own. In fact, the company in question controlled 90 percent of China’s online consumer-to-consumer business, and after the buyout, the company was rebranded eBay EachNet. But Jack Ma was ready for a fight, and he used every local and cultural advantage he had at his disposal. The first step was to create the subsidiary site, Taobao, which launched in May of 2003. With its focus on online haggling for consumer-sold products, it targeted the same customers as eBay. In the first four months after Taobao’s launch, Jack Ma managed to hide the fact that Alibaba owned Taobao, and during that time, the new service was quickly gaining customers from eBay EachNet. Crucially, Taobao had something Ebay didn’t: an understanding of what appealed to the Chinese market. With lively graphics and clustered displays, it captured the feel of a hectic bazaar, while eBay’s site had the neat, clean and sterile feel preferred by Western users. Eventually, in 2004, eBay EachNet moved to a US host, essentially killing their chances in the Chinese market; due to firewalls put up by the Chinese government to keep out “undesirable” content, sites hosted from foreign countries are often slower to load, if not blocked altogether. EachNet was plagued by the slow service, so customers flocked to the free, fast and fun service provided by Taobao. There’s no doubt that Taobao was one of the best things that happened to Alibaba. It gave them control of China’s e-commerce business and Jack Ma finally had a business that was making serious money. These days, Alibaba is over 18 years old and continues to be a retail powerhouse. But Jack Ma is a long-term visionary, and sees Alibaba living to the ripe old age of 102. The key message in this book: Despite a lack of experience and little start-up funding, Jack Ma built an e-commerce empire from the ground up, at a time when few people in China even had an e-mail account. But Jack had something far more important: he was filled with entrepreneurial spirit and the desire to put in the hard work necessary to make his vision a reality. Actionable advice: Like Jack Ma, you don’t have to settle for one thing. In addition to being a great businessman, Ma is also a philanthropist invested in climate change and the environment. In 2015, he bought Brandon Park in the Adirondack Mountains, in order to make sure it remained protected from developers and polluters. Got feedback?

In these blinks, the author introduces valuable insights furnished by the true story of the Chinese e-commerce company, Alibaba. He tells how its founder, Jack Ma, launched his ideas, gaining traction for Alibaba in a market that hardly existed, and how the company eventually became the largest of its kind in China. In these blinks, you’ll discover which dirty tricks Yahoo! deployed in the name of competition; how offering a service for free can kick-start an economically sustainable business; and why being an enthusiastic, entrepreneurial person is more important than being the brightest boy in class. Entrepreneurship is easier today than ever before. You don’t need a million dollars to get started; all you need is a great idea and some free time. And yet, the world is full of people too afraid to take those first steps. Overcoming difficulties in your life is only possible if you put in serious effort instead of sitting around complaining. Starting a business is no different. So then why isn’t everyone an entrepreneur? Many people think it’s too hard. After all, most industries already have a big player, and even if you trust yourself enough to compete with giants such as eBay or Google, there are still many legal and social hurdles to overcome.  Every entrepreneur faces these problems. The only way to succeed is to try. When Jack Ma started Alibaba in 1999, only one percent of the Chinese population used the internet. And those who did use it could hardly imagine buying anything online. People had enough trust issues when their business partner was standing right in front of them! Online buying was out of the question. And yet, in the course of 15 short years, Alibaba overcame international competitors and social mistrust, and it now dominates 80 percent of China’s e-commerce market. Hearing a success story like Alibaba’s might cause you to start doubting yourself. “What can I do that’s so special?” you might ask. Well, you don’t have to be as smart as Einstein to start a business that will one day become successful. In fact, success has more to do with brio than brains. Before starting Alibaba, Jack Ma was an English teacher earning $20 per month. He sometimes jokes that Alibaba is so successful precisely because he doesn’t really know anything about computers. It wasn’t his computer genius that made him so successful, but his entrepreneurial spirit. Starting a company is easy these days; having it go under is easier. But it needn’t be that way. Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs set short-term goals and either go out of business or look for a quick exit that will make them millionaires. If you want a successful company, however, it needs to be designed to last, not just to get through the season. One of the goals Ma set at the very beginning of Alibaba was for the company to last at least 80 years. In other words, a human lifetime. Although he later stretched that goal to 102 years, he stayed true to the idea of building a sustainable company that lasts. Such a decision impacts the day-to-day business of your company. For instance, while Ma wanted to take the company public as early as 1999, he postponed the decision until the moment he was sure that going public would actually take the company further. Also, a sustainable business is one that stays true to its culture. As a business grows, it will encounter many unexpected events that can change its very culture. To achieve longevity, avoid these changes at all costs! Alibaba encountered one such event in 2005, during the course of negotiating Alibaba’s buy-out of Yahoo! China. At the very last moment, Ma backed out when Yahoo! came up with one last demand: to name their venture “Alibaba-Yahoo!”. Ma believed that this would cause Alibaba to lose face in the eyes of domestic customers, making it appear as if Alibaba were Yahoo!’s puppet. This buy-out, the deal that turned Alibaba into a global phenomenon, was only finalized once Yahoo! finally gave up on its demand. A successful business is one that has found a way to win customers’ hearts. But how do you do this? Start by finding an important customer insight to build upon. In the beginning, Alibaba tested various profit-making opportunities, like partnering and investing, on a global website to satisfy his investors. They even tried to open an office in Silicon Valley. Unfortunately, these early efforts failed, because the company didn’t have that customer insight. This all changed when Alibaba finally uncovered the barrier that made customers wary about e-commerce: placing trust in someone they had never met. After Alibaba developed authentication services that verified its status as a legitimate company, customers showed a greater willingness to use Alibaba’s services. This crucial customer insight was also used on Alibaba’s C2C-platform, TaoBao. Rather than simply copying the sleek model used by similar American websites, TaoBao offered a fun platform with a live-chat application on which users could bond and build trust with one another. But a customer insight isn’t all it takes. That insight must also be compatible with the market. Before Alibaba launched its premium services, use of its website was completely free. Though pressure from investors made the decision to offer free services quite difficult, the Alibaba team knew that the Chinese market would prefer trying something out before committing to it. This was simply the only way to gain a loyal customer base. From a strategic point of view, providing free services was really the only option available on the market – at least at the start. This was even truer of the consumer market. For this reason, TaoBao has been a free service since its launch, in 2003. Although eBay mocked TaoBao for their free-service model, they later had to shut down their China website after TaoBao snatched up the majority of the market with their free services. But even if you build a business based on keen customer insights, you’ll still face challenges along the way. Our following blinks will help you overcome those challenges. Every business will face difficulties along the way, but such inevitabilities shouldn’t discourage you from trying. In fact, you can actually turn the barriers that stand in your way into advantages! A limited market, for example, could also be considered a great opportunity for development. When Alibaba started, China was still discovering the internet – and very cautiously at that. The average person would probably think that starting an online business there would undoubtedly lead to disaster. There simply weren’t enough potential customers!  However, where most people saw limitations, Ma saw opportunity – the buying power of a billion people. What’s more, you can change seemingly limited social conditions over time in order to make a positive impact. Another difficulty for internet businesses in China is dealing with local laws and officials. This has caused foreign companies such as Google to give up on the Chinese market and all it’s potential. Despite his international ambitions and time spent abroad, Ma was never too quick to judge local politics that involved the free usage of the internet. He simply recognized them as part of the deal, and decided to concentrate on whatever good he could achieve through his business. For example, an e-commerce business that brings jobs and prestige would surely make local officials reconsider their intolerant position regarding the internet. Finally, unexpected crisis can also be an opportunity to further develop your business. In early 2003, China was hit by the deadly SARS epidemic. After an Alibaba employee contracted the virus, all of the company’s employees had to stay quarantined in their homes. But instead of letting their fear incapacitate them, the Alibaba team kept the site running from home. They were rewarded for their efforts with a huge influx of traffic. People all over the country were either quarantined or too scared to go out to buy things in person, and as a result, they were practically forced to give e-commerce a try. If your business is the first on the market, will it always stay that way? Probably not. Once they catch wind of the opportunity you’ve created, others are likely to follow. Staying ahead of the competition starts by differentiating yourself from them. Young businesses often fall into the trap of copying someone they admire, forgetting that true success only comes when you become more than someone else’s shadow. For this reason, Ma worked hard to ensure that TaoBao would be more than a mere copy of eBay.  TaoBao understood that consumer culture in China was different from that in Western countries. Chinese consumers didn’t have garages full of old stuff that they wanted to sell online. Rather, they wanted to sell products like they would in a small back-alley shop. Knowing this, TaoBao encouraged this culture by offering tools such as the WangWang live-chat. They also encouraged buyers and sellers to call each other and build a relationship, just like they would in real life. Moreover, you should appreciate competition as a way to develop yourself, not simply as an opponent who needs to be crushed. People easily fall into the trap of creating a hostile relationship with the competition, and, as a result, focus all their energy on hurting them. Contrastingly, you should use competition to inspire positive action. Take, for example, the war between eBay and TaoBao. Although partnering up with Alibaba would have been advantageous for them, eBay instead engaged in a war full of dirty tricks, such as inviting the TaoBao team to an event they were hosting and then un-inviting them at the last minute. And this although eBay’s own community was calling them to partner up with Alibaba! By the time eBay finally offered an adequate deal, Alibaba was already negotiating with Yahoo! instead. Building your organization is one thing. Building relationships with your team is another. Our final blinks will examine the interpersonal aspects of a strong business. As your business grows larger, the difficulties it faces will only increase in number. As the leader of the company, it’s therefore important for you to be strong enough to inspire others to endure the hard times and thrive during the good. In part, this will require an ability to make bold decisions. As an employee, taking the path of least resistance may be the smartest thing you can do; for leaders and entrepreneurs, however, things are different . Look at Alibaba: their entire story is a series of bold steps. From the company’s humble beginnings, operating from a small apartment in Hangzhou, to becoming a publicly traded company in 2014, Jack Ma had to constantly make hard decisions along the way. Offering a free service when everyone else is charging; going global when 99 percent of your compatriots have never even used the internet; and postponing public trading until the company could rock internet history – all these decisions have strategic meaning, and demonstrate a willingness to act boldly. But not only will you have to make bold decisions; you’ll have to make hard decisions as well. As a leader, you will sometimes have to make decisions that strain your ethical compass. But that’s just part of the deal if you want to build a company that lasts. Alibaba, for example, was forced to make some difficult decisions during a bout of hard times in late 2000. Although the company was gaining both customers and popularity, they hadn’t turned a profit. This forced Ma, who at this point had only ever hired people, to lay off half the staff in his US office only months after he’d opened it. And yet that decision had to be made for the company to survive and thrive. A business is only as good as its staff. Though company leaders play a critical role in the organization’s development, they can’t do everything alone. They have to build a strong team. But how? When hiring people for a new business, try to avoid becoming seduced by prestigious college diplomas and fancy resumes. It’s more important that the team works well together. After all, a business is a group effort; it won’t work if everyone is doing their own thing – no matter how skilled they are. For example, when the author first joined Alibaba, in 2000, he was put in a team of Western managers – all with perfect resumes – in a Hong Kong office. These Western managers had separated themselves from the actual Alibaba team in the Hangzhou office, and were simply doing their thing, totally disconnected from the rest of the team. A poor arrangement at best! Working well together isn’t all your employees need to do, though. They also have to be personally invested in the company to make it truly succeed. This way, you can be sure that they’ll always give their very best. In the early days of Alibaba, nearly all employees had stock options. As a result, people were working hard to cut costs, plodding away in cramped office spaces and sacrificing their personal time to ensure the company grew strong.  Developing a personally invested team was also one of the key measures Alibaba took in getting through their financial troubles in 2001. Part of these measures involved hiring an experienced manager, who tested the team on the company’s core values. The way he figured it, the bare minimum requirement for the team is that they share the company’s core values. If they don’t, they probably aren’t as personally invested as they should be. Solid team-building, along with the boldness and deep understanding of their customer base, made Alibaba what it is today. If you follow in their footsteps, the sky’s the limit for your business. The key message in this book: Anyone can start a business and succeed, provided they have enough determination and the right attitude. As the story of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba reveals, even a small start-up from a developing country can compete with Western giants if they set their minds to it. Actionable advice: Choose a goal that seems too big to achieve. When setting your goals for your personal and professional life, don’t be afraid to dream too big. Your goals shouldn’t create artificial limitations; rather, they should toy with the idea of what’s possible.

This centralized banking system helps control the flow of currency among other important tasks, such as dampening the effects of financial crises. But how was the Fed established? It certainly wasn’t conceived overnight, but rather was the result of many years of political and social struggle. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that brought US markets – and many individuals – to their knees, these blinks will show you that the long history of the Fed can shed much light on today’s market challenges. In these blinks, you’ll discover why it was so difficult to come up with a plan to establish a US central bank; how Woodrow Wilson’s character brought bankers and politicians together; and why today’s populist anger against Wall Street echos the anger of the past. If a presidential candidate today were to question the US Federal Reserve’s right to exist, at best the comment would be considered a joke or worse, the ravings of a lunatic. As you’ll soon see, however, this sort of opinion in the early days of the United States wasn’t uncommon. Between the War of Independence which ended in 1783 and the early 1900s, many people opposed any form of concentrated authority in the United States, including a central bank. This opposition was based on a fear that with such an institution, the government could exercise an undue amount of control over citizens’ lives.   For instance, in 1791, the Philadelphia-based First Bank of the United States was chartered for 20 years. Anti-federalists, however, strongly opposed this central bank’s existence as a sign of government dominance, and blocked the charter from being renewed. In lieu of a central bank, banks at the regional and state levels were forced to issue their own banknotes.   During the War of 1812 against Britain, the lack of a regulated central currency in the United States caused fiscal chaos. To better secure their market interests, businesses began to favor both centralized tariffs and regulation, which led to the establishment in 1816 of the Second Bank of the United States.   Soon enough, however, the hopes for a strong central bank faced yet another hurdle in Andrew Jackson, the seventh American president. Jackson opposed centralized banking as he saw it as an extension of the wealthy minority’s power over the poorer majority. His opinion, which echoed a populist current at the time, was that banking was an elitist, anti-democratic force. In 1836, to combat what he saw as an unfair and inappropriate amount of economic and political power held by the central bank, Jackson vetoed the charter renewal for the Second Bank of the United States. His opposition dealt a death blow to the dream of a central bank for the rest of the century. After the serious economic depression known as the Panic of 1893, the United States entered a period of economic prosperity that for many, seemed as if it would last forever. This was an illusion, of course. The fantasy was shattered in 1907, when a three-week-long market crisis led the US economy to shrink by some 40 percent. How did this happen? The rise of trusts was a contributing factor. A trust is a company which has achieved a monopoly position in a certain market. A cotton trust, for instance, would own a majority – if not all – of the shares of a cotton company trading in an unregulated market. This trust alone would then be able to determine the price of the shares in the market.   In 1907, the catalyst of the crash was the United Copper Company. First, the company’s owners overborrowed because they misread how much money they would need to corner the market for United Copper Company shares. Even with the borrowed money, however, they lacked sufficient cash to monopolize the market. Soon, they realized they didn’t even have enough cash to pay off their debts to their creditors and the banks. This liquidity failure incited panic in the public at large. People were worried about the security of private companies and public financial institutions. In a mad dash to save what cash was left, people flocked to banks to withdraw their savings. Unfortunately, the banks too suffered a liquidity problem. They had made investments in unregulated financial companies and didn’t have the necessary reserves to pay out depositors. This signaled the onset of another market panic, and soon the US economy came to a screeching halt. A central bank would have been able to provide the necessary cash during this period, but of course, the United States at the time did not have a central bank. Regional banks instead had to rely on the goodwill of a few individual financiers, or on banking moguls such as J.P. Morgan. This scramble caused American regional banks to crave the security of a centralized institution that would help them avoid such crises in the future. Though government oversight of banking is commonly accepted today, it was a nascent idea in the early twentieth century. As you’ll soon discover, social and political reform was critical to bringing about this shift in perspective. The Progressive Era, or years between the 1890s and 1920s, marked one of the largest steps forward for social and political reform. The women’s movement pushed for voting rights, and black communities fought to overcome race-based economic disparities, which persisted despite the end of slavery. In the corridors of power, however, banking reform was the subject for mostly white, American male leaders. Across the political spectrum, there was a consensus that reform was necessary, particularly regarding policies that would increase the government’s oversight of the banking system. More oversight would allow for regulations to break up trusts and monopolies as well as establish a central bank in the United States. The Panic of 1907 provided the biggest push for banking centralization and banking reform. Before this, most politicians and bankers felt that the market would sort itself out, and that politics had no business meddling. In fact, they felt that the government had no place in business at all. The crisis, however, showed the fallibility of believing that markets were truly self-regulating. Not only were markets unable to fix themselves, but also the possibility existed that, with a the lack of government oversight, businesses could take advantage of consumers. The stock market, for instance, was rife with risky schemes. Individuals would bet on stocks without having the assets to back such dangerous investments, and in doing so, were essentially creating an unregulated, even duplicitous, side market. A series of articles in the Wall Street Journal in 1909 in support of banking reform captured the seed of change that was slowly germinating in this new progressive environment. In what sounds like a scene straight out of a movie, a small, secret group of bankers and politicians met on an island off the coast of Georgia in 1910 to discuss the future of banking. One of them was Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich from Rhode Island. While he had once been staunchly opposed to a central bank, the Panic of 1907 and a study of Europe’s central banking model had convinced him otherwise. Aldrich saw how Europe’s bank served as a critical, stabilizing force amid tough financial times. He was especially interested in England’s central bank, which had prevented the destabilization of the British pound ever since it was established in 1694. Another member was Paul Warburg, a German-American banker and expert in the European banking system. Though he was in many ways an outsider to American politics and finance, his European expertise and support for a central bank were important in fashioning the draft for an American bank. Warburg’s and Aldrich’s contrasting backgrounds were reflected in their disagreements regarding the extent to which an American central banking system should be regulated.   Warburg favored strong government regulation, while Aldrich believed a small group of regional banks run by politicians and bankers should provide oversight. The group sought to appease both bankers and politicians, though this was no easy task given each side’s contrasting interests. Bankers felt threatened by government intervention, while politicians disagreed on how much intervention would be appropriate. In general, Republicans wanted little to no government influence, while Democrats wanted more oversight but were wary of bankers being a part of the regulatory process. Recalling Andrew Jackson’s populist fear of bankers, Democrats in general regarded bankers with suspicion. With a lengthy back and forth, the island group was able to draw up a draft plan for an American central bank, which we’ll explore in the next blink. The meeting on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia resulted in the release of the Aldrich Plan in January 1911. Though the plan wasn’t used in its entirety, it did raise a number of issues that were critical to the final act to create a centralized banking system, called the Federal Reserve Act. The Aldrich Plan outlined three central goals. The first was uniting state banks, which up to that point had printed their own currency. Under the previous system, interstate commerce and exchange rates between states had been unregulated. Under the Aldrich Plan, a unified system would establish connections among state banks and make interstate commerce run more smoothly. The second goal was to establish a standard currency. This would lend legitimacy to the unified bank system by ensuring all banks would share the same currency and that it would carry equal value across United States. The last goal was the establishment of paper money. Before the Aldrich Plan, businesses had struggled to gather assets and cash in particular. Maintaining liquidity depended on banks making questionable deals with stock market traders, and tough economic times only made such deals less reliable and more difficult. Under the Aldrich Plan, businesses would more easily be able to borrow cash, and the resulting liquidity would work to soften financial crises before they became economic disasters. The plan was clearly designed with the interests of both bankers and politicians in mind. It pleased politicians as the plan increased the government’s role in overseeing interstate and national financial transactions, and thus increased the overall accountability of the financial system. Bankers were also happy, as they could now play a greater role in interstate commerce thanks to increased business opportunities afforded by a larger network of banks. Soon after the Aldrich Plan was introduced, in 1913, Woodrow Wilson became the twenty-eighth president of the United States. Wilson was an admirer of both a strong federal government and laissez-faire economics, and as such, he symbolized a compromise between the economic viewpoints of Republicans and Democrats. President Wilson would be the man to lead the final push for a national central bank. He was motivated to do so for two reasons. First, he was a strong believer in a powerful federal government; and second, he saw banking reform as a way to curb the influence of monopolies. Wilson pushed for greater federal oversight of banks while also allowing room for healthy business competition by providing credit to both businesses and individuals. To him, a central bank symbolized a strong federal authority that would provide easier access to credit by being a “lender of last resort.” This meant that a central bank and the US Federal Reserve could lower interest rates in times of need, providing banks with the necessary reserves to keep the economy going. These convictions helped Wilson to get the Federal Reserve Act passed in 1913. The act emphasized two further points of development for the central bank. First, the federal currency was to be elastic, meaning it would increase or decrease in value depending on demand. Second, banks had to utilize financial reserves during times of crisis, as holding on to reserves only aggravates a stressed economy. The central bank would also have reserves available and allocate funds as necessary during a future crisis.   The act passed through the House of Representatives and the Senate, and President Wilson signed the act into law on December 23, 1913. Despite the benefits it offered, the establishment of the “Fed” did not solve all the financial worries in the United States. Laws require time to take effect, and the Federal Reserve Act was no exception. The act’s main goal was to create the Federal Reserve, a process that had many steps and needed to take into account many different factors. One such factor was determining where to set up reserve banks, or regional banks in major US cities, with the goal of distributing the central bank’s power. Bankers identified 12 different cities in which to establish reserve banks, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland and Dallas. Another factor was how much involvement Wall Street should have on the board of the Federal Reserve. Paul Warburg was nominated as board chief, a decision not without controversy. Warburg’s involvement with financial company Kuhn and Loeb signalled a potential conflict of interest. But he eventually severed ties with the firm and was able to appease his detractors. World War I, however, soon provided the Federal Reserve an opportunity to exercise its power, especially with regard to its role in domestic and international trade. During the war’s early years, the Fed mostly complied with a Department of Treasury request to minimize interest rates. Low interest rates means more borrowing and, as a result, more trade. However, the Fed wanted to increase its powers. Warburg and his board asked Congress for the right to issue banknotes. Congress granted the Fed its wish, and in a matter of months, the central bank had doubled the amount of money in circulation. The Fed’s ability to lend money and regulate international trade during wartime signaled a significant expansion of its power. It enabled the United States to assist the economies of Britain and France by exporting food and other supplies. Such positive influence earned the Fed international recognition. History has a tendency to repeat itself. The Federal Reserve today faces many of the same issues it did a century ago, with people voicing concerns over the unbridled power of banks and the inability of governments to adequately control them. Let’s connect the dots between the past and present. The suspicion with which banks are regarded today, for instance, is reminiscent of the Progressive Era, during which the general population felt that banks could and did misuse their power. The Panic of 1907 confirmed that fear, showing the populace that a lack of governmental control can indeed lead to economic disaster. Just as businesses in the early 1900s rushed ahead in the pursuit of profits, the 2008 financial crisis was fueled by the delusion that the US housing market could expand indefinitely. In reality, people were borrowing money to buy homes they couldn’t afford, creating an inflated housing market bubble. The eventual pop of that bubble wreaked havoc on the economy and on individuals, and only confirmed the general distrust of big banks and the financial sector. Social activism surrounding the Fed today echoes past movements. The Progressive Era was witness to many activists, from women to racial minorities to politicians, fighting for certain goals. This included, of course, bank reformers who helped pass the Federal Reserve Act. Banking controversies are back in the headlines. Remember the Citizens United case heard before the US Supreme Court in 2010? This ruling granted corporations the same legal rights as individual people, yet without the same level of accountability to which individuals are held. Many activists and political groups continue to petition for more corporate responsibility and for the fair prosecution of wrongdoing in the financial sector. So remember that the protests against and concerns about the banking sector today are not a new phenomenon – they’re as old as the history of the Fed itself. The key message in this book: Though the United States won its independence in 1776, it wasn’t until 1913 that the country established had a central bank, called the Federal Reserve. The goal of the Fed was to alleviate the potential damage of financial crises, a goal that is still fights for amid many conflicting interests today. Actionable advice: Remember to inquire into the history of an institution. The next time you hear people calling for institutional change, pay close attention to the arguments for or against such change. Take the time to look into the history of the institution in question. Change does not occur in a vacuum, and poignant historical context can inform misguided short-term memory. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Newspapers reported on Greece’s ballooning public administration and told outrageous stories of mass fraud – for instance, that legions of people had pretended to be blind so that they could receive benefits. And, though painful, the solution looked simple enough: these profligate countries needed to whittle down their administrative apparatus, cut benefits where they could, raise taxes and so forth, until they were in a position to pay back their debts. But, actually, this advice is wrong on several levels. It misplaces the blame, penalizes the wrong people and – laughably enough – doesn’t even work. These blinks explain why. They also discuss why a “swap derivative” is a dangerous thing; why it’s sometimes best for a country to let its banks go bust; and the link between Hitler and austerity. The recent financial crisis, which began in the United States back in 2007, hit Europe hard. Many nations are still struggling to recover, and there are some who think they know the best policy for getting the European economy back on track. This policy is called austerity. Austerity, however, isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Though often effective when a single institution finds itself in crisis, it’s a dangerous policy when applied to a nation. Austerity is the process of reducing spending by issuing budget cuts, the goal being to boost an economy’s competitiveness and inspire confidence in its businesses. But we can already see evidence that austerity on a national level fails and weakens the economy, especially when it’s applied to multiple countries at once. Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy and Ireland are all cases in point. To understand why this is so harmful, imagine that your family has gone over budget. In such a situation, it makes sense to cut back on spending until things return to normal. But imagine that every household in the state did this at the same time. Money would cease flowing into local businesses, and stores and employers – burdened with expenses of their own – would begin to suffer. To weather the tough times, businesses would need to take out loans and lines of credit, creating even more debt – debt that they’d be unable to pay off until the households in the state begin spending money again. As you can see, this situation benefits no one – and it’s exactly the situation that austerity applied on a national level gives rise to: citizens spend less, the economy shrinks and debt grows. Furthermore, it’s the members of the lower classes who get hit the hardest. When budgets are cut, it invariably hurts welfare programs, unemployment benefits and the people who rely on social programs to get by. In times of austerity, the average struggling worker always suffers more than the banker who caused the crisis. It’s commonsensical to tighten your budgetary belt and reduce spending when times are tough; however, when a national budget is slashed across the board, the results are never good. A quick review of the historical record shows that austerity has routinely failed to restore economic growth. In the 1920s, during Warren Harding’s presidency, the United States experimented with austerity, and the result was the Great Depression. In 1931, President Herbert Hoover, desperate to balance the budget, tried to increase taxes. But it was too late for such a quick-fix approach, and the country was plunged further into recession. Only when President Franklin Roosevelt abandoned austerity in 1933 and increased spending under the New Deal did the economy finally recover. Germany was also subjected to a painful period of austerity after World War I and the Treaty of Versailles. This period impoverished and disillusioned large swathes of the population, setting the foundation for Hitler’s rise to power. Sweden, France and Japan also experimented with austerity in the 1930s, and their economies also suffered. Growth only began once they’d reversed the cuts and started making investments. Some economists will point to successful cases of austerity, but these are highly dubious. Australia, Denmark and Ireland are often held as positive examples, but with Denmark, one can argue that their budget cuts were always made during an economic boom, not during a recession. As for Ireland, the country was also experiencing economic growth during the 1980s, helped in part by the devaluation of the Irish pound in 1986, which boosted the demand for the country’s exports. Finally, in Australia’s case, it should be noted that there are no records to suggest that any cuts were made to unemployment benefits or capital taxes, as supporters of austerity would have you believe. Between 2007 and 2008, a massive financial crisis swept across the globe, and when it came time to cast blame, many pointed the finger at government overspending. But the truth is that the US banking system, not government policy, caused the crash. The banks had become heavily involved in “repo markets” that allowed them to borrow and make short-term loans with one another using housing-mortgage securities. In order to save some money, the banks would exchange these securities for cash and then buy them back at a very low interest rate. This worked fine for a while, and it would have continued to work had homeowners not begun defaulting on their mortgages, making the securities utterly worthless. But that’s exactly what started happening in 2007. Mortgage defaults skyrocketed, real-estate prices plummeted and banks began losing money left and right. When the media picked up the story, and the word “crisis” entered the public sphere, people panicked and couldn’t withdraw money from their banks fast enough. This only made matters worse. Since the banks didn’t have enough cash on hand to cover the withdrawals they borrowed money from other banks, which spread the problem even further. This proliferation of problems was sparked by two things: specific types of securities known as CDOs and the investment practice known as credit default swaps. CDOs stands for collateralized debt obligations, which is a fancy name for what is basically a bunch of seemingly random mortgage securities bundled up together. Now, these bundles came with an opportunity for investors to use credit default swaps (CDS), which was a way for them to bet against the bank, and receive a massive payout if the owner defaulted on the mortgage. The mortgage market was considered so safe that insurance companies like American International Group (AIG) sold a staggering number of CDSs to banks around the world – so many that they ended up being unable to pay for them when the defaults began. And when it became clear that AIG couldn’t pay on the CDOs, the investors became desperate and tried to get rid of them at drastically lowered prices. And since no one in the United States would touch them, investors and banks began looking to Europe, where the crisis likewise took hold. In 2008, most European nations were in no shape to take the blow of a banking crisis.   This was especially the case for Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, which the author refers to as the PIIGS nations due to their poor economic policies. All of the PIIGS nations had been struggling with economic growth. Portugal and Italy faced the problems of low birth rates and an increasingly elderly population; Ireland and Spain were dealing with a bursting property bubble. Furthermore, industries in the PIIGS nations weren’t growing as much as they’d hoped, due to products from core European countries like Germany being in higher demand. So these industries, and the nations themselves, were steadily building up debt. Adding to their problems was the additional credit they’d received for adopting the euro. Not only were they unable to pay back this credit; the adoption of the euro also reduced their ability to handle crises on their own. Since they could no longer control inflation and exchange rates, they were unable to employ the usual shock-absorbing tactics: devaluing the currency and increasing exports. Alas, instead of coming up with creative solutions to the crisis, it was decided to bail the banks out, a move that doomed the PIIGS nations to permanent austerity. The logic behind the bailout was that the banks were “too big to fail,” and that, if they went bankrupt, the fallout would be catastrophic. But the banks were also “too big to bail” since their value had become dangerously high. For example, in 2008, the combined value of the three biggest French banks was just over three hundred percent of the French gross domestic product! And the same thing had happened all across the EU banking system. To pay for these bailouts, the PIIGS nations essentially put themselves in a position of permanent austerity, since they would no longer have the money to invest in anything else. Many economists have held up Ireland as a model of how Greece might recover through austerity. But a closer look reveals that Ireland isn’t in enviable economic health. After Ireland spent €70 billion on bailing out its banks, it embarked on an austerity program that cut public-sector salaries by nearly 20 percent and drastically reduced welfare and other social benefits. Meanwhile, its growth was nearly non-existent. In 2011, growth was below 1 percent, and most of that came from foreign companies taking advantage of reduced taxes and generating wealth that, in the end, doesn’t stay in the country. At the same time, by mid-2012, the unemployment rate had risen to almost 15 percent – a sharp increase from 2007’s unemployment rate, which stood at 4.5 percent. And after three years of austerity, the debt-to-GDP ratio climbed from 32 percent in 2007 to 108 percent in 2013. To see what might have happened had the nations not bailed out the banks, let’s look to Iceland, which was actually in a worse position than Ireland in 2007. Around that time, the assets-to-GDP ratio of Iceland’s banks was nearly 1,000 percent, putting them in a similar “too big to fail” scenario. But Iceland did allow them to “fail” and the results were far better than you might expect. In many respects, Iceland did exactly what Ireland didn’t do: It provided additional support to social benefit programs like welfare, raised taxes on the top earners, lowered taxes on low-to-middle income families, devalued its currency and created capital controls. Contrary to the catastrophic predictions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), these actions resulted in Iceland’s GDP only dropping 6.5 percent in 2009 and 3.5 percent in 2010. And starting in 2011 a 3 percent growth returned, and continued in 2012, placing Iceland as a top grower on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development list.   While austerity might be in the best interest of the banks, since it usually entails their being saved from bankruptcy, it isn’t in the best interest of the nation or its citizens. Rather than looking to countries like Ireland, and singing the praises of austerity’s healing abilities, we should look to what real signs of recovery can tell us. As we saw in the case of Iceland, the first step to helping a nation in the grips of a banking crisis is to let the banks go bust and loosen their control over the economy. Otherwise, the process of saving the banks drains the state of the resources needed to help protect its people during recovery. So instead of bailing out the troubled banks, Iceland used 20 percent of its GDP to fund new banks, which took up its domestic operations. It was costly, but far less so than a bailout. Nations should take a serious look at their banks and ask themselves, “What service are we really protecting with a bailout?” The banking industry doesn’t provide an indispensable service like food or energy. What it does is make obscene amounts of money serving as a go-between on transactions between borrowers and lenders. But letting the banks go bust is only part of the solution; it’s also helpful to raise taxes on the wealthy to quickly begin reducing the debt. In a 2012 study, German economists showed just how restorative a one-time-only tax on the wealthiest 8 percent of its population could be. By collecting 10 percent of net wealth over €250,000, a country could increase GDP revenue by 9 percent! Similarly, American economists Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez suggest that if the United States raised the income tax on the wealthiest 1 percent of the population from 22.4 percent to 43.5 percent, the country would increase its GDP revenue by 3 percent. If a nation decided to act in the interest of the majority, rather than its few wealthiest citizens, there would be no shortage of creative solutions. One thing is certain: there’s bound to be another financial crisis down the road, and hopefully we can learn from our mistakes and make better choices when that time comes. The key message in this book: Though the international banking crisis was caused by the private sector, it was the public sector that had to pay when bailouts resulted in cuts to public services and social benefits. As a result, struggling families were hit especially hard while the wealthiest were protected. This is what happens when austerity is used to restore economic stability. But there are alternatives, and if more people understand what happened ten years ago, maybe the next crisis will be handled differently. Got feedback?

It would similarly be great if we could trust that the pills we put in our mouths were effective. But unfortunately, such reputable practices cannot be taken for granted. In these blinks you’ll discover how pharmaceutical companies harm medicine by conducting trials that make drugs look significantly better than they really are. Due to deliberate methodological flaws and the withholding of data, medicine has become as corrupt as any other profit-driven industry. You’ll also learn that pharmaceutical companies often fail to publish unflattering trial results; drug companies persuade doctors to prescribe their medicine; and real-life data can easily be analyzed for decades to come. So how do we know how effective drugs are? Often we look to medical trials to determine whether certain medicines are worth taking. Unfortunately, however, not all trials are created equally. Trials that are funded by pharmaceutical companies are more likely to produce results skewed in their favor. This bias becomes startlingly evident when you look at the results of Harvard and Toronto researchers’ 2010 survey of over five hundred medicinal trials. The survey asked two main questions: Did the results favor the test drug? Were they funded by the industry? Of the industry-funded studies, 85 percent yielded positive results, compared to only 50 percent of the government-funded trials. This sort of huge discrepancy indicates that studies sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry produce positive results that cater to industry interests. In addition, industry-funded trials are often riddled with hidden methodological flaws that make drugs appear better than they are.   Let’s take a look at the multinational pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer, for example, which published several trials on a drug called Pregabalin designed to treat pain. During these trials, researchers measured participants’ pain at regular intervals. However, as is often the case in medical trials, some participants exited the study because they were experiencing the drug’s negative side effects. In these cases, Pfizer decided to take the last measurement of pain severity – while participants were still on the drug – and simply carry that over into the remaining measurements. This technique is deceptive because it disregards the negative side effects. When the analysis was eventually redone – this time properly – Pfizer’s “last observation” method was unsurprisingly revealed to have overestimated the improvement in pain by about 25 percent. As we saw in the last blink, if medical trials are funded by the industry, it’s a safe bet that the results will be positive. But how exactly do industry-sponsored trials nearly always manage to achieve positive results? One way is to simply not publish medical trials that produce unflattering results. We can see this quite evidently in an investigation published in 2010, whereby researchers compiled the results of all the trials that had ever been conducted on the drug reboxetine, an antidepressant by Pfizer. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against a placebo, i.e., an inert sugar pill. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, yielded a positive result, and not coincidentally, it was this trial that was published in an academic journal. But what about the other six trials? They had almost ten times as many patients, and each of these trials showed reboxetine to be no better than a sugar pill. Yet, these trials were never published. This withholding of trial data fundamentally distorts medical evidence. By preventing you from seeing half of the relevant data, it becomes exceedingly easy to convince you of something false. This process of withholding negative trial results from publication is called publication bias, and it’s no small matter. In medicine, research serves a concrete purpose: to save lives, cure illness, and ease suffering. Withholding trial results puts people’s lives at risk. We like to think of scientific research as being objective and free from commercial bias. However, business and research are only becoming more intertwined, as an increasing number of medical trials are conducted by clinical research organizations (CROs) on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. Trials conducted by CROs bring down the cost of testing drugs, since CROs outsource to poorer countries, but this commercialization of research raises some ethical dilemmas. According to the Declaration of Helsinki, an important set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation, trial participants are supposed to come from a population that could reasonably benefit from their results. In practice, this means that a costly AIDS drug, for instance, shouldn’t be tested on people in the impoverished parts of the world, where the drug would be out of financial reach for participants. Yet, in many cases, especially in Africa, drugs are tested on people who couldn’t possibly benefit from the drugs’ development – simply because it’s cheaper. Moreover, the commercialization and globalization of research trials calls into question the data’s reputability. For example, if a high blood pressure drug is tested on a pool of typical patients in India, those patients would exhibit different underlying characteristics, lifestyle habits and medical access than if the same study was conducted in America or Europe, causing a significant rift in test results. Would the findings really be applicable to Western patients? In fact, medical trials from developing countries have produced positive results while those conducted elsewhere showed no benefit. If clinical research is conducted economically rather than ethically, we simply can’t be sure of the data. Medications don’t go straight from the lab to the stores. First, pharmaceutical companies have to send their drugs to regulators for approval. Regulators are tasked with monitoring a drug’s safety, but unfortunately, the regulatory environment is beset with problems. For starters, government regulators tend to be paid poorly. However, someone with such inside knowledge on regulation is valued by pharmaceutical companies. As a result, regulators are often tempted to leave the regulatory body in favor of the private sector. Even Europe’s top medicinal regulator at the time, Thomas Lonngren, announced in December 2010 that he was leaving his governmental post to work as a private consultant for the pharmaceutical industry. But people change jobs all the time. What’s the big deal? Well, what happens when governmental regulators, in the course of their everyday duties, are thinking about their future at a drug company? Could they not help a drug company overcome hurdles and approve a drug in order to leave a good impression?    This conflict of interest makes the existing regulatory mechanisms ineffective. In fact, the standards have been set so low that regulators only require pharmaceutical companies to show that their drug is better than nothing. When a new drug is released, doctors and patients are interested in one practical question: is it better than the best currently available option? However, the answer is often no. Of the 197 new drugs approved by the American Federal Drug Administration between 2000 and 2010, only 70 percent boasted data that suggested they were better than other available treatments. The same problem exists in the EU: to get a license to market your drug, you only have to show that it’s better than nothing. In fact, only half the drugs approved between 1995 and 2005 had been studied in comparison with other treatments at the time they were allowed on the market. Medical trials aren’t perfect. Sometimes they’re conducted in unrepresentative patients, or sometimes they’re too brief. They can measure the wrong data, be incorrectly analyzed and sometimes the results simply disappear entirely. On occasion, trial results are outright fraudulent. One famous case of medical research fraud comes from American anaesthetist Dr. Scott Reuben, who simply never conducted the twenty or more clinical trials on pain he had published over the previous decade. Instead, he made up the data!   Trials can also fail because they’re conducted on unrepresentative “ideal” patients. In the real world, patients are complicated: they have diverse medical problems and histories or take lots of different medicines, all of which interact with each other in unpredictable ways. Despite these complications, clinical trials sometimes study drugs in unrepresentative, unrealistically ideal patients, who are both young and also have a clear, singular diagnosis. Freed from real-life complications, trials in an ideal population might exaggerate the benefits of a treatment or find benefits where there are none, thus making the results completely irrelevant to real-world application. And yet, these kinds of trials are actually routine in pharmaceutical research. Finally, drugs are often tested against ineffective competitors. One thing that is sure to make a new treatment look promising is testing it against another that doesn’t work very well. For example, a study compared the drugs paroxetine and amitryptiline: paroxetine is a newer antidepressant, and is largely free from side effects such as drowsiness; amitryptiline, in contrast, is a very old drug, known to make people sleepy. In clinical practice, patients take it only at night to account for this side effect. In this trial, however, both medicines were administered in the morning. Amitryptline patients thus reported daytime drowsiness, which made paroxetine look better by comparison. With all the available medicines out there today, how do doctors decide which to prescribe? They don’t have the time to read every single peer-reviewed article relevant to their work. This presents a great opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry, which spends billions on marketing (about twice as much as it does on research and development) to convince doctors that their medicine is the real deal. One way to do this is to appeal to doctors directly. In fact, the overwhelming majority of the industry’s promotional budget goes to marketing directed at doctors. About half of that is spent on drug reps, people who visit doctors in their offices and try to convince them in person of the superiority of their company’s drugs over the competition. Drug reps are often young and attractive, bringing both gifts and the promise of a mutually beneficial relationship with the drug company they represent. Drug companies also print advertisements in academic journals. While ads for drugs are supposed to contain “objective” and “unambiguous” information, a study from 2010 found that less than half of the drug ads in leading medical journals referenced a high-quality trial which supported their claims. Drug companies also fund patient groups, who need money to lobby and support their members more effectively. These groups also can benefit from specialist expertise. Drug companies are happy to oblige, as this gives them an opportunity to establish a positive image for their brand, as direct advertising to patients is prohibited. Finally, drug companies pay celebrities to mention drugs during interviews. For example, Kathleen Turner, the mom from Serial Mom, drops references in interviews to arthritis drugs, and is paid to do so by Wyeth and Amgen.     Altogether, this forms a powerful marketing mechanism through which tens of billions of dollars are spent each year – as much as $60 billion in the US alone. By now you’ve seen what’s wrong with advertising and testing within the pharmaceutical industry. Our final blink looks at what we can do to change it. Because the pharmaceutical industry puts so little effort into running effective trials, we really have no idea which treatments are actually the best for many of the most important diseases. One way to counteract this problem is by establishing randomized trials in routine medical practice. Let’s say you wanted to compare two statins, drugs used to lower cholesterol in the blood, in order to see which is best at preventing heart attacks. Normally, when a general practitioner sees a patient and prescribes a statin, she simply clicks the “prescribe” button in her software that links to a page where she chooses the drug and prints out a prescription.    Here, an extra page could be added: “Wait! We don’t yet know which of these two statins is best. Rather than choosing one, just press here to randomly assign one or the other to your patient.” The doctor’s office would then need to follow up with the patient on the drug’s effectiveness. Using this type of system, the medical community could create a meaningful, anonymized database of health records, which, eventually, could give us a better idea of which medicines are actually best. Many of the major problems with clinical trials can be addressed with these kinds of simple trials and electronic health records: The key message in this book: The pharmaceutical industry puts little effort into developing effective drugs, and instead spends billions on marketing. If we want to live in a world in which we are prescribed medicine because it’s the best solution to our ailment, then we’ll have to seriously rework the way medical trials work.

These flashy big spenders, who strove at all costs to maintain their glamorous and luxurious lifestyle, have come to epitomize the excesses of that decade. Few stories embody these traits and the general atmosphere of the 1980s as well as that of RJR Nabisco and its CEO Ross Johnson. But it’s not just a story of one company – it’s the story of how a once fairly benevolent business practice, the leveraged buyout, transformed into something much more sinister. In these blinks, you’ll find out why leveraged buyouts became so common; how Johnson rose to his prominent position; and why RJR Nabisco was such an attractive target for a hostile takeover. Have you heard the term leveraged buyout, or LBO? Well, by the 1980s, the LBO had become a dirty word, synonymous with corporate greed and the unhinged nature of Wall Street. But at its inception, the LBO was simply a way to preserve family wealth. These transactions were devised by clever lawyers who were looking for ways to help wealthy business owners skirt estate taxes and pass money onto their heirs. Not coincidentally, LBOs first came on the scene in the late 1960s, when a generation of people, some of whom had built massive business empires, were getting ready to retire. Because of the way estate taxes function, if business owners wanted to retire and pass their companies on to their heirs, they would have had to pay huge sums of money in taxes. Under these circumstances, they generally had three options: first, they could pass the company on to an heir and pay their taxes in full; second, they could sell the company, relinquishing control of it in the process; and finally, they could go public, putting the business – and its stock price – at the mercy of the market. Naturally, none of these three choices were especially appealing. So, a lawyer by the name of Jerry Kohlberg developed a solution, albeit a rather slow-moving and lengthy one. Say Mr. Big was retiring. His lawyers would found a shell company and bring in a number of investors who would take out massive loans to buy Mr. Big’s company out. Mr. Big would still keep a stake in his business, thereby maintaining some control, while the investors would have gotten the target company for a much lower price than if they acquired it at the end of a bidding war with other prospective buyers. The money for these buyouts would come from bank loans, insurance bonds and the personal funds of the investors. As a result, the investors involved only paid about ten percent of the cost, while getting 30 percent from insurance bonds and 60 percent from bank loans. In other words, the investors acquired the target company for almost nothing, while the shell company took on a massive amount of debt, the effects of which would be mostly felt by the target company. In 1982, a company called Gibson Greetings was sold for $80 million to an investment group that had paid just $1 million of the cost themselves. A year and half later, the firm went public and was resold, this time for $290 million. The primary individual investor had put down $330,000 and had turned it into $66 million; in other words, the LBO craze was in full swing. It was clear to investors how profitable this tactic was and, by 1983, ten times more LBOs were taking place compared to just four years earlier. So what prompted this frenzy? Well, there were two main factors. First, the US Internal Revenue Code played a central role by allowing deductions of interest tax, but not dividends. As a result, companies were encouraged to go into debt and pay interest, rather than operate at a profit. Second, the appearance of junk bonds, speculative investments with a high risk of default, made it possible to raise a massive sum of money in a short period. Junk bonds can be raised in a snap, transforming LBOs from slow, ambling processes into rapid-fire, aggressive takeovers. Naturally, this change raised eyebrows and LBOs were chastised just as vigorously as they were promoted. The proponents of this tactic said it made firms leaner and increased their value, which was a valid point since an LBO could transform a company. After all, the massive debt burden involved enabled investors to streamline the business without mercy, cutting costs wherever possible. However, the debt burden also fueled criticism against LBOs. Government officials warned that a leveraged takeover one day meant a bankruptcy the next. Naturally, the losers in such situations were the employees of the target companies, many of whom lost their jobs. But the original shareholders also suffered; their investment value crumbled as the company took on all the new debt. But enough about the minute details. Now that you have some background on what an LBO is, next you’ll learn about a man who was behind one of the biggest leveraged buyouts of all time. In the 1950s, a man named Ross Johnson entered the Canadian business scene at the bottom of the corporate ladder. He would go on to become a prime example of a new breed of businessman, one that eagerly moved from firm to firm, pledging allegiance to investors rather than to a company. Playing the game this way turned out to be quite lucrative, and Ross was no stranger to luxury – he was fundamentally driven by a love for travel, celebrities and the finer things in life. He never stopped seeking the thrill of buying new properties, eating at world-renowned restaurants and meeting stars. In fact, he even kept a number of celebrities on his payroll to promote his company of choice at any given time. Good examples are former American Football player Frank Gifford and famed tennis star Rod Laver. To boot, Ross also had a penchant for attending celebrity golf tournaments. But while he was soaking up the good life, Ross didn’t pay much attention to the consequences of his often nefarious business strategies. For instance, he would liquidate entire departments on a mere whim and relocate whole sectors to different cities, simply in the name of a tactical advantage. To put it differently, Ross would happily sacrifice innumerable pawns to help capture a bishop. So, how did he ascend to such power? Well, his first position was a sales job in his home country of Canada. He worked his way up the ladder and, in 1963, got a break while working at T. Eaton, an old Canadian department store, under the management of a notorious head of personnel, Tony Peskett. Peskett pushed all his followers to keep business and management in perpetual flux, constantly shaking up companies and the market alike. While critics of this approach said that such a tactic simply meant pursuing change for the sake of change, leaving behind a trail of chaos and destruction, Johnson personally benefited tremendously by adhering to it. He soon began making crafty moves and was able to climb the corporate hierarchy during the frequent shakeups. Johnson benefited from his relationship with Peskett, but it wasn’t long before he was applying his mentor’s knowledge on a much grander scale. Johnson’s big chance came in 1976 when he became the CEO of the Canadian packaged goods company, Standard Brands. Finally, he was in a position where he called the shots. In this role, Johnson was already living the high life, but his insatiable thirst for bigger and better things made him set his sights on a merger with a much larger company: Nabisco. In the end, Nabisco technically took over Standard Brands – but in practice, quite the opposite happened. Back then, Nabisco was already responsible for some of the most popular crackers and cookies in the world, Ritz and Oreo among them. Because of their incredibly successful products, by the time the 1980s Nabisco had settled into an efficient, conservative monolith of a company. Employees never worked past 5:00 p.m. and no one feared for their jobs. However, when Nabisco merged with Standard Brands, the upheaval practiced by Johnson soon clashed with the Nabisco’s established protocols. Rather than spending time in boring meetings, mired with endless presentations, the crew from Standard Brands haphazardly shot out ideas, heckling everyone around them. They even taunted Johnson, who happily encouraged this rambunctious behavior. Johnson’s approach rapidly permeated Nabisco, and the same shift would occur when the firm later merged with RJR Reynolds, one of the world’s largest tobacco companies. At the time, RJR Reynolds was one of America’s most successful cigarette brands. Its founder had introduced innovations such as the first pre-rolled cigarette, as well as a famous brand of pipe tobacco, and the company dominated the market. When the firms merged, it was because of the growth opportunities it would afford both of them. However, the flashy behavior of the Northern US company, Nabisco, immediately conflicted with the values of its Southern counterpart, RJR. For example, employees at the RJR factory had never even seen a limousine, whereas it was the preferred mode of transportation for Nabisco managers. So, Ross Johnson was famous for shaking up businesses, but a new kid on the scene would challenge his burgeoning power. His name was Henry Kravis, a Wall Street banker who was making millions through LBOs. Ross had a distinct approach and, while most other traders were closing deals in hours or days, it could take years for him to seal an LBO. Naturally, Kravis’s higher-ups at the investment bank Bear Stearns weren’t so keen on this protracted timeframe. For example, Kravis was at one point made the interim CEO of a stationery company during an LBO, prompting a furious call from his boss at Bear Stearns who wanted to know what one of his senior traders was doing at the helm of a crumbling paper company. Kravis’ vision clearly wasn’t appreciated, and he soon left the firm, along with his cousin George Roberts, to team up with the originator of LBOs, Jerry Kohlberg. Together, in 1976, the trio formed the infamous private equity company, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). It was through this firm that Kravis played a key role in changing LBOs from innocuous tax workarounds into a powerful vehicle for corporate takeovers. However, Henry and George were much more interested in cutting huge deals than Jerry was. The cousins knew that making a $100-million deal took about as much work as cutting one for $10 billion – and they weren’t about to waste their time. By 1987, all the big players in the LBO world had a pool of investor money to use for LBOs. But the Kravis cousins set their sights on an even bigger pot. By forming a massive investment fund, the pair would show everyone that they had the most power and that the biggest deals belonged to them. To accomplish this goal, coming off of a massive deal with the Chicago-based Beatrice Foods, KKR began seeking funding for a new war chest. The company even waived management fees of their fund for the first several years to bring in more investors. Pretty soon, they had pulled together $5.6 billion, twice as much money as the competition. Professionals like the Kravis cousins were largely responsible for refining LBOs – but with so much money to be made, just about everyone wanted in on the action. So, while Johnson didn’t have any need to carry out an LBO, he knew that if he didn’t, he would look back on the moment as an opportunity lost. But Johnson knew that his greed would put off any serious players from touching RJR Nabisco, KKR included. As a result, his only option was to go with an outsider in the LBO world, the investment banking company Shearson. This firm was desperate to snag their own piece of the LBO pie, and they gladly agreed to absolutely insane terms, including handing over a massive cut of the total deal to Johnson and ensuring the maintenance of certain departmental budgets and retirement packages. Naturally, such concessions would jeopardize the austerity measures on which any solid LBO rests, such as downsizing departments to repay the debt incurred through the deal. But this wasn’t the only issue; involving several LBO novices meant that the deal was handled without the discretion and ruthlessness necessary to succeed. After all, a well-executed LBO is over before anyone realizes it has begun. To ensure this, senior executives get together with investors and come up with a buyout package. Once everything is in order and they have arrived at a share price offer, the executives put the proposal to a vote of the board. At this point, the deal is already so far along that the board basically has no choice but to say yes. The management calls for a yes or no vote, and if the board says no, corporate raiders are standing by to swoop in and grab the vulnerable company simply by buying enough of its shares on the stock market. However, in the case of Johnson’s deal, a lack of experience meant that information got out before it should have, resulting in disastrous consequences. Johnson’s LBO bid was doomed to failure from the get-go. Here’s how it played out: He and Shearson intended to offer a price of $75 a share for RJR Nabisco, $4 per share higher than the company had ever sold for. After the numbers were crunched, this came out to a total price tag of $17.6 billion, double the amount that any bank had ever loaned for a takeover. In fact, it wasn’t even initially clear if there was that much money available in the world. Naturally, when the board heard about Johnson’s offer, they insisted on issuing a press statement and opening up an opportunity for other offers to come in. Frankly, the board didn’t care for Johnson or his management style and were happy to get rid of him if they could. As the news spread, offers began pouring in. A special committee was tasked with getting the best deal for shareholders, and two offers stood out: KKR offered $94 a share, and First Boston, by way of a tax loophole, was prepared to offer anywhere from $105 to $118 a share. But before these offers were made, Shearson got word that Kravis was going to throw his hat into the ring, and changed its bid to $100 a share in an attempt to outbid him. In the end, it didn’t matter; the outlandishly large offer from First Boston prompted a second round of bidding. All involved parties were asked to place another bid and First Boston was asked to show how they could come up with the funds. Both Shearson and Kohlberg Kravis increased their bids, coming out to between $108 and $109, while First Boston failed to secure the necessary financing. As a result, the battle came down to a dead heat between the two firms. The board was faced with a tough decision: acquiesce to the iron grip of KKR or hand victory to Johnson. If you were a part of Ross Johnson’s gang, you could count on leading a pretty charmed life – but other people were basically irrelevant to him. That’s why, when the LBO came before the board, it was already obvious that Ross was utterly indifferent to everyone else. In the end, the fact that he viewed each person in the company as expendable would drive the board’s decision against him. It didn’t help Johnson that his management deal became emblematic of corporate greed. All it took was a single New York Times article, which laid bare the lucrative deal Johnson’s team was aiming for, to unleash a national cascade of criticism. Of course, the board saw this media event as just one more blow to RJR Nabisco’s already tarnished reputation, and the special committee, therefore, chose KKR, which promised to put the company and its employees above all else. Just like that, Ross Johnson was done for at RJR Nabisco, and everyone, from rural workers to board members, was happy to see him go. KKR would introduce much-needed order to the company by applying their experience of acquiring companies without dismantling them. So, while the deal wasn't the pot of gold everyone had assumed it would be, it also didn’t break KKR with its sheer scale. And that wraps up the story of Ross Johnson. His legacy is one of corporate greed in excess, but he certainly had a good time along the way and held few regrets about those years. In fact, because of his talents as a salesman and his plain lack of ethics, he continued to have a thriving career throughout the 1980s in the United States. While some people’s fortunes were made or destroyed with the RJR Nabisco LBO deal, Ross simply entered semiretirement, laughing at the whole affair. He formed a consulting firm with an old friend and, while neither of them actually needed the money, they were happy to entertain themselves by doling out cheap advice to friends. The key message in this book: Leveraged buyouts began as a clever workaround for wealthy business owners to get out of paying estate taxes, but soon transformed into a vehicle for hostile corporate takeovers. The story of these deals is loaded with powerful characters and driven by distinct differences in approaches that separated the winners from the losers.   Got feedback?

Does it depend on the player? Or the goalkeeper? Or something else entirely? As you’ll find out, the answer to those questions is quite intriguing, and has to do with far more than the skill of the players. What’s more, these questions aren’t just interesting for fanatical soccer fans – they are also highly relevant to the field of economics. These blinks will offer you insight into the economic thinking that plays out on the soccer field and how abstract economic theories can be verified by the most popular game ever. By examining soccer data, you’ll learn about new economic models of human behavior and get a completely new view on the importance of soccer matches. In addition, you’ll learn why you should always choose to kick first during a penalty shoot-out; why the referee always seems to prefer the home team; and how to get the most out of your Rock Paper Scissors strategy. To appreciate how soccer helps us understand economics, we first have to understand John Neumann’s minimax theorem. His game theory theorem concerns two-player zero-sum games, games in which the positive payoff for one player always means negative payoff for the other. Minimax assumes that players choose strategies that aim to minimize their opponents’ maximum possible payoff – hence “minimax.” And since we’re talking about zero-sum games, this also means that each player also attempts to minimize his own maximum loss. For example, in a game of Rock Paper Scissors, only one player can win, and the other will lose. Each player’s strategy is therefore to minimize the payoff (the win) for the other. There are two such strategies: pure and mixed. Pure strategies are strategies whereby a player always chooses the same move (like playing Rock every time), whereas mixed strategies employ variations of Rock, Paper and Scissors. An important hypothesis of minimax theory is that if it’s disadvantageous for the other player to know your choice in advance, then you will benefit from choosing random strategies. For example, imagine that you are playing Rock Paper Scissors against a long-time friend. If you tend to play Paper most often, then your friend can easily exploit this by pursuing a pure strategy – that is, by always playing Scissors. However, if one person plays pure and the other plays mixed, the mixed strategy will win two-thirds of the time. On the other hand, if both players play mixed strategies, then both will have equal chances to win. Thus, if two players randomly play Rock, Paper or Scissors, they should each win 50 percent of the games. Ideally, then, both players should mix moves, because every pure strategy would only have a 33 percent chance of winning. The minimax theorem was introduced as far back as 1928, but had never been verified by empirical data. That is, until the penalty kick in soccer. But why are penalty kicks considered a minimax game? Just like Rock Paper Scissors, there are only a limited number of strategies, which are chosen independently of the opposition’s choice. The game involves a kicker and a goalie, who both have a strategy (kick left, right, or middle; jump left, right, or stay in the middle). The payoff for the kicker is the goal; the payoff for the goalie is a no-goal. The kicker tries to maximize the likelihood of scoring, while the goalie tries to minimize the likelihood. Importantly, since it takes the ball only 0.3 seconds to reach the goal, the goalie can’t react to the kicker’s strategy. Instead, he has to decide on a strategy beforehand, meaning that both players choose their strategies independently of one another. Additionally, because each player must choose from a limited number of strategies – left, right, and middle – we can therefore formalize the players’ choices, and evaluate whether they verify predictions made by the minimax theorem. Indeed, the kickers’ strategies prove the minimax theorem’s predictions about both players’ behavior and the effectiveness of their strategies, namely that they choose mixed strategies, that the likelihood of success is the same for mixed strategies and that no soccer player employs pure strategies. Interestingly, a player’s kicking strategy shows that players automatically create serially independent sequences, meaning that they neither always kick towards the same corner nor always change corners.  In other words, their shot location is random.   Just as minimax predicts, this strongly indicates that their choice in strategies is not influenced by previous choices or outcomes. In fact, of the circa 9,000 penalty kicks in international leagues that have been evaluated, the average scoring probability across strategies is 80 percent, regardless of the order in which the kicker shot left, right or center. As you’ll see in our following blinks, just as soccer can help to verify game theory, it can also help us clarify assumptions about other economic models that were previously considered too vague to evaluate. Not only does the penalty shoot-out shed light on game theory; it also provides us with a unique opportunity to analyze the psychological factors in competitive behavior. Economists and psychologists look at the environment in which decisions take place in order to better understand those decisions. A penalty kick, for example, falls under the category of “tournament settings,” characterized by competition. Social scientists use these models to analyze other real-life competitive situations, like job promotions, and study what factors influence who wins. However, economists and psychologists have found tournaments to be insufficient as analogies for real-life competition, as it's hard to observe and measure the strategies behind real-life scenarios. For example, did a candidate manage to earn a promotion because he had a higher incentive (like paying off his mortgage) or because he was more likeable or less stressed during the interview? The tournament model simply can’t provide a satisfactory answer. This insufficiency is due primarily to the lack of clarity in the observation of strategies and outcomes in everyday situations. The results are already difficult to categorize, and seem too vague to use in explaining psychology or emotions. The penalty kick, however, offers the ideal way of evaluating psychological influence in tournament settings because of how simple all of the variables are; it reduces the entire scenario to only the outcomes (the result of the shot) and the psychological factors, such as shooting first or second. Moreover, the randomness of the kicking order in a penalty shoot-out makes for reliable data. In a penalty shoot-out, both teams are automatically part of a random selection process: the coin flip. Thus, the decision as to who goes first – and 97 percent of all professional players chose to kick first – is randomized. This randomness adds credibility to penalty-kick data, as randomized data can’t be easily tampered with. Because both teams perform in front of the same audience and because the result of the penalty shoot-out determines who wins the match (i.e., they have the same stakes), we can ask: does kicking order in a shoot-out effect athletes’ performance? The result is astonishing: Consider that between 1970 and 2014, the winning frequencies by team in both national and international competitions were 60.6 percent for the first team and 39.4 percent for the second. This is because the standard order of ABABABABAB, where A is one team and B is the other, puts tremendous pressure on the kicker of the second team. In fact, kickers seem to know this: there are only two exceptions in all documented coin tosses in which the winner of the toss didn’t choose to go first. The first exception was Italian goalie Buffon against Casillas, a goalie from Spain. Buffon won the coin toss and decided that Spain should kick first. Five years later, the same teams and the same players went to a shoot-out, and the Spanish goalie chose Italy as the first kicker. But how do we know that the disadvantage of the order ABABABABAB is purely psychological? Well, studies have shown that if we change the kicking order to something else, like ABBABAAB, we can eliminate the disadvantage almost entirely. In order to test this, scientists had professionals from Spain’s La Liga perform 200 shoot-outs in the new order, and found that the new order had evened out winning frequency: 51 percent for the first and 49 percent for the second team. The sequence ABBABAAB is called Prouhet-Thue-Morse (PTM) sequence, and answers one important question in studying tournament settings: how can you order a sequential competition between two players such that it is as fair as possible? The order used today, Strict Alternation (ABAB) gives an advantage to one competitor – one that is completely psychological. Clearly, psychological factors influence players’ performance. Our next blink will explore how pressure can influence the other people on the field: referees. One of the fundamental tasks in economics is to analyze how people make decisions. The soccer field provides a perfect environment to study how social pressure affects our decision-making. For one, audience support of the home team applies social pressure to the referee. Because professional games are attended by up to 100,000 people, this pressure can be overwhelming and can lead to bias. Consider this recent evaluation of data from Spanish soccer matches, which has even revealed that, when the rewards are higher for winning the game (for instance, at tournament finals), the referee’s bias towards the home team increases equally. This indicates that the stakes for the home team has influence on the referee as well. The statistical mean of injury time is 2.93 minutes in the second half of the game, and this rarely changes if a team leads by more than 1 point or if it’s tied. However, injury time varies greatly if it is a close contest. For example, if the home team is ahead by 1 goal, then the extra time added at the end of a half in order to make up for time lost due to injuries or other interruptions is 29 percent below average – either 1 or 2 minutes. When the home team is behind by 1 goal, injury time is 35 percent above average – somewhere around 4 extra minutes! So, when the game is close enough for injury time to matter, that is, if the difference in score is greater than 1 point, then the referee systematically favors the home team, meaning that social pressure can unconsciously influence people whose only job is to remain neutral. However, there are ways to influence the game without actually being on the field, such as cheering, whistling, booing and hooliganism. In our final blinks, you’ll learn how these influences affect other fans. In spite of fear’s drastic effects on our behavior, it has only very recently been investigated in economic theory. How does risk change the behavior of consumers? And how do they manage this fear? Fear is the result of the difference between subjective and objective probabilities of risk – people respond to subjective fear of a situation, not the objective risk. First put into an economic model by Becker and Rubinstein in 2013, it put forward two testable hypotheses: First, that with the right incentives (benefits), people learn to control their fear (costs). The idea is that your willingness to control your fear is dependent on what economic cost/benefit you expect from exerting that control. Therefore, if we can determine how much potential benefit they expect to receive, we can then measure and predict people’s reactions to frightening situations. Interestingly, when someone expects large benefits from controlling one’s emotions (e.g., fear), his or her subjective experience will more closely reflect the objective risk. Consider, for example, that people who frequently travel on airplanes benefit greatly from controlling their fear that they could crash and die. Their subjective belief of how likely it is that they will crash is closer to the objective, statistical risk of crashing. However, those who very rarely travel by plane often show anxiety or fear – their subjective belief of the likelihood that they will crash is larger than the actual risk. Indeed, if you frequently find yourself in a given situation then you are less likely to avoid that situation because of its risk. For example, data gathered from the Palestinian Intifada between 2000 and 2005 showed that the Palestinian attacks in Israel only influenced the Israelis who occasionally used the goods and services that exposed them to risk, such as restaurants, shopping malls, cafés. In contrast, the demand of frequent users was completely unchanged by terrorist attacks. Interestingly, the Becker-Rubinstein model can be verified by soccer data by looking at how violence and hooliganism affect ticket sales. The following data is from 45 seasons in the Spanish League, from 1951-1995. One hundred and sixty seven events were recorded that qualified as hooliganism and 334 matches were singled out in a before/after analysis. Married people, for example, show the strongest reaction to acts of violence and hooliganism, due to their higher costs of overcoming fear. Indeed, studies found a 40 percent difference in the ticket renewal rate between singles and married individuals after one particularly violent soccer season. In fact, only 51 percent of married people actually renewed their tickets. Why? Their emotional investment in their marriage outweighed their interest in their hobbies. The opposite was true for singles, who had no marriage in which to be emotionally invested. Likewise, single-ticket buyers’ attendance dropped by 40 percent after acts of violence. Single-ticket buyers attend games only occasionally, and therefore don’t benefit from overcoming their fear of violence at soccer games. By contrast, single season-ticket holders, are hardly affected by violence. In fact, almost all of them, 94 percent, renewed their season tickets after acts of violences, and 95 percent attended games directly following acts of hooliganism. All of this data confirms the prediction of the Becker-Rubinstein model that controlling our fears depends on our incentive to do so. But the second hypothesis of the Becker-Rubinstein model did not prove true: that better educated people are able to more accurately assess objective risk. If we split season-ticket holders that fall into the categories of high education (5-6 year college degree) and low education (high school degree), we see that the attendance rate among the high education group dropped only from 95 to 93 percent after acts of violence. The attendance of the low education group, however, dropped much more significantly – from 92 to 75 percent. This data of soccer attendance shows us that maybe more highly educated people are not in fact better at assessing objective risk. However, because of other variables that the study does not take into consideration, this example exposes some shortcomings in attempting to link data to causation. The key message in this book: We can gain a number of insights into economic behavior by looking to the soccer field. By examining the strategies of the penalty kick, a referee’s preference to a particular team, and even something as simple as ticket sales, we can learn a lot about the world around us. Suggested further reading: Risk Savvy by Gerd Gigerenzer Risk Savvy is an exploration into the way we misunderstand risk and uncertainty, often at great expense to our health, finances and relationships. However, if we better understand risk, we can develop the tools necessary to navigate this highly complex world without having to become an “expert in everything.”","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Reich","summary":"We all live in a democracy, which is supposed to mean that the people are reigning. But when you think about it, do you really think that you and your fellow ones are the ones who decide where America is going? Probably not: in a recent poll, 77 percent of the US citizens polled said that too much power is in the hands of a few rich people and corporations. Something has gotten out of balance in the American democracy and economy, the game has become rigged against the average US citizen while it favors the rich and global corporations. In this book, you’ll learn about what has gone wrong, how the Tea Party movement is making it worse and what can be done about it. You’ll also find out: why the rich are effectively paying less income tax than the middle-class; what motivates the oil industry to donate $150 million every year on political campaigns; and why Henry Ford paid his workers three times more than other factory workers were paid. Have you ever wondered why, despite the fact that the American economy has grown consistently over the last three decades, your wage hasn’t changed a bit? In fact, the average American worker’s monthly pay has grown by only $280 in thirty years. We have to ask ourselves, who is benefitting from all of this economic growth? While the working and middle classes have seen very little change in their wealth, the rich have enjoyed the lion’s share. Indeed, over the last few decades the gap between rich and poor has grown at a terrifying rate. In the ‘60s and ‘70s, the top one-percent earned somewhere between nine and ten percent of the total income nationally. In 2007 that number had more than doubled at 23.5 percent. Even more frightening is the fact that the wealthiest 400 Americans are now wealthier than the 150 million lowest earners put together! Moreover, the average wage of CEOs has gone from being “only” 40 times that of their average workers to 400 times over the same 30 year period. So what caused this startling rise in inequality? In essence: tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy. The United States saw several tax cuts for the rich under both the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations. Looking at the period between 1958 and 2008, you notice that the average effective tax rate, i.e., the rate people actually pay after all the tricks and loopholes have been exploited, has dropped from from 51 percent to only 26 percent for the top one percent. What’s more, the rich also earn a great deal of their income in the form of capital gains, that is, profits that come from stocks, bonds or real estate. Capital gains are taxed at only 15 percent instead of the 35 percent for wages in their tax bracket. Meanwhile, the income tax on the average middle-class worker has increased from 15 to 16 percent. Anyone who follows American electoral politics knows that presidential campaigns are expensive. Political ads, staff and tour busses all come with a huge price tag. Take a deep  breath and let this sink in: the 2012 general election in the US, the most expensive in American history, cost $2 billion. So where do politicians get all that cash? Mostly, it comes from the deep pockets of big corporations. Yet, as they say, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. In return for donations, businesses expect to get something in return. And indeed they do! In fact, large corporations have vast influence in Washington. The oil industry, for example, spends around $150 million each year on political campaigns. In return for their “generosity,” they expect the government to create laws that benefit their business. These benefits could come in the form of tax breaks, promises not to sign environmental protection bills or contracts for cushy government jobs. Just imagine that the tax breaks for the oil industry earn them an estimated $2.5 billion a year – well worth their initial investment! Politicians defend their coddling of big business by pontificating about the job opportunities these companies create for Americans. This claim, however, doesn’t ring true; most of the jobs created by today’s corporations are not in the United States, but overseas. Why? The answer is economic: corporations are driven only by the profit motive, and have no interest in helping the American middle class. Unfortunately for Americans, cheap labor is found elsewhere. According to a 2012 survey by Wall Street Journal, the 35 largest American corporations created 333,000 jobs abroad, while only creating 113,000 in America itself from 2009 to 2011. Apple, for example, employs only about 43,000 people in the US – yet it has nearly 700,000 workers abroad, mostly in China. As we’ll see, shrinking tax revenue means that the government has less money to sustain public services, which has dire consequences. Do you get excited about tax season? Not likely! No one likes paying taxes, and many people actively try and reduce the taxes they pay by voting for politicians who advocate tax cuts. Yet, campaigns to slash taxes have an obvious consequence: worse public services. Lost tax revenue means government must cut basic public services that we all need, such as schools, highways, hospitals, safe bridges, police or public transportation. For example, spending on education and infrastructure has seen a dramatic drop from 12 percent of GDP in the ‘70s to just three percent in 2011. Although these cuts everyone, they’re especially damaging to the poor. In 2012, for instance, the Republicans in the House of Representatives decided to cut $3.3 trillion from low-income programs over the next ten years. This translates to a drop in health care coverage for 14 to 28 million low-income people and a 17-percent reduction in food stamps. These cuts are even more dramatic when you consider that, according to a study of the Agricultural Department in 2011, nearly one in four children belonged to a family that could not afford sufficient food at some point in the year. People sometimes counter this by appealing to the generosity of America’s wealthy elite, pointing to its long tradition of charity. Yet, today’s seemingly charitable donations are often not designed to actually help the poor! Most philanthropy from the wealthy is directed at cultural institutions, like operas and art museums, or at the universities from which they graduated. These are more investments in their lifestyles than true charity. In fact, only 10 percent of all charitable donations actually help the poor or support organizations that do so! In 1914, the famous automobile magnate Henry Ford did something revolutionary: he decided he would pay his workers three times the wage a typical factory employee earned at that time. Although this might seem crazy, there was a huge upside. Ford employees could now afford Ford cars, thus turning his workers into customers. And his idea worked! After only two years, Ford’s profits doubled. It’s this basic deal between American employers and workers that made the American economy so strong: employers paid workers enough to live a decent life, and their paychecks in turn kept the economy growing. This was the key to America’s economic success and growing middle-class. Armed with a decent income, Americans could spend their earnings on American-made products, which in turn created even more jobs and higher salaries. In the late 1970s, however, the deal was broken. Tax breaks for the wealthy gave them a much larger share of the economy at the expense of declining wages for the middle class. This was especially true after the 2008 recession. For example, if you started to work at General Electric in 2002, you would earn between $21 to $32 per hour. In 2012, after the crisis, they earned only $12 to $19. The decline in middle-class wealth isn’t something we should ignore, and in fact has serious consequences for the health of the American economy. In order for an economy to grow, it needs healthy middle class people to constantly purchase new products. It can’t rely on spending of the wealthy, because they eventually reach a point at which there is nothing else for them to purchase. They already have everything, and would rather save money at that point. And if money goes unspent, then the economy cannot grow; it can only stagnate. By this point, you’ve seen how favoritism towards the wealthy elite has damaged the American economy. We’ll now look at one of the major forces in the United States working to further dismantle the few existing social programs. The anti-government and tax-cutting policies we’ve seen aren’t just driven by the wealthy and powerful. They also find supporters among the “normal” American population, who have organized themselves into a group known as the Tea Party Movement. Tea Party members are often associated with the Republican Party, and consider themselves to be conservatives. In actuality, they’re quite regressive. True conservatism is about conserving the good parts of government and society that we already have. In contrast, the Tea Party wants to abolish the public achievements made over the years, hence taking us back in time, preferably to the US of the 1920s. It was in these times that the US government felt comfortable letting the free market reign – a time when there was no Social Security, labor laws, unemployment insurance or minimum wage. Moreover, people who identify with the Tea Party are ideologically distinct from moderate Republicans. They are, at their core, an angry white minority who, according to political analyst Michael List, come primarily from poor, rural, heavily conservative areas in the Southern – i.e., former Confederate – states. Consequently, their political positions differ from Republicans in certain areas. A 2011 CNN poll among Republicans revealed considerable ideological splits. For instance, Tea Party members were twice as likely than other Republicans to believe that abortion should be illegal under every circumstance or that gay marriage should be categorically forbidden. Indeed, the Tea Party is ideologically extreme, immune to science and unwilling to compromise on anything. Their strategy is simple, yet decisive: they’d stop at nothing to achieve their ends. Just look back to 2013, when House Republicans, with the aid of the Tea Party, forced the government to shut down at tremendous cost to American taxpayers because they were unhappy with Obama’s budget. The regressive right has become obsessed with a return to the old and “pure” America, in which the government had no teeth and citizens were left to their own fate. The America that they want to recreate also had a different social mentality, one shaped by the unfortunate ideas of Social Darwinism. Simply put, Social Darwinism holds that the principle of survival of the fittest – that only those who are strong deserve to survive – will lead to a strong society. The concept of Social Darwinism was developed in the 1880s by a Yale professor of political and social science William Graham Sumner. He believed that, in order for civilization to progress, it must be totally free. Social classes would have no obligation to one another, and those too “unfit” to survive under free market capitalism would die out. These callous sentiments are well represented in Tea Party ideology. They believe that government should do as little as possible to help the needy, as doing so creates unnatural dependencies and disrupts the process of natural selection. Let’s look at some of Ron Paul’s views to get an idea of how Social Darwinists think: In a Republican debate in 2011 on Obama’s healthcare plans, he was asked how he would handle a young patient who had fallen into coma without having previously purchased health insurance. Of course, without insurance, he couldn’t pay the treatment. His response: “That’s what freedom is all about: taking your own risks.” In essence, if he died, it would’ve been his own fault – survival of the fittest. By now, you’ve seen just how frightening contemporary social and economic policy can be. Our final blinks will offer you some advice on what you can do to change it. If you’ve read this far, then you should be thoroughly terrified by these recent political and economic trends. So what can you do to enact change? For starters, you can get more involved in the political process. Citizenship means more than just checking a few boxes on an election ballot. No positive change will come unless the right people mobilize, organize support and make it happen. The politicians in Washington, regardless of their intentions, need someone to push them to do the right things. Heed the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt. During Roosevelt’s 1936 re-election campaign, a woman listed all the problems that he needed to fix. He replied: “Ma’am, I want to do those things, but you must make me.” So how do you make them? You’ll have to take action! But you can’t make a difference on your own; you have to join forces with others or, even better, start your own movement! Unfortunately, politicians and media won’t pay attention to average individuals. But they will pay attention to thousands of people that have come together for a common cause! You don’t necessarily need formal authority or a fancy title in order to get people energized and organized. You only need strong motivation and an infectious passion for change. There are dozens of examples throughout history – such as Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela – of individuals whose sheer desire for change inspired great social and political movements. What’s more, you need to seek out the people who disagree with you. When you only talk to people who share your views, then you have no hope of changing anything! This means stepping outside of your ideological bubble and engaging with your opponents in order to persuade them. So you know now how you can accomplish change. But what sorts of changes should we implement? Here are some points that you might want to consider: Blessed with their vast wealth, the rich should be expected to contribute a larger share to society. In practice, this means paying higher tax rates than those who have less. The fact that the 400 richest Americans pay less income tax than most of the middle-class workers due to the tax loophole created by capital gains is simply intolerable, and must be changed. Moreover, the super-rich should pay the same income tax rate as they did in the ‘50s and ‘60s: 70 percent on income over one million dollars. Another idea would be to levy a two-percent surtax on the assets of the richest 0.5 percent of Americans. Each of these individuals has more than $7.2 million in wealth, meaning they possess an unprecedented 28 percent of all the nation’s wealth! Such a tax would generate around $70 billion per year in revenue. So what do we do with all this additional revenue? We should invest it into public goods, especially in those which are woefully underfunded but are also crucial to the country’s future: education and infrastructure. Kids are packed like sardines in the classroom, schools can’t afford textbooks or science labs, teachers receive a pauper’s pay: lots of schools desperately need money, and this lack of funding puts the education of America’s children at risk. Meanwhile, we drive on unsafe roads and our subways, buses, ports and airports are sorely in need of repair. After examining the existing American infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave it an overall grade of a D – hardly something to brag about. As you can see, there’s still lots to do, and we are in strong need of active citizens who want to bring progressive change. It doesn’t matter how you do it; the important thing is that you do it. The key message in this book: The political and economic game is rigged against the American middle class. Big money and the regressive right have taken over in Washington and have set the American economy on a crash course. Luckily, with the right attitude and policy initiatives, we can put things back on track.

Thirsty frontiersmen with stills in backwater swamps. Partying city dwellers willing to risk their lives for a drink. The element that connects them all is bourbon, a distilled spirit that is intimately tied to the history of America. From bootleggers and bureaucrats to blue-collar workers, bourbon has fueled both greed and thirst. These blinks take you on the adventure that established American whiskey as a potently symbolic drink, with its roots deeply embedded in the nation’s culture. You’ll learn which whiskey is worth your cash and how capitalism tarnished the myth of the small bourbon distillery forever. In these blinks, you’ll discover which conditions make American whiskey officially bourbon; why when the British left, rum dried up and whiskey became popular; and how the US government tried to poison America’s thirst for booze.   This is a Blinkist staff pick “Pour yourself a glass of bourbon and read or listen to these blinks. They really give you a sense of the long and gritty history of this most American of spirits.” – Erik, Editorial Production Manager at Blinkist How do you like your bourbon whiskey? Served on the rocks, with a twist? Or perhaps just a shot after a long day at work? However you enjoy bourbon, know that it has a long, storied history as the drink of choice for the American people. There are many reasons why bourbon is a uniquely American spirit. While bourbon is technically a whiskey, this type of spirit can only be called “bourbon” if it meets the following conditions: It must be distilled in the United States; the grain mixture must be at least 51 percent corn; and it must be aged in new oak barrels. These rules to protect bourbon’s unique character came about through careful lobbying by the liquor industry. In particular, Lewis Rosenstiel, head of one of America’s largest liquor companies, wanted to give bourbon a special classification to secure it as a distinctively American product. Through this classification, Rosenstiel knew he could make bourbon a more desirable export product. He spent millions of dollars lobbying overseas, even sending every US embassy a case of bourbon! In time, his efforts paid off. In 1964, the classification rules were made law and bourbon was on its way to international fame. While politics made bourbon the spirit it is today, its history with American drinkers runs much deeper. North American whiskey appears as far back as the seventeenth century when the fiery spirit was supplied to frontier soldiers fighting Native Americans. This whiskey was of questionable quality, but producers at the time weren’t concerned about quality ingredients or proper distilling procedures. But as settlers began to move into the western territories, new and different corn and grains were discovered and added to the mash recipe. This certainly helped the flavor of this originally simple spirit: what once tasted like gasoline began to refine into what we know as bourbon today. Thus, bourbon whiskey was on its way to becoming the “American native spirit.” Many popular stories about bourbon whiskey are of families following noble, centuries-old distilling traditions, unconcerned with modern technology. But the reality of the whiskey business tells quite a different story. The truth is that small, family-run whiskey stills were getting squeezed out of business as far back as the eighteenth century. Between 1789 and 1797, when George Washington was president of the United States, he tried to introduce a tax on whiskey that would benefit big producers while harming smaller ones. People who lived on the frontier, many of whom made their own whiskey for sale, rebelled against the tax, arguing that it would ruin them. The protests were successful, and Washington gave up on the tax. But it was only a matter of time before big companies would take over the distilled spirits business. Today, large producers disguise their influence by releasing products under many different brands, which at first glance appear to represent small, family-run businesses and artisanal traditions. Even though store shelves are packed with dozens of different whiskeys and bourbons, some 75 percent of these are made by the same Big Four producers: Beam, Schenley, Stitzel-Weller and Heaven Hill. These four companies are constantly fighting for market leadership. So are you fooling yourself into thinking that there are tons of small brands that differ in quality and value? In essence, the whiskey industry is taking advantage of the power the alcoholic spirit has to make us feel connected to past traditions, to relive the spirit of the American frontier. By manipulating this desire, the Big Four market products offering you a break from today’s chaos and a retreat to a simpler time. But really, these companies represent nothing less than hardened American capitalism in the modern world. So we now know about today’s whiskey industry. But what were its origins? Captain George Thorpe was America’s first whiskey distiller. Some 400 years ago in a Virginia swamp, he became one of the first thirsty men to distill corn mash into alcohol. This early whiskey came out tasting more like paint thinner than the bourbon we know today. It’s no wonder that this tipple faced tough competition from the far more palatable Caribbean rum. When the British were still in control of North America, rum was cheaply available, as British territories in the Caribbean provided an easily accessible source of sugar cane from which to distill rum. Rum was so popular that it could even be used to trade for goods or British-backed credit. This trade in alcohol provided healthy tax revenues for the British government, and soon led people to see rum as all that was bad about British rule in America. When the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, the supply of cheap rum came to an end. And with sugar imports cut off, rum stocks were quickly depleted. Whiskey could be made with local ingredients, so it quickly became popular – so much so that it came to represent a symbol of national freedom. Even George Washington had his own whiskey distillery, producing around 11,000 gallons a year! You might think, after independence, it would be smooth sailing for whiskey producers and drinkers. But the whiskey industry was about to enter a troubling period in its history. By 1875, newspapers were filled with stories of scandal, corruption, bribery and tax evasion going on in the whiskey industry. What became known as the Whiskey Ring was a conspiracy involving hundreds of people selling cheap, low-quality whiskey disguised as a superior product. Dozens of distilleries across the country were involved, and most were evading federal taxes. The Whiskey Ring conspiracy even reached the White House. To his dismay, President Ulysses S. Grant discovered that his secretary and friend, Orville Babcock, was one of the ringleaders! This scandal resulted in the arrest of hundreds of whiskey producers, and it damaged the reputation of the whiskey business for a long time. But things got even worse in the twentieth century. In 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment was passed, banning the production or sale of alcoholic beverages and ushering in the era of Prohibition. This ban lasted for 13 years. People soon forgot what a quality product tasted like; illegal “bootleg” booze began to appear, accepted by desperate customers despite its low quality. Things even turned deadly, as the government began to meddle with the supplies that bootleggers were using to manufacture illegal whiskey. For instance, alcohol was still needed for medical purposes. To make sure these products weren’t used for consumption, the government deliberately added poisonous chemicals to the mix. Unfortunately, this didn’t stop bootleggers from making booze or thirsty consumers from drinking it, either. By 1925, alcohol-related deaths had increased to 4,000 per year. And even though Prohibition was eventually repealed, its effects on the whiskey industry lasted much longer than the time it was enforced. Prohibition’s dry spell ended in 1933, and afterward many Americans celebrated with a glass of whiskey. But they didn’t realize that the world of whiskey had been forever changed. Before Prohibition, both large and small distilleries operated across the United States. Over half of these distilleries were forced to close after 13 long years of being unable to sell alcohol legally. Even companies that did try to restart their businesses after repeal struggled and often failed. The companies that did succeed in the market after Prohibition were the Big Four. These companies had the resources to control the industry by shutting down the competition and buying up or squeezing out of the market smaller rival brands. These companies also had the capital to roll out extensive marketing campaigns, the beginning of a rebranding effort to change the bad reputation distilled spirits had that led to Prohibition in the first place. Instead of a low-quality libation tied to violence and corruption, whiskey now was a luxurious beverage for refined connoisseurs. Interestingly, given that there was a shortage of whiskey after repeal and that whiskey as part of its refinement process needs a few years in barrels, companies began to explore the production of new varieties of spirits in the 1930s. Distillers like Stitzel-Weller started using wheat to make a lighter spirit that could be sold quickly without needing to age too long. After years of fierce competition, the Big Four came together during World War II to help the war effort with a program called “Cocktails for Hitler,” to produce industrial alcohol. Indeed, once the United States entered the war, many distilleries diverted their alcohol for industrial purposes. The Big Four even collaborated and shared techniques to assist in the fight. This newfound cooperation didn’t last long, however. Soon after the war was over, the Big Four were once again fighting among themselves for industry dominance. Bourbon in America traditionally was a drink for blue-collar workers. While rich people might enjoy bourbon on occasion, the spirit was primarily seen as the preference of soldiers and hard-working men. But all this started to change when vodka arrived on the market. Vodka was first imported to the United States in 1946. Early on, the spirit was mostly popular in neighborhoods and cities with large Eastern European populations. But soon cocktail culture began to grow, with one drink emerging as a popular favorite: the Moscow Mule, a mix of vodka, lime and ginger ale. American baby-boomers saw vodka as a “hipper” alternative to bourbon, now associated with old-fashioned dads and “square” uncles – an image they wanted to avoid. Vodka was easier to drink and also easier to mix with other ingredients in cocktails. What’s more, alcoholics liked vodka more as it was essentially odorless, and couldn’t be detected on the breath. After being sold in the US market for just 30 years, vodka even began to outsell bourbon, the traditional American spirit. Something had to be done, so the whiskey industry came up with a plan: to rebrand bourbon as a luxury drink. As vodka’s popularity continued to rise and bourbon’s star fell, Maker’s Mark, a small distillery in Kentucky, decided to try something new. It changed its domestic image into an international brand, focusing on becoming an expensive, luxury drink for discerning tastes around the world. This marked a new trend that many other distilleries followed. And it worked! Many Europeans, unaware of bourbon’s humble beginnings, considered bourbon a fancy, imported spirit and boosted sales. Soon, whiskey producers were selling their products for higher prices internationally. Today bourbon is a drink that is enjoyed by people from all walks of life. So when you savor your next sip, now you can enjoy bourbon’s complex history along with its complex taste! The key message in this book: Bourbon is the quintessential American spirit, yet its history is storied and often unsavory. From its humble beginnings as a fiery distilled spirit for frontiersmen to its bootleg status during the years under Prohibition, this corn-based whiskey was often synonymous with corruption, tax evasion and even murder. Yet over time bourbon’s image has changed, to become the internationally popular alcohol it is today. Actionable advice: Take a moment and relax. Today’s modern life is often chaotic. If you want to make a connection with the past, get yourself a high-quality bottle of bourbon and relax. A great bourbon takes many years to age, so take the time out to savor what it means to make a spirit this refined. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It’s name tends to conjure clichés – samba music and bikinis. But, of course, there’s much more to it than that. With its checkered history, corrupt and bureaucratic government and widespread poverty, Brazil is, economically speaking, relatively backward. Yet, at the same time, it is a country with masses of natural resources and a key position in the southern hemisphere. In the early aughts, it rose to international prominence, along with Russia, India and China, as one of the BRIC countries. These “Big Four” were seen as the potential future powerhouses of the world economy. And while China is still more or less viewed this way, Brazil’s prospects seem much bleaker. So what happened? These blinks help explain how everything for Brazil seemed to be coming up roses – just to end in a mess of thorns. In these blinks, you’ll learn how brands like Budweiser, Burger King and Heinz are in the hands of Brazilian billionaires; Why the example of Eike Batista perfectly explains Brazil’s economy; and how corruption has been a staple of Brazilian business since the nineteenth century. When you think of Brazil, your first thoughts might be of Rio’s famous Christ statue, Carnival, endless beaches and colorful samba dancers. But the reality isn’t so patently picturesque. For most Brazilians, it can be a struggle just to get the most basic things in life. Every city in Brazil has favelas, neighborhoods filled with makeshift shacks built by poor residents in bits of open space – under a bridge, in an old parking lot, wherever. You can even find them in the alleyways tucked between skyscrapers. But the favelas are just one facet of the problems Brazilians face. Others include clogged roads, a poorly functioning public school system and hospitals that often cause more health problems than they cure. Even though Brazil’s constitution guarantees free public healthcare, if there’s a health crisis and you don’t have private insurance, you’ll likely wait an entire day in the emergency room. There is also an astounding amount of bureaucratic red tape and paperwork for basic needs such as opening a bank account or getting a phone connected. And trying to cancel one of these services can be even worse. When the author tried to switch his internet provider, for example, he ran into such resistance that he had to file an official complaint with the government’s telecom agency. Making things more difficult is the fact that all the paperwork needs to be stamped and notarized before it can be submitted to the government – a process that requires hours of waiting. Therefore, getting even the most basic tasks accomplished in Brazil can send you into a Kafkaesque world of endless waiting, where filling out paperwork just leads to more paperwork! The situation is so dire that every year it takes the average Brazilian company 2,600 man-hours to prepare its taxes. For these reasons, there are despachantes, people whose job is to help others navigate all this red tape, a task which usually involves becoming friendly with the right bureaucrat. Though Brazil has more than its share of problems, the country has managed to make impressive progress. Only a generation ago, the country was impoverished and struggling under the dictatorship which ruled the country from 1964 until democracy returned in 1990. Since Brazil has adopted democracy, popular exports like coffee, sugar, soybeans and beef have helped make its economy the seventh biggest in the world. The nation also produces more oil than Norway. And then there’s 3G Capital, a corporation run by a trio of Brazilian billionaires who have come to own some of the most iconic American brands, including Budweiser, Burger King, Heinz and Kraft. Yet despite these economic advancements, the rich and poor are still widely divided, especially in the treatment they receive from the law and the government. Those who have resorted to minor crimes such as petty theft or selling marijuana often await trial behind bars and are sent straight to prison once they’re convicted. It’s only those who are wealthy enough to pay for appeals and hire lawyers that can get their sentences suspended. Good attorneys can submit requests that take advantage of loopholes in the legal system and slow down the process while their clients stay out of jail. This is what Paulo Maluf, a longtime politician and former mayor of São Paulo, the biggest city in the southern hemisphere, has been able to do. Over the course of his 50 years in various offices, Maluf has been accused of astounding acts of corruption: In 2011, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice cited evidence that suggests he skimmed $19 billion from public works in just four years as mayor. Though Maluf denies all accusations, he’s also wanted by the international police organization Interpol for such crimes as corruption, conspiracy, money laundering and falsifying documents. But, thanks to the Brazilian justice system, he’s a free man and spent a mere 40 days in jail in 2005. It goes without saying that Paulo Maluf isn’t the only corrupt official in Brazil. In fact, the country has an established system of patronage, where officials distribute favors and titles among their friends – which is how many of Brazil’s wealthy businessmen rose to power. Patronage is a centuries-old tradition. When Portugal’s King João VI fled Europe to escape Napoleon’s advancing forces, he arrived in Brazil in desperate need of money. So, in 1808, to generate revenue, he sold Brazilian titles to his Portuguese friends in the royal family. Since then, the deep roots of corruption have remained a fixed part of Brazil’s culture, especially when it comes to business. In 1964, the military overthrew the government, and about five years later they created a secret government agency called Oban. Established as a program to uncover subversive agents, Oban functioned by uniting Brazil’s top businessmen and politicians. Their methods were extreme: During interrogations, suspects were given electric shocks and violently beaten. One victim of Oban was Dilma Rousseff, who would later go on to be president of Brazil. But the businessmen had little choice but to go along with the torture that was going on around them. One banker reasoned that, “It was either us or them.” And cooperating with Oban also meant that the businessmen could keep themselves in good standing with the politicians that controlled Brazil. Back then, the economy was struggling and the government credit that came from supporting Oban could keep a business alive. And this cooperation between business and politics is still popular today; the most successful businesses are run by those who join forces with the powers that be. Bribes are considered such a standard part of doing business that companies actually put themselves at a competitive disadvantage by not taking part in these schemes. Indeed, bribery is so widespread that economists calculate its effects account for the loss of $20 billion – one percent of the country’s GDP. Despite its reputation for corruption, Brazil’s economy has long shown potential, which can be seen in the story of Eike Batista. Batista was born in 1957 to a wealthy family led by his father, Eliezer Batista da Silva, who was the minister of mines and energy in the 1960s and president of the state mining company, Vale. Eike began his business career in the early 2000s by buying the rights to iron ore deposits just as demands from China’s steel factories sent prices skyrocketing. But there was another reason investors were crazy for Batista. As the saying goes, people don’t invest in products, they invest in people; and Batista was seen as a charming playboy, one with a former Playboy cover girl for a wife and brilliant mind for business. With the help of his family, Batista surrounded himself with Vale’s best engineers and it seemed he had a golden touch for picking the right people and the right projects. While he didn’t have a track record to prove himself, he did hold plenty of promise, and in July of 2006 his appeal to money managers resulted in his mining company, MMX, raising $400 million and having the largest IPO Brazil had ever seen. Batista’s rise continued to be spectacular. Between 2007 and 2010 he went from not even being mentioned in the Forbes list of the world’s wealthiest people, to jumping from $6.6 billion to $27 billion. Finally, in 2012, with a net worth of $30 billion, Batista was ranked the eighth richest in the world. But all the while, he was also getting rich by selling an image of success. He was raising billions for new start-up companies while also winning the favor of politicians who were looking for a secure way to transfer massive amounts of public money. Behind the scenes, however, things weren’t perfect. Batista’s oil fields were actually underperforming and being labeled as “prospective,” a term given to oil reserves that may or may not be profitable. Batista was seen as the face of Brazil’s future prosperity, an image he was happy to embrace. But in 2012, the same year he appeared on the Forbes list, his net worth dropped by $14.5 billion in just three months. The problem was this: both Batista’s ventures and Brazil’s economic prospects were built on a very unstable bubble. One of Batista’s mistakes was refusing to listen to anything he didn’t want to hear. He labeled any employee who questioned the success of a project as a calça curta – the literal translation is short pants – but it was his way of calling someone a little boy, or small minded. By 2013, the analysts at Standard & Poor’s were warning Batista that his petroleum company, OGX, could be broke by the end of the year. But it wasn’t just Batista; the entire Brazilian economy was on the decline. With the poor forecasts, foreign investors were losing hope and holding back, turning those predictions into a self-fulfilling prophecy; the loss of trust also meant Brazil’s government had to borrow money from foreign banks at much higher interest rates. And things only got worse. For 2013, Batista’s companies reported $10 billion in losses and his personal net worth dropped below zero. Then, in May of 2014, Batista resorted to selling his homes, hotels and expensive toys to get whatever cash he could. Meanwhile, Batista’s problems were being echoed by Brazil’s own sociopolitical woes. President Dilma Rousseff was impeached for using government-run banks to help finance the government. While these methods were nothing new, the country had grown so frustrated and resentful that Rousseff became the scapegoat and was officially removed from office on August 31, 2016. Unfortunately, the outlook isn’t improving, as the current political uncertainty is accompanied by economic turmoil. More money continues to leave Brazil than comes in, and China isn’t buying as much iron and soybeans as before; plus, the IMF is predicting the economy will shrink by eight percent between 2015 and 2017. As we’ve seen, these troubles are so deeply rooted in Brazil; only time will tell if the nation can find a way around them. The key message in this book: There’s a fascinating story behind the economic success of Brazil, the epic rise of its billionaires and their subsequent downfall. Due to a history of corruption that has persevered for centuries, success does not reach everyone equally, and those who claim to have the country’s best interests in mind often have ulterior motives.   Got feedback?

Massive companies such as Google, Facebook, PayPal, Uber, Amazon and Apple are considered as some of the best places to work, in large part due to their push for more progressive work environments. But are those tech companies really progressive? Undeniably, the number of male employees far exceeds the number of female ones. This is the new norm. And upon closer examination, the work cultures in these companies seem to have been created to service men and feed the “bro” mentality. This is not good. As you’ll see, male-dominated workplaces have serious implications for business success and society as a whole. In these blinks, you’ll find out what influenced the tech industry to hire antisocial men; how many women held computer science degrees in the 80s compared to today; and how much gets invested in male-led companies in comparison to female-led ones. What does a typical computer programmer look like? The first image that comes to mind is probably a nerdy-looking man who’s terrible in social situations but excellent at dealing with numbers. This stereotype, however, is in massive contrast to the reality of the early days of computing. During the first part of the twentieth century, working with computers was considered a clerical job – like typing or operating a switchboard – and thus deemed “women’s work.” In other words, the first computer programmers were women. It should come as no surprise to learn that women programmed the first computer for the US Army during WWII. Or that rear admiral Grace Hopper – who held a PhD in mathematics – programmed Mark I, a computer at Harvard University which helped in the development of the atomic bombs that would be dropped on Japan in 1945. Another thing that many people don’t know is that astronaut John Glenn’s successful orbit of the earth in 1962 was made possible by the work of three female NASA mathematicians. The lack of recognition for their contribution inspired the 2016 film Hidden Figures. Then, in 1967, an article titled “The Computer Girls” was published in Cosmopolitan magazine. The piece contained an interview with Hopper, who compared programming to organizing a dinner party. She said that women made good programmers because of their patience and attention to detail. But sometime in the 1960s came a report that claimed men were better suited to programming. Unsurprisingly, the report was written by two men, psychologists William Cannon and Dallis Perry, who were hired by a software company to characterize the perfect computer programmer. Of the 1,378 programmers they interviewed, only 186 were female. After their research, Cannon and Perry concluded one key trait was that they “didn’t like people.” By connecting good programming skills with antisocial behavior and introversion, the ideal employee was more likely to be male on account of men being three times more likely to receive the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Since the release of that report, the industry was persuaded to hire antisocial men. Their dominance in the field has led to the false assumption that the majority of programmers should be men. By the time commercialized computers entered the market in the 1980s, the male nerd stereotype was firmly established within society. Before we dig into that, however, let’s first look at when men started taking over the technology industry. Two things happened in the late 1960s: the technology industry started to gain traction, and women programmers were replaced by men. Around this time, the technology industry was growing, and computing was gradually being recognized as an intellectual job. As a product of the times, intellect was considered a male, and not female, trait. As we’ll see, boys were more likely to be in contact with computers. And as computer science courses grew in popularity, male college applicants were more experienced and confident in admission tests than their female counterparts. The male dominance of computing degrees can still be seen today. In 1984 about 40% of computer science degrees were held by women, compared to 18% in 2011. This was because computers started to be perceived as “boys’ toys.” A study of high school children found no distinction between pre-existing computer skills in girls and boys. But since the industry was becoming dominated by men, in large part due to the report by Cannon and Perry, computers became a guy thing. This stereotype was perpetuated by toy manufacturers, teachers, parents and children themselves. By the 1980s, when computers first entered the household, girls were afforded even less exposure. Computers were typically a present for sons, and video games were predominantly targeted toward young boys. What’s more, the male-dominated computer stereotype started to infiltrate pop culture. Films from that era, such as Weird Science, WarGames and Revenge of the Nerds, all shared the narrative of the nerdy boy winning over attractive and passive women with impressive computing skills. Of the few women who ended up in the tech industry, despite never-ending discouragement from parents, teachers and peers, not many stayed for long. The bias against female programmers impacted the number of women in the industry, and by 1995 female college students at Carnegie Mellon University were dropping out of computer science courses at double the rate of men. As you can see, the combined influences of external and internal sources have reverted the tech industry to a male-dominated state. The nerd was the first stereotype to come from the tech industry, but since then others have joined the ranks. The rising popularity of the industry gave rise to the more complimentary term “brogrammer” – a mash-up of “bro” and “programmer.” In combination with the “work hard, play hard” mentality, the tech workplace has become an increasingly unwelcome environment for women. One key piece of evidence for bro culture is that business deals often take place in settings that are uncomfortable and uninviting for women. As crazy as it seems, some meetings take place in hot tubs or at strip clubs. This puts women in a difficult position regarding whether or not to attend. On the one hand, a woman could miss out on, for example, investment opportunities, if she refuses to attend uncomfortable meetings. But on the other hand, if she does attend, she could lose credibility and even risk being objectified or sexually assaulted. To show you just how normalized strip clubs have become in association with business, Yelp employees refer to the Gold Club strip club as “Conference Room G.” The Gold Club is located in Silicon Valley, which, unsurprisingly, has received its fair share of sexual harassment allegations. One such case involves Susan Fowler, a former software engineer at Uber. She reported being propositioned by her boss on her very first day – a claim that HR dismissed as a simple misunderstanding. In 2017, Fowler detailed her experiences on a blog, giving rise to the scrutinization of the entire tech industry’s misconduct concerning female employees. Fowler’s experience highlights the patriarchal structures underpinning the tech industry. This is in stark contrast to the way Silicon Valley sees itself, especially when it comes to sex parties. You might be surprised to hear it, but according to the author, sex parties are very common in Silicon Valley. Because of the idea of a free love, polyamorous culture going mainstream, they’re considered progressive and liberating. The problem is that they’re only considered progressive and liberating by men there. The truth is that they exist to serve male fantasies of dominance while female attendees risk losing respect. This was confirmed by two people: One is a venture capitalist who admitted he probably wouldn't hire a woman he saw at a sex party and the second is a former Google employee who felt she’d become a sexual target once her colleagues found out that she’d attended sex parties. Though there are some prominent women like Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki who’ve made it in tech, their success stories are often regarded as chance opportunities. But when a man succeeds in the tech industry, it is credited to his ability. Women are unfairly considered less competent than men. Just consider how women’s quality of work is doubted much more than work done by men. For instance, women are asked to check their coding more frequently. This is unwarranted. A study by the open-source coding community GitHub even revealed that, when the coder’s gender is withheld, women’s work is approved more often than men’s. Another injustice is that male-led companies receive more financial backing from venture capitalists than female-led ones. In 2016, Fortune magazine reported that investments worth $58 billion went to male-founded businesses. Compare that to the $1.46 billion invested in female-founded ones. The tech industry is structured in a way that suits single men over married people, and especially over mothers. Large corporations such as Google promote a blend of work and social life by providing meals, exercise classes, haircuts and beer-filled fridges to their employees. And until recently, Uber used to serve their evening meal at 8:15 p.m. These workplace structures present a clear indication of when employees are expected to knock off, with an obvious disregard for families waiting at home. Not only is parenthood of little concern to these tech companies, but when you’re a mother, the unfair expectations are even greater. Janica Alvarez, CEO of breast pump company Naya, is often asked by investors how she’ll be able to take care of her children while meeting work demands. Her business partner – who’s also her husband – has never faced such a question. The exclusionary nature of the tech world makes it hard for women to break into it, let alone progress in their careers. In the following blink, we’ll take a deeper look into why there are so few female tech employees. Let’s get one thing clear: Silicon Valley is not conspiring to keep women away. There are, however, some hiring practices that perpetuate the prioritization of men over women. First, though Silicon Valley purports to be based on meritocracy, that’s not actually the case. For example, PayPal was proud of hiring based on merit, even though during its early days the staff consisted mainly of founder Peter Thiel’s friends and acquaintances. Paypal believed that businesses should hire individuals with conforming ideologies. The problem is, if PayPal believes that it selects employees based on merit, while at the same time supporting conformity, then they’ll perceive their non-diverse staff of white, educated men as being the best there is. Furthermore, these false beliefs prevent them from recognizing any biases that need addressing. That said, it is very difficult to change a culture once the status quo has been established. If men make up the majority of staff, then when it comes to referring other employees, they’re likely to call upon other men. In order to help avoid this employee mitosis, diversity advisor Joelle Emerson suggests that companies hire a head of HR to target diversity before there are more than 50 employees. Or, simply follow in Pinterest’s footsteps, which worked to increase diversity by asking for referrals specifically from underrepresented groups. The more mainstream culture marginalizes groups, the harder it is for those groups to be able to – or even want to – enter the industry. The rise of bro culture has gotten so out of hand that Christa Quarles, now the CEO of online restaurant booking service OpenTable, was taken to a strip club during a job interview to see if she would fit in with the culture of the workplace. Not only is this detrimental to the tech employees, but it also has an impact on consumers. If a homogenous group of white men develops a new technology, they’re drastically ill-equipped to consider other perspectives, misogyny and racism possibly attached to their product. Social media platforms are a good example of this. In 2014, female game developers and journalists spoke up about the inherent sexism in video games. The women received death and rape threats for their opinions due to a lack of safeguards on online platforms such as Twitter, which was created by four men. It’s pretty clear that women are treated unfairly in the tech world, but with Silicon Valley producing so many successful companies, what’s the incentive for business owners and investors to disturb the way things have been going? One reason is that inclusivity can improve profit margins. Companies that have worked toward eliminating sexism have seen their customer base grow. Ever since the online multiplayer game League of Legends began to suspend abusive gamers and provide them with detailed explanations as to why they were being banned, the number of monthly users has risen from 67 million to 100 million. Women also make up around 70-80 percent of consumer purchases, so it would make business sense to have services targeted toward women. Google employee James Damore complained that women are not biologically wired to be good at programming because they tend to empathize instead of systemize. Damore’s logic here is flawed: empathy is in fact immensely useful when designing services and products since it allows businesses to understand and target customer’s needs and wants. Another argument for gender equality in the workplace is that companies with diverse leaderships report bigger earnings. According to an International Monetary Fund study that looked at 2 million European companies, those with women in 40-60 percent of leadership roles recorded better financial returns. It also suggested that diversity results in higher rates of creativity and critical thinking due to differing perspectives and approaches. Furthermore, companies with a balanced number of males and females were less likely to go out of business because the average woman is more averse to risk. This supposition is backed up by tech investor Roger McNamee, who suggested that gender balance would lead to fewer company failures. Business leaders should think about this. Just because a certain demographic has been successful, it doesn’t mean that other types of people couldn’t help to further increase success. More diversity leads to more success, and it’s time for tech companies to start becoming more welcoming of women.   The key message in these blinks: History and society have both played an influential role in shaping today’s tech industry into a male-dominated world. The task of improving women’s inclusion within the field isn’t easy, but there are clear opportunities and financial benefits for companies that choose to diversify. Got feedback?

But what can we do to make the world a better place? Well, a great first step is to build a social business. Charity, social entrepreneurship, nonprofit organizations, nongovernmental organizations and so on are all meant to support a good cause – but a social business is something entirely different.  In these blinks, you will learn what a social business is all about and what differentiates it from other social enterprises. You will be given advice on how to come up with a concept for your own social business and how to get it started.  You’ll also learn how poor Bangladeshi people run a bank; why a social business actually should aim for profits; and why capitalism is incomplete without social businesses. You’ve likely already heard of the term “social business”, but what does it really mean? Fundamentally, a social business isn’t based solely on its bottom line. Most businesses, private ones in particular, are all about maximizing profit; on the other side of the coin are nonprofits that rely primarily on philanthropic donations. But a social business is distinct from both. The primary aim of a social business is to solve social, economic or environmental problems. To accomplish this goal, such businesses employ regular business methods like the production and sale of a product or service that makes the venture self-sustaining. For instance, Grameen Danone makes and sells affordable yogurt products loaded with micronutrients, and their overriding goal is to combat malnutrition among children in Bangladesh.  But it’s not quite that simple. In fact, there are two forms of social business: Type I and Type II. A Type I social business produces profits but does not dispense dividends – that is, they don’t regularly pay out a percentage of their profits to the company’s owners.  So, while Type I social businesses are still owned by investors, all the profits are reinvested in the company, resulting in neither a gain nor a loss for the investors. Grameen Danone is an example of one such Type I social business, as they operate without dividends.  On the other hand, a Type II social business operates like a typical for-profit company. However, unlike a Type I social business, it is owned by poor people rather than wealthy investors. As a result, the profits of the business go directly to low-income people and, therefore, serve a social function – namely the alleviation of poverty.  For example, the Grameen Bank is a Type II social business. It’s owned by the poor of Bangladesh and provides loans to low-income citizens.  There’s a lot of confusion surrounding social businesses, and discussions about them are likely to feature terms like social entrepreneurship, NGO, social enterprise and foundation. However, these ventures are all different from social businesses.  For starters, a social business is not the same as social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship is all about one person – the entrepreneur – and his or her idea. So, while such initiatives can have a social impact, they can be driven by non-economic, charitable or business intentions.  So, while the entrepreneur in question might have a social vision, his social entrepreneurship could take many forms and is thus different from a social business – which you now know is an economically stable business with a social mission and no loss or dividends.  Second, contrary to what many may assume, a social business is not a nonprofit organization. Consider a foundation, a type of a nonprofit organization. While they might have a social agenda, they are distinct from social businesses because they’re not economically sustainable; they don’t generate profit or any income, they simply distribute charitable donations.  On a similar note, nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, are also distinct from social businesses, since NGOs are purely non-profit organizations with charitable goals. They run on philanthropic donations and, therefore, lack economic sustainability. Furthermore, they spend much of their time and energy on fundraising, which makes it difficult for them to expand in any sustainable fashion.  So, you’re now interested in a social business, but how can you start your own? That’s what you’ll learn next, and it all begins with forming an idea! Think of a standard, profit-maximizing business. When founding such a company, entrepreneurs generally seek out a gap or niche in the market that they can fill. Their main intention in doing so is to earn as much money as possible.  However, when launching a social business, it’s essential to start by identifying a social issue that you want to solve and are uniquely suited to tackling. As a social business, you’ll by definition be serving a social function, which makes turning a profit a requirement, not a goal, for your enterprise.  So, to identify a social problem, start by asking yourself what is needed in the world and what bothers you most? What causes these needs to arise?  Then ask yourself, considering my skills and talents, can I build a social business that helps solve such problems and fill such needs? For instance, take Cure2Children, which collaborates with the Grameen Healthcare Trust. This social business was founded by a doctor and an entrepreneur who both saw a need for health care in impoverished nations.  Specifically, they saw a need to treat the genetic disease thalassemia, a condition that affects approximately 100,000 children around the world today. Dr. Faulkner, the doctor, learned how to treat thalassemia and the pair had their idea.  After identifying a need, choose the one problem that you think you stand a chance at solving. After all, you can’t save the whole world at once. Keep in mind that you’re new to the game, just learning how to run a social business, and that it’s important to start simply.  After all, if you dive head first into one of the biggest and most complicated problems facing the world, you’ll likely struggle for months or even years just to get up and running.  Now that you’ve got an idea, the next step is to secure funding. But how exactly? Well, it’s important to come up with a reasonable business plan to attract potential investors. This plan should include a detailed five-year budget and forecast for operationalizing the business, complete with both cost and revenue structures.  In addition, the budget you generate should show that your idea is viable: revenue should cover all costs and preferably leave you with a small surplus for rainy days.  But it’s also important to demonstrate that your cash flow is balanced on both a weekly and monthly basis. After all, you might need more cash in April than in August, and if your revenues aren’t balanced enough to account for the difference, your business could be toast by the end of the summer.  Finally, it’s a good idea to build your social business around the structure of a for-profit company. While this might seem surprising at first, here’s why it’s actually very helpful: Social businesses are not currently recognized as a legal category of business, which means that you will likely be stuck with running a for-profit company that makes a social goal the core of its operations. However, social businesses operating under this structure risk lawsuits, as some countries have laws that require for-profit businesses to maximize profits for their owners.  While this risk can be reduced by having your investors sign a document certifying that they cannot receive profit beyond their original investment, the approach is still not ideal. Then again, this solution is better than using the structure of a nonprofit, since such organizations are heavily scrutinized due to the tax exemptions they enjoy.  As World War II was finally coming to a close, global prospects appeared bleak. Poverty and hardship were widespread across the globe.  As the years passed, capitalism advanced, resulting in positive changes for many – but not for everyone at once. In the decades since the Second World War, many economies have done extremely well, particularly those of Europe and North America, significantly increasing the wealth and quality of life of hundreds of millions of people. But still more people were left impoverished in the wake of this boon.  So, in attempting to address the gap between the rich and poor, the United Nations set the Millennium Development Goals, which included the aim of cutting the global poverty rate in half. What followed were great improvements for the poor.  For instance, in 1991, the poverty rate in Bangladesh was 57 percent, but by 2005 it was as low as 40 percent. While this number is still too high, it continues to drop by about two percent annually.  But beyond that, it’s clear that the current capitalist system is failing. Just take the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, in which a food crisis struck, leaving millions of people starving. The prices for rice, corn and wheat had gotten too high for poor people to afford. Such crises are a direct result of a world system that doesn’t take into account the needs of all people, but instead only the lucky, wealthy few.  And that’s why social businesses are so essential. Social businesses don’t disregard the capitalist system, but add the important aspect of doing social good to the work of sustaining a business. Just take the social business Grameen Veolia Water, or GVW, a joint venture of Grameen and Veolia Water.  GVW strives to increase and improve access to clean drinking water in rural parts of Bangladesh. For instance, in the village of Goalmari, they provide clean and affordable water to approximately 20,000 people! The key message in this book: Social businesses are a distinct type of company that make the world a more equitable place. These businesses place a social, economic or environmental goal at the core of their operations by letting go of the demand to turn a profit for investors.  Actionable advice: Ask around to find a problem to solve: If you’re having a hard time deciding on an idea for your social business, just try bouncing ideas off people. Keep asking yourself who you think needs help and remember that it could be anyone from the disabled to children or the elderly. Simply by talking with people about the problems they encounter, you’re sure to find something deserving of your attention.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

After all, where else could he have found out what the launch of the world’s ugliest car, a wink from a General Electric company executive, and the fall of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain have in common? These and the other events described in this book represent several major developments in US business history, the repercussions of which can still be felt today. They paved the way for things like the end of insider trading and an employee’s right to work for whomever he or she pleases. In these twelve exciting and surprising case studies, you’ll find: how Wall Street almost killed off Piggly Wiggly, why shareholder meetings of large companies are usually a complete farce, and how a misinterpreted wink landed some GE executives in court. How much can a person miss in three days? Well, if you happened to be a stock market investor who fell into a three-day coma on May 28, 1962, you might have woken up to almost no noticeable change in your investments, but you also would’ve slept straight through the chaos of the 1962 Flash Crash. This three-day turmoil neatly illustrates how bizarre the behavior of Wall Street bankers can be, and how investors are guided more by their mood than actual facts. On May 28, 1962, the mood on Wall Street was distinctly glum after six months of stock market decline. There was a lot of trading going on that morning, and the central office was running late in updating stock prices, as this was done manually. Investors panicked when they realized they could only know a stock’s true price with a time lag of some 45 minutes, by which time they assumed the true price had fallen. Consequently, they rushed to sell off their shares, which created a downward spiral in prices. Their expectations became self-fulfilling, causing a crash that annihilated $20 billion in stock value. But just as emotions triggered the crash, they also helped move along the recovery: investors considered it common knowledge that the Dow Jones Index, which measured the value of the general stock market, could not go below 500 points. So when the value came close to that limit, a buying panic broke out as everyone expected prices to go up. Three days after the crash, the market had fully recovered. After this bizarre event, everyone was searching for rational explanations. But all stock exchange officials could come up with was that the government needed to pay more attention to the prevailing “business climate,” i.e., the mood and irrational expectations, of the financial market. This inherent irrationality translates into the market’s unpredictability. In fact, the only thing that can be predicted about the market is, to quote famous banker J.P. Morgan: “It will fluctuate.” Have you ever heard of the Ford Edsel? Originally intended to be Ford’s flagship product in the late 1950s, the car not only ended up being one of the most spectacular product failures of all time but is also frequently cited as one of the ugliest cars ever made. How could a company as successful as Ford fail so dismally? For one, it completely miscalculated the market. In 1955, the American automobile market was booming. Families’ disposable income was increasing and people were becoming more interested in medium-priced cars, a segment in which Ford was weak. That’s when the company started planning the Ford Edsel. Unfortunately, by the time the Edsel was launched in 1958, the market had done a 180: an economic downturn and an abrupt change in consumer tastes had made people flock to smaller and cheaper car models. A second reason for the failure was that customers had unrealistic expectations for the car. Ford had spent $250 million on planning the Edsel, making it the company’s most expensive project up to that point – a fact that Ford promoted extensively in its marketing. This created a lot of buzz around the project, so when the Edsel was finally launched, consumers were expecting something revolutionary. However, they were disappointed to see that the Edsel was just another four-wheeled automobile after all. The third and final strike for the Edsel was its shoddy build. Since Ford had spent most of its efforts on carrying out psychological research to make the car appealing to its target group (i.e., young families with a disposable income), it neglected to fine-tune the technical side of the car. Consequently, once the product launched, customers found several faults, ranging from unreliable brakes to a jumpy acceleration. Although the Edsel might not have been a completely useless car in the end, it just couldn’t live up to its expectations. Warren Buffett is one of the richest people on the planet, and yet he admits that his tax rate is lower than his secretary’s (whose income, naturally, amounts to far less than his). Sound like a cruel joke? Well, it’s the perfect example of how unfair the US federal income tax system is. To understand how it got so bad, let’s examine the increasingly twisted development of the system since its inception. In 1913, after decades of political debate and fears that it was tantamount to socialism, the federal government began to levy an income tax. The reason was that its own income stream had run dry while its expenses were increasing. Initially, income tax rates were low and the main contributors were the richest citizens. Since then, rates have been raised continually and the application of the tax expanded to larger swathes of the population and, at the same time, more and more loopholes were created for the rich. These days, the income tax rates are generally quite high and have the greatest effect on the middle-class population. The way the tax is structured today encourages inefficiency. For example, freelancers will often stop taking on new contracts mid-way through the year just to not earn more income because, from a tax perspective, it makes more sense than earning more. What’s more, the complicated system of loopholes has made enforcing taxation a battle. The Internal Revenue Service, which collects the tax, must annually contend with an army of citizens’ tax advisers and lawyers whose speciality is circumventing the tax code. This is a colossal waste of human resources on both sides. Unfortunately though, tax reform is politically unfeasible. Multiple presidents have tried to reform the tax code into something simpler, but all have failed. The current system simply favors too many rich people with too much influence, and they don’t want to relinquish their advantages, such as capital gains being taxed less than salary income. So what’s the solution? The federal income tax system needs to be reset back to its 1913 state so we can try again. Imagine your uncle works for an oil company and he calls you up one day to tell you to invest in his company’s stock, as they’ve just struck oil and will only announce it tomorrow. Sounds like, if you bought the stock, you could end up doing time for insider trading, right? That would hold true today, but it wouldn’t necessarily have been that way before the Texas Gulf case. In 1959, a mineral company called Texas Gulf Sulphur hit the jackpot in the wilderness of Ontario, Canada. Their preliminary test drilling indicated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of copper, silver and other minerals in the ground. The people who knew about the find decided to keep quiet about it, stealthily buying shares in Texas Gulf. And as executives and other people in the know began buying shares, they instructed their relatives to do the same. When rumors spread that the company may have discovered something substantial, Texas Gulf held a press conference to actively downplay the hearsay and spread disinformation – as its own executives continued to buy shares. When the company finally announced the news about its find, the price of the shares skyrocketed and everyone who had bought the company’s stock got very wealthy. While this behavior wasn’t considered ethical, even by Wall Street standards, insider trading laws hadn’t ever been properly enforced before. This time though, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action: it charged Texas Gulf with deception and insider trading. This unprecedentedly bold step angered many investors. At the trial, the court had to decide whether or not the results of the test drilling had made the value of the find clear, and whether the company’s subsequent pessimistic press releases were deliberately misleading. In the end, the court issued a guilty verdict along with a statement that the public needs to be afforded a “reasonable opportunity to react” to any news that will affect share prices before company insiders can start trading shares. From then on, insider trading has been regulated and Wall Street has become a little cleaner. In the early 1960s, the automatic copy machine was a huge hit and the product’s developer, Xerox, suddenly became the market leader. But, within just a few years, the company experienced a huge downfall. Let’s take a look at Xerox’s rollercoaster ride in three stages. First, there was initial success against all the odds. Traditionally, people weren’t interested in copying documents because they felt like they were stealing original content. What’s more, the process was expensive, since the first copy machines would only run on specially treated paper. So when Xerox launched its first plain-paper photocopier in 1959, nobody expected a high demand for the product. The company’s founders even went so far as to discourage their friends and family from investing in the company. Yet in just six years, the company’s revenues had skyrocketed to $500 million. Second, there was sustained period of success. Xerox became so confident that it started investing heavily in philanthropy. As is fairly typical for an overnight success, the owners wanted to show their gratitude to those who had helped them and use their newly acquired position to influence society. For example, Xerox became the second-largest donor to the University of Rochester, which had originally helped develop photocopying technology. What’s more, the owners seemed to care a great deal for the United Nations. In 1964, they spent $4 million on a television campaign supporting the UN after it came under public attack by right-wing politicians. In the third stage, Xerox was forced to see how quickly success can turn into defeat. Shortly after reaching the peak of its glory in 1965, Xerox realized it was in trouble. The technological lead it had over competitors had diminished as they were producing cheaper copycat products. What’s more, new investments into research and development were ineffective, which left the company stranded. These three stages are a poignant example of the many stages a growth company can potentially go through. Luckily for Xerox, it survived the third stage and is still successful today. In late 1963, the brokerage company Ira Haupt & Co. was in trouble. It no longer had sufficient capital to trade in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and its membership had to be revoked. The reason for this predicament was that the brokerage, which traded in commodities, had made a disastrous deal. It had bought cottonseed and soybean oil to be delivered at a later point in time and used the warehouse receipts as collateral to borrow money from the bank. Unfortunately, it turned out that the receipts had been doctored and the oil did not actually exist. Ira Haupt & Co. was suddenly the victim of large-scale commercial fraud and unable pay back the massive debt. After meeting with several banks, shareholders and the NYSE, it was found that Ira Haupt & Co. needed $22.5 million to become solvent again. To make matters worse, the entire nation was in a panic: President Kennedy had just been shot and the market was declining. But instead of letting Ira Haupt & Co. go bankrupt, the NYSE did something unprecedented: they saved the brokerage. The NYSE worried that the bankruptcy of Ira Haupt & Co. in a time of national panic would cause people to quickly lose faith in their investments and send Wall Street into a crash. They felt that the nation’s welfare depended on the survival of the brokerage, so they worked with the NYSE member firms and the brokerage’s creditors to hammer out a plan for Ira Haupt & Co. to pay back its debts. The NYSE itself pledged $7.5 million, almost a third of its total reserves. Together with other lenders it managed to save Ira Haupt. It is unlikely that we’ll ever see the NYSE make such a bold move ever again, but at the time it prevented a financial crisis in the heat of national panic. These days, whenever a company is mired in a scandal, they’ll claim that nobody did anything wrong – that the true culprit is “communication problems.” For example, if a company dumps toxic waste into an aquifer, it’s not out of greed, but because “The board failed to properly communicate the new environmental strategy to the local managers.” One case where this claim was put to the test was in the late 1950s when General Electric (GE) engaged in large-scale price fixing. No fewer than 29 electronics companies colluded to fix prices of $1.75 billion worth of machinery sold, with over a half a billion dollars coming from public institutions. The fixing could typically cost the customer as much as 25 percent more than normal price. When it turned out that GE was the ringleader of the price fixers, the scandalous matter was brought before the court and a senate subcommittee. Though some managers faced fines and prison terms, no higher level executives were charged. Why not? They claimed it was all due to a communication error: middle managers had misinterpreted their instructions. Apparently, at the time, there were two types of policies accepted at GE: official ones and implied ones. If executives gave you an order with a straight face, it was an official policy you should follow. But if they winked at you as they gave an order, the interpretation was up to you. Typically you were supposed to do the exact opposite of what was said, but other times you had to guess what the executive was implying. And if you failed to deduce what was implied, you’d be the one in trouble. Because of this, even though GE had a policy that forbade discussing prices with competitors, many managers assumed it was mere window dressing. But once they landed in court for the price fixing, they realized they couldn’t blame the executives. This story shows us that executives can, indeed, use communication problems to fend off responsibility for all manner of illegalities. Unless you live in the southern or midwestern United States, chances are you’ve never heard of Piggly Wiggly. Either way, in 1917, it patented the concept of the self-service supermarket. It was the first supermarket to, for example, provide shoppers with shopping carts, put price tags on all the items and have check-out stands. Piggly Wiggly still operates today, but is relatively unknown due to the actions of its eccentric owner Clarence Saunders, who went to great lengths to fight financial speculation. In the 1920s, Piggly Wiggly was rapidly expanding throughout the United States. But when a couple of franchises in New York failed in 1923, some investors tried to take advantage of this by starting a bear raid against Piggly Wiggly. A bear raid is a strategy where investors make investments that only turn a profit if a company’s stock price falls and then do everything in their power to force the price of the stock down. In Piggly Wiggly’s case, they claimed the whole company was in trouble due to the failed New York franchises. Saunders was furious and wanted to teach Wall Street a lesson: he started an attempt to corner Piggly Wiggly’s stock, meaning he wanted to buy back the majority of it. And he almost succeeded. He announced publicly that he would buy all existing stock in Piggly Wiggly and, after borrowing heavily, managed to buy back 98 percent of the shares. This drove up the stock price from $39 to $124 per share: a catastrophe for the bear raiders, who faced enormous losses when the price rose. However, the raiders managed to convince the stock exchange to grant them an extension on paying up. Saunders’ position was not tenable due to his debts, and he eventually suffered such large losses he was forced to declare bankruptcy. If only Saunders would’ve had more influence over the stock exchange, you might be wiggling yourself through the aisles of a Piggly Wiggly instead of shopping at a big box store like Wal-Mart. When a highly influential government bureaucrat jumps over to the business world and leverages his old government connections to make money, many people are likely to accuse him of being a sell-out. But in the case of David Lilienthal, this wouldn’t be an appropriate accusation. In the 1930s, Lilienthal was a good civil servant under the reformist President Roosevelt. Then, in 1941, he was appointed chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, an entity in charge of developing and distributing cheap hydroelectric power in areas that private providers didn’t cover. Later, in 1947, he served as the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, emphasizing the importance of the peaceful civilian use of nuclear power. And, when he finally left public office In 1950, he was honest about his motivation for the move, saying he wanted to make more money so he could provide for his family and save for his own retirement. Once he entered the private sector, Lilienthal also proved himself a committed businessman. His background in energy made him well-suited for the mineral industry and, since he wanted to experience the trials of entrepreneurship, he took over the severely ailing Minerals and Chemical Corporation of America. He succeeded in bringing the company back to life from the brink of failure and earned a small fortune as a result. His new line of work also influenced his own opinions: he wrote a controversial book about why big business is important for the economy and security of the United States. His old government colleagues accused him of being a sell-out, but Lilienthal was merely highly committed to both sides of the coin. Eventually, Lilienthal decided that he wanted the best of both worlds and, in 1955, founded the Development and Resources Corporation, a consultancy that helped developing countries carry out major public works programs. This latest endeavor proves that Lilienthal really is the ideal businessman: accountable in equal measure to both shareholders and humanity. Who do you think are the most powerful people in America? In theory, it should be the stockholders. Especially given the fact that they own the largest corporations in America and these giant companies wield such great power in American society that many political scientists have suggested that the United States resembles an oligarchic feudal system more than a democracy. These major corporations are always led by a board of directors elected by the shareholders, giving the shareholders the true power. Once a year, shareholders come together for an annual meeting in order to elect the board, vote on policies and question the executives who run the company. But, far from being the dignified, serious events you might imagine, these meetings are generally a complete farce. That’s because the company’s management doesn’t really feel that the shareholders are their bosses. They make it hard for shareholders to come to meetings by holding them far away from the company’s headquarters. At the meetings, they try to to keep the shareholders from getting involved by droning on about the company’s great performance and future. This tactic works with most shareholders. The only thing that makes these meetings interesting are the professional investors who challenge the company board and management into a debate. One comic example was seen in AT&T’s 1965 shareholders’ meeting, when investor Wilma Soss berated the chairman of the board Frederick Kappel and even suggested he see a psychiatrist. Professional investors like Soss often own stock in many companies and thus want to hold them accountable for their actions. In this case, Soss was fighting to get more women on the board of directors. But trying to rouse apathetic investors is a thankless job: there is nothing more passive and compliant than a small investor who is fed dividends regularly. If shareholders only wielded their power more often, company management could not simply do as they please. If one day you were to receive a highly tempting job offer from a competitor of your current employer, you’d be able to accept it, right? Actually, your right to do so was not always so clear, and you have a research scientist named Donald Wohlgemuth to thank for setting the precedent that allows you to do as you please. In 1962, Wohlgemuth managed the space suit engineering department of the aerospace company B.F. Goodrich Company. The market for space-related products was growing fast during the race for the moon, and Goodrich was the market leader in space suits. At the time, though, the company had just lost the contract for the now famous Apollo project to its main competitor International Latex. So when Wohlgemuth received an offer from International Latex to work on the prestigious Apollo project with more responsibility and a larger salary, he accepted without delay. But when Wohlgemuth told his superiors at B.F. Goodrich that he was leaving, they feared that he would divulge the secrets he had learned about space suit production. Due to this fear and the fact that Wohlgemuth had originally signed a confidentiality agreement, B.F. Goodrich then sued Wohlgemuth. When the controversial matter went to court, two key questions of near-philosophical nature arose: If someone hasn’t ever broken an agreement or shown the intention of doing so, can action be taken against them on the assumption that they will? Should someone be prohibited from pursuing a position that would tempt them to commit a crime? In a groundbreaking decision, the judge ruled that while Wohlgemuth clearly was in a position to harm Goodrich by sharing what he knew, he could not be found guilty of it preemptively, and so was free to enter into employment with International Latex. This decision formed the precedent for similar rulings, making it a great victory for employee rights. In the 1960s, of all the currencies of the world, the British pound sterling was perhaps one of the most prestigious due to its old age and high value. So when the pound came under attack from financial speculators in 1964, central bankers around the world felt obliged to defend it. The roots of the attack go back to the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, when the major economies of the world decided to build an international monetary exchange system where all currencies were exchangeable at fixed rates. This meant that, to maintain these fixed rates, governments had to often intervene in the currency exchange market by buying or selling currencies. In 1964, Britain found itself in economic difficulties: it was running a large trade deficit. Currency speculators believed that Britain could not keep up the fixed currency exchange rates and would be forced to devalue the pound. Consequently, they started betting against the pound in the market: they wanted its value to fall. Faced not only with the threat to the prestigious pound sterling but also to the international monetary exchange system itself, a broad alliance of monetary policy makers led by the US Federal Reserve mounted a defense. They started to buy pounds to counteract the pressure to devalue the currency. Initially, it seemed as if the tactic was working, and the first waves of attacks were fended off. But the speculators were persistent, continuing their attacks for years. Finally, in 1967, the alliance could not afford to buy more pounds, and Britain was forced to devalue the currency by over 14 percent. In hindsight, the war over the valuation of the pound sterling was merely the first sign of the inherent shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system, which would come to an end just four years later in 1971.

We all have varying degrees of knowledge about what capitalism is, but its history and how we got to where we are today aren’t as well known. From why it first took in England, or how it led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, capitalism’s influence on humanity throughout its 200-year history cannot be understated. And by combining capitalism’s history with an understanding of its basic mechanism of using money to make more money, we can begin to predict how it might affect humanity in the future. Although capitalism was initially restricted to Europe and North America, the fact that its implications are now omnipresent in nearly every corner of the world makes the understanding of it more pertinent than ever. In these blinks, you’ll find out how capitalists use money to make more money; why refugees helped capitalism come about in England; and what the subprime mortgage crisis is, and how it helped cause the Great Recession. The majority of the world runs, to varying degrees, on capitalism. But while there is no monolithic form that governs everyone who lives under a capitalist system, there are a number of common principles that all varieties of capitalism share. Put simply, capitalism’s most characteristic feature is the investment of money to make more money. This sort of invested money is known as capital. Those who use money in this way are capitalists, and the excess money made out of this process is profit. Capital can be anything that can somehow be transformed into money. Take homeowners, for example. They can choose to sell their homes for money, rent it out to others, or use it as collateral for a mortgage. Another characteristic of capitalism is its reliance on wage labor. Combined with capital such as machines, buildings and raw materials, labor is necessary for the production of goods and services. In return for their work, laborers receive wages from employers. Wage labor isn’t only important for production under capitalism, however – it’s integral to capitalist consumption. As individual workers cannot produce all the goods or services they might require, such as food, or a place to live, they have to purchase it. This drives demand for the goods and services resulting out of capitalist production, thus providing jobs for wage laborers in the first place! Wage labor therefore constitutes a fundamental interaction between capitalist production and consumption. Finally, capitalist consumption and production all take place within the confines of capitalist markets.  Unlike in pre-capitalist times where much of humanity only consumed what they produced – and produced what they themselves consumed – today’s dynamic capitalist markets allow the consumption and production of practically anything, as long as there is demand for it. Markets can take the form of the traditional marketplace, grocery store or, more recently, online spaces, where people buy and sell goods electronically. Within markets, capitalists seeking to make more profit than others generates competition. This is a key tenet of capitalism. Competition can take many forms, including cost reduction. One way of reducing costs is to lower workers’ wages. Another might be to increase innovation through creating machines that can replace human labor. By lowering costs, capitalists can sell their products for less money than their competitors, thus generating more profit for themselves. While it’s true that capitalism in its modern industrial form first became fully-fledged in nineteenth-century England, its roots can be found in medieval Europe. It’s impossible to identify a single cause behind the advent of conditions that allowed for capitalism in Europe. However, one determining factor that brought together various possible causes was the lack of a cohesive and all-dominating elite throughout the continent. Unlike in the advanced societies of, say, the Roman Empire, or China’s medieval imperial dynasties, medieval Europe’s political fragmentation laid the groundwork for capitalism, particularly through its feudalism and multi-state structure. European feudalism allowed for the development of markets and wage labor – both key features of capitalism – in ways that slave-based societies or self-sustaining peasantries couldn’t. This was because economic producers were more flexible under feudalism. As opposed to slaves, producers had a limited amount of freedom but, unlike self-sufficient peasantries elsewhere, they had to provide a surplus to their feudal lord. This meant that feudal societies were able to make comparatively easy transitions to capitalism. The surpluses that feudal peasants paid their lord was simply replaced by the payment of money. This, of course, meant peasants needed to make money as wage laborers. Europe’s multi-state structure was also a condition that helped capitalism develop later on. With multiple jurisdictions ruling over a relatively small continent, entrepreneurs could move from place to place depending on where entrepreneurial opportunities were more fruitful. This multi-state structure was even more important when it came to refugees escaping the Counter-Reformation in the sixteenth century. Refugees who fled to England from countries like Belgium and France brought financial innovations with them, and these innovations formed part of the foundation for capitalism in England to thrive. One of these innovations constituted the origins of the modern corporation and found its roots in sixteenth-century Antwerp. There, merchants had figured out a method of financing their ventures by spreading risk throughout a large pool of investors. In England, meanwhile, the seeds of capitalism were also being sown. In the sixteenth century, large enterprises in areas like coal mining, and massive growth in the small-scale production of clothing and household goods meant that wage labor was becoming increasingly widespread and, with it, the consumption of goods in competitive markets. All of these conditions would create a fertile ground for the growth of capitalism in nineteenth-century England. As schoolchildren, most of us learn about the progress made during the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We’re told how it was responsible for so many of the technological breakthroughs we’re completely dependent on today, such as mass transport and electricity. But central to industrialization was the advent of industrial capitalism. And it began in England. In the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, capitalism was anarchic in its nature. Levels of production and consumption were expanding so rapidly that state regulators found it hard to keep up with regulating markets, and organized labor found it hard to keep up in terms of organizing in opposition to their capitalist managers. The newly empowered and rapidly wealth-accumulating capitalist class embraced the lack of regulation in this environment as it meant they were free to develop their entrepreneurial endeavors – and increase their profit – with little interference from the state. These sorts of beliefs went hand in hand with the increasingly trendy philosophy of liberalism, which placed the freedom of both individuals and markets as paramount to human liberty. Meanwhile, amongst this anarchic environment, new cities, factories, roads and railways were springing up at lightning speed. But lack of state interference was ironically creating much more interference than capitalists had bargained for. The unregulated market forces that kept wages down and prices up were having a dehumanizing impact on wage laborers’ lives. This lead to rioting, strikes and public disorder. What’s more, machine breaking becoming commonplace. All of these things disrupted capitalist production. Slowly but surely, radical labor movements became more organized and demanded rights for their members, challenging the dogma of unregulated capitalism. By the mid-nineteenth century, anarchic capitalism began giving way to a more managed form as the state stepped in to restore order by imposing more market regulation. Key to this period was the awakening of class consciousness. This was exhibited by mass workers’ parties, increasingly balanced relations between employers and unions, and the state’s intervention in regulating the economy. To give laborers more control over their lives and work, for example, voting rights were extended to all men in 1867. The founding of the modern welfare state was also key to the success of this more managed form of capitalism. Social policies that make up the norm of modern Britain, such as free healthcare and secondary education, were put into law in the 1940s. Before then, it was the market that set a price on healthcare and secondary education. While the market still had a role to play, the state had in fact managed to reel in the more dehumanizing aspects of the earlier anarchic forms of capitalism. This form of state-managed capitalism would improve living conditions for millions. But all this would begin to change in the 1980s. In the 1970s, state-managed capitalism began to run into trouble. One of the main reasons for this was the rapid increase of international competition. The growth of free trade meant that capitalist enterprises, now faced with competitors around the world, had to find ways to further reduce costs. This involved lowering wages, outsourcing production to countries with cheaper labor costs, or replacing workers with increasingly productive machines. All of this was disastrous for employer-union relations, and governments found it increasingly difficult to resolve industrial disputes and regulate markets that were becoming more globalized. When governments failed to resolve such issues, they began to lose the support of the public, and faced electoral defeat. If governments themselves couldn’t compete against international market forces, they would have to try and embrace them. Another factor contributing to the demise of managed capitalism was a shift in public opinion of individual rights. Whereas collectivist concerns such as social welfare and equality had once dominated political discourse, these began to be replaced by concerns for the individual’s well-being. Instead of being more concerned with low unemployment rates, the mood was shifting toward favoring lower tax rates and prices. Both of these factors came together to form a perfect storm that managed capitalism couldn’t withstand. With the election of the Conservatives in Britain led by Margaret Thatcher in 1979, a new, remarketized neoliberal capitalism slowly began to engulf the world. It heralded a return to capitalism’s more anarchic beginnings. Thatcher’s government quickly went about dismantling managed capitalism. Unions and employers were no longer consulted on political policy. Furthermore, unions’ abilities to organize were severely restricted, and any defiance of these new limitations was punished by stripping unions of their assets. Thatcher also began to inject market forces by privatizing nationalized industries. As a result, by 1992, two-thirds of British state-run companies had been put into private hands. Thatcher’s neoliberalism changed the political landscape in such a way that even the British Labour Party adopted it as their overall philosophy. The Labour government under Tony Blair in the 1990s and 2000s, for example, continued Thatcher’s remarketization of British healthcare by allowing private financing of hospital construction and restructuring hospitals into corporate-like foundations. While this new world of neoliberal capitalism allows for increased consumer choice and individual freedom, its decimation of public services means that people’s lives are less secure. For example, without empowered unions, laborers struggle with job security. And with the sale of public housing to the private sector, rental costs are much more susceptible to brutal market forces. As neoliberalism became the ruling capitalist model in the UK under Margaret Thatcher, the same international market forces and increased individualism caused neoliberal dominance elsewhere. Sweden, for example, also succumbed to neoliberalism, albeit less so than in the UK. The Swedish Social Democratic Party governed from 1932 to 1976 and, by doing so, established an omnipresent welfare state, high taxes and relatively healthy labor-employer relations. This meant that Sweden had one of the most managed capitalist systems in the world. But, as in the UK, problems began to emerge in the 1970s. With the rise of international competition and global economic integration, as well as a burgeoning individualist ideology, industrial conflict increased and the egalitarian collectivism that had allowed for high taxes and expansive welfare programs decreased. The time was ripe for remarketization. So it happened. And it was led not by a Thatcherite party, but by the Social Democrats. In the 1980s, unable to continue funding their expansive welfare programs in the face of international competition, benefits were cut, taxation decreased, the investing of private capital in state-owned sectors was permitted, and the financial sector was deregulated. All of this meant that by 2011, inequality in Sweden grew more than in any other OECD country in recent decades. But, as its capitalism was so well managed before remarketization began, Sweden is still among the most egalitarian countries in the world and is still a top spender when it comes to education and healthcare. The same cannot be said for the US. Even before the swing toward individualism in the 1970s, US society already honored the importance of the individual and entrepreneurial spirit in what is popularly known as the American Dream. Still, a managed capitalism was to be found in pre-1970s America, particularly after the Great Depression of the 1930s. During this time, expansive welfare programs were put into place by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal legislation. Unions were even empowered during this time, and a National Labor Relations Board was set up to allow class compromise between laborers and employers. But, as in the UK and Sweden, this was not to last. Remarketization in the US began under the Reagan administration in the 1980s with expansive tax cuts. Additionally, industries such as air travel, railways, and telecommunications were either deregulated or privatized. The result of this? By the end of the 1980s, income inequality had returned to levels not seen since the 1920s. At the same time, in order to remain competitive in international markets, US manufacturing increasingly moved to cheaper markets such as Mexico. Perhaps most significantly, the remarketization and subsequent deregulation of the American financial sector set the scene for the global crisis that international capitalism has faced since 2007. The remarketization that took place in powerful capitalist economies such as the UK and the US changed the way capitalism in the rest of the world worked. Because of this, in addition to increasing international competition and deregulation, two other factors would come together to create the perfect storm that would be the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession. The first of these was the financialization of capital, constituting a shift toward capital being invested in high-risk and potentially high-profit financial contracts on the stock market as opposed to in the traditional capitalist production of goods and services. Take futures, a financial contract where one commits to buying shares or commodities at their current price at a fixed point in the future. If the price has risen after the fixed period, futures investors can make a profit by selling the shares at this new, higher value. But of course, the value can also go down during this fixed period, leading investors toward a loss. Such high-risk, speculative financial contracts are typical of what British academic Susan Strange terms casino capitalism. And due to intensified financial deregulation since the 1980s, such financial contracts have been able to be easily bought and sold across borders with little government oversight. This financialization of capital contributed to the second factor that would set the 2007-2008 crisis in motion: the excessive growth of debt. The prime example of this is a key component of the American subprime mortgage crisis, where easy credit combined with speculative financial instruments would lead to disaster. So how did it happen? The housing bubble that burst in the mid-2000s had previously guaranteed a safe return on investments into housing. Egged on by big banks with the prospect of hefty commissions and bonuses, mortgage brokers increasingly handed out loans to less worthy creditors. In what became known as subprime mortgages, brokers gave out mortgages to those with bad credit ratings who would previously never have qualified as they had no proof they could pay back their mortgages. These subprime mortgages were then sold off to banks, who subsequently packaged them into financial instruments that would be sold on to larger financial institutions. But as soon as housing prices began to fall, mortgages stopped being paid back, and the whole system began to collapse. Huge financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers had themselves borrowed money from outside the US to cash in on the housing boom, and in the process had acquired debt forty times their capital. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers was no longer able to pay back its debtors. It filed for bankruptcy and set into motion a chain reaction worldwide that would exacerbate the already fragile global economy. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, further bankruptcies followed, faith in investment banks was shattered, and credit became scarcer. The Great Recession was now truly underway – international trade, employment, wages and consumption fell all over the world. The effects of the crisis were hard for anyone to ignore. But sadly, lessons haven’t been learned. The low interest rates put in place after the crisis, while helping to solve economic woes in western nations, have led to increased borrowing in developing countries. In China, Brazil and Turkey, for example, debt-to-GDP ratios have increased far beyond 2007 levels, meaning that something similar to the subprime mortgage crisis might happen again. This begs the question: If the very economic policies that helped avert deepening the 2007-2008 crisis are laying the groundwork for other problems, what can be done to avert further capitalist crises? It won’t be an easy task. When it comes to reforming and regulating banks, not much has been done since 2008. There is the argument that banks will simply move to another less-regulated country if confronted with the prospect of increased regulation and less opportunity for profit. So we may have to accept that crises are an inherent feature of capitalism itself, seeing as capitalists will always seek new ways to make money from novel investments. But for many, this isn’t a sufficient answer. With capitalism’s endless desire for growth being a direct contributor to climate change, for example, reforming capitalism has become an existential issue that humanity will be forced to confront. However, just as in the banking sector, proposed reforms to industries that directly contribute to climate change are met with fierce resistance, as increased regulation leads to decreased short-term profits. Of course, in the not too distant future, disaster stemming from climate change may shut down entire capitalist economies, thus affecting long-term profit. But with the political left at a weak point in its history, viable alternatives to capitalism aren’t obvious. Therefore we’ll have to rely on capitalism’s dynamic nature to help reform its more destructive tendencies. Perhaps a focus on reforming the remarketized, neoliberal capitalisms of the West and pushing for a move back toward its state-managed post-war variants would be a step in the right direction. After all, less neoliberalized regions such as southern and southeastern Asia were much less affected by the Great Recession. Perhaps these dynamic regions will have a large role to play in the future of capitalism. The key message in these blinks: Capitalism is the dominant socioeconomic system the world runs on today. It’s all about investing money to make more money, and relies on a combination of wage labor, competitive markets, consumption and production to function. Although capitalism began in Europe, it has now spread to most of the world. And while its beginnings were fairly chaotic, state intervention managed to regulate capitalism’s state excesses up until the 1980s. The undoing of such intervention led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, and poses questions about how capitalism might continue into the future. Got feedback?

As communism crumbled, politicians and intellectuals of all stripes reached a similar verdict: liberal-democratic capitalism was the only game in town. As Margaret Thatcher famously put it, “there is no alternative.” That’s a view which has been increasingly challenged in the decade since the 2008 financial crash. In the US, self-declared “democratic socialist” Bernie Sanders is one of the frontrunners to lead the Democratic party into the 2020 presidential election. On Amazon, books with titles like Communism for Kids meanwhile race up the bestseller lists. The idea that the state can and should play a role in the economic life of our societies is back in fashion. All that would have worried Milton Friedman, one of the twentieth-century economists most closely associated with the argument that economic freedom is the only guarantor of political liberty. As he saw it, the road to hell really is paved with good intentions. What starts out as a promise to redress market imbalances ends up aiding monopolies, undermining living standards and – paradoxically – increasing inequality. Was he right? Well, that’s something you’ll have to decide for yourself as you read these blinks. Along the way, you’ll learn why government spending doesn’t necessarily lead to economic growth; how a negative income tax could boost social welfare; and why basic education benefits society as a whole but university education doesn’t. Economics and politics are often taught as separate subjects in school. We typically learn that economics is about material well-being, while politics is about individual freedom. Follow that approach to its logical conclusion and you soon end up with the idea that any political system can be combined with any economic system. But that’s a mistake. In reality, you can’t mix the state-led socialist economy of the Soviet Union with the individual political freedoms of the US to create a kind of “democratic socialist” society. Why not? Well, economic and political freedoms are actually interdependent and, if you curtail the former, you also limit the latter. Imagine a hypothetical British holidaymaker in the aftermath of the Second World War set on taking a vacation in the US. As he goes about booking his travel, he realizes he can’t afford the trip, because the government’s capital controls mean that sterling is undervalued relative to the dollar. Now compare that to the case of an American citizen who isn’t allowed to visit the Soviet Union because she holds pro-capitalist views. In both cases, restrictions on economic and political freedoms have the same result: they prevent individuals freely pursuing their own dreams and destinies. That means you need a system that guarantees both the economic and political liberties we need to thrive. That system is called free-market capitalism. Let’s take a closer look at how it works in practice. The most important point is that the government’s role in this ideal society is strictly limited. Its purpose is to guarantee basic law and order rather than infringe upon our individual freedoms. Think of it as setting the rules of the game. Buying and selling is a basic economic freedom, and we’re at liberty to use it as we please. The government, on the other hand, has only one job: to enforce individuals’ property rights and protect them against theft and extortion. When governments restrict themselves to this role, the free market can take care of the rest – how people want to live their lives, what they want to buy and sell and, ultimately, who they want to be. You’ve probably heard politicians arguing that the government needs to intervene in the economy to ensure that it functions properly. You might also have come across the notion that free-market capitalism is inherently unstable and causes financial crises when it’s left to its own devices. Both ideas are popular among advocates of big government, but they’re rooted in bad economics. To understand why, we have to look at where they came from. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, a new consensus emerged. Economists began arguing that boosting government expenditure with an eye to correcting market contractions was the best way of promoting stability. At its most basic, this boils down to a theory promoted by the British economist John Maynard Keynes that every dollar of government spending creates another dollar of increased wealth for private individuals. That’s known as the Keynesian balancing wheel of government spending. There’s just one problem: it doesn’t work in the way it’s supposed to. When private spending decreases, Keynes’ followers claim, the government needs to step in and do their own spending to maintain economic balance. In the real world, however, these programs inevitably take too long to roll out and lead to all kinds of unintended consequences. Drawing down such programs, for example, usually takes just as much time as it did to get them up and running. That means that they’re still in place even after the economy has recovered and people are being taxed to cover a useless policy, thereby sucking value out of the economy. That’s a typical example of the ability of Keynesian economics to solve problems in theory that it can’t tackle in reality. The theory just isn’t capable of creating the conditions for its own success. Take the argument that government spending boosts individuals’ spending. The behavior of large groups of people is so complex that it’s impossible to accurately forecast their actions. Evidence from the Great Depression meanwhile suggests that lots of folks responded to such policies by saving rather than spending money! Spending isn’t the only way governments intervene in markets – there’s also monetary policy. The outcome, however, is the same: the more governments intervene in economic life, the worse the results. Take the Great Depression. The severity of the crisis was amplified by the government’s mismanagement of the money supply via the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. Between July 1929 and March 1933, the money supply dropped by a third. The Federal Reserve, which had a free hand in making policy, actively decided to do nothing. That error transformed what would have been a minor contraction into a full-blown crisis. So what should the Federal Reserve have done? If it had stuck to a much more narrowly defined and specific role – simply maintaining the money supply – the Depression wouldn’t have been nearly as severe. Instead, incomes were halved and prices plummeted by over thirty percent between 1929 and 1933. That means it’s vital to restrict the Federal Reserve’s role in future to prevent repeats of such crises. Rather than giving a small number of bureaucrats the power to determine monetary policy as they see fit, the central government’s role in economic life should be limited to expanding the monetary supply by a fixed, predictable amount each year. That would prevent governmental interference in markets and curtail state lending and investment, thus eliminating the instability caused by the government’s intervention in the economy. A reasonable target would be a 3 to 5 percent expansion annually – a small but ultimately positive amount that should be permanently fixed. Most people agree that governments have a legitimate role to play in education. While it’s true that state education provides society with a productive labor force, governments should restrict their focus to “K-12” schooling – education from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Why? Well, that’s where the neighborhood effect comes in. That’s a way of describing how individual actions affect other people regardless of whether they’ve consented or not. This can be positive or negative. In the case of K-12 schooling, the neighborhood effect is clear: an educated society benefits everyone to a much greater extent than living in an uneducated society. If people couldn’t read, write or do basic arithmetic, social life as we know it would break down. But once you progress beyond the last year of high school, education becomes much more niche and the neighborhood effect no longer applies. At that point, the government should cease to play an active role in education. If, say, someone receives a PhD in a subject like particle physics, it’s no longer clear that this directly benefits society in the same way that basic literacy does. In fact, it mainly helps the individual holder of the degree. It’s hard to justify why the government should tax everyone to fund such educational programs. That said, governments also need to reform the way they cover the costs of K-12 schooling. Currently, children are forced to attend local schools that are maintained and run with funds raised through direct taxation. A better way of doing things would be to create a voucher system in which every family receives an allotted amount of money per child which they could use to pay for a school of their choice. This would force schools to compete with one another in the marketplace rather than relying on government subsidies. That wouldn’t just improve efficiency and drive down costs but also create better curricula. Currently, governments determine what children learn, but while there’s plenty of consensus about what young kids should be learning, it isn’t nearly as clear what teenagers ought to study. In a market system, this would be determined by the needs of communities. Schools with the best-suited curricula would attract more students and thereby set a new market standard, which other schools would then follow. Monopolies emerge when companies gain so much control over a given product or service that they can determine the price at which it’s sold rather than the free market. That makes monopolies the ultimate enemy of economic freedom. So how do they arise? The root of the problem is the absence of competition in markets. But let’s define our terms here. In a free-market capitalist economy, “competition” isn’t about mindless rivalry, that is, the desire to beat opponents or drive them out of the market. Rather, it’s about the number of alternatives in economic life. A healthy, competitive economy is one in which individuals have numerous choices about which goods and services they wish to voluntarily exchange. Right, now that we’ve clarified what we mean by competition, let’s take a closer look at monopolies. They generally arise in one of two ways. First off, there are monopolies caused by technical limitations. This covers situations in which having multiple companies in one sector is simply impractical. Think of water or electricity services, for example. It just isn’t feasible for competing companies to lay their own pipes or cables under every city. These monopolies may be inevitable, but that doesn’t mean they should be run by the government. In fact, it’s better if they’re managed by unregulated, private sector companies. That’s because government monopolies are much less accountable when they don’t play by the rules. No wonder – they’re backed up by state power! Distortionary government assistance like tariffs can also lead to the emergence of monopolies. Take steel tariffs. If a government sets a tariff on foreign steel imports, it eliminates competition in the steel industry as a whole. That creates the perfect conditions for monopolies to develop. The absence of competition meanwhile leads to private collusion as multiple providers join forces to set the price of goods and services. If the US implemented tariffs on foreign steel, US steel manufacturers would only have to collude with one another rather than with their global counterparts. That would substantially lower the bar on monopolistic behavior. In the societies of the past, people were born into a class or caste that determined what kind of work they could do. That meant that it was virtually impossible to earn large amounts of money. Capitalist society is different. Anyone can do any job they please. As a result, people have access to much higher potential incomes. This creates the conditions for social mobility and a wealth of opportunities – features unique to capitalist societies. But if people are to be truly free when it comes to choosing their occupations – and destinies – the government needs to stop policing and redistributing incomes. After all, there’s a good reason why some jobs are more handsomely rewarded than others. Folks who work in difficult or unappealing jobs deserve to be paid more than those in cushier positions. When the government regulates incomes, fewer people will want to do these difficult jobs, causing labor shortages in various economic sectors. So what’s the alternative to such intervention? Well, a good start would be to abolish progressive income taxation and replace it with a flat rate system. The redistribution of wealth through progressive taxes is designed to reduce income inequality and unequal living standards. But here’s the issue: it’s based on a misunderstanding of “equality.” Income redistribution only affects equality of outcome, that is, the size of your paycheck. A genuinely free society, by contrast, emphasizes equality of opportunity, or our equal ability to make something of ourselves through hard work. Redistribution privileges one social group – in this case, the less well-off – over others, and leads to inequality of opportunity. The second upshot of such a policy is that it disincentivizes people who work in difficult, well-paid jobs, thereby undermining innovation. A flat rate system would do away with these problems. Everyone would pay a fixed portion of their income to the government. That wouldn’t just redress inequalities of opportunity – it would likely boost government revenues as it would eliminate the complicated system of loopholes typical of progressive income tax codes. Social welfare programs invariably claim to reduce inequality. Time and again, however, they fail in their stated objectives and actually end up making society less egalitarian. Take public housing. Run by an inefficient bureaucracy rather than efficiency maximizing market forces, public housing programs not only reduce the overall supply of housing, but confine poor people to a small number of dangerous neighborhoods. But that’s not even the worst of it. Social security policies that force people to pay for old age insurance throughout their lives are even more damaging. Why? Two key points stand out. First off, it’s essentially a redistributive tax, since wealthy people will contribute more in absolute terms over the course of their lives. Secondly, it’s extremely paternalistic in its assumption that people can’t be trusted to save enough money for retirement on their own. Both of these factors make such policies unacceptable for freedom-loving capitalists. Rational adults shouldn’t be treated like children who can’t take care of their own interests! That means that it’s time for governments to scrap these inefficient, taxpayer-funded welfare programs. They should be replaced with a negative income tax to help reduce the burden on the poorest members of society. Here’s how it would work. All government welfare schemes would be abolished. Anyone who failed to earn a minimum level of income would instead receive a direct cash payment from the government. This would alleviate poverty in the most efficient way possible, since it would streamline government and do away with the need for expensive bureaucratic departments to oversee welfare programs. Taxpayers, meanwhile, wouldn’t need to pay nearly as much of their income into the system, thereby increasing the productive circulation of money in the economy. It’s also important to remember that rolling back the state wouldn’t leave a vacuum – after all, there are charities and philanthropists. In fact, privately run charities subject to market pressures are often much more effective and agile in providing help than slow and inefficient government departments. Most importantly, allowing individuals to choose how they spend their excess income would preserve their individual freedom – something that egalitarian, progressive income taxation systems simply can’t do. The key message in these blinks: Milton Friedman’s classic text on economic and political liberty is premised on the idea that society has become overly fixated on egalitarianism and that this has undermined freedom. Expensive and cumbersome governmental attempts to intervene in the economy and redistribute resources, he argues, aren’t just extraordinarily wasteful – they also lead to all sorts of unintended outcomes. Restraining the state and giving people more choice, Friedman concludes, will ultimately produce the best outcomes: economic stability, individual liberty and protections for the least well-off that actually work.

It is a detailed analysis of what is going wrong in the world, and what we have to do to fix it. Cheap takes you on a journey from America’s giant shopping malls and outlets to low-wage factories in East Asia. The author explains how we have destroyed quality, durability and craftsmanship, and exchanged them for an easy and cheap hit. In these blinks you’ll learn why low prices are harming our economy and culture; why people take it upon themselves to drive ridiculously long distances to buy cheap, poor quality products; why we feel compelled to buy bargain-basement items even though we know they are not worth our money; and how pricing experts manipulate us to make us buy more than we want. Two centuries ago, if you wanted to buy a dress you wouldn’t go to an urban superstore, but instead head to the nearest seamstress and have it made. If you wanted some milk, you’d go to the local farm, not the shop on the corner. Needless to say, everything about the way we shop has changed since then. Why? Well, it began with the invention of mass-production. Mass-production was first developed to manufacture weapons. Before the Industrial Revolution, guns were time-consuming to produce: A gunsmith had to manufacture each individual piece, and the finished product was always prone to misfiring. Simeon North, an American entrepreneur, was the first to come up with a way to mass-produce high-quality guns. He split up the production process by having several semi-skilled workers make the different interchangeable parts, rather than having one man make the entire gun. This increased the quality of the guns, and made them much faster to produce. This new style of manufacturing and the development of factories led to many other changes in society. More and more people left their villages and migrated to cities, where there were more work opportunities in mass-production. This urbanization, in turn, further accelerated the development of that mass-production. In traditional villages people knew the members of their communities, so they knew who made or produced what they were buying. In cities, however, residents needed a constant supply of cheap goods, like food or clothes – and there wasn’t a local farm where they could buy their milk. The economy had to change as drastically as production and society itself to accommodate these swift developments. Before the Industrial Revolution, each product was the result of someone’s backbreaking labor. Things we take for granted today – such as stoves or wheels – were very expensive and difficult to produce. Thanks to a few entrepreneurial pioneers, we eventually adopted shopping in convenient and cheap stores. There was an increased demand for a new kind of store as cities kept growing. People needed easier access to their products, and an entrepreneur named John Wanamaker created one of the earliest department stores, Oak Hall, in Philadelphia. Oak Hall was based in a large space, and sold mass-produced clothing at a range of prices that appealed to people from various economic classes. It was highly successful. Wanamaker even used Oak Hall to invent some new shopping traditions, like the first January White Sale, where products were sold at cheaper prices to prevent the inevitable post-Christmas drop off in sales. Other entrepreneurs, such as Frank W. Woolworth, soon followed suit. Woolworth opened stores that offered inexpensive goods, but economised by providing less attention to customers than smaller shops had traditionally offered. Pioneers like Wanamaker and Woolworth ended up changing the way prices and customer service worked. Workers interacted very differently with shoppers in superstores, malls and discount shops. Previously, shop clerks had been highly educated, and they often knew their customers quite intimately. By contrast, sales clerks in the new stores received only brief training, and any interaction with customers was supposed to be done as quickly as possible. Stores also introduced price tags, shopping cards and cashiers to speed up the shopping process. A few decades ago, economists developed a model of the perfect shopper: Homo economicus. Homo economicus was an utterly rational man who made logical choices. But he doesn’t exist. Our brains are simply not wired to always act rationally. We often make illogical decisions when looking for a bargain, for instance. Have you ever done something like driving five miles to a convenience store because its cheese is nine cents cheaper than the cheese at the store by your house? Rationally, you spend more money traveling than you save on the cheese. That still might not stop you, however. Why? Well, we make irrational decisions like this because our brains seek to avoid loss – whether that means clinging to a bad relationship or wasting gas to save money on cheese. Humans actually rely far more on morality than rationality when making decisions. This is a legacy of our evolution. Experiments have shown that monkeys have the same tendencies as we do. Capuchin monkeys, for instance, have a strong understanding of fairness. If a capuchin monkey is given a cucumber, it’ll happily eat it. However, if it sees that another monkey is given a grape, it’ll start screaming and throw away the cucumber because it knows a grape is a better treat. It feels it’s been cheated. Humans behave in the same way. If we think someone is treating us unfairly, we get upset. We won’t buy a product if we think the price is unfair, even if it’s actually reasonable. Behavioral studies have shown that when we make decisions about shopping, we’re much more guided by morality and experience than logic or economics. Like the monkeys who throw away their cucumbers, we don’t want to feel that someone is ripping us off. When you go to the supermarket or mall, you’ll see the same price levels over and over again. We’re so used to prices like $9.99 or $109.99 that we don’t stop to wonder how the sellers choose those exact amounts. Pricing is very complex. In fact, it has it’s own field of study within economics, and human behavior plays a major role. Our brains are much more comfortable with numbers like one, two, five and ten, because we have ten fingers and five on each hand. Young children, for instance, can multiply one, two, five and ten much more easily than any other numbers. Pricing experts know how to exploit this. We wouldn’t question why a new computer is $999.99 instead of $1,000. We just accept that $1,000 is an understandable price, and $999.99 is only a cent below it. However, we would start questioning the price if it was $968.54. We’d wonder how the shop calculated such a strange amount. Prices can influence us into making completely irrational decisions. Have you ever gone into a shop just to pick up some milk, but ended up buying some hairpins because they were only 99 cents? Or maybe it was a new sponge for 59 cents? You find yourself thinking you might as well buy these small things, because you might need them later, or you might not find a deal like that again. We’ve all experienced this – it’s exactly what retailers want. There’s a reason those hairpins are 99 cents rather than a dollar. It makes us feel like we’re getting a good bargain, even if we aren’t. We get fooled easily in the moment when we see these sorts of prices. Even if we don’t really need the hairpins or the sponge, we’ll buy them anyway without much thought. Have you ever bought something you knew you didn’t need just because it was cheap? Did you think something like, “Well, I wouldn’t normally get this, but now that it's on sale . . . ” You certainly aren’t alone. In the last few decades, we’ve developed a very striking desire to find good deals. When we see a bargain, we’ll go for it, even if we know we don’t need the product. Imagine you buy two cheap plastic bracelets that were on display by the cash register, just because they were a two-for-one special. You know they can’t be high quality, and might break within a few days. But even if someone told you that, or pointed out that the trinkets are worth less than the plastic bag you’re carrying them in, you’ll probably still feel good about them. Your brain will tell you you did well, because you avoided the worst thing – paying the full price. Even though we keep getting more access to cheaper products, we still think we’re paying too much. Most of us buy simple things like laundry detergent or toothbrushes at discount stores every week. Even though we feel good when we find bargains, we still consider the prices to be too high. We’re always demanding that stores lower their prices, and we get upset if they raise them even a tiny amount. This feeling that we’re being cheated by overpriced items is completely wrong. In fact, prices have only declined over time, and we’re paying much less than we did a generation ago, even after the financial crisis. Adjusting for inflation, we’re actually paying about 52 percent less for appliances, 18 percent less for food and 32 percent less for clothes compared to the 1970s. So instead of buying random goods because we think we’re getting a good deal, we should try to understand how pricing and products are changing over time. So now that we’ve seen why we lust after inexpensive goods, let’s see how cheap prices, bad quality and retail culture are hurting us, our economy and our education. Our constant hunt for profits saps creative innovation in the United States. When society focuses on making quick money, we see a decline in creativity. Why? Well, many companies don’t want to spend time and money creating new things, because they aren’t guaranteed to bring short-term profits, and might even bring deficits instead. This is reflected in our education system. Businesses aren’t looking for intelligent workers who value innovation – they just want cheap and disposible employees. This does immense harm to the country: In 1950, 50 percent of all PhDs were conferred in the United States. In 2010, it was only about 15 percent. The quest for cheap goods and high profits is also hurting workers, and taking away their hard-earned rights. The average wages for workers today are so low that their fathers would’ve laughed at them. Americans have been forced to accept much lower salaries because of technological advances and globalization. Firms can now simply transfer their offices and factories to lower-wage countries, so they don’t have to spend as much as they would in the United States. Caterpiller, who make tractors and other heavy equipment, is just one example. In the 1970s and 1980s, Caterpiller set a gold standard for salaries and benefits, but they slashed their wages after being hit by overseas competition. They reduced their hourly pay from about $40 per hour including benefits, to $13–$18, plus only $9 in benefits. The workers were forced to accept this, or the firm would’ve moved abroad. Our culture of cheapness hurts everyone. We all need to work together against it. China wasn’t considered the factory of the world until about 50 years ago. Before then, American goods weren’t produced in countries like India or Bangladesh, but at home. Buying local wasn’t a virtue – it was a necessity. Why? It’s all about shipping prices. If American companies had paid to ship goods from Asia 50 years ago, 20 percent of the total cost of production would have been sunk in transportation. It wasn’t worth it, even though wages were much lower in China. This changed with the introduction of shipping containers, which caused global shipping costs to plummet. Shipping containers reduced delays, theft and spoilage of goods. They also reduced shipping costs by over 90 percent. Moreover, container ships could be managed by a very small crew. Today, you only need about a dozen people for a ship of 6,000 containers, slashing costs. Most dollar stores and other bargain shops owe their very existence to this cut-price shipping. As you might imagine, this has had drastic consequences for people living in countries that produce cheap goods. When companies first began moving their production to low-wage countries, many thought it would bring prosperity to workers there. The opposite has proved true. Many countries, such as China, have deliberately suppressed wages so that overseas capital won’t be deterred from investing still more money. Instead of trying to improve their social systems, or the living and working conditions of people in factories, governments have just exploited the workers even further to improve the market. China’s current society is a combination of capitalism, socialism, feudalism and slavery. So what can we do to fix this mess? It can certainly seem overwhelming, so how can an individual do anything to help? Well, the good news is that everyone can work to make the world a better place. Consumers need to shop more responsibly, and try to stay aware of what they’re supporting with their money, but stores and chains can also contribute. Chains like Walmart are well-known to be horrible places for employees. They have low wages, high turnover rates and long working hours. A few supermarket chains, however, are trying to be more responsible with their products, employees and customers. The chain store Wegmans is one example. They try to keep their prices affordable, but they also spent twice as much on training for their employees as other stores. They offer a wide range of benefits for both their customers and employees. They sell local food, and provide health insurance and a generous retirement plan for their workers. Positive changes can help dismantle harmful ideas and power structures. Instead of going for every bargain you see, look for better quality products. Avoid traveling unnecessary distances for cheaper goods, and be more aware of the consequences other people have to face to bring us our low prices. This might mean that some cheap stores will make less money, or that companies will have to start selling higher quality products. But this is exactly what we need if we’re going to forge a healthier relationship with the things we consume, and better working conditions around the planet. Consider this your wake-up call. Everyone can help by changing the way they shop! The key message in this book: Since the Industrial Revolution, society has become obsessed with producing and consuming cheaper and cheaper products. Big companies trick us into buying things even when we know we don’t need them, and we readily go along with it. Our overconsumption is hurting the planet and our global community. Individuals and companies alike need to start being more mindful with their consumption choices if we want to reverse this change. Actionable advice: Don’t buy those hairpins just because they’re on sale. When you catch yourself absent-mindedly throwing extra things into your shopping cart because they’re cheap and you might need them later – stop. Think about what you really need. Quit buying small things out of habit – that’s exactly what those companies want, and you’re only hurting yourself and others. Be more mindful with your shopping decision, and try to consume only what you truly need.

While this is indeed partly accurate, it is far from the whole story. With a population of well over 1 billion people, China is also a huge market for selling goods, but those who wish to do so must first understand the uniqueness of China’s consumers. In the following blinks, we intend to do just that. You’ll develop a deeper understanding of how the Chinese market and Chinese consumers work, think and act. We will look at what sets China’s consumers apart from consumers in the West and the lessons that anyone hoping to break into the Chinese market needs to understand. You’ll also find out how e-commerce is one field where the Chinese are really the world’s super-consumers; why marketing to Chinese consumers involves more than attracting individuals; and how the West can reach 200 million Chinese customers in 2020 without even going to China. Over the past two decades, Chinese culture has transformed, and the country’s laws have changed along with it. This is big news for foreign firms, as legal structures in China used to hamper consumer culture. These days, however, reforms have resulted in the rapid construction of new department stores and malls across the country. The current context presents a prime opportunity for foreign firms to sell their products. But before your company dives into the Chinese market, it’s important to know about the significant ways that Chinese department stores differ from their Western counterparts. First, Chinese department stores play the role of landlord to retail brands that rent space on a floor and design a miniature store for themselves in that space. By contrast, Western department stores are merchants who hold inventory and do their own merchandising. In the Chinese model, brands act as retailers, which presents a challenge for foreign companies lacking experience in this arena. Second, the Western distinction between wholesale and retail isn’t the norm in China, since no corporate buyers exist in Chinese department stores. Rather, each brand is responsible for determining the product mix to order, delivery, merchandising and staffing. When it comes to Chinese malls, the differences are more subtle but still important. For instance, unlike in the West, where brands and retailers in malls can remain in business despite poor performance, Chinese mall owners can terminate a lease if a retailer underperforms. Not only that but unlike the typical two-level malls of the United States, Chinese malls usually have four to six levels, with the most expensive rents on the first floor and the least expensive on top. The difference is justifiable since foot traffic is dramatically lower on the top levels. Finally, apparel, footwear and accessories tend to sell very well in Chinese malls, while electronics, bedding and home decor fall flat. The reason for this is that in China, malls have become centers of youth culture, just like in 1970s and 80s America. These young Chinese shoppers frequent malls to buy items like clothing that help them shape their identities. It’s no secret that China is rapidly developing in terms of its economy, culture and technology. In fact, transformations that typically occur over five to seven years in more developed economies can happen in just a year in China. And this difference is even more pronounced in the world of e-commerce. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the magazine Focus Money, in China, shoppers make 8.4 online purchases per month compared to just 5.2 in the United States, 4.3 in the United Kingdom and 2.9 in Germany. Not only that, but China now has more online shoppers than the United States has inhabitants! In no small part, this trend is because of the Chinese firm Alibaba, the world’s largest e-commerce company, which has a hand in 80 percent of all online purchases in China. The company utilizes a platform called Tmall, where 135,000 foreign and Chinese brands sell directly to 600 million Chinese consumers. What’s more interesting for American firms is that a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group found that 50 percent of Chinese consumers prefer American products to their Chinese equivalents, and are willing to pay for the difference. As a result, American brands can often sell their products at a premium. That all being said, there are definite drawbacks to the Chinese world of online shopping. For one, brands that sell in China need to register every piece of their intellectual property in the country. If they don’t, they’ll quickly find that another firm has claimed it as their own. China abides by a “first-to-file” rule for intellectual property rights rather than the Western approach of “first-to-use.” And second, the Chinese e-commerce market can be difficult for luxury brands. Just 5 percent of luxury purchases in the country are made online. Consumers are wary of being sold fakes and want to be able to feel and touch the luxury craftsmanship before shelling out the big bucks. So, China is now the world’s largest consumer market, which means foreign firms need to reassess the outdated idea of China as a mere mass producer of low-quality products. More specifically, rather than focusing on manufacturing and exporting their goods to China, foreign companies need to incorporate the six megaprocesses of the supply chain into their strategy. These are planning, buying, making, storing, distributing and selling.  One company that has been exceptionally successful in this regard is the Italian luxury apparel firm, Ermenegildo Zegna. While Zegna enjoyed healthy profits in China in the past, it was only by adapting its entire supply chain strategy that the firm became the single best-selling luxury men’s clothing line in the country. To accomplish this incredible feat, the firm applied analytical approaches and best practices across all six megaprocesses, while staying mindful of the key differences in the Chinese market. It proceeded patiently, gradually opening new stores and building up its brand identity. It also emphasized its top-quality products and service. Having enjoyed a five-fold increase in revenue over just three years shows that it’s clearly doing something right! Many retail companies also struggle with problems in their Chinese supply chains. Their issues tend to be related to things like poor quality products and unpredictable supply. To avoid these problems, you need to have  clear answers to the following questions in relation to your company: First, what’s your strategy for things like procurement, IT, purchasing and managing relationships with suppliers? Second, what processes do you need to execute this strategy? Is the human capital in your organization sufficiently informed about China to carry out this strategy? Third, is the technology your company uses to support these operations sufficiently robust to be used in the Chinese context? And finally, what metrics will you use to measure your success? If you have solid answers to each question, you will vastly improve your chances of having a problem-free supply chain. The first ever Chinese television commercials for cars aired in the 1980s, employing a standardized and boring format; the ads featured a photograph of a car against a blue background with text to the effect of “We are now selling Toyotas. Please call this number.” It’s difficult now to even imagine such ads and, in the current climate, Chinese marketing couldn’t be more different. Today, finding the right message for your target audience is essential, and when it comes to marketing in China, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First off, China comprises many different kinds of markets. Branding and messaging by Chinese companies are focused more on reliability, benefits and value when targeting emerging markets, but more focused on customer relationships and emotional connections when targeting developed ones. A great example is Lenovo, the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China since 2014. The company chalks its success up to its ability to segment Chinese consumers and tailor marketing to each group. To do so, Lenovo varies its branding according to the market it’s targeting, and specifically based on whether the market is mature or emerging. For instance, Lenovo’s products in a mature market are branded as international goods, with an English logo and tagline as well as a higher price point, and the company positions itself as a global brand. After all, in this market segment, the company competes with brands like Apple and Samsung. However, in developing markets like those in small cities, villages or rural communities, Lenovo sticks strictly to Chinese in its logos, ads and collateral, clearly positioning itself as a Chinese firm. Another important thing to remember is that the creative factor in Chinese branding is different from its Western counterpart. For example, in the West, creativity in advertising revolves primarily around the values of an individual, often resulting in attempts to validate a consumer’s self-image. But in China, creativity in marketing is attached to collective cultural values like harmony and happiness, as well as the notion that the brand meets Western standards of prestige and quality. Simply put, for Chinese consumers, the group acceptance of a product is an important selling point. Chinese consumers now make up over one-quarter of all luxury purchases worldwide. That means one out of every four luxury watches, handbags, cars and necklaces makes its way into the home of a Chinese consumer. To break this incredible volume of purchases down, you can think about Chinese luxury consumers as belonging to three distinct groups, each with different purchasing habits. The first group is the Chinese nouveau riche. These are the business and political elite who have, over the past two decades, amassed incredible wealth; they’re sophisticated, well traveled and experienced consumers. For this group, material luxury goods are old news and what they want instead is novel, exclusive experiences, like courtside basketball seats and tickets to movie premieres. Next, we have the gifting group. This is an important segment because gift giving is core to Chinese culture. The consumers in this group buy luxury goods on a tremendous scale, both in China and abroad, as a means to build and maintain social relationships. Because of the importance of this practice, this group also isn’t very sensitive to price; they see their purchases as an investment to gain social capital. And finally, there are middle-class consumers. This is by far the largest group both in terms of population and potential. These consumers are more price-conscious than the other two and also value product quality and prestige. Since it’s so full of potential, we’ll focus on this last group. To truly capitalize on this segment of middle-class luxury consumers, companies should play on the desire for quality and functionality. A case in point is Brooks Brothers, a luxury American clothing brand. The company has had incredible success selling in China, with 40 percent of its stores now located in China’s largest cities. So how did this come about? The firm carefully crafted a position for itself as the producer of exceptionally well-made clothing at a reasonable price, perfectly suiting the desires of middle-class consumers. Beyond that, it also hammered home the excellent value of its products, which is another important factor for this lucrative market segment. A mere decade ago, the Chinese government only allowed its citizens to travel to a handful of other countries. Today, things are different. Chinese nationals regularly board flights to over 150 nations worldwide, and this explosion in Chinese tourism naturally implies new opportunities for foreign travel companies. For instance, in 2001, under 10 million Chinese citizens traveled to foreign countries. By 2014, that number had grown to 100 million, and it’s estimated to reach 200 million by 2020. In addition, the way they travel has also changed. Up until the mid-2000s, Chinese tourists tended to travel as part of small, highly regulated group tours because of their lack of foreign travel experience and their tight budgets. But today, group tours are exceedingly uncommon, as Chinese travelers spend more money per person per trip than tourists from any other nation, at roughly $7,000 on average. Those that do opt for group tours have higher standards, expecting more lavish accommodation, food and itineraries. Besides seeing the world, another major motivation for the wealthier Chinese travelers is to purchase foreign real estate. This is only natural, as increased travel has given wealthy Chinese consumers a better understanding of the global property market. As a result, many Chinese families who can afford to do so are seeking to turn their liquid assets into foreign real estate and lead binational lives. In fact, Chinese citizens are the number-one foreign buyers of real estate in many major cities like New York and Los Angeles. And Chinese involvement in foreign real estate is only increasing; the luxury real estate broker Sotheby’s reported that, in 2009, 5 percent of their real estate sales were to Chinese investors – by 2014, that number had soared to 35 percent! The key message in this book: The Chinese market holds incredible potential for foreign firms, but the country exists in a context unlike many others. To succeed, foreign companies need to understand the motivations behind China’s growing mass of consumers. By studying the nuances of this group, your company can succeed in the Chinese market.

But modern economies are changing, and the old model no longer holds. Increasingly, the most important investments and assets in our economy are nonphysical – or, in other words, intangible. Today, the true value of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google or even Starbucks lies in intangible assets, be it software, research capabilities, branding or organizational development. And that matters, because companies built around intangible assets behave differently from those reliant on physical goods. For one, they can scale up faster and grow bigger. They are also riskier for investors, and easier for competitors to exploit. The intangible economy is here, and these blinks explore its impact and future. In these blinks, you’ll learn the characteristics of intangible investments; why Starbucks’s real assets are intangible; and why an intangible economy could lead to lower investment unless governments step in. When William the Conqueror, ruler of late eleventh-century England, wanted an estimate of his kingdom’s wealth, he sent out surveyors. In towns and villages across the land, they talked to people, inspected buildings and property and counted animals. Outside of London, in the village of Stansted, which is today the site of a busy international airport, they recorded a mill, 60 pigs, three slaves and 16 cows. The village’s value was listed at £11 per year. For centuries, the process of assessing value – of a business, a town or even a country – has involved measuring, counting and valuating physical, tangible things, like buildings, machinery or computers. But economists are now catching up with an emerging reality. Intangible assets – things that we can neither see nor touch, but that are nonetheless valuable – are growing in economic importance. To understand the rising importance of the intangible economy, imagine you find yourself in a 1970s supermarket. You probably wouldn’t feel too out of place, because, physically speaking, not much has changed in supermarkets in the past 50 years. Today’s supermarkets have aisles flanked by shelves coolers, freezers and checkout counters, just like those of half a century ago. What’s changed for supermarkets is the incredible growth of intangible assets. Consider the rise of barcodes. They not only sped things up at the checkout, making it unnecessary for a worker to manually enter prices. They also enabled management to see, with the help of computer systems, and without a manual stock count, how many sales had been made, and what stock was in inventory. This, in turn, made it easier to manage stock, plan promotions and change prices without having to manually reprice every item. This development greatly increased the productivity of supermarkets and enabled more complex and more profitable pricing systems. Supermarkets have also invested heavily in branding and marketing, two more key intangibles, boosted by data-driven loyalty-card systems. Nowadays, the most valuable assets for many businesses are things we cannot touch. When Microsoft hit a market valuation of $250 billion in 2006 and became the most valuable company in the world at the time, the value of its traditional physical assets was a mere $3 billion – just 1 percent of its overall value. Businesses like Microsoft are hugely valuable, not because of the worth of their factories, or their machinery, or their warehouses. Rather, it’s because of their software, brand and intellectual property, and because the efficiency of their supply-chain organization means they can quickly get products to market. Today, we’re experiencing an increasing disconnect as capitalism operates with less and less reliance on physical capital. Let’s explore a little how this change is taking place across the world. The modern concept of gross domestic product, or GDP, was invented in the 1930s as a way to measure how much production had fallen during the Great Depression. It sought to count the total output of, and investment in, the economy. But it ignored any investments that weren’t physical, so a car factory’s new machines counted as investment, but the money spent employing designers to research a new car model did not. It’s taken a long time for intangible investments to be reflected in official economic figures, and even now the situation is imperfect. In the United States, for example, money spent developing computer software has only been counted in official statistics as an investment since 1999. Its inclusion added 1.1 percent to GDP, which reflects its significant value. Today, most developed economies incorporate key intangibles like software or research and development into their official figures, but the picture isn’t perfect. Spending on assets such as market research or branding is still not included in the United Kingdom’s GDP figures, for instance. Despite these difficulties, economists have reconstructed analyses of investment in intangible assets over time. And these reconstructions show that, in the United States, investment in intangibles overtook investment in physical assets in the mid-1990s. In the United Kingdom, that crossover happened a little later, in the late 1990s. Across Europe, the picture is a little uneven. In countries with large tech sectors or heavy government research and development investment, like Sweden and Finland, intangible investment is again ahead. In less highly developed economies, like Spain and Italy, intangible assets have not yet overtaken traditional, physical assets. But the overall picture is clear. Developed economies are slowly but surely investing more and more in intangible assets. So why does this matter? After all, the nature of investment has always changed. The building of water mills gave way to steam engines. Gas-fired power stations are now giving way to solar arrays and wind farms. So why should we care about the shift from a tangible to an intangible economy? Well, intangible assets are fundamentally different from tangible assets in various ways. And that means that businesses operating with intangibles will behave differently, and an economy reliant on such businesses will have different characteristics. Let’s take a look at some of these differences. At some point in your life, you’ve probably bought a coffee from Starbucks. And if asked to name the company’s business assets, you might point to the large shiny coffee machines in each store. The machines are a great example of how physical assets have limits. They can pump out a lot of coffee, but once a machine is working at full capacity, the branch manager will need to invest in a new machine if he wants to brew more coffee, and hire more employees to run it. One of the main differences between intangibles and tangibles is that intangibles don’t share these limits. Instead, they are scalable, meaning they can be used time and time again, simultaneously, in different places. A key intangible asset for Starbucks is its operating manual. Once that’s been written in, say, Chinese, it can be used in every single Starbucks branch in the country at the same time. Ensuring that every customer in each of China’s more than 3,000 stores gets the consistent Starbucks experience is a valuable, scalable investment in the business’s brand. The scalable nature of intangibles is particularly apparent in the tech industry. For example, the costs of investment in software development required to create the game Angry Birds can be spread over a huge number of downloads – more than three billion at the time of writing. Or consider the digital music business. Once you own the rights to a song – an intangible investment – you can sell it as many times as you like, with almost zero costs. This scalability means that we may increasingly see intangible-intensive businesses that can grow incredibly large. Starbucks’s investment in processes and brand have allowed it to spread quickly across the whole world. Google and Facebook require almost no tangible assets, compared to the corporate giants of 50 years ago, and this has allowed them to scale up their assets – that is, their software and reputation – to soaring heights, very quickly. This also means that new entrants trying to break into markets dominated by the owners of scalable assets face a major challenge. In a market with high scalability, there are few rewards for the runner-up. If Google’s algorithms mean that its search function is simply the best out there, and it is infinitely scalable, then why should anyone use Yahoo! or Bing? Clearly, industry concentration is something we may have to get used to. Banks love certain types of lending, such as mortgages. That’s because, with a mortgage, a bank loans money secured against an asset – the house – that is not only valuable but immovable. If the borrower defaults, the bank can simply seize and sell the house. Intangible assets are the opposite of immobile assets. By their very nature, they tend to be sunk costs – costs that a business or investor has already incurred and which can no longer be recovered. This means that the costs of investing in them are complicated and very difficult to calculate and recover if things go wrong. If a traditional manufacturing business goes bust, it can sell off some of its assets to pay off outstanding debts. Property valuators can place an accurate market value on things like the factory buildings. And in today’s economy, there are established secondary markets for almost all used equipment. If you need to off-load your production line, or a tunnel-boring machine, or even a used submarine, there are marketplaces where you can do that for a fair price. By contrast, there are no established markets for brands or corporate processes. If a global coffee chain went bust, it could sell its coffee machines and cash registers. But it would find it far harder to valuate and sell its brand. The brand might have some value – although, given the business has just failed, it might not. Even if it does, recovering that value would require selling the entire business, likely in a negotiated sale. Unlike physical assets, it can’t simply be put up for sale as a stand-alone item. The sunk-cost nature of intangibles can be problematic for the financing of intangible-heavy businesses, because banks are generally unwilling to invest against assets that can’t be seized or sold. Perhaps more worryingly, the predominance of such businesses could also lead to heavier crashes when a bubble bursts. When there’s a market crash, affected businesses usually sell off their assets cheap, because everyone else is also selling. That’s tough enough when the assets are tangible, like property. The price may be terrible, but at least some value is recovered. But with bubbles based around sunk, intangible assets, with no secondary markets to sell them in, there is a risk that the assets will have no value at all. If you own a bus company, you probably don’t spend much time worrying about your competitors sneaking into your depot at night to use your buses. You have a lock on the depot door, a security guard and several hundred years of established property law on your side. And during the day, your competitors can’t make use of your buses because, well, your drivers are driving them. The situation is different with intangibles, because they generate spillovers. That is, your competitors can easily steal your intangible assets. Invest in a bus, and only you can use it. Invest in an idea or concept, and it can be easily commandeered by your competitors. Sometimes spillovers amount to the simple adoption or imitation of ideas. Not long after Apple released the first iPhone, plenty of other smartphones were produced that looked just like it. Competitors simply imitated Apple’s ideas – for example, its creation of a software supply chain, in the form of an app store. Apple certainly benefited by creating the iPhone. The device now accounts for two-thirds of the company’s revenue. But it also had a spillover effect, which benefited other phone manufacturers, or at least those savvy enough to keep up. Spillover effects also occur at a lower level, most obviously every time a good employee leaves one knowledge-based company and goes to work for another, taking her training and experience with her. Spillovers matter because they require strong regulatory frameworks to ensure they are not abused. A key challenge for policy makers in an intangible economy is to find robust ways to protect intellectual property, and to ensure that the fear of spillovers doesn’t discourage businesses from investing in intangibles. Intellectual property law is evolving, but it remains relatively underdeveloped, as is indicated by the ongoing global trade disputes between China and the United States over piracy. The nature of spillovers also has implications for business practices. To avoid being left behind, businesses in an intangible economy need to quickly identify and exploit their competitors’ spillovers. To do this, they’ll need to invest in their networks, collaborations, partnerships and business intelligence. This points to a positive flipside to spillovers: the potential of synergies in an intangible economy. The science writer Matt Ridley once said that innovation is what happens when ideas have sex. It’s certainly true that new innovations can be born from different ideas coming together in unexpected ways. Consider the microwave oven. At the end of World War II, Raytheon, a US defense contractor, was producing vacuum tubes for radar defenses. While working on the system, a Raytheon engineer named Percy Spencer realized that microwaves in a metal box could heat food. The first microwaves were produced, and a few years later, a novelty stand in New York was selling “speedy weeny” microwaved hot dogs. But microwaves were a flop domestically until Raytheon bought a white goods manufacturer, Amana, in the 1960s. Combining Raytheon’s technical microwave expertise and Amana’s knowledge of kitchen appliances and what households wanted led to a microwave oven that was safe and easy to use. Most importantly, customers wanted it. Forty thousand microwaves were sold in 1970. By 1975, sales were at a million a year. Different ideas fusing together eventually created one of the defining innovations of modern life. Most innovations are the result of synergies – a combination of one idea with another that results in something either entirely new or radically better than what existed before. Today, technology is enabling some very exciting synergies, such as Uber. Taxi companies have, of course, been around for a long time already, but the fusion of a taxi-like network with new, sophisticated smartphone software – an intangible asset – was a major development. It enabled Uber to build a hugely valuable system, where drivers can efficiently connect to users and payments are seamlessly processed. The importance of synergies in an intangible economy has clear implications for policy makers, because establishing national and local economies that can exploit synergies brings big benefits. For instance, a business’s innovations in research or production processes are more valuable when other local businesses are also coming up with great ideas, because it will be easier to find synergies. That’s one reason why Silicon Valley is so productive; when there are lots of businesses, in a small area, investing in research and new ideas, it encourages a virtuous circle of innovation. The intangible economy brings new characteristics, both good and bad, to the businesses involved and to society. But one negative characteristic, not much explored by economists until now, is rising inequality. If you listen to the news, inequality seems to be an inescapable reality of daily life. Tech billionaires, investors and the rest of the global elite enjoy the benefits of globalism, while people in left-behind communities lead lives of economic insecurity. As a result, populist politics abound, from Donald Trump in the United States to the Five Star Movement in Italy. Inequality has certainly been rising in major economies. For example, in 1979, men with a college education in the United States earned, on average, $17,000 more each year than those with just a high school education. By 2012, and adjusted for inflation, the gap was almost $35,000. As well as income inequality, there has also been a rise in wealth inequality, as the value of rich people’s assets, like that of their houses, have grown faster than those of poorer people. Understanding the intangible economy may help us understand some reasons for the growth in income inequality. The nature of intangible businesses means that they generate high-paid jobs. Intangible businesses need people – from product managers to design engineers – with a mixture of strong cognitive and noncognitive skills, people who can deal with the technical side of software development or research, while also handling the social interactions required to manage and capitalize on spillovers. And because intangible businesses tend to be scalable, they can afford to pay more than their nonscalable competitors. In short, Google can afford to pay a product manager considerably more than a traditional manufacturer can pay its factory manager. The growth of the intangible economy can also help explain the rise of wealth inequality. That’s because a key driver of wealth inequality is simply rising property values. And property values haven’t risen uniformly, but disproportionately in cities where intangible investment and spillovers, and therefore innovation, are high. So a city like Detroit, reliant on its automobile industry, saw property prices decline in real terms between 1980 and 2015. Meanwhile, San Francisco, home to many Silicon Valley businesses, and a city rich in intangible assets, saw property prices rise almost 150 percent between 1980 and 2015. In this way, the clustering of intangible-intensive businesses in cities has driven rising property prices, and wealth inequality. The introduction of electrical power in the United States revolutionized the modern-day factory production line. Previously, it was powered by a single shaft run on steam power. A single problem could shut down the whole factory. But with the advent of electricity, suddenly every machine could have its own motor, a great step forward in productivity. However, by the early twentieth century, almost 40 years after electrical power was introduced, only half of the factory capacity had been electrified. This slow adoption shows how it can sometimes take a long time for societies and economies to adjust to the new realities of innovations, and it will also take time to adjust to the intangible economy. But we can help ourselves by making some changes now. First, governments should consider the future of adult education. As we shift to an economy based on ideas and knowledge, many argue that schools need to change. It is often said, for example, that all children should learn to code. But technology moves fast, and it’s hard to say with confidence what skills children should learn today to prepare them to join tomorrow’s workforce. Perhaps, soon, coding will become automated. Adult education, however, provides adults with immediate options to diversify. Governments should consider how to nurture the adult-education sector until it is as common and crucial as today’s schools and universities. Second, economies will need to change their approach to financing. As we’ve seen, intangible assets are by nature “sunk,” so they are not easy to value or recover if things go wrong. As a result, banks can be reluctant to lend money to a business in the intangible economy, because they have little to no guarantee that they’ll recover their capital if the business fails. Thankfully, there are some potential solutions. For example, in Singapore and Malaysia, governments have begun to subsidize bank loans made against intellectual property, hoping to kick-start confidence in loans in the intangible economy. In the United States, a UCLA professor of finance, William Mann, recently noted that 16 percent of registered patents have been used as collateral against bank loans at some point. Economies that can find and pursue solutions such as these will encourage innovation, and pull ahead. Even if we can fix the financing problem, however, avoiding underinvestment in an intangible economy may still be difficult. Perhaps the greatest risk for the future intangible economy is the risk of underinvestment. If spillovers cannot be contained, and businesses don’t have confidence that they can reap the rewards of their research and development, then investment will lag. Jobs, salaries and economic growth will suffer. It is possible that dominant, scalable firms will step in to fill some portion of the gap. For instance, businesses like Facebook, or Google, are happy to provide financial backing for start-up clusters in major tech hot spots like London or Berlin. And this investment will spill over and benefit other companies. But a company like Google is also big and diverse enough to reap some benefits for itself, as it uses or simply acquires new ideas generated by the start-up cluster it has invested in. Monopolistic tech companies may also perceive that it behooves them to invest in research that isn’t just for their own benefit. If they fund research that is in the interest of the general public, they’ll stand a better chance of maintaining their reputation while also fending off regulatory interventions that could break them up. But this is unlikely to fill the entire investment gap. And so, in order to avoid an investment gap, governments should themselves consider scaling up their investments in research and development. This is not a new concept. In the United Kingdom, one-third of all research and development is government funded. Huge numbers of US tech breakthroughs have originated in research at DARPA, the US defense department’s research agency. Nor is the idea necessarily unpopular. Indeed, figures from Democratic senator Bernie Sanders on the left, to the investor and businessman Peter Thiel on the right, support greater public investment in R&D. And there is evidence to suggest that government investment in R&D does generate economic benefit. Research conducted by one of the authors found that increased UK government investment in university research led to an increase in national productivity of around 20 percent. Increases and decreases in government support were closely correlated with rises and falls of productivity, with a three-year delay. Put extra money into university research one year, and three years later you’ll have a corresponding growth in productivity. So increased spending on research and development is likely to pay off. The intangible economy is here, and it’s growing. Policy makers face a choice. They can either recognize that an intangible economy has different characteristics than a tangible one and proactively pursue policies that nourish its growth or they can ignore this new reality. Those that acknowledge the new reality will reap the rewards for years to come. The key message in these blinks: Investing in intangible assets is becoming increasingly important. And because the nature of intangible investment is fundamentally different from tangible investment, this rise has consequences – for the nature of businesses and our economy, for society and for policy makers. Economies that succeed in an intangible-rich world will be those that maximize synergies and innovation while maintaining a healthy flow of investment.  Got feedback?

The societies in the East were more culturally and technologically advanced than their European counterparts. Europe was in fact a relative backwater, plagued by conflict among its many states. While China was able to mobilize its workforce to build great architectural projects like the Forbidden City, Europe was struggling with dreadful sanitation and violence. Yet towards the end of the century, the nations of Europe had begun to grow economically and militarily. Over the next 500 years, the balance shifted overwhelmingly in favor of the West. The development of the Western empires is one of the most obvious examples of this phenomenon.  In 1500, the Western nations controlled just 10% of the world’s surface and 16% of its population. By 1900, this ratio had risen dramatically: just under two thirds of the world’s land and peoples, not to mention 79% of global economic output, were under the control of the Western empires. Increasingly, the West’s domination stretched into other spheres. Western religion and Western science spread across the globe, with, for example, economic debate having long been dominated by the ideas of three Europeans: Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes and Karl Marx. Even Western fashion became the widespread norm. With this domination, living standards in the West rose compared to those elsewhere. By 1990, the average American was seventy-three times richer than the average Chinese – an extreme reversal of their fifteenth century statures. Western nations have grown exponentially from relative poverty to world dominance over the past five centuries. Historians have long theorized why a few Western nations managed to transform themselves from a position of relative poverty to world dominance. Some have argued that their imperialism, through which they subdued and exploited the rest of the world, was the key. Yet empires have existed throughout history, and many Eastern civilizations, such as the Chinese and Ottomans, had huge empires too. Hence, this and the majority of the other explanations for Western domination are too narrow and simplistic. The truth is that Western civilization accomplished a series of six institutional developments. Institutions are crucial because they frame the values and norms in which a society operates; hence advances in those institutions carried great importance. These six developments (or, to use the language of the modern, computerized world, killer applications) propelled the West forward. The rest of the world, lacking these developments, was left behind. An example of such an app is the development of rational scientific thinking, which enabled technological advancements and improved military hardware, among other things. Another example is the spirit of competition, which arose from the constant wars and battles between European nations, and later formed a basis for the development of free market capitalism. The remaining ‘apps’: property rights, medicine, work ethic and the consumer society all had similarly profound and powerful effects. These six killer apps developed in different areas of the West at different times, but all of them contributed to the creation of ideals crucial to the improvement of human society, among them democracy, political freedom and capitalism. It is important to note though, that some developments weren’t so positive; mechanized war, ethnic genocide and the slave trade were also products of Western civilization. Western civilization developed six killer applications, which enabled it to dominate the rest of the world. Due to its geography, Europe is a fragmented continent. For much of its history, its many states were constantly at war with each other. Between 1500 and 1799, Spain was at war with foreign enemies 81% of the time, England 53% and France 52%. Even though life was dreadful for the populations living in the war zones, this constant warring provided the launch pad for future Western dominance. Competition between states led to technological advances in military hardware as each one tried to gain the upper hand by developing new weapons and defenses. Even more crucially, the need to fund the fighting led to the development of the key capitalist financial institutions, such as the bond market, the public company and the bank. The competitive spirit also ran through society itself with the various social groups constantly fighting for power and influence. This competitiveness led the European states to seek fortune and power elsewhere in the world. European explorers and merchants took to the seas to find new markets and trade routes, and they ruthlessly exploited the resources they discovered. Their military strength and desire for wealth allowed them to dominate the local, often much larger, societies they encountered. These conquests brought new raw materials and opportunities, propelling the European societies forward. Compare this to the strict hierarchical society of China, which lacked competitors from outside of their huge, centralized nation. Without social mobility or any incentive to seek overseas expansion, their society became stagnant and inefficient. The Chinese lacked the crucial killer application that had developed in the West: a spirit of competition. A spirit of ruthless competition, developed in Europe, was vital for the development of capitalism and Western power. In the seventeenth century, European scholars were busily engaged in discovering the secrets of the natural world. This was the beginning of a scientific revolution, which saw the creations of modern disciplines such as biology, mathematics and astronomy. These developments were almost entirely European in nature. Why? The scientific revolution was in part kick-started by the Reformation of the Christian faith in the fifteenth century, which saw Protestants split from the Roman Catholic Church. As opposed to Catholics, Protestants were encouraged to read the bible for themselves, leading to a rise in literacy. At the same time the development of the printing press allowed ideas to be easily circulated. Together these two developments created an environment where new ideas could be easily read and spread. Western rulers were quick to understand the benefits that these new ideas could provide for their states. A prime example of such a ruler is the Prussian King, Frederick the Great, who embodied many of the new scientific and cultural ideals. This helped him create a liberal society based on rationalism rather than the religious superstition that plagued many other societies. He also applied these scientific theories to war, developing one of the strongest armies of his day. These principles failed to take off outside the West. In the Islamic Ottoman Empire, for example, religious oppression clamped down both on scientific thinking and the printing press, effectively halting scientific progress and the dissemination of new information. This resulted in the once powerful empire crumbling in strength. While the modern methods of the Prussian artillery became feared across the world, Ottoman forces were still hurling stone cannon balls at their enemies. The development of scientific principles gave the West a crucial advantage over other societies. The discovery and colonization of the Americas provided a perfect experiment between two Western models of political and social organization. The British in North America and the Spanish in South and Central America developed two diametrically opposed systems. There can be no doubt which system proved most successful. By the twentieth century, the United States had become a world superpower with a stable, democratic constitution. The nations to its south, however, suffered centuries of instability following independence. In the British colonies, land was shared out among the settlers. Even those who left Britain incredibly poor were given property. Crucially, with this property came voting rights. Following the ideas of the philosopher John Locke, a system where property owners could participate in a representative government was developed. This form of government allowed disputes to be amicably settled and the rule of law enshrined. A culture of private property rights and constitutional government developed, which would form the basis of the US constitution. In Spanish America, there was no such system. The Crown owned the land, which was governed by a tiny elite.  Contrary to the British, the Spanish did not provide the colonial populations – mostly made up of natives rather than settlers – with land. This meant that although they were economically vital, they had no political power. After independence, they had none of the democratic traditions so vital in the North. Dictatorship, civil war and petty squabbling followed. The development of a model of representative government based on property rights was a killer application that drove Western civilization forward. The model of representative government based on property rights and the rule of law provides the strongest societies. Before the development of modern medicine, life was pretty dreadful. Life expectancy across the globe was low and most people expected to die at a relatively young age. Diseases such as plague and smallpox were rife in appalling sanitary conditions; the population of Europe, for example, had been halved by the Black Death epidemic. Yet in eighteenth-century Europe, life expectancy started to increase. Huge improvements in public health and science led to better sanitation and developments such as vaccinations. By the twentieth century, killer diseases such as typhoid, which had plagued Europe for centuries, were almost eliminated. These developments alone helped the standards of health in the West rocket above those in other civilizations. However, just as health was improving in the mainland Europe, the Western nations were facing new dangers in their colonies, most notably in Africa. In order to continue their expansion in these areas, they had to overcome deadly foes such as malaria. The colonies effectively became huge laboratories where Western doctors could examine patients and look for cures to these diseases. As new cures and remedies were discovered, Western empires could reach ever deeper into the tropics, enabling them to discover and exploit even more resources. Hence, the development of modern medicine was another killer application that helped the West. Not only did these medical improvements benefit Western colonists, they also helped raise life expectancy for the native populations as well. Some, like the French empire, made it a policy to spread medical improvements across all their subjects. In fact life expectancy in Africa improved more under European occupation than with independence. Therefore, despite what some argue, many European empires also had a positive impact on their possessions. The development of modern medicine spread Western civilization and helped raise global life expectancy. The Industrial Revolution erupted from developments in the textile industry in eighteenth-century Britain. Due to high labor costs and the abundance of cheap coal, the early industrialists turned to technology to keep production profitable. The results were astounding. Productivity in Britain shot up and the cost of cotton goods dived. But alongside this revolution in supply, a similar, lesser-known revolution occurred in the demand for textiles. Suddenly, people across the globe desired new, affordable clothing, and this demand fuelled the growth of the textile industry. This development was not limited to textiles, as all manner of affordable goods were coveted. A market-driven consumer society where people desired to buy and consume affordable goods was created. This was another killer app of Western civilization. Increased demand meant more factories, higher employment and better wages, which in turn enabled the workers to consume more goods. Nothing better exemplifies the power of the consumer society than the failure of Communism in the Soviet Union. Although the Communists could keep up with the West in their military hardware and heavy industry, they utterly failed to provide their citizens with the consumer goods desired. What the citizens wanted was what people in the West had: jeans, Coca-Cola and pop music. In totalitarian societies, like Communism, what the people demand is often ignored in favor of the production of goods that uphold government power, such as armaments. The people might have money to spend but nothing to spend it on, meaning that living standards fail to rise and there is less incentive to work hard and be productive. The formation of a consumer society radically raised the standard of living in the West. After the Christian Reformation, beginning in fifteenth-century Europe, the new Protestant nations that were formed grew at a faster rate than Catholic ones. Perhaps the main reason for this was the work ethic developed from the values of Protestantism. This work ethic was one of the killer apps that enabled Western civilization to grow and prosper. Protestantism is a religion where knowledge, literacy, thrift and hard work are highly valued. These are all principles crucial to economic prosperity. In addition, Protestant communities tend to be based on trust and honesty, allowing for networks of credit and business to thrive, again propelling economic development. The development of this Protestant work ethic spurred several other developments that were crucial for Western prosperity. The Industrial Revolution, for example, was enabled by the fact that the workforce was more dynamic and hardworking than before. The work ethic, with its adherence to thrift, also encouraged people to save money, allowing them to accumulate capital and invest it onward, spurring yet more growth. While the Protestant religion helped create a hardworking, success-driven population in the West, religions in other societies acted as a drag against progress. In China, for example, Confucianism helped create a stability ethic where social equilibrium was more desirable than expansion. This was a major reason why Chinese society grew stagnant and then collapsed while the West expanded and progressed. In fact in recent years, the growth of the Chinese economy has coincided with the growth of Protestantism in the country. Protestantism helped create a work ethic that encouraged people to work hard and save money. Many in the rest of the world have looked back at the centuries of Western dominance and wondered how it has been possible. Eager for success of their own, several nations have aimed to download the killer applications that enabled Western civilization to flourish. The first nation to appreciate the need to westernize in order to grow was Japan. In the late nineteenth century, Japanese leaders attempted to completely transform their society, culture and institutions based on Western models. Out went the centuries of traditional clothing, for example. In its place came Western fashions, including a new Western dress code for civil servants and the military. This westernization also included the development of a Western style industry and consumer society, both of which greatly helped Japan catch up with the Western nations.   Over the twentieth century, other societies have followed this approach: for example, the nations of Southeast Asia copied the Western industrial model with great success after World War II. Meanwhile, the Turkish rejected the traditional Islamic state after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, embracing the scientific, rational nation state instead – even going as far as to westernize their alphabet. Yet, not all such attempts lead to success. When the Japanese decided to westernize their society, they had no idea which elements could provide success (i.e., which apps to download). They therefore endeavored to copy as much as they could. This unfortunately included developing a Western style empire which left a bloody and disastrous trail until its fall in 1945. Nevertheless, in the hopes of Western-like success, many nations have tried to reject their own traditions and download the killer applications. Many other civilizations have tried to copy elements of Western success. The great divergence,which saw the West’s prosperity and power soar above the rest of the world, is slowly waning. Many fear that the dominance of Western civilization that has characterized the last five centuries is over. The fears are largely justified. The Western economies have been hit hard by the recent financial crisis. Many are struggling with huge levels of debt and a declining confidence in their economies, while the economies in Asia, most notably that of China, continue to show staggering levels of growth. Westerners seem to have forgotten some of their own killer applications. The work ethic that sustained so much economic success has largely disappeared in many areas. Europeans now work the shortest hours in the world, while the Western adherence to thrift and saving has disappeared with the availability of easy credit. More worrying is a loss of Western self-confidence. Since the 1960s, teaching in the West has drifted towards favoring relativism; assuming every civilization is equal, without examining why one culture may be superior to another. This means young people in the West are taught little about the narrative of Western history and the successes of Western civilization. Even Western cultural institutions like museums, schools and the media show more interest in celebrating the history of other civilizations than their own. While the future of the West could be bleak, we should remember that many elements of Western civilization are still thriving elsewhere: the rise of the rest of the world has been largely the result of them downloading the Western killer applications. The future of Western dominance is uncertain, as Westerners have forgotten some of the vital killer applications. The key message of this book is: Western civilization developed six killer applications, which transformed it from a position of relative poverty to total global domination.  This brought massive benefits in prosperity, power and health compared to their counterparts elsewhere. Yet this period of Western dominance could be coming to an end. Societies in the West seem to have lost confidence in themselves. At the same time, the rest of the world seems to be learning from the centuries of Western success and applying the same apps to their own societies. The questions this book answered: How did Western civilization become the dominant global force? Western nations have grown exponentially from relative poverty to world dominance over the past five centuries. Western civilization developed six killer applications, which enabled it to dominate the rest of the world. How did the killer applications cause Western civilization to become so powerful? A spirit of ruthless competition, developed in Europe, was vital for the development of capitalism and Western power. The development of scientific principles gave the West a crucial advantage over other societies. The model of representative government based on property rights and the rule of law provides the strongest societies. The development of modern medicine spread Western civilization and helped raise global life expectancy. The formation of a consumer society radically raised the standard of living in the West. Protestantism helped create a work ethic that encouraged people to work hard and save money. How will future developments alter the balance of power which has lasted for the last five centuries? Many other civilizations have tried to copy elements of Western success.

We work to earn it; we shop to spend it; we save and protect our supply of it. Yet why exactly do we spend our lives in the thrall of money? What is it that makes it so important? These blinks will give you a unique look at why cash is king, from its early beginnings to what it’s become in the twenty-first century. In these blinks you’ll discover why cash is more valuable than the paper it’s printed on; why a German can’t distinguish between debt and guilt; and why money is to a man what pollen is to a bee and a flower. Money is a crucial element of survival in the society we've constructed. We use cash as a medium of exchange for getting the things we want or need. And if you really want to understand money, you first have to understand how it works in the context of the laws of nature. The nature of exchange is a key concept for all living creatures. Organisms work together to survive, often entering into symbiotic relationships, or symbiosis. In such a relationship, two different organisms benefit each other so that they together can better survive and reproduce. That's how bees and flowers work. Bees derive energy from the nectar in flowers and then make honey to store through the winter. In turn, they spread pollen from flower to flower, thus fertilizing the flowers and ensuring their survival. Bees and flowers also exchange electrical energy. Flowers have a “negative” charge and bees a “positive” charge – like magnets, that's why they're attracted to each other. The bees are pulled toward the negatively charged pollen, which then sticks to them so they can easily transport it and pollinate other flowers. Both species benefit equally. Ancient humans, in contrast, came to realize that they as a group had a better chance of survival if they helped each other. So humans specialized in different skills and created divisions of labor. Some individuals hunted, while others raised children, for example. Eventually, humans started producing more food than they could consume. For the first time, they had a surplus that they could trade with other groups for goods they needed. Thus groups began trading technology, such as hand axes or spears. Over time, humans learned that trade was easier and more effective if there existed a universal tool for exchange, rather than exchanging goods or services themselves – and money was developed. Humans aren't always logical. Our emotions can push us into making irrational decisions, though economists tend to forget about that when doing calculations. Economists often theorize that humans are always rational, but this is simply untrue. Modern economics is founded on a certain model of human behavior, in which people weigh the costs and benefits of different options and choose the one that's most beneficial. However, events like the 2008 global financial crisis illustrate that human behavior isn't always guided by logic. We're affected by cognitive bias, the tendency to have irrational thoughts that lead to errors or biases in judgment. Cognitive bias is powerful. Did you know, for example, that the weather affects the amount of money you spend? It’s been shown that customers tip more when it's sunnier. That's also part of the reason why markets perform better on sunny days. Loss aversion is another thing that affects what we do with our money. Loss aversion makes us perceive losses as more damaging than the possibility of a gain. So how can we understand financial choices as a society if economists are basing their equations on faulty assumptions? And what’s more, brain imaging has revealed that when a person makes a decision about money, certain areas of the brain linked to subconscious emotions are activated. The nucleus accumbens, for instance, is associated with feeling pleasure or being motivated. It's activated when we anticipate gaining something, like winning the lottery. The anterior insular, on the other hand, is associated with negative emotions like pain, and it's activated when we anticipate a loss. That's why we hate losing so much – it actually hurts! So when you make a financial decision, you're actually affected by subconscious processes too, in addition to cognitive bias and loss aversion. Emotions influence our spending quite a bit! “Money” might seem easy to define. It's simply the stuff we use to make a transaction, whether in the form of coins, bills or digital currency. But there's actually a fair bit of disagreement among experts on what actually constitutes “money.” There are two opposing economic doctrines that seek to define what money is. The first doctrine, metallism, posits that money derives its value from materials that have intrinsic worth, such as silver, gold or other commodities. So paper money should be “backed” by a valuable commodity to ensure its worth. The metallist view considers money to be hard, meaning its value is determined by the market. Chartalism, on the other hand, posits that money doesn't have an intrinsic value. So a dollar bill is just a piece of paper that doesn't mean anything on its own. The chartalist view considers money to be soft, meaning that a state can control the value of money by adding more of it to the marketplace. For chartalists, the value of money is a reflection of an economy’s overall performance. Although the doctrines differ, the history of money has shown a general pattern, in that we’re moving gradually from the idea of hard money to soft money. From currency’s early days to the twentieth century, money was generally viewed as hard. Paper notes and coins were all tied to reserve metals, usually gold. In 1900, for example, the U.S. Congress established the Gold Standard Act, which tied the dollar to the price of gold. In 1971, however, President Richard Nixon separated the dollar from the price of gold, and the rest of the world mostly followed suit. Countries gradually removed the connection of money to the price of material goods, so they could have more control over the actual value of their currency. Today, money only derives its value from the amount of it that's in circulation; it does not have intrinsic worth. As the years pass, metal coins and paper notes become more and more outdated. The rapid technological advancements of the last hundred years have altered much of society, money included. The twentieth century saw several major changes in the global monetary system, such as the introduction of credit cards. Credit cards are safer and more convenient than bills and coins, because a card can be used online or swiped quickly at a checkout counter. Credit cards aren't necessarily widespread, however. While consumers in the United States have tons of cards, some 82 percent of global transactions are still conducted in cash. Some countries, such as Germany, have few credit cards. Germany historically has been averse to debt. In fact, the German word for debt, schuld, translates to “guilt.” Yet credit cards have been found to boost spending, so it's likely that governments and businesses will continue to encourage their use, especially in rapidly developing markets such as China. Consumer spending actually grows by 0.5 percent when credit card payments increase by 10 percent, research has shown. Mobile phones have also changed how we pay for goods, and it's likely that they will have a far greater impact than do credit cards today. There are many more mobile phones than credit cards in the world, and such a network presents the potential for extensive payment systems. Mobile payments are estimated to grow by 62 to 100 percent in coming years. We may see some major changes, like the rise of mobile wallets, which allow a mobile phone to make direct payments. Apple Pay is one example of technology that ties together mobile devices and payment systems. Apple Pay allows a user to connect her credit or debit cards to an iPhone, and then pay for goods in stores that accept Apple Pay. A user just has to hold her phone up to a special reader in the store for the transaction to be completed. Money is practical, as it allows us to buy the things we need. Yet it has a symbolic purpose too, in that it can make a statement about the lives we lead and the society we’ve created. Your opinion on and use of money says a lot about your values, which is why so many people use money to measure success, or failure. Plenty of people work tirelessly to earn as much as they can, only to spend that cash on status symbols such as expensive cars or clothes. Yet how you see money depends on your background and your culture. Many religions, such as Hinduism and Christianity, preach that believers should seek money as little as possible. In Christianity, Jesus tells a wealthy man to get rid of all his possessions and follow him instead. As a society, we’ve incorporated money in many of our value systems. Money can even represent the values of an entire nation. Ancient coins have revealed a lot about the societies from which they came. In ancient Vietnam, Dinh Bo Linh (968-979) unified Vietnam after a civil war and issued the new nation's first coins. These coins tell an interesting tale. Heavier coins indicate a strong economy, whereas lighter coins suggest that metal was going to other uses, such as for weapons during wartime. Images are also revealing. If coins are detailed and have complicated calligraphy, it indicates a higher educated society, with a ruler concerned with the literacy of his people. If the coins are simple and easy to understand, usually the opposite is true. The key message in this book: Money is an extremely powerful force. We evolved to use it to collaborate more effectively and survive in the wild. The financial choices we make are influenced by our emotions; and our values often stem from how we treat and treasure money. Money has changed a great deal since it was developed, and it’s clear that money will continue to evolve, especially as technology progresses.  Suggested further reading: The Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson The Ascent of Money is an explanation of how different historical events led to the development of the current financial system. It aims to show how, despite its proneness to crises and inequality, the financial system and money itself are drivers of human history and progress. Got feedback?

But the end of the Cold War did not abolish the possibility of nuclear destruction; thousands of nuclear warheads remained in their silos, ready to be launched at a moment’s notice. Unfortunately, not much has changed since then. If anything, the situation has worsened. The nuclear programs of rogue states such as North Korea mean that the possibility of nuclear escalation is now at its highest since 1991. But how did we get here? And what can we learn from the mistakes of history? The following blinks will take us on a journey through the history of nuclear warfare – from the early days of the Manhattan Project up to the present day. In these blinks, you’ll discover how an international team of scientists developed the first nuclear bomb during WWII; what event in 1983 almost brought the world to nuclear annihilation; and how a TV movie helped convince Ronald Reagan that nuclear war should never, ever happen. On July 12, 1945, in a small New Mexico farmhouse, a plutonium core was placed inside the first nuclear bomb. This event was the culmination of approximately three years of work conducted by the team behind the Manhattan Project – a group of British, US and Canadian physicists who were put together as an allied response to the German physicists who were busy creating their own super bomb. The bomb about to be tested in New Mexico housed a plutonium core surrounded by a series of high explosives, each of which pointed inward toward the core. When the explosives detonated, they would all fire at precisely the same instant, thus imploding the core and causing a chain-reaction explosion the likes of which had never before been seen. After years of intense research, the scientists had eventually discovered that there were two materials that could cause this kind of explosion: uranium-235 and plutonium-239. Nuclear bombs rely on fission – when atoms split and release energy. Both uranium-235 and plutonium-239 have a high proton count, making it easier to start a fission reaction. The idea was to split the atoms in the bomb’s core, releasing a massive amount of energy – and causing an unprecedented explosion. When fission happens under strictly controlled circumstances, such as in a nuclear power plant, the produced energy can be used to fuel electrical generators. However, on July 17, 1945, during the first bomb test, no one was exactly sure what was going to happen. They knew the detonation had to trigger all the explosives at exactly the same time if the reaction was to be successful, so the scientist Donald Horning came up with the X-Unit. This was an electronic triggering device that would simultaneously set off all 32 explosives in the bomb. These explosives completely surrounded the core in the shape of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons; it looked like a big soccer ball. Horning’s triggering device worked perfectly, and the first test produced a mushroom cloud that bloomed eight miles into the sky. The sight, along with the accompanying roar, caused at least one technician to think that this must be what doomsday would look like. In June of 1945, World War II was still costing lives in the Pacific. So the question became, how to use the bomb in order to get Japan to surrender? Some were hoping for a public display of nuclear power in an unpopulated area. But there was a risk that the next bomb might fail to detonate. So instead, the US military, along with the president, decided to deliver an unannounced bombing on Hiroshima. This occurred on August 6, 1945. The bomb was called “Little Boy,” and it was ten feet tall and weighed ten thousand pounds. Its core contained 0.7 grams of uranium-235, an amount that weighed less than a dollar bill but would unleash an explosion equivalent to 12 to 18 kilotons of TNT. Yet despite the massive death and destruction caused by the bomb, the Japanese Emperor refused to surrender. So a second bomb, this one with a plutonium core and the code name “Fat Man,” was dropped on Nagasaki just three days later. Remarkably enough, while the bomb was being loaded onto a plane, a technician noticed that it had been incorrectly wired. So a quick and dangerous rewiring was done on the spot, using a soldering iron right next to five thousand pounds of high explosives. It is believed that only one-fifth of Fat Man’s plutonium actually fissioned, but it was still a bigger explosion than Hiroshima, equivalent in yield to 21 kilotons of TNT. This second bomb resulted in the unconditional surrender from Japan’s emperor. Afterward, international discussions raged. How was this revolutionary weapon going to be controlled? Believe it or not, there were even some from the military who wanted to ban nuclear weapons. US Air Force General Henry H. Arnold called for the bomb to be immediately outlawed. Eventually, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 was issued, giving America’s nuclear program civilian oversight through the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which was made up of politicians. These politicians would have to work with a group of military officials who were supposed to act as advisors, yet would continue to push for more control in the decades ahead. If there was any hope of a world government – something similar to the United Nations – safely controlling the production and handling of nuclear weapons, it was effectively squashed by the tensions of the Cold War. There were two events in particular that put the United States and the Soviet Union at loggerheads. In 1948, the Soviets staged a violent takeover of Czechoslovakia’s democratic government; and in 1949, the Soviets successfully tested their first nuclear bomb, the RDS-1. As a result, the US government spent the next 40 years, until the Cold War’s end, fearing a Soviet invasion of Europe. So the big question facing Congress in 1949 was how the United States should respond to such an invasion. One side argued for conventional warfare; the other, for an “atomic blitz,” which relied on nuclear weapons and minimal ground forces. With the heavy losses of WWII still fresh in people’s minds, the atomic blitz side won, and the Air Force’s Strategic Air Command (SAC) was formed to prepare for a potential nuclear strike. Meanwhile, as the Cold War continued, so did an arms race between the two nations. Both sides started out with the implosion bombs – also known as Mark 3 bombs – that had been used in World War II. But in 1949, the United States began working on the Mark 4, which stored its nuclear core separately from the rest of the bomb. It also featured a safer detonation device that could detect a change in altitude and therefore remain unarmed until it was released from the plane. But the Mark 4 was soon replaced by the Mark 6, which was ten times as powerful. And then the Mark 6 was supplanted by the Mark 7, which was smaller and lighter but no less powerful. All the while, both the United States and the Soviets were racing to develop their own hydrogen bomb. For the United States, the first full-scale experimental test of a liquid-fueled H-bomb was on November 1, 1952. The explosion was equivalent to roughly 10.4 megatons of TNT – five hundred times more than the Nagasaki bomb. This was followed on March 1, 1954, by the famous Bikini Atoll test of a solid-fueled H-bomb that yielded 15 megatons. And the Soviets weren’t far behind; their own thermonuclear test of the RDS-6 occurred in August of 1953. The Strategic Air Command (SAC) took preparedness very seriously. There were countless checklists and endless drills, each designed to ensure that bombs could be loaded onto planes and planes put in the air at a moment’s notice. But this meant that nuclear weapons were constantly being loaded and unloaded from planes that were routinely flying over populated areas. These routines came with a significant risk of human and mechanical error, and that risk would continue to increase as long as the nuclear stockpile grew. And after the Soviets launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, the stockpile increased considerably. Not only did the satellite launch make the United States feel like they were losing the Cold War; the mystery surrounding Sputnik stoked fears that the Soviets were close to actually using their nuclear weapons. So the US felt impelled to create even more impressive weapons. The growing stockpile did raise concerns, however – concerns about both the proximity of storage facilities to densely populated areas and about how much the explosives were handled during training missions. One primary concern was over “one-point safety,” which is how vulnerable the bombs were to having just one of the explosive detonators accidentally go off. There are a number of theoretical scenarios where this might happen, such as a fire causing a short circuit in the wiring or a bullet puncturing the bomb’s shell and striking or sparking the explosive. If just one detonator around the bomb’s core goes off, it wouldn’t result in a 15-megaton explosion – but it would likely release the core’s poisonous radioactive material into the air. And even small traces of plutonium dust can be deadly. Two of the most vocal proponents for trying to get more safety features built into the bombs were scientists Robert Peurifoy and Carl Carlson, both of whom worked for Sandia, the research and development laboratory that was under contract with the US military. But many in the government and military were opposed to more safety features. They saw them as increasing the likelihood that the bombs might fail to go off when needed, and retrofitting old bombs was just too costly. As it turned out, the people who were concerned about safety had every right to be, since reports show that accidents weren’t at all uncommon. One of the most dangerous accidents is known as “the Moroccan incident.” In January of 1958, a plane loaded with a Mark 36 hydrogen bomb, capable of a 10-megaton yield, blew a tire and caught fire at an American airfield in Morocco. US Air Force personnel tried to put out the flames that were feeding off a full tank of jet fuel – but couldn’t. The base was evacuated. Luckily, the melted 8,000-pound bomb was recovered two hours later and the radioactive material was buried. A month later, a Mark 6 atomic bomb was accidentally jettisoned from a plane flying over South Carolina. Thankfully, the fissile core was not inside the bomb, which detonated upon impact, leaving a 50-foot crater in the yard of a home, tearing apart the house and a car. Incredibly, the family suffered only minor injuries. Later that year, the first detailed safety report on nuclear weapons was issued, and it revealed that an average of seven bombs were being accidentally dropped every year. On top of that, there were twelve crashes or accidents that involved a plane carrying a nuclear bomb. The report suggested that these accidents would only increase as the stockpile grew, and things would get even worse as the bombs, missiles and rockets got more complex. Another worrisome factor was the psychological element. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, there wasn’t a thorough screening process for the military personnel tasked with handling these weapons. So there was a genuine threat that someone drunk, high or in the throes of a psychotic episode could accidentally or purposely detonate a nuclear device. Indeed, the European stockpiles were especially vulnerable. Amazingly, there were hardly any security measures in place to stop a pilot in Germany from taking off in a plane and launching a nuclear missile; or for a soldier in Italy to knock a guard unconscious, take the key from around his neck and launch a rocket. Either one of these acts could have easily started a nuclear Armageddon. You don’t need to have military expertise to have heard of the B-52 bomber, but you may not know how problematic these planes were. Despite their frequent malfunctions, however, they were the main transport vehicle for nuclear bombs, resulting in some especially dangerous incidents. In 1961, a malfunction caused a B-52 to crash into a barley field in northern California after the crew safely evacuated. It was carrying two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs that luckily shattered without incident. Just weeks later, a B-52 was flying over the Appalachian Mountains when turbulence caused its tail to break apart. The plane was carrying two Mark 53 H-bombs. It crashed into the side of a mountain, and only two of the five crew members survived. The bombs were recovered from the wreckage, undetonated and intact. And in 1966, a mid-air collision occurred when a B-52 was attempting to refuel over the coast of southern Spain. The fuel airship exploded, killing the entire crew. The B-52, carrying four Mark-28 H-bombs, broke apart, killing two crew members. It took over a month to locate all four bombs; all the while, the United States denied there was any threat. Yet one bomb had partially detonated, excavating a 20-foot crater near a cemetery and releasing a cloud of plutonium onto a nearby farm. These are just some of the many accidents involving B-52s. In the 1970s a different kind of threat emerged as military servicemen began to take part in the growing drug culture. Even the ones who handled nuclear bomb storage weren’t immune to the cultural changes. At one Air Force base in North Carolina, 151 of 225 security personnel were arrested on marijuana charges, and on Missouri base, over 230 officers were arrested for either using or dealing drugs on site. During these years, it was common for hashish, heroin and LSD to be discovered in the barracks and workstations of military personnel. The desire to efficiently command and control US nuclear weapons led to some impressive developments. In the 1950s, NORAD became the first computer network, its purpose being to link the radar systems of Air Force bases across the United States to detect a Soviet first strike. But there was another computer being used to program the US nuclear response. The Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) dates back to the late 1950s when an early IBM computer processed a list of targets to come up with a plan for optimal destruction. Its precise goal was to ensure the complete annihilation of the enemy with a 75-percent probability. On December 2, 1960, SIOP called for 3,423 nuclear weapons to be directed at 1,000 different ground zeroes. The plan would eliminate 3,729 targets and along with an estimated 220 million lives, with far more dying from the subsequent fallout and aftereffects. Another disturbing thing about SIOP is that once it starts, there’s no stopping it. When newly elected presidents throughout the years have been shown this plan, they’re usually shaken and deeply disturbed by the massive level of overkill on display. What’s also disturbing is that, on more than one occasion, SIOP came close to going into effect. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the SAC was ordered to be at DEFCON 2, the level of readiness just below imminent nuclear war. Sixty-five bombers were in the air, and multiple nuclear submarines were in striking position. Fortunately, the Soviet Union agreed to remove their weapons from Cuba, and the crisis was averted. What’s more troubling is the number of accidental occasions when faulty computers have nearly triggered war. On multiple occasions, NORAD mistakenly identified incoming Soviet missiles. Once, this was due to the accidental running of a test program that was believed to be a real scenario. But thankfully, cool heads prevailed. According to a report in 1968, there were an average of 130 significant accidents per year that involved nuclear weapons. That’s 1,200 incidents between 1950 and 1968, with 13 of those incidents getting labeled as “broken arrows” – when a weapon gets accidentally fired or detonated and releases radioactive materials. Sure enough, these incidents continued into the 1980s, which is when one of the biggest accidents took place. It happened on September 18, 1980, at an underground missile silo in rural Arkansas, where an active Titan II rocket was being maintained. This rocket carried a W-53 warhead, the most powerful one produced in the United States at the time. According to a list provided by Robert Peurifoy of the Sandia Laboratory, it is also one of the nuclear weapons with the highest risk of accidental detonation. But the Titan II rocket comes with other inbuilt dangers. Its fuel tank is especially dangerous, containing highly toxic liquid propellants and an oxidizer that releases an even deadlier explosive vapor. On the evening of September 18th, the maintenance crew was doing a routine fill-up of the oxidizer tank, when a metal socket was accidentally dropped; it fell 70 feet before striking the side of the rocket, and immediately, a nasty looking cloud of vapor began to fill the underground silo. Alarms and warning lights went off, but the staff were confused and started to panic because, even though they had checklists to follow for every procedure, there wasn’t one for this scenario. Orders came to evacuate the silo, including the control room, even though it was protected by massive blast doors and sealed off from the vapor. With everyone evacuated, hours went by as a toxic cloud of rocket fuel vapor rose up into the sky. Soon, people and news reporters began to gather around the access road to the silo. Obviously, something needed to be done quickly, but the Air Force and SAC had a thorough bureaucratic process to follow. You’ll discover how this turned out in the next blinks. Jeff Kennedy was one of many people who received an emergency phone call that night. He was a highly respected Air Force missile mechanic who knew the Titan II inside out, and once he arrived on the scene, he knew what needed to be done. But no one was ready to approve his plan, and nothing was going to happen until all proposals were passed up the bureaucratic chain of command. This frustrated Kennedy, who knew that waiting would only make the situation worse. In total, it took nearly eight hours for a plan to be approved, and it started off with a bad choice. Technicians were ordered to enter the silo using the main access door instead of the escape hatch, which would’ve been a whole lot quicker, easier and safer. But those in charge erroneously believed that people wearing protective suits and gear wouldn’t be able to fit down the escape hatch. Kennedy knew that it was a mistake, but he put on his gear and followed the orders. With the help of his friend and fellow technician, David Livingston, Kennedy slowly opened the series of blast doors. Once inside, they used a portable vapor reader to measure the air; the needle on the device maxed out at over 21,000 parts per million. The air was toxic enough to start melting their suits. Rightfully, Kennedy and Livingston were ordered back outside. But then the final bad decision of the night was made. An order came to turn on the ventilation fan to clear the vapor from the silo. Kennedy knew that it would only take a tiny spark to instantly turn the silo into a roaring fireball, but Livingston agreed to turn the switch and activate the fan. And sure enough, just after Kennedy stepped outside, the place exploded, sending a tower of fire into the sky, briefly turning night into day. Remarkably, David Livingston was the only person to die that night, although many others were also blown off their feet and suffered severe burns. The warhead, which was also blasted into the air, landed in a ditch right next to the access road. The official report of the incident blamed the low-ranking officers involved and decided that the Titan II was still “basically safe.” It was clear that very little would change during the 1980s. Indeed, the most dangerous year in nuclear history, 1983, was still to come. Mere months after the Damascus incident, Ronald Reagan was elected president, and his administration committed $1.5 trillion to a defense budget that included growing the nuclear arsenal. One of these weapons was the Pershing II, a missile with a mere 1,000-mile range that was scheduled to arrive in West German bases in November of 1983. With a range that small, it was clear to the Soviets that these missiles had only one purpose – to annihilate Moscow in under ten minutes. Making tensions worse, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, and the United States began a campaign of psychological warfare by routinely sending SAC bombers into Soviet airspace and conducting Navy exercises close to Soviet bases. Then, on September 1, 1983, the Soviet Union destroyed a Korean Airlines flight after it accidentally entered Soviet airspace, killing all 269 passengers. A month later, the United States sent troops to Grenada to overthrow a Soviet-backed communist regime. But the most dangerous incident occurred a week later when NATO conducted a drill called Able Archer 83, which was designed to simulate the authorization of nuclear warfare. With the delivery of the Pershing II only weeks away, the timing for this simulation couldn’t have been worse. When the KGB overheard communications from the drill, they thought they were hearing the real thing, bringing the Soviet Union perilously close to launching a preemptive attack. Luckily, the drill ended soon, alleviating the worst fears of the Soviets. On November 20, 1983, Ronald Reagan and millions of other Americans watched a made-for-TV film called The Day After. It was a realistic portrayal of how average people would cope with the outbreak of nuclear war, and Reagan was among those extremely shaken by what they had seen. When the president appeared on TV shortly after seeing the film, his rhetoric had dramatically changed. He announced that a “nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought.” Reagan’s new attitude was matched by that of the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the two began working to reduce their nuclear programs and finally put an end to the Cold War. Also, after decades of warnings, the military finally heard Robert Peurifoy and agreed to spend money on retrofitting some of its stockpile with improved safety devices. It was clear how needed these improvements were when the House Foreign Affairs Committee graded the safety of every type of weapon in the US arsenal. On a scale from A to D, only three got an A, and 12 received a D. More recent safety additions include a barcode system that was introduced to prevent the accidental transport of armed weapons on training missions. This is exactly what happened in 2009 when six nuclear missiles sat in an unguarded plane for two days. There are still many improvements to be made, but the greatest risks may lie elsewhere. While Russia possesses around 3,740 nuclear weapons, France around 300, China 240 and the United Kingdom 160, it’s the nations of India and Pakistan that could pose the biggest threat. These countries aren’t exactly friendly neighbors, and Pakistan recently doubled its arsenal to around 100 weapons. But the added threat here comes from the number of Islamic radicals in the area who have already made multiple attempts to steal a nuclear weapon and might one day succeed if security isn’t tight enough. The key message in this book: Nuclear weapons are not something that can be safely controlled with strict bureaucratic checklists and procedures. As long as computers and humans are involved, something is bound to go wrong. Humans will make mistakes and computers will malfunction, and the more secretive nations are about those mistakes and the technology behind their weapons, the harder it will become to improve safety and design, making all of us more vulnerable to a catastrophic accident.

Why did you buy it? Did you need it?  Usually, we buy things because we think we need them, but even that explanation isn’t waterproof. After all, why do we choose some things over others? In fact, the real reason we buy things has to do with the way we relate to other people and how we want them to perceive us. It comes from psychology and evolution. That interaction, that desire to seen a certain way, sits at the core of our consumption, and it’s been around forever (way before the word “cool”).  So let’s dive into the psyche and explore our desires, anxieties and rebellious instincts that drive us to want to buy things and be the coolest cat around. In these blinks, you’ll find out why cool products are the human equivalent of a male peacock's feathers; what part the medial prefrontal cortex plays in our desire to be cool; and why punk and rock n’ roll isn’t as cool as it used to be. You make decisions every day. Even just a banal trip to the supermarket is full of choices and decision-making. But our behavior – including deciding what to buy – isn’t just a single set of actions. It’s actually in motion, swinging between three pleasure machines within the brain. You’re not necessarily conscious of these pleasure machines. They’re subconscious, and affect our behavior in their own particular ways.  Let’s look at how they work: The first is the Survival pleasure machine. Quick and inflexible, this force operates based on reflexes that instinctively jump into action without a thought.  Say you’re having lasagna for dinner. You heap a huge serving onto your plate and, while chatting with your partner, help yourself to another one. You don’t even consider it. Why? Well, we humans are wired to eat as much as possible to survive! The Habit pleasure machine is the second force. It’s the one that guides your routines and day-to-day life. You probably have habits you undertake so often, it’s like the habit dictates your behavior. For instance, many people have a cup of coffee every morning right after waking up. As opposed to an instinctual decisions, habit decisions form slowly over time.  Finally, there’s the Goal pleasure machine, the rational and conscious force. It allows you to weigh the pros and cons of a decision, and then make an informed choice. For example, you might habitually always buy Italian salad dressing, until one day you see an ad for Caesar salad dressing. The next time you’re at the store, you change your routine: you find the Caesar dressing, compare it to Italian dressing and decide which to buy.  But the Goal force also has a social component. When you’re evaluating the two dressings, you’re actually doing so based on who you think you are and how you think others see you. In other words, you might go with whichever is organic, or locally produced, because you want to show that you care about healthy food and the environment.  Do you remember being a kid and being so excited about a new piece of clothing? Most people know that feeling of strutting into class, looking forward to their peers’ compliments, hiding the fear that their fresh new jacket isn’t that cool after all. In fact, people consume cool products precisely because of the need for social recognition and a fear of embarrassment. Even in the 18th century, economist Adam Smith recognized that we consume more than we need to survive. We consume to socially assert ourselves.  That’s because cool products, like some hyped new Nike sneaker, aren’t necessary for us to exist. Nothing about the shoe’s coolness is necessary for its wearer to walk or live. But legendary sneakers like Jordans or Chuck Taylors didn’t become so popular because they revolutionized athletics or the way we walk. They became famous because of their effect on street fashion – on a new standard of cool. So, how does your brain decide what’s cool?  By activating the area responsible for thinking about yourself and others. It’s actually located right behind your forehead and it’s called the medial prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is responsible for evaluating how others will perceive you.  Therefore, you might think you’re buying some sneakers because of you like the way they look, but unconsciously, your brain is telling you that the shoes will have a positive social effect. They’ll make you appear cool, boost your self-esteem and make you happy.  Interestingly enough, this quest for social standing and status affects the economy in ways you wouldn’t expect. But before we get into that, let’s see where this compulsion for cool comes from. Let’s get into the fundamentals. If humans have a need for status – and consuming cool things helps us get that status – we should first figure out where this need for status originally comes from. Well, up until this point the dominant perspective on consumerism held that it’s a product of unnecessary and artificial needs. That’s because the American economist Thorstein Veblen made the argument that a meaningless competition for social status drives our consumption. In his view, products are essentially trophies. For instance, if your friend buys the new iPhone, your desire to keep up in the contest will make you want it too.  But another economist, Richard Easterlin, made the argument that what really matters is relative income. In his view, we spend money and consume more than we need because we’re constantly trying to gain position in society relative to the status, or rank, of others. Other consumer critics hold that consumption is an unethical arms race in which we strive to outdo others in the battle for coolness and social status. The result is a modern society that irrationally wastes resources. But there’s another perspective, this time from evolutionary biology. It says that we instinctively seek status as a means of connection to others. Humans have been competing and cooperating forever, right? So products and consumption are just new ways of sending signals about ourselves to others in society.  For instance, just like peacocks use their tails to attract a mate, humans use cool products to gain positive responses from each other. We’re social animals by nature and rely on this positive feedback for our well-being.  So, while you think your friend bought a pair of Jordans because you have them, in reality his purchase was driven by a biological need for social belonging. It’s hard to gain status in a group if you’re not interesting to its members. This premise leads naturally into the next idea, which explains that, if you’re not interesting to a group’s members, you’ll jump at the opportunity to attain a socially-rewarding position in another group. That’s how new cultures are formed. In the course of forming new cultures, consumption becomes a form of opposition to the predominant social order. Consuming certain things and not others can help one group forge a new culture.  For example, in the ‘50s, an entire subculture emerged around blue jeans and leather jackets. Like James Dean vs. the square businessman, members of this group were seeking an escape from the conformity of the then-dominant culture.  Brands caught on and began manufacturing jeans and leather jackets, marketing them as cool. The result was the fragmentation and rapid increase of styles, each of which abided by a different understanding of cool and status. Hence the mods, rockers, punks and goths.  Actually, this impulse is not unlike Darwin’s concept of natural selection, in which species diversify to beat out competition. Instead of competing for the same resources – or status, in this case – we break into subcultures that provide a different opportunity for recognition. What’s considered cool also shifts depending on our standards and norms. Today, for instance, punks aren’t as revered in the media as highly educated tech-geeks sporting flip-flops and generic light gray hoodies. They’re definitely not punk rock, but they’re cool today because we’re obsessed with education and sustainable business models.  So, instead of standing in opposition to society, contemporary cool is all about changing society for the better. Consumption today is driven by innovation, creativity and unconventionality – not by rejection or transgression. Just take the success of the Toyota Prius. It couldn’t be further from the classic cool of a Mustang or Ferrari, but that doesn’t matter. Today something can be cool because it makes the world a better, cleaner place. The key message in this book: Contrary to what some believe, consumerism is not a sickness of capitalist society, but an impulse etched into our brains. In fact, we purchase items we think of as cool to seek recognition from other humans and gain acceptance in society.  Actionable advice: Test the power of a cool brand. Try buying one can of Pepsi and one of Coke. Pour each into a clear glass and serve them to a friend in sequence. Then ask if they prefer Pepsi or Coke and which tasted better. You might be surprised that they prefer the taste of the soda that isn’t their brand of choice, a testament to how our brains attach expectations and the associated emotions to brands.

Old political divisions between left and right were replaced by a shared emphasis on letting markets do their thing. That consensus was smashed in 2008 as the global financial crisis threatened to tank the global economy. Politics was back. Republicans and Democrats wrangled over the details of the largest bailout deal in American history, and European governments watched on as a banking crash morphed into a political crisis. These upheavals, Adam Tooze argues, can be traced back to the 2008 financial crisis. All in all, it’s been the greatest period of turmoil to have rocked the Western world in 30 years. So where does that leave us – is there a path back to economic and political stability, or will we be locked into our current predicament for the foreseeable future? The answers to those questions, Tooze argues, depend on getting the history of the crisis right. And that’s just what these blinks set out to do. Along the way, you’ll learn Why bankers speculated on the high-risk mortgages that first triggered the 2008 crisis; How policymakers responded, what they got right and what they messed up; and Why the political center has lost so much ground in the decade since the crash. Crises explode in a flash, but they usually have long, slow-burning fuses. The 2008 crash was no different. The financial dynamite that ripped apart the global banking system that year had been primed way back in the 1970s. That’s when US lending markets were first deregulated, making them both hugely lucrative and incredibly risky. Between 1996 and 2006, something else happened – US house prices almost doubled, while household wealth surged by $6.5 trillion as Americans cashed in on their properties. Demand for houses was sky-high. That’s when money lenders made the fateful decision to get in on the action and make it easier than ever before to get a mortgage. Borrowers previously deemed too likely to default on their repayments jumped at the opportunity to finally buy their own homes. The high-risk loans they were offered became known by a name that’s now notorious – “subprime” mortgages. So, why was anyone willing to take this risk? Well, that’s where securitization came in. That basically meant bundling huge numbers of mortgages together and selling shares in these “bundles.” In theory, that should have spread investors’ risk if borrowers ended up defaulting. As long as more people were servicing their loans than weren’t, the folks buying up the bundles would be fine. But that’s not how it panned out. In 2008, the American housing bubble burst. Homeowners didn’t just default on their loans, however. The value of their properties – the collateral underpinning the whole system – also plummeted! That created the perfect storm. Lenders were now repossessing houses worth a whole lot less than the mortgages on them. Unsurprisingly, shifting these properties was a tall order, and the mortgages themselves became worth little more than the paper on which they were printed. Banks that had heavily invested in subprime bundles now found themselves on the hook. On September 15, 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers became the first domino to fall. It’s not hard to see why: a shocking two-thirds of its $133 billion worth of securities were in subprime mortgages! The irony of it all? The financial industry was warned that taking too many risks would end in tears back in August 2005, when the Indian economist Raghuram Rajan addressed a gathering of top economic policymakers in Wyoming. The title of his presentation was “Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?” Needless to say, Rajan’s warning fell on deaf ears. As the crisis began to unfold, it became clear that European banks were in deep on some of the American financial sector’s riskiest lending practices. Not one to look on from the sidelines, the European banking industry had thrown itself into the US housing boom with gleeful abandon. If the banks didn’t have their own cash, they simply borrowed it from Wall Street lenders. Huge sums of European money soon ended up in American mortgage securities. By 2008, a full quarter of all securitized US mortgages were held by foreign banks – most of them European. Meanwhile, European banks held 29 percent of high-risk securities. The British bank HSBC alone pumped a cool $70 billion into mortgages in the US before 2005. When the crash came, there was no way out, and Europe’s leading banks found themselves at the heart of the unfolding crisis. The situation was dire – European banks realized they were in even deeper trouble than their American counterparts. This is illustrated by leverage. In investment lingo, that refers to the ratio between the money a bank has borrowed and the money it’s actually holding. Right before the crash, US banks’ leverage averaged out at 20:1. For Deutsche Bank, UBS and Barclays, of Germany, Switzerland and the UK respectively, the average was at least 40:1! That meant European banks simply didn’t have the cash they needed to cover their debts in an emergency. Both the Swiss and British central banks, for example, were holding less than $50 billion each when the crisis hit. The European Central Bank (ECB), the institution responsible for the Eurozone, had just $200 billion. All told, European banks were well short of the $1.1 to $1.3 trillion they needed to cover what they were lending. That was unsustainable. A full year before Lehman went bust, banks across Western Europe were sending out SOS calls. On August 9, 2007, the French bank BNP Paribas announced it was freezing all its funds – in everyday terms, preventing withdrawals – because the US property market was too unreliable. This triggered a mad scramble. Investors watched their peers panic, panicked themselves and then rushed to withdraw their cash. It was the twenty-first century equivalent of customers queuing outside banks in the 1930s, but with a twist. It wasn’t hundreds, thousands or even millions that people were pulling out of the financial system – it was trillions! Global financial markets couldn’t handle the 2008 housing crash. Soon enough, the whole system was imploding. By the end of the year, trade between the world’s wealthiest countries had fallen from $17 trillion to just over $1.5 trillion – the largest drop since the Great Depression. Over the winter starting that year, around 800,000 Americans lost their jobs every month. The US government didn’t hang around to find out how much worse things could get. The Federal Reserve nationalized large parts of the mortgage finance system and launched a program of painful but increasingly effective quantitative easing. That’s essentially a policy of printing dollars and using them to buy up mortgage-backed securities in order to reassure anxious investors. All in all, the Reserve injected $1.85 trillion into the cash-starved banking system. Members of the Eurozone – the countries using the Euro – weren’t nearly as nimble, and Angela Merkel’s German government stubbornly blocked a joint approach to resolving the crisis. But this approach was exactly what was needed to defuse the situation. Why? Well, the introduction of a common currency meant that economic lightweights like Greece could borrow at the same rate as powerhouses like Germany. When push came to shove, the former was always going to find it much harder to repay their debt than the latter. And that brings us to the second issue. Unlike the US, individual Eurozone countries like Greece couldn’t just print euros to get themselves out of trouble – the printing presses, after all, were controlled by the ECB. The only way to resolve the crisis was to coordinate members’ responses. That was the last thing Merkel’s Germany was going to agree to, however. There were two clearcut reasons behind the country’s stance. First off, the government was desperate not to alienate its voters, and nothing was as likely to do that as using their taxes to bail out struggling countries like Ireland and Greece. Secondly, that attitude had deep historical roots. When Germany reunified, conservatives from the former West resented “shouldering the debts” of the former East. The plight of smaller Eurozone countries left them cold because they didn’t want to repeat what had happened in the 1990s. That left just one option – leaving individual Eurozone countries to fend for themselves and resolve their debt issues on a national basis. As we’ll see in the next blink, some countries weren’t capable of that. With major European leaders like Merkel unwilling to sacrifice political capital and extend debt relief to smaller members of the Eurozone, states like Greece and Ireland soon found themselves in over their heads. It’s easy to see why. Take Ireland, a nation just half the size of New York City. Its leading banks had racked up debts worth more than 700 times as much as the country’s total GDP! As a bank run became more and more likely, the government stepped in and assured creditors that it would guarantee the debt of Ireland’s six largest banks. Keeping that promise was of course impossible, and attempting to do so bankrupted the state. Greece was in an even worse position. Before the crash, its deficit had added up to ten percent of its GDP. In 2010, it was scheduled to repay 53 billion euros to its creditors. It couldn’t be done – the country was officially insolvent. That was bad news for everyone. If smaller countries went under, there was a real risk that they’d take larger members at the heart of the Eurozone like Germany and France down with them. But Germany was still digging its heels in and refusing to back a joint recovery program. Radical measures were necessary if Greece and its debt-laden counterparts – Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus and Spain – were to be kept afloat. That’s when the International Monetary Fund, or IMF for short, stepped in to break the deadlock. Merkel and the American president Barack Obama were the key backers of the call to bring in the IMF. The German chancellor liked the idea because involving an international institution was bound to go over better with her voters than the ECB intervening on its own. Obama was meanwhile anxious that the worsening Eurozone crisis would undermine America’s own successful recovery. Calling in the IMF was a stunning humiliation for many Europeans. As a general rule, it was poorer, developing countries that had policy dictated to them by the organization – not wealthy Western democracies! But in the spring of 2010, the so-called “troika” composed of the IMF, ECB and the European Commission - the legislative body of the Europen Union - started doing just that in Greece and other struggling Eurozone countries. The deal they put on the table was simple. In return for bailout payments, these countries would implement extreme austerity measures. These went furthest in Greece, where the retirement age and VAT were raised, while public sector jobs and pay were slashed. The threat of economic contagion had been averted, but the political effects of crushing austerity would reverberate for years to come. The recession didn’t just affect the Eurozone – it also spread into the former Eastern Bloc. Economic upheaval led to the reemergence of old tensions – above all in Ukraine – as Russia and the West competed for influence. By the 2000s, the economies of ex-Eastern Bloc countries like Poland, Latvia and Estonia were heavily reliant on foreign investment. Take carmaking, for example. In the 1990s, 15 percent of European motor vehicle production was based in Eastern Europe, but 90 percent of the industry was foreign-owned. Caught in the middle of the historic rivalry between Russia and the West, these countries had to choose which side to draw that investment from: NATO in the West or the Russian-led Eurasian Customs Union. Supporting one side meant rejecting the other, and Ukraine had watched its neighbor Poland thrive after choosing to align itself with the West and, in February 2008, decided to apply for fast-track NATO membership. Two months later, Merkel stated that Ukraine would be welcomed into the alliance at a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania. That, as far as Russian president Vladimir Putin was concerned, was a direct provocation. Ukraine meanwhile found itself in its own economic crisis, with the steel industry at its center – a development both the West and Russia attempted to use to their advantage. At the time of the crisis, around 42 percent of Ukraine’s export earnings came from steel. But in 2009 its steel industry shrunk by 34 percent, hitting the country hard and leaving the government desperate for help. In November 2013, the IMF and EU made Ukraine their proposal – a paltry $5.6 billion in assistance. Russia decided to put a much heftier aid package on the table. Namely, a cheap gas contract and $15 billion in loans in exchange for joining the Eurasian Customs Union. The latter offer tilted the scales and the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych duly accepted Russia’s proposal. Pro-European protestors took to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kiev in the hundreds of thousands. Violent crackdowns ensued, but Yanukovych’s days were numbered. On February 22, 2014, he fled the country and was replaced by an interim government, which promptly signed the IMF-EU deal. Incensed, Russia refused to recognize the government and dispatched troops to annex the Crimean peninsula in the south and support Ukrainian separatists in the eastern Donbass region. Over 10,000 people have lost their lives in the resulting conflict. The aftershock of the global crash was also felt in one of the EU’s largest non-Eurozone members: the UK. Its tremors undermined the foundations of London’s financial sector and changed the face of the country, possibly forever. But before explaining that, let’s look at how London became the world’s number one financial hub in the first place. Between 1944 and 1971, the Bretton Woods Agreement regulated trading relationships between 44 countries. The system aimed to promote growth, simplify trade rules and reduce economic volatility, and one of its most essential parts concerned currency conversion. While it was in place, the value of members’ currencies was fixed to the US dollar, which in turn was fixed to gold. If you’ve ever wondered why the dollar functions as a kind of global reserve currency, there’s your answer! The Bretton Woods system also gave the American Federal Reserve and Treasury greater powers over monetary policy. That meant that banking was much more restricted and tightly regulated in the postwar US than it had been before the Second World War. As we’ve already seen, investment bankers thrive on risk. What they needed was a global hub with light-touch regulation, so they could take bigger gambles and make bigger profits. That’s just what London provided. From the 1950s onwards, the UK’s capital became a center for offshore dollar lending and borrowing. British, American, European and Asian banks all rushed to this new financial mecca, and London became the go-to city if you wanted to trade currencies, especially dollars. The crash undid much of that. By 2007, $1 trillion in foreign currency was being traded in the City every day, while 250 foreign banks were based there – twice as many as New York. But the 2008 crash hit London hard. Two British banking giants – Lloyds-HBOS and RBS – had to be nationalized. European banks based in London, like Deutsche, Barclays and Credit Suisse, also took a hit and found themselves at a disadvantage in comparison with their Wall Street rivals. In 2014, the British think tank Z/Yen ranked Wall Street above the City for the first time in its well-respected annual report. The future doesn’t look particularly bright for London, either. According to the author, the poor handling of the financial crisis and the ongoing Brexit process mean that American-Asian trade will bypass Europe entirely from now on. With Brexit negotiations proving such a headache and so many gloomy forecasts about what’ll happen once they’re over, plenty of people have been asking themselves why the UK ever decided to leave the EU. The answer has two facets. Firstly, there’s a long-standing tradition of Euroscepticism, both in the country as a whole and within the Conservative party in particular. There’s also a widespread worry that the EU will undermine London’s status as a global financial hub. The recession that followed the 2008 crash intensified these concerns. When the Conservative-led coalition took over from Labour in 2010, it implemented its austerity agenda. As cuts began to take a toll on the National Health Service and other social services, plenty of people started looking for scapegoats. One group fit the bill – migrants from EU states in Eastern Europe. There was also growing popular anger at out-of-touch elites in Brussels and London. By 2011, polling showed that less than 50 percent of Britons wanted to remain in the EU. In October that year, 80 Eurosceptic MPs demanded a referendum on constitutional change in the union. By that point, it had become impossible to ignore anti-EU sentiment in the UK and Eurosceptic MPs in parliament. In January 2013, the coalition government announced that it would hold a referendum on EU membership within the next four years. The prime minister, David Cameron, wasn’t opposed to Britain’s continued membership in the EU, but he needed to keep his MPs on his side. Holding a vote seemed like an easy win. Cameron also calculated that conditions would favor the Remain camp at the time of the referendum. Unfortunately for him, the Eurozone crisis wasn’t swiftly resolved, and the EU was still yet to offer the UK concessions on hot-button topics like integration and EU nationals claiming benefits. In 2014, Eurosceptic parties like the British United Kingdom Independence Party – UKIP for short – and the French National Front made sweeping gains in European elections. The fallout meant Cameron’s negotiations with the EU stalled. When the referendum was finally held in June 2016, all Cameron had won from the EU was a one-off cap on migrants’ benefits and a vague promise from EU president Donald Tusk that talk of an “ever closer union” wouldn’t apply to the UK. After an unconvincing campaign to remain in the EU, a small but decisive majority voted to leave. The legacy of the crash of 2008 was just as divisive on the other side of the Atlantic. The main sticking point? A growing sense among the recession’s victims that the people who caused the crisis didn’t just get off scot-free – they were actually rewarded. In 2008, $18.4 billion in bonuses were paid out by Wall Street. Some of the most notorious executives in the business were among those cashing cheques that year. Take the insurer AIG. In the run-up to the crash, it was responsible for insuring banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which were later bailed out at the taxpayer's expense. AIG didn’t hedge its investments – in other words, it didn’t have a plan B in case those banks needed an emergency payout. Given that insurance is all about risk management, that was negligent, to say the least! Fast forward to December 2008 and AIG was about go bankrupt with losses amounting to an amazing $61.7 billion – one of the largest losses in American business history. That didn’t stop the company from announcing, in March 2009, that it would be paying employees in its financial products division, the department at the heart of AIG’s reckless practices, bonuses worth between $165 and $450 million! That would have made plenty of folks mad at the best of times, but this was in the middle of a severe economic downturn. Millions of ordinary Americans who’d taken out subprime mortgages had lost their homes. In Florida alone, some 12 percent of all properties were foreclosed or abandoned in 2010. The idea that the system had been designed to serve the interests of a wealthy elite started to gain ground across the political spectrum. Voices on both the left and the right who would’ve been dismissed as crackpots in a better economic climate suddenly sounded pretty credible. On the right, the opinion website Breitbart told working-class Americans that they’d been deliberately set up for a fall. On the left, “Occupy” demonstrators raged against what they saw as a tiny elite hoarding the nation’s wealth. As they put it, “The system isn’t broken – it’s rigged.” On both the left and right of the political spectrum, voices like Robert Reich, Bill Clinton’s former labor secretary, argued that “the problem isn’t the size of the government but whom the government is for.” Billionaire businessman Warren Buffett suggested a 35 percent income tax on the highest earners – a policy which was promptly shot down by Republicans in Congress. The evidence that the government benefited only a thin margin of the population was mounting. Mounting resentment against the “establishment” finally boiled over in the 2016 US presidential election. Why did it take so long for alienated voters to vent their frustrations? Well, the 2012 elections hadn’t provided much of an outlet for disaffected Americans. Obama had a few choice words to say about Wall Street bonuses back in 2009, but he’d always made it clear that his priority was to prop up rather than punish failing banks. That’s hardly surprising – his administration was packed with people like Larry Summers – the senior government economist and Wall Street alumni who’d dismissed Rajan’s warning before the crash. And Obama’s 2012 opponent Mitt Romney, a banker and celebrated venture capitalist, was even more of an establishment insider. While the Democratic candidate ultimately came out on top, his electoral success merely masked the simmering discontent below the surface of American politics. In 2016, Americans who’d had enough of the status quo found candidates who seemed to be every bit as angry as they were. On the left, Bernie Sanders electrified his voters by harnessing their rage against the establishment and openly railing against Wall Street’s outsized influence on political life. On the right, Donald Trump – the richest person to ever run for the presidency – promised a break with business as usual and championed the interests of regular Americans. His top priority was to take on China, the country he blamed for destroying jobs in the US. In the end, the Democrats settled on Hillary Clinton as their candidate. The choice was a curious one in many respects and seemingly reflected the party’s complacency – after all, Clinton was known to be friendly with Wall Street and had made $600,000 giving speeches for Goldman Sachs! As became clear, many voters who’d gotten behind Obama weren’t convinced by Clinton, and around seven million of them switched to Trump in 2016. That was enough to swing the vote in key states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the business mogul’s favor. Instead of tackling inequality, Trump has slashed business taxes by 40 percent and raised the estate tax threshold to $11 million – policies tailor-made for the super wealthy and Wall Street fat cats. That leaves just one question: Where will all that rage go next? Given the extraordinary and shocking political events of the last decade, it seems likely that the crash’s legacy will be with us for some time yet. The key message in these blinks: Very few governments and institutions were equipped to deal with the fallout of the financial crisis of 2008. Their inaction and lack of coordination made matters worse, while their failure to punish those responsible for tanking the global economy enraged average citizens. This meant the economic crisis spilled over into a political crisis. After over a decade of upsets and upheavals involving everything from the Ukraine war to Brexit and Trump’s election in the US, we’re still experiencing the effects of the worst crash since 1929.

What to read next: Fault Lines, by Raghuram G. Rajan The financial crisis caught most economists and governments off guard. After years of growth, they’d convinced themselves that the new globalized, finance-driven economy was shockproof. But as we’ve seen in these blinks, there were a few sharp-eyed analysts who didn’t see it that way.

And, thanks to humanitarian organizations, we don’t have to rush to the region in crisis; all we have to do is donate to the organization and they’ll provide the aid for us. But does that donation actually make a difference? As you keep following the news, you may get the impression that even millions of donations won’t alleviate the suffering. In fact, sometimes, the more aid organizations there are, the more some conflicts seem to drag on and the stronger some warring factions seem to get. Indeed, you’ve probably heard that, for every dollar given, barely ten cents make it to the intended recipients. So what is it that doesn’t work about humanitarian aid, and how can we change that? Read on and find out what terrorists love about refugee camps; why it sometimes pays for a poor country to hire PR specialists; and why Caritas International gave money to the Tamil Tigers. What first comes to mind when you hear the term “humanitarian aid”? Probably, you think of the ICRC – the International Committee of the Red Cross. Founded in 1863 by Henri Dunant, the Red Cross was the first Western humanitarian aid organization, and countless other aid organizations have sought to emulate its commitment to the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence. Unfortunately, however, today’s organizations often fail to uphold these principles. This became clear in 1994, during the Rwandan genocide, when Hutus slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Tutsis. When armed Tutsi forces tried to fight back, thousands of Hutus fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 250 aid organizations provided them with medical care, food and shelter in refugee camps in Goma. The organizations present included various UN groups, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Oxfam and several branches of Caritas and CARE. These refugee camps effectively served as strategic centers for the armed Hutu forces, who then carried out further killings of the Tutsi people. The extremist Hutu government simply relocated to Goma and continued the genocide. The aid organizations knew about it, too, and failed to stick to the principle of neutrality by siding with the Hutus. This happened largely because humanitarian organizations are now commercial enterprises. Consider what happened when an Irish aid organization tried to cut down on supplies in protest of Hutu violence. When they stopped giving out extra soap and mattresses, another organization swooped in and started giving them out. Aid organizations, instead of working together, are often in competition. They incur sky-high costs, so once they set up in a crisis zone, they try to earn back as much of their investment as possible, which they can only do by winning donor contracts. In the competition for donations, humanitarian principles are often set aside. Humanitarian aid is supposed to be about easing human suffering. Sometimes, however, it fails to make life better for the people it purports to serve. In some cases, it can even make life worse. How is this possible? Humanitarian aid is often abused by warring factions. Providing aid in conflict zones is tough and often requires aid organizations to make problematic negotiations. When Sri Lanka was hit by the 2004 tsunami, for example, aid organizations couldn’t help with reconstruction without negotiating with the Tamil Tigers, a guerilla force seeking to establish Tamil as an independent state. The Tigers taxed every shipment of building materials that Caritas International imported. This increased Caritas’s costs by 25 percent – and helped fund the Tigers. UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, faced a similar problem in former Yugoslavia during the wars of the 1990s. Armed Serb forces set up roadblocks along key routes and UNHCR had to surrender 30 percent of the aid supplies they delivered. Warring factions can also take advantage of refugee camps; indeed, it’s now common for so-called refugee warriors – fighters in conflict-ridden zones – to hide out in them. Refugee warriors can regroup and reorganize themselves in the camps, where defenseless civilians also serve as human shields against attack. It’s estimated that they constitute as much as 15 to 20 percent of the total population of refugee camps worldwide. When Sudanese rebel refugee warriors launched a fight against their government from camps in Ethiopia, they referred to the civilian refugees there as “aid bait” – a means of obtaining more humanitarian aid. And of course, when refugee camps become strategic combat points, it only makes life more dangerous for the civilians in them. In 2004, Kofi Annan, the former Secretary General of the United Nations, tried to persuade wealthy member states to provide more funding for projects in the world’s poorer nations. It’s their right, he said, to receive funding. But that’s not really the case. Giving aid is a favor, not a duty. In other words, aid organizations are free to ignore a crisis if they so choose. To return to the example of the Rwandan genocide: the Tutsis received almost no humanitarian aid; all the money and resources went to Hutus in camps in Goma and the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Indeed, it’s not unusual for organizations to ignore certain crises. In fact, that’s the rule, not the exception. Jan Egeland, a Norwegian diplomat and aid worker, even compared receiving international aid to winning a lottery in which 25 equally desperate groups have to participate each week. Only one can win. Humanitarian organizations choose which crises to focus on based on their own cost-benefit analysis. They’re more likely to earn back their investment if they get a lot of donations, so they pick regions that attract more donors. Donors are attracted to crises that get more media attention, and so that’s where the aid organizations go. For a crisis to win the aid lottery, it has to get more attention, which means the victims must stand out from victims of other ongoing crises. Countries in crisis areas are now induced to fight PR battles to gain more support for their causes. In Palestine, for example, press officers are employed to try to garner international attention for the plight of the people. Few people from stable countries personally travel to conflict zones; instead, they rely on the media to keep them up to date on what’s happening. But aid organizations, in an attempt to draw more donors, often try to gain more media attention. And they often resort to unscrupulous methods. Aid organizations tend to exaggerate their reports from humanitarian missions. This happened when cholera broke out in a refugee camp in Goma during the Rwandan genocide. The outbreak was covered extensively by a number of journalists, and an international fund-raising campaign was launched almost immediately. A UN representative started holding daily press conferences in which each aid organization gave updates on what was happening. The organizations began competing, each trying to present the highest death toll, and the official number of deaths per day quickly climbed from 600 to around 3,000. The organizations also failed to report that some of the dead had really been murdered by extremist Hutus for their suspected disloyalty to the Hutu regiment that was based in the camp. Why did these groups exaggerate their figures? Again: money. Higher death tolls mean more media attention, and more media attention means more donations. Exaggerating the cholera death toll was profitable. Humanitarian organizations also try to garner attention by influencing journalists. Some organizations even embed journalists in their missions to make sure they witness the suffering there. They offer free flights and provide journalists with expensive chauffeurs and interpreters. In exchange, the journalists give them publicity. Many journalists develop cozy relationships with aid organizations as a result, which makes it even harder for them stay neutral. You might expect humanitarian aid workers to be extremely adept at dealing with the intricacies of crisis zones. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. Humanitarian missions teem with unqualified amateurs. Since major aid organizations like the Red Cross and UNHCR have been known to make grave errors, more and more amateurs are coming to believe that they can do a better job. Some now set up their own organizations, which are collectively referred to as “My Own NGO”s, or MONGOs. MONGOs aim to deliver fast and cheap aid, and to sidestep the bureaucratic processes of traditional NGOs. However, they often only end up contributing to the crisis they’re attempting to ameliorate. In Afghanistan, for example, religious American MONGOs gave out Bibles along with the meals they distributed. This, naturally, created tensions with the Islamic Afghan government. When MONGOs make mistakes like this, they often go unreported. MONGOs are typically funded by larger aid organizations that fear criticism of the MONGO will reflect badly on them. All this means that crises victims aren’t protected from the dangers of unqualified aid. This happened in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in a camp for amputees whose limbs had been cut off by rebels and soldiers during the decade-long civil war. MONGOs and private individuals took several child amputees from their families and relocated them to the United States and Germany, supposedly so they could receive better medical treatment. However, the children had already been receiving appropriate medical treatment in the camp – there was no need for them to be taken away. Victims of unqualified aid, like these children, have no protection against this kind of intervention. There aren’t any laws regulating the quality of humanitarian aid. Let’s take a closer look at a place where humanitarian aid hasn’t worked: Afghanistan. The United States’ War on Terror began in Afghanistan one month after September 11th, and with it came one of the greatest humanitarian aid projects of our time. It failed. Why? There are several reasons, but one of the main ones is that aid work in Afghanistan is often done through intermediaries, and money gets lost along the way. Aid organizations subcontract smaller organizations to carry out their projects, and those organizations usually subcontract the work again. A project typically goes through four to seven of these intermediaries, and each one absorbs part of the funds for their wages. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), for example, once set aside $15 million to build a road from Kabul to Kandahar. The money was then passed through three other organizations, each of which took six to twenty percent of the project’s funding. In the end, there was only enough money left to build a low-quality stretch of tarmac that was barely an improvement on the road it replaced. Aid organizations also usually fail to supervise their projects because they’re trying to keep them secret from terrorists. Fearing the Taliban, organization headquarters are usually hidden and people rarely go out to check on the projects they’re financing. That also means they’re not there to intervene when funds are misspent. Another problem is that, in Afghanistan, the line between Western military strategy and humanitarian aid has been blurred. The United States and Europe expect aid organizations to work as force multipliers – that is, to support Western military strategy and supply aid when needed. However, if humanitarian aid has a political slant, enemies of the United States consider aid organizations to be their enemy, too. In Afghanistan, aid organizations became targets for the Taliban, which forced these organizations to seek protection from military powers, tightening the bond even more. It’s a vicious cycle. So how can we make humanitarian aid actually work? There’s no simple answer to this question, but if we want to improve humanitarian aid, we need to change our understanding of it. First, we need to question the principle of giving aid at any cost. Blind adherence to this principle caused the humanitarian world’s “mother of all controversies” during WWII, when the Red Cross cooperated with Nazi Germany. The Red Cross knew about the Holocaust but nonetheless kept silent, fearing that lives would be lost if there was a ban on working within Nazi territory. They felt they had to uphold the principles of neutrality and impartiality, even in the face of Nazi terror. Today, the Red Cross considers this a “tragic mistake.” That tragic mistake has been repeated several times since, however. And, if we want to avoid such mistakes in the future, we need to reexamine the core values of humanitarian work. We have to consider how successful aid missions have been in the past, and whether the good they did outweighs the harm. Humanitarian work also needs to become more transparent. All aid organizations promise to “learn” and “improve” with every new campaign, but how can we ensure that they actually do that? In 1997, a number of aid organizations, in an attempt to address this issue, founded the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action (ALNAP). However, after monitoring accountability efforts for eleven years, ALNAP concluded that humanitarian aid work still lacked a coherent means for assessing performance. Aid organizations must be held more accountable, too. Journalists could be of great help, here – by staying neutral, for instance, and resisting the benefits that organizations offer them. All in all, the first step toward improving humanitarian aid is to assess it more carefully. Humanitarian aid should never be above criticism. The key message in this book: We need to think more critically about how aid work should be carried out. Aid organizations have now become commercial enterprises that strive to manipulate the media in order to garner more donations. They’re manipulated by warring factions, as happened in the Rwandan genocide, and they’re often poorly organized. When an aid organization makes big mistakes, there’s little protection for the victims. The nature of humanitarian aid needs to change if we want to ensure that it really helps the people it aims to serve.  Actionable advice: Before you donate, research.  Before you give money to an organization, read as much as you can about them. Figure out where your money will go. When you make more informed decisions regarding your donations, your money does more good for the people you want to help. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

That year, ten banks in the eurozone asked for bailouts and eurozone governments struggled to repay their debts. These blinks will explain why the crisis hit the countries on the periphery of the eurozone worse than the others despite comparable GDP growth rates among eurozone member states. They’ll also talk about possible structural reforms that would prevent a similar crisis in the future. In addition, you’ll learn why Germany wasn’t hit as severely by the crisis despite a higher unemployment rate; why austerity measures didn’t solve Greece’s economic woes; and what would happen if Greece left the eurozone. The economies in the eurozone area are all connected, but when the euro crisis hit Europe in 2009, different countries were affected in different ways. Some countries, like Germany (in the core of the eurozone), fared better than others, like Greece (on the periphery). What caused the differing impacts of the crisis? We can’t attribute the phenomenon to GDP growth rates, because these were similar across the eurozone. The GDP growth rate is a metric that helps determine a country’s economic health: GDP is a barometer for how much a country produces over a period of time; its growth rates describe the increase in output from one period to the next. In the eurozone, countries experienced similar GDP growth at the beginning of the 2000s. Greece’s GDP growth rate was about 4 percent, whereas Germany’s was 3.7 percent. So if GDP growth wasn’t a factor, can unemployment rates explain why Germany fared better than Greece? Unfortunately, they can’t either. In 2006, 8.9 percent of people in Greece were unemployed whereas Germany’s unemployment rate was at 11 percent. Thus, just like GDP growth rates, unemployment rates can’t explain the disproportionate impact of the eurozone crisis. However, there is one thing that can explain the imbalance: Germany and Greece had vastly different inflation rates, which turned out to be harmful for Greece’s economy. Inflation rates refers to how much prices increase over time. In 2006, Greece had an inflation rate of 3.2 percent while Germany’s was 1.58 percent, or half of that. The higher rate of inflation meant that Greek products were more and more expensive in comparison to German products, which made Greek companies less competitive. So higher inflation rates were a big reason that Greece was hit so hard by the eurozone crisis. But what was causing them? We all know that some countries can offer their goods for better prices than others. How can we describe this relative competitiveness? Experts describe competitiveness with a metric called a nominal unit labor cost (NULC). This analyzes a country’s competitiveness by dividing the cost of labor per hour by the productivity of labor. For example, if a country’s average hourly wage is €5 and, on average, one hour of labor produces €10 worth of GDP, then the country has an NULC of 0.5. Since the measure decreases when employees are working more productively or getting paid less, the NULC is useful for comparing competitiveness between different countries. If a country has a low NULC, domestic companies can sell their products more cheaply than companies based somewhere with higher NULC rates. And when you look at the history of the NULC in the eurozone, you’ll find that all numbers for this measure have gone up since 1995 – except in Germany. In fact, the NULC in Germany was almost stagnant from 1995 to 2008: pretty much nothing changed. In contrast, in countries like Spain, Greece and Portugal, the NULC rose considerably, meaning the wages of workers increased faster than their productivity. In Greece, the NULC rose by over 60 percent from 1995 to 2008; in Portugal, it rose by 50 percent. According to economists, Germany’s success was the result of the Agenda 2010 reforms, which aimed to boost competitiveness by increasing taxes for employees and reducing taxes for employers, which created more room for employer investment. This policy drove down German labor costs, allowing its companies to be more competitive and sell products at better prices than companies from the periphery. So how did German companies’ competitive pricing impact the eurozone crisis? To get a better understanding of the eurozone crisis, let’s take a closer look at macroeconomic theory. In macroeconomic theory, all countries have something called the balance of payments to record the country’s economic transactions with the rest of the world. This balance is made up of two components: the current account and the capital account. The current account is a nation’s net income. It includes the trade balance (the value of exports minus the value of imports) and returns on investment. For instance, if you receive dividends on an investment you made abroad (because the venture was profitable), this is a positive return on investment, which will positively affect the current account. There’s also a third part of the current account called net cash flow. This money comes without consideration or obligations. In other words, loans wouldn’t factor into this measure, though foreign aid would. If the sum of the three parts of the current accounts is positive, a country has a current account surplus. On the other hand, if the net income is negative, that’s a current account deficit, which must be compensated for by money transfers. Money transfers are important because they’re the second part of the balance of payments, called the capital account. The capital account is the balance arising from the different forms of money transfers, mostly investments, that flow into the country minus those going out of the country. These can be investments in buildings or machinery construction (foreign direct investment) or bonds or shares of companies (portfolio investment). If, for instance, a country has a current account deficit from having more imports than exports, it needs to have an equally high capital account surplus. This can be achieved by selling bonds to finance the deficit. In the end, this is all recorded in the balance of payments. Here’s what happened in Europe pre-crisis in macroeconomic terms: countries from the periphery, like Greece and Portugal, had a current account deficit from 1994 to 2008. We already mentioned one reason for this, namely, the decreasing competitiveness of their domestic companies due to increasing wages. The higher cost of products from countries like Greece created less demand for them abroad. This eventually resulted in a decrease of exports. Simultaneously, countries from the core with a low NULC, like Germany, could produce cheaply. This created a demand for importing their products into the periphery. As previously noted, these conditions produced a current account deficit in the periphery. To complicate matters, the money that financed this deficit came from the core. Germany, in particular, exported large amounts of capital to the periphery countries in various forms. German banks were not only lending money to banks and governments in the periphery but also making investments in machinery and buildings. Why would banks lend money to countries in the periphery given their bad economic outlook? There were two reasons banks from the core made these investments. The first was the 2008 financial crisis and the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which caused lots of uncertainty in financial markets, making it seem safer to lend money to banks in the periphery rather than to those outside the eurozone, i.e., in the US or UK. Why? Because everyone believed that even if a bank in the periphery ran into trouble, European governments would act to save it. Second, these investments were made because they seemed like they could be potentially lucrative. At the time, the return on investments was high and, before the euro crash, nobody thought a collapse was possible. When the euro crisis hit, which country do you think had the highest debt? Hint: It wasn’t Greece. In fact, by the end of 2009, Spain had more outstanding overall debt – both absolute and relative – than Greece or Portugal. Though that’s hardly surprising given that Spain’s economy was by far the largest of those three countries. But, even in relative terms, when we assess the amount of debt in comparison to the GDP of each country, Spain still had the highest debt. How high? In 2009, Spain’s debt was at €5,274 billion – five times its GDP that year – while Greece had comparatively little debt – €703 billion – “only” three times its GDP. So why was Greece seen as more culpable for the crisis than Spain? Because of different kinds of debt. One kind is domestic debt, which exists within a country when a bank lends money to a company in the same country. Then there’s external debt, which is a money transfer between countries. This kind of debt is also part of the capital account we discussed previously. And, for our purposes, there’s another important differentiator of debt: the debt sector. If a government is in debt, we call that public debt. On the other hand, the accumulated debt of private companies is called private debt. Of all the countries in the periphery, Greece had the highest public debt – far more than Portugal and Spain. In Greece, 53 percent of the debt was public; in Portugal, it was 27 percent;  in Spain, 17 percent. Since Greece had the same amount of domestic and external debt as Portugal, its high public debt was the main thing that set it apart from other countries in the periphery. Meanwhile, Spain had more domestic debt. But why was it so problematic that the Greek government had so much debt? If you’ve ever worked on something as part of a team, you’ll agree that it’s important to have rules for a successful collaborative effort. And since all countries in the eurozone were working together to manage one currency, they had to lay down some basic rules. The idea behind them was to avoid one country taking on too much debt and thereby affecting the international value and reputation of the euro. These rules took the form of the 1997 Stability and Growth Pact, which established guidelines on national debt levels. These guidelines were necessary because the countries that made up the eurozone were sovereign and could decide their own fiscal policy (government spending or taxation). Thus, the national debt limit of each country was set to 60 percent of the GDP. Furthermore, countries weren’t allowed to run a budget deficit above 3 percent of their GDP. To clarify, the national debt is what’s owed by a government and a budget deficit occurs when a government spends more than it earns. The latter pushes up the national debt. So the Stability and Growth Pact coupled with the decreasing competitiveness of its companies put Greece in a bad situation. Since Greece had such high public debt, it wasn’t allowed to engage in government spending to help its domestic economy because its budget deficit would have risen to unacceptable levels. Although infrastructure projects, e.g., building roads between economic hot spots, might have benefitted industry, Greece couldn’t invest in them. Additionally, the decreasing competitiveness of Greek companies lowered government tax revenues, putting the government in a straightjacket. Greece was trapped. Was there any way to improve the situation? Whether we borrow money from a credit card company or take out a home mortgage, most of us pick up a little debt in our lives. And what do you do when you’re in debt? You save some money to pay it back. When governments do this, it’s called austerity measures. Austerity measures can help restore competitiveness and reduce the public deficit. And that was Greece’s approach. Since the country couldn’t engage in government spending to invigorate the economy, it implemented austerity measures with two main goals: First, to bring down the wages in Greece, which would allow companies to sell their products at better prices. Greece did this by cutting wages in the public sector, and the wage cuts eventually spread throughout the whole economy. Second, to decrease public debt by increasing taxes and reducing spending on social services. Another way the Greek government tried to reduce public debt was through privatization, which usually makes public companies more efficient and enables the government to spend less. In 2010, the Greek government announced full privatization of casinos and sold 49 percent of the state railway operator.   Although these austerity measures were all serious efforts to improve the economy and did succeed in lowering the nominal unit labor costs, it couldn’t solve Greece’s economic woes. Why? Because all over the eurozone, other countries were taking similar measures which lowered their NULCs, so Greek companies didn’t actually become more competitive. In sum, although austerity did help Greece to a certain extent, the measures didn’t solve problems fundamental to the country’s economic woes. As we’ve seen, countries from the periphery were hit severely by the eurozone crisis. To recover, these countries tried austerity. But so far these measures haven’t been fully effective. Since the eurozone’s problems are structural, the best way to fix them is by reforming its structures. One such structural problem is the disjunction between monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary policy aims to influence the supply of money, i.e., the amount of it in circulation, and is controlled by one entity: the European Central Bank together with central banks of member states. However, there’s no such single entity to regulate fiscal policy, which relates to taxation or government spending. This ensures the sovereignty of member states, but it means there’s no European entity organizing fiscal policy to serve the entire eurozone’s interests. There are, therefore, two possible ways to reform this disconnect and help economies in the periphery. The first is to increase the European budget (the money member states pay into the central organization). Increasing the European budget by around five percentage points would create a €500 billion safety net for states with high public debt. However, for that reform to be effective, the eurozone would need a separate entity to decide where to spend the money. Thus, member states would lose some sovereignty. Politically, this wouldn’t be popular. A second possible reform is to abolish the Stability and Growth Pact, allowing states like Greece to engage in government spending to grow their economies. However, the more debt Greece accumulates, the more likely it is to default. And that would lead to the drastic devaluation of the euro, impacting all the member states. As it stands, although these potential eurozone reforms could improve the situation for countries in the periphery, they bear risks. But, luckily, there is one other option... Here’s some food for thought: What would happen if Greece left the eurozone and introduced its own national currency? Analysts suspect that introducing a new currency would lower the burden of Greece’s debt. The country would likely reintroduce the drachma, it’s old national currency. Let’s say the new currency, the new drachma, would be introduced with an exchange rate of one. That means every euro in the economy would be replaced by a new drachma. If a bank has an external debt of €100 million, these debts would then amount to 100 million new drachma. After this introduction, the currency would likely quickly be devalued; soon, each new drachma might be worth only €0.5. The bank would still be 100 million new drachma in debt, but the actual value of the debt in euros would have decreased by 50 percent. This process would drastically cut Greece’s public debt. And Greece would have an additional benefit from this scheme: its companies would become more competitive. Similarly to the process of debt reduction, the devaluation of currency would help companies in Greece sell their products more cheaply, domestically and abroad, because they would be cheaper in euros. Still, this approach would also involve major risks. First off, banks from the core of eurozone would suffer substantial losses as a sizable portion of their assets (e.g., Greek government bonds) would be worthless. This could eventually lead to a global banking crisis since core eurozone banks are heavily interconnected with US banks. Another risk is that investments in the eurozone might decrease because prospective investors would have reason to fear another country exiting from the eurozone, causing further economic losses. The key message in this book: Major structural problems led to the eurozone crisis, creating a disequilibrium in the economic competitiveness of different countries. Because these problems are so fundamental to the anatomy of the eurozone, the only possible reforms are structural – and each of the reforms comes with their own risks.

To this day, we continue to accept these small objects of value as a form of payment for virtually anything we desire. But have you stopped to wonder if this system is actually severely outdated in today’s highly technological and digital age? Well, some people certainly think it is – and that’s exactly why the cryptocurrency of Bitcoin emerged. If you have yet to hear of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, here’s your chance to get informed. With these blinks to Digital Gold, you’ll be walked through the world of Bitcoin, learning the essential ideas of what exactly it is and why it became so famous. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Bitcoin became connected with the Occupy Wall Street Movement; how (and why) Bitcoin is managed communally; and why it is so incredibly hard to hack it. On January 9, 2009, a mysterious internet user hidden behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto brought forward an idea that would change the financial world forever: Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital currency radically different from any traditional cash system. First of all, anyone can get involved by simply downloading its open-source code. Anyone can look at the code, examine what is happening under the hood, so to speak, and even help make improvements. This contrasts with classic software programs like Photoshop or Microsoft Office, where a closed group of developers build a program whose code only they can see and change.  Another way Bitcoin differs from a typical currency is the total absence of a centralized authority. Unlike a bank, where each user's holdings and transfers are stored privately, Bitcoin uses a communal database called the blockchain that everyone can see. The blockchain is like a giant public ledger that stores the record of all existing bitcoins and every transaction ever made. But instead of being located in one place, a brilliantly designed mechanism distributes this exact same record to every computer in the Bitcoin network. As a result, Bitcoin is not as private as the international banking system, where only you and your bank can access your finances. However, there’s also no limit to the amount of Bitcoin accounts, called wallets, that a user can own. And unlike a bank, all you need to create a new wallet is an e-mail address, so anyone can open an account and Bitcoin has the potential to be used totally anonymously. Bitcoin also updates traditional currencies by integrating powerful encryption techniques into its core. While a lot of cash withdrawals still rely on primitive PIN numbers, Bitcoin uses robust public-key cryptography that not even the most powerful supercomputers can crack. Public-key cryptography has two components: a private and a public key. When a Bitcoin transaction takes place, the public key is recorded in the blockchain for everyone to see. But only the users who made the transaction have the private keys necessary to decrypt the transaction and access the funds. By using cryptography in this way, Bitcoin is able to bypass centralized security systems like banks. After the financial crisis in 2008, people all over the world began to think about alternative ways of handling money. One major idea that became central to Bitcoin was communal management. In fact, two key Bitcoin structures – the maintenance of the blockchain and system updates – are both managed communally.  The blockchain is continually updated with new transactions in the form of blocks. Blocks are formed every ten minutes in a way that ensures everyone ends up with the same blockchain, no matter where they are in the world.  This is a crucial step because the blockchain records which transactions took place and who owns which bitcoins. By creating a communal record of the system, Bitcoin protects itself from hackers who would try to inject false information and create money out of thin air. The same mechanism of communal management is also used to update the whole system. To change the Bitcoin protocol, a majority of its users have to approve the proposed modification, no matter how slight. This means that no individual can manipulate the protocol to their advantage, and changes happen only after lengthy discussions on Bitcoin forums. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin is invincible: if a hacker managed to control 51 percent of the entire network – which is highly unlikely, especially as more and more people use the system – they could change the protocol as they wished and take control of the blockchain. But even then, they wouldn’t be able to spend anyone else’s bitcoins. The encryption is so strong that the hacker could only reverse his own transactions and block other people from conducting any themselves. We’ve all heard of the hidden black markets of the world, where shady dealers sell all kinds of illegal goods. But did you know there was an equivalent black market on the internet? Hidden deep in the Darknet, a section of the internet only accessible with anonymizing software like TOR, the Silk Road marketplace once allowed buyers to purchase drugs and get them delivered to the address of their choice. Bitcoin was the perfect complement to Silk Road’s anonymity; sellers were happy that Bitcoin transfers could not be reversed, and buyers felt more secure buying drugs without having to conduct a face-to-face transaction. In fact, Bitcoin proved so useful for Silk Road’s profitable black market that Silk Road became the principal source of all Bitcoin transfers. As Silk Road grew, so did the value and popularity of bitcoins. In February 2011, when Silk Road was born, one bitcoin was worth around $1. By mid-May of the same year it was already worth around $10. And by June 2011, after a senator called for Bitcoin to be eliminated, describing it as a form of money laundering online, its value rose to $30 within two days. Thanks to Bitcoin, Silk Road grew into a libertarian's dream: a highly organized marketplace that was self-regulated, anonymous, decentralized and beyond government control. By March 2012, Silk Road boasted 10,000 registered users buying $35,000 worth of product a day from vendors based in at least eleven countries. On the forums, security moderators explained the ins and outs of Bitcoin safety, and doctors advised how to best consume each drug. Silk Road came to an end in September 2013 when its owner, Ross Ulbricht, shared essential information with an undercover FBI agent. But Bitcoin had never been stronger – by then, one bitcoin was worth $140. What do cypherpunks, anarchists and supporters of the Tea Party have in common?  They’re all strongly opposed to government control in society.  At times, this mistrust of government can be well founded, such as when governments use their influence to cut cash flow to dissident political groups. Take the case of Wikileaks. In September 2011, WikiLeaks released the largest set of confidential documents ever made public: 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to the US Department of State from all around the world, containing top secret assessments of other countries and their diplomats. WikiLeaks’s goal was to reveal the true face of American power – hidden behind the handshakes and big business smiles.  But the US government fought back. They circumvented US laws and forced Visa, PayPal and Western Union to stop accepting donations to WikiLeaks, thereby eliminating 95 percent of its revenue. Some people suggested that WikiLeaks accept Bitcoin as a form of donation. Bitcoin developers debated the issue at length in their forums and eventually concluded that it would be too risky. The government scrutiny that would follow might prevent their still-young code from maturing to its full potential.  But people around the world had seen the malicious power of a government in action – and saw the value of a decentralized currency. WikiLeaks wasn’t the US government’s only challenge in September 2011. The Occupy Wall Street Movement, which was grassroots anti-capitalist, took control of Zuccotti Park in Manhattan, New York. And where there was a fight for freedom, so too was there Bitcoin. The Occupy movement was inspired by anti-austerity protests in Spain, contesting the government’s bailouts of big banks and not of the people. They were interested in Bitcoin as a way of receiving donations that couldn’t be frozen by any central authority, and as a place to store private funds that wouldn’t be undermined by the whims of the stock market.  The movement learned much about Bitcoin from the concurrent Bitcoin Meetup in New York, where Bitcoiners from around the world expounded the possibility of creating an alternative, freer way of organizing the economy.  The citizens of Argentina are all too familiar with financial experiments. The country’s history is riddled with financial crises and severe inflation, and many failed attempts to mitigate them. So, at the second official Bitcoin meetup in Argentina, many people were excited about the possibilities of the new currency. Soon, Bitcoin would break down many of the government restrictions imposed to control the value of the Argentine peso. For example, exchange rates for the US dollar had been placed artificially high, all PayPal transactions were banned and economists who spoke out against the policies were fined. And if you wanted to buy something overseas with a credit card, you had to deal with extended delays. The Bitcoin meeting organizers experienced this themselves. If they wanted to sell a $100 ticket through credit, they would receive 595 pesos and the transaction would take 14 days; but if they used Bitcoin, they could get 920 pesos in only two days. Bitcoin also became a way of protecting funds from government interference. People in Argentina typically kept their money in cash because, as in many developing countries, opening a bank account was difficult – and getting a credit card was even harder. But Argentinians had come to deeply distrust the government's currency management, as they had seen their money become worthless from rapid inflation on multiple occasions in the past. So when Bitcoin arrived, they saw it as a safe, stable place to keep their money, even though they couldn’t spend it directly in Argentina.  In fact, since early 2013, the Argentine peso fell by an additional 25 percent against the US dollar, while Bitcoin has risen by an astonishing 860 percent. In the same way that the internet liberated information and communication from postal services and major media corporations, some believe Bitcoin will free money from the strictures imposed by banks. And they might be right. One major advantage Bitcoin has over the banks is its capacity to transfer money instantaneously. We live in a world where it’s normal to transfer gigabytes over the internet in minutes or call a friend on the other side of the world in HD, but a bank transfer still takes multiple days. This anachronistic arrangement came into sharp focus during the financial crisis. The major bank JP Morgan Chase was on the point of collapse and needed funds urgently from a bank in Japan. However, the situation arose on a weekend and the next Monday was a bank holiday. So to save the bank, they were forced to write a $9 billion paper check and send it by mail!  With Bitcoin, it would have taken milliseconds. But Bitcoin beats the banks in another way: its digital nature makes it perfectly suited to the new economy of the internet. Bitcoin’s universality allows money to cross borders without foreign transaction fees. And as digital currency can easily be divided into very small amounts, online services can charge tiny fees, like 0.01 cents to read one page of a book or 0.02 cents to skip an ad. But Bitcoin is not only transforming the world of finance; its unique structure has many other applications too. Consider the core of Bitcoin, the blockchain protocol, as an example. Its powerful verification system allows people to build trust in a wide variety of circumstances. Since everyone can see the blockchain and no one can modify it, this concept can replace traditional legal systems of trust, like when someone needs a witness for the signing of a contract or will. In the past, an official like a notary or solicitor had to be present, but with the public blockchain, everyone can see that the contract really took place. Bitcoin has the power to fundamentally disrupt the way we use money. But the most interesting uses of Bitcoin have yet to be discovered. The key message in this book: Bitcoin is a virtual currency created and controlled by its users. Through its uncrackable cryptography and decentralized organization, Bitcoin fundamentally limits the power of governments and banks, and empowers individuals to transfer money around the world anonymously, safely and quickly.

Page","summary":"Did you know that there are over 35,000 types of spiders, 10,000 species of birds and some 440 varieties of shark? Such facts might make you wonder: how does such a small planet maintain such a wide diversity of life? Diversity stems from the gradual process of evolution through natural selection – a process so intricate, with so many variables (temperature, food sources, geography and so on) that it is inherently complex. In short, the complexity of our world breeds its extraordinary diversity. These blinks provide insight into the subtle dance between complexity and diversity, a dance which has led to the huge variety we enjoy in our world every day. In these blinks, you’ll discover how a Mini Cooper and a Jeep are both the same and completely different; why when it comes to diversity, smaller is actually better; and why there are more varieties of automobile than of pencils. What do you have in your refrigerator? You may have the same types of foods, like various kinds of cheeses. You’ll also have foods of different types, like eggs, milk and meat. Why is this important? The differences between these items illustrate an important theme: there are three types of differences between things. In other words, there are three types of diversity. First, there's diversity within a type. This kind of diversity is determined by the variations in the type’s particular characteristics. Think about a specific species of animal, like a cardinal. Each cardinal is unique – some are redder or have slightly smaller beaks – but they’re all still cardinals. They’re all the same species of bird. At some point, variations become so great that we can’t call them differences within a type anymore. Instead, we’re really looking at different types. Compare cardinals and flamingoes. They’re similar enough to be the same type: they are birds. Yet they’re distinct enough to be considered a separate species. Cardinals and flamingoes are thus different types of birds. The third kind of diversity is about the way separate parts are put together, called composition. Individual pieces can produce something quite different when they’re put together in a certain way. Think about a washing machine or an airplane. They’re both comprised of several smaller parts, like bolts, screws and a spinning engine. However, these parts combine to create something completely new and distinct in each example. So when considering diversity, we have three types. Diversity within a type can be called variation, diversity between types can be called variety, and then there's the factor of composition. But how are these sorts of diversity created? Read on for more. Let’s start by examining the ways in which diversity arises within different types. This usually begins when new individuals of a certain type are created. When a new individual is produced, errors or drifts can occur. Mutation is one such drift. It’s caused by minor changes in the production process. One of the clearest examples of mutation is in the development of life. Mutations in DNA result in offspring with slightly different characteristics. The tiniest DNA mutation can make a certain bird’s beak longer than usual, for instance. Inversion is also another type of drift. Inversion happens when the information that’s used to produce an individual gets inverted, or flipped, thus creating a new variation in that type. So if a code, like 10100100, gets inverted during the copying process, it could end up being 01001010. If an inversion happens within DNA coding, for example, it could result in a significantly different type. Think of an inversion like an inside-out spring roll: while it has the same ingredients, they’re assembled the wrong way around. Diversity within a type can also occur when elements from different variations are combined or transferred to each other. Recombination happens, for example, when two people combine their genes to produce a child. If the mother can be represented as 00000000 and father as 11110000, their offspring might be a random combination of the two, such as 00110000. Recombination happens in a cultural context as well. When musician Bruce Springsteen says Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan are his influences, he’s really describing recombination in a metaphorical sense. When elements transfer only in one direction instead of mixing together, it’s called transference. Transference is common in the products we use and consume. A cup holder, for example, can be transferred to boats, lawn chairs or cars. You’re probably familiar with Darwin’s idea that organisms best adapted to their environment are able to survive and pass on their genes. But shouldn’t this theory result in less diversity, as the few stronger individuals triumph over weaker individuals? It doesn’t, however. Evolution through natural selection has produced a tremendous diversity of life. But how can this be? The answer lies in the complexity of the world’s environments. Environments are shaped by a number of different factors, such as temperature, altitude, water presence or land type. These factors are constantly changing, as they're influenced by things like climate change or plate tectonics. These changing factors encourage diversity. When environments are constantly changing, the characteristics that allow organisms to survive within them are also constantly changing. A slight change in temperature could cause different plants to proliferate. Certain birds would then have to adapt to a change in food source. Over a longer period of time, these changes could result in the evolution of a new species. Another key feature in complex and diverse environments is the close relationships that appear between the different types within it. This, in turn, leads to even greater diversity. A successful species will go into decline if it uses up too much of its food source. Imagine a species of bird, for example, running out of worms. The birds will also decline if there's an increase in the number of predators, like cats. So diverse environments produce birds that rely on different resources and have different predators. The diversity of the environment is what allows a species to exist, as without such diversity, the species might go extinct. Ultimately, the world thrives because it's a complex space that's constantly in flux. The diversity across types, in addition to the variation in environment, keeps the world healthy. Imagine a simple chair. Which elements are needed to assemble it? A seat, legs, perhaps a backrest? There are an infinite number of chairs that can be produced depending on the way each of these individual elements are designed, and in the way the parts are put together. The multiple compositions of these individual parts is what creates diversity. Looking at it another way, we can compare two mammals, such as rats and humans. The cells these two mammals are comprised of are virtually identical. It's the way the cells are assembled that makes the two organisms so vastly different. Cars work in a similar fashion, as most cars are built with the same parts: engines, doors, air bags and so on. Yet how a car is designed and manufactured can mean the difference between a sturdy Jeep and a sporty Mini Cooper. So how do various types arise? A species needs to find its niche, or an environment in which it can survive and thrive. These niches set the stage for different types to proliferate. Successful restaurants, for instance, often rely on finding a niche in the market. A restaurant owner needs to create a certain kind of space in which his staff can tailor the menu and experience to a customer’s individual taste. The many variables involved can create a number of different niches for a restaurant to exploit. Even just two basic variables, such as spice or plate size, result in many niches: mildly spiced dishes served on family-sized platters; chili-rich dishes served as small, tapas-style plates; and so on. These niches can exist side by side, too. So in sum, even a small number of variables can result in quite a bit of diversity. How many ways can you build a house, compared with the ways you can build a bench? There are limits to diversity, and these limits are set by a large number of factors. For example, the number of ways a type's parts can be put together may be limited. There can also be a limit to a part's dimensions. We can understand this better by thinking about the formula XD, where D is the number of possible dimensions. The value of D has an enormous effect on diversity, in that the more dimensions, the more diversity. There are more models of cars than pencils, for instance. A car has many dimensions; that is, it can have several kinds of seats, doors, windows or colors. A pencil has fewer dimensions, so it by default has less diversity. A type's size compared to the size of its niche also acts as a constraint on diversity. Think of it this way: larger animals need more food and a greater space in which to live. For this reason, the earth maintains a greater number of smaller organisms, like insects and bacteria, and fewer large animals, like elephants and blue whales. Larger animals just require more resources to sustain themselves. The largest animals are found in vast landscapes for the same reason. Whales live in open oceans, while elephants live in African savannas. If there's too much interdependence between types, this also reduces diversity. When types rely on each other, they're much more limited in their scope. This is why there are so many more books than computer operating systems. Books aren't dependent on each other; and they're less dependent on other factors. Cookbooks don't rely on history books, for example, and self-help books don't rely on novels. Computer operating systems, on the other hand, need to integrate with many other types, such as other software programs, types of computers or servers. Which is inherently more complex: the seating on an airplane or the movements of people on a dance floor? Actually, the answer is neither. The first is organized in a specific order, whereas the second tends to be quite random. Complexity, however, is found somewhere between the two, represented by the acronym BOAR: between order and randomness. A system can have many parts and still not be complex. When you're building something with instructions, like an IKEA bookshelf, there might be many individual pieces but the process of assembly is straightforward. Randomness, on the other hand, is different. By definition, randomness is not complex. Consider the act of flipping a coin. The outcome will always be random. Adding more coins won't make it any less random or more complex. Complex systems have a mixture of parts, some which are orderly and some which are random. Think of “cakewalk,” a game similar to musical chairs. Participants play by walking around a clock on the floor, and they stop when the music stops. Then a number is drawn, and the person standing on that number on the clock is the winner. The game does have an order, as participants play according to a set of rules, one of which is that everyone walks in the same direction around the clock. There are also random elements: participants walk at different speeds, and no one knows when the music will stop. So in observing the patterns of movement in the game, it actually is quite complex. Complexity, by definition, isn't simple. The difficulty of explaining complexity is part of what makes it complex! You can describe something as complicated, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's complex. What's the difference? A technical device like a blender might be complicated, but it's not complex. It's easy to describe and predict what it can do. It's very unlikely that your blender will start making French toast, for example. So what is complexity? In a complex system, entities don't necessarily act according to rules, so the system is much more difficult to describe and predict. Let's go back to the game of “cakewalk.” Imagine if the participants stopped walking in the same direction and started moving in different directions. Some walk backwards, and some move sideways. The game would evolve, and it would be more difficult to describe and predict the game’s potential results. A complex system also has a number of tipping points. If any are reached, large-scale chaos can ensue. Part of the reason it's difficult to predict what a complex system will do is that huge changes or crises can occur quickly and with little initial input. For example, imagine a population of 100 people. At least 20 people need to start rioting for the population to lose its stability and fall apart. This might make society seem mostly stable and easy to predict, but that's not necessarily true. What if you only need ten people to start a riot that quickly grows to 20 people? If the society has other similar traits, it isn't as simple or predictable as you might think. One small change, then, can suddenly cascade through the entire system, affecting it tremendously. What's our most important skill in a tough situation? It's really our skill in combining the other skills we have. This is called robustness. Robustness is the ability to function in periods of disturbance or uncertain conditions. On average, systems with greater diversity are more robust than systems with less diversity. To understand this, think of a field of crops. The higher the number of crops the field has, the more it yields. In other words, more crops make it more robust. Imagine a field that only has two kinds of crops. Each crop has a mean yield of 100 pounds with a standard deviation of 10. So there's a 95 percent chance the whole field will yield between 80 to 120 pounds. Now imagine a field with 16 kinds of crops with the same mean and standard deviation. This field's yield would have a 95 percent chance of being between 95 and 105 pounds. A more diverse system is more robust, so it has less variation in performance. Systems with limited diversity tend to be susceptible to the same influences, which also makes them less robust. Think about a stock portfolio that's made up of companies that all rely on oil, like car manufacturers or airlines. A change in oil prices would directly affect the performance of these companies. Thus a stock portfolio like this would be less robust than a more diverse portfolio. Ecosystems work the same way. If all the species in the same ecosystem can be easily influenced by the same factors, the ecosystem is less robust. The Irish potato famine was a tragic example of this sort of weak ecosystem. Before the famine, almost all the potato plants in Ireland were of the same variety. There was little variation, so there was little diversity. When potato blight came to Ireland, it devastated potato crops, as potato plants (being nearly all of the same variety) were highly susceptible to the disease. What things do you need in a bedroom? A dresser, an overhead light, a bed? Would the room function better if it had several beds? Not really, as you probably only need one. The concept of diminishing returns states that when you add a certain type to a system, every time you add another individual of the same type, that addition is less valuable than the first added. New individuals still add value, granted, but less and less so with each addition. Let’s say we have to assemble a product development team. If our product is to be an app, adding a computer engineer would increase the team's performance significantly. Adding a second engineer, however, might be helpful but not as helpful as our initial guy. Adding a third would probably be overkill; and so on. Our team instead would really benefit by adding other types of specialists rather than more computer engineers. A diversity of skills would increase our team's performance overall. So instead of adding more of the same type to a system, it's better to add different types. This makes a system perform better overall. Let’s look at an example that contains a formula for determining how well a system is performing. A shopping mall has three types of stores: type A, type B and type C. The first store of each type might increase the mall's overall performance by 30 percent; the second store of each type by 20 percent; and the third store of each type by 10 percent. When we combine these performance percentages, we can get a sense of how well the system as a whole is doing. So if our shopping mall has one of each type of store – ABC – our mall has a system performance of 90 percent. Yet if our mall has two of one type of store and one of another – AAB – our mall has a system performance of just 80 percent. And if we’ve a mall with three of the same type of store – AAA – our performance is just 60 percent. In sum, a diverse mall will deliver better results. Think about a typical day, and all the things you do. Without thinking consciously about it, we participate every day in a number of very complex systems, from saying hello to a high school friend on social media to riding the train into work. What’s more, our world is progressively becoming more complex. What does this mean for the future? The pace of change has accelerated, and our lives are increasingly more interdependent and interconnected. This also increases the complexity of our lives’ “systems.” We've already seen how diversity makes complex systems perform better. This means that diversity today is more important than ever. Yet this isn’t necessarily happening. For example, the plight of bees has been the topic of much speculation, as a lack of diversity in their environment has led to colony problems. Bees require a variety of flower species to sustain themselves, so modern agrarian monocultures are potentially harmful. We could face a large-scale environmental crisis if bees were to go extinct, as many plant species rely on bees to spread pollen and assist in plant reproduction. Our complex world systems are also more likely to produce large-scale events, especially if we fail to diversify sufficiently. The 2008 financial crisis, for example, was caused largely by a lack of diversity in financial products (subprime mortgages) and strategies. Greater diversity would've made the system more robust. Even if the crisis had occurred in a robust system, robustness would've made it recover faster. Stock portfolios work in a similar fashion. A balanced portfolio, with a combination of stocks from various industries with varying levels of risk, might not always earn the highest profits but will be much more resistant to market swings. If one sector is hit, the portfolio won’t suffer much. A diverse portfolio is therefore more robust. The key message in this book: Complex systems have an intimate relationship with diversity. Greater diversity means greater robustness, which makes a system perform better. Diversity also encourages innovation, as it pushes types within a system to search for new niches in which to compete and thrive. These characteristics are true of all complex systems in the world, from ecosystems to financial markets. Suggested further reading: Simply Complexity by Neil F. Johnson In Simply Complexity, Neil F. Johnson presents an introduction to complexity theory, explaining what complex systems are, where we can spot them in everyday life and how we can benefit from understanding complexity. Although a young field, complexity science already offers us ways to help explain and potentially avoid complex phenomena, such as traffic jams, financial market crashes and modern warfare.

In the other corner stands Google, search engine giant and software visionary, armed with the strength of an open-source operating system called Android and leagues of phone manufacturing partners. Once friends, these two tech behemoths turned enemies, fighting for an ever-larger piece of the lucrative smartphone market. These blinks document how an early partnership turned into a legal dogfight, complete with backstabbing, closely-guarded technological secrets and piles of nondisclosure agreements tossed in the trash. In these blinks, you’ll discover how Steve Jobs was misled by his “friends” at Google; what gorillas, glass and iPhones have in common; and how many lawyers it takes to cripple a smartphone manufacturer. In 2001, the technology market was wowed with the introduction of Apple’s iPod. Yet the device had only one function: playing music. Meanwhile, Apple executives had been dreaming for some time of creating an Apple phone, but Steve Jobs didn’t share their dreams. He didn’t want to waste money and effort developing a phone that would only end up being meddled with by the large phone carriers, such as T-Mobile or AT&T. At the time, companies that manufactured phones depended on carriers not just for marketing but also for subsidizing a phone’s purchase price; thus carriers had a big say in the development of any phone technology. True to character, Jobs didn’t accept this situation, as he wanted Apple to have full control over any phone it developed. Apple instead focused its efforts on the iTunes Store, a service that offered music and videos for download. It launched in April 2003 for Mac and iPod users, as only Apple hardware had the software required to run iTunes. Yet competition in the market was growing. Other phone manufacturers were equipping phones with music apps that allowed users to download music from Amazon or Yahoo, for example. People no longer needed a phone and a separate MP3 player – they could have both on a single device. Instead of developing a phone that was compatible with iTunes, however, Apple partnered with technology company Motorola to launch a music phone called Rokr. It seemed the perfect fit: Motorola would develop the hardware, negotiate with phone carrier AT&T and then pay Apple a licensing fee to run iTunes on the device. Rokr was a flop, however. The device was chunky and could only store 100 songs. It could run iTunes but didn’t allow a user to download music from the internet directly. Yet this setback wasn’t of huge concern to Apple. In 2004, iPod sales began to soar, and at the same time, Jobs started to think again about an Apple phone. By the end of 2004, Steve Jobs was warming to the idea of an Apple phone. He knew that mobile connections were now fast enough to run a web browser, for example, or even stream video. Cingular, a phone carrier that was soon to be absorbed by AT&T, promised it would cede full control of product development if Apple were to ever develop a mobile phone. So Apple started development, with the lofty goal of creating smartphone features that had never been seen before. For instance, the company wanted to pioneer a multi-touch screen, which would allow a person to use two fingers to navigate. Today, using pinching or stretching gestures on a smartphone screen is commonplace, yet in 2005 phone chips weren’t powerful enough to run the graphics software required to interpret two-fingered motions. Due to these ambitious goals, Apple’s first prototypes were very large. Over the next two and a half years, the development team worked to shrink the technology sufficiently to make it fit inside a regular-sized smartphone. The company also found a way to manufacture a scratch-resistant screen. Early on engineers were frustrated with their two options: plexiglass screens that could survive a fall but scratched easily, and ordinary glass screens that didn’t scratch but shattered in a one-meter drop test. Jobs had an epiphany when he met with glassmaker Corning and learned about gorilla glass, which is the hardest glass in the world. Originally developed for fighter-jet cockpits, gorilla glass was the solution Jobs was looking for, and he convinced Corning to start producing it for Apple. With a screen made of gorilla glass, the iPhone passed all its durability tests. The phone screen didn’t scratch when shaken in a bag filled with coins; it even survived a fall onto a concrete sidewalk. While we take innovations such as gorilla-glass screens and multi-touch navigation for granted today, at the time such ideas were groundbreaking. Imagine you arrive at work one day to find that half the rooms and even hallways in your office have been sealed off and you can no longer access them. Although this seems ridiculous, it’s exactly what happened at Apple during the development of the iPhone. Jobs didn’t want any information about the iPhone to be leaked. So as development proceeded, he began to cordon off areas, limiting employee access. Over one weekend, certain common areas became off-limits to any employees not on an iPhone team. Some buildings were virtually divided in half. Importantly, employees on the iPhone team had to stay silent about their work. Jobs had team members sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), but even this step wasn’t enough. He also had employees sign another contract, confirming they had indeed signed the NDA! The bottom line was that if anyone was caught discussing the project with outsiders, they would be fired. Even the teams working on the iPhone couldn’t share information about their work with other iPhone teams. Engineers working on the phone’s electronics worked apart from people who worked on software, for instance. In fact, when the software team needed to test-run programs, they weren’t even given the real phone that the engineers were working on but had to make do with a simulator! Other companies that provided iPhone components were kept in the dark, too. Marvell Electronics provided the phone’s Wi-Fi chip, but the company didn’t even know the chip would become part of a smartphone, thinking it was for a new model of the iPod. To keep Marvell in the dark, Jobs even showed their executives fake schematic graphs of a fictional iPod project! Scott Forstall was a brilliant software engineer and had worked for Apple since 1992. Yet despite his successes, he still remained outside of Steve Jobs’s “inner” circle of favored developers. So imagine how Forstall felt when Tony Fadell, a relatively new engineer, quickly became one of Jobs’s favorites and was appointed head engineer for the iPhone project. Fadell had led the team that developed the iPod, and by late 2006, the iPod was generating 40 percent of Apple’s revenue. Apple’s initial plan for the iPhone was to first create a new, better iPod, then add a phone function. The device was to run the iPod operating system. Forstall had a different vision for the iPhone, however. He approached Jobs and suggested that the team instead develop a compressed version of OS X, the operating system for Apple’s Mac computers. Jobs liked the idea and allowed Forstall to take on the project, even though he wasn’t sure it could be done. At the time, mobile chips weren’t nearly powerful enough to run OS X. The operating system would have to be scaled down to a few hundred megabytes, a tenth of its size. Yet Forstall managed to do it. As a result, the rivalry between Forstall and Fadell heated up, and they fought about nearly everything over the next two years. When Forstall’s team was doing well, for example, Jobs allowed him to poach the best engineers from Fadell’s team. Forstall also kept his project a secret, and Fadell’s iPhone team didn’t even know about it! Insiders say their rivalry was partly fueled by Jobs’s behavior. He would seem to favor one executive’s team for a while, then switch to favoring the other, stoking their competitive animosity. In 2007, few people would have considered technology giants Apple and Google direct competitors. Google made its money from search ads, while Apple sold electronic devices. Rather, the two companies were on friendly terms. Jobs was friends with executives at Google, and several of Apple’s board members also served as Google’s advisors. What’s more, Google CEO Eric Schmidt was a member of Apple’s board of directors. Google was even a partner in the development of the iPhone. Jobs was keen to include Google software such as YouTube and Google Maps in the device, and so Google organized a special iPhone team to work on these projects. Yet at the same time Google was developing its own smartphone project. In July 2005, the company bought Android Inc. for $50 million and put Android cofounder Andrew Rubin in charge of its project. Rubin worked on the Android smartphone operating system in secret, and only a few top Google executives knew that the company had partnered with phone manufacturer HTC to develop a new kind of smartphone. The first phone Google developed was similar to the BlackBerry device and was called the Sooner. Yet the device was not successful, primarily because it was released on the heels of the far more impressive iPhone in 2007. Jobs had succeeded in creating a smartphone with a multi-touch screen and a cutting-edge design – and it overshadowed the Sooner completely. The Android team dropped the Sooner shortly afterward and set to work on the Dream. This new project was to offer features that even the iPhone didn’t have, such as a 3G connection, a copy-and-paste function and Google Street View. Jobs presented the Apple iPhone at MacWorld on January 9, 2007. True to form, his presentation was flawless. The engineers sweated out the whole event, however. They knew the device was far from being ready for the market. For instance, when the phone processed too many tasks at once, it ran out of memory and crashed. Jobs secretly used several iPhones during his presentation, switching to a new phone whenever one device froze. While Jobs could hide this glitch during his presentation, the next step could have been the company’s undoing, as the iPhone was scheduled to launch on June 29. Jobs’s team had a number of problems to overcome. The phone’s virtual keyboard still didn’t work. Multiple letters would pop up when a user touched one key, and only after an irritating lag time. What’s more, engineers still hadn’t figured out how to properly embed multi-touch sensors into the gorilla-glass screen. The phone’s tiny antenna was presenting problems, too. The manufacturing company couldn’t mass produce them properly, and transmission performance was unreliable. Despite these challenges, Apple managed to meet its deadline. The international media covered the June 29 launch as if it was a historic event, and the iPhone remained in newspaper headlines for weeks. Stories captured young Apple enthusiasts rushing to touch and purchase the iPhone as if it were a sacred relic! In the first two days, Apple sold 270,000 iPhones, and went on to sell another 3.4 million over the next six months. Friends had warned Jobs about Google’s secret Android project, but he didn’t take their warnings seriously. On November 5, 2007, Andrew Rubin held a press conference to announce the development of the Android operating system and a newly founded Open Handset Alliance, or OHA. This was a consortium of 34 phone producers, software developers and carriers, including T-Mobile, Ebay, Intel and Sony. Jobs didn’t like this at all. The Android mobile operating system would be open source, so that any phone manufacturer could use it. Once this platform launched, it would be in direct competition with Apple’s iOS. The goal of the Open Handset Alliance was to develop open, shared standards for mobile devices instead of having companies develop proprietary software, like Apple had done with its iOS. Google aimed to promote Android devices on the basis of their open-source operating system, which the company itself would benefit from in turn. The following week, Google released a video in which cofounder Sergey Brin and Android engineering director Steve Horowitz were shown playing with different phones. One Android phone offered features that the iPhone didn’t have, such as Google Street View. Jobs felt that the Android phone was basically a knock-off of the iPhone and confronted Google executives about it. They initially reassured Jobs that the phones that were featured in the video were just prototypes for testing the Android OS, and not actually new smartphone models. Jobs mistakenly believed them, as he considered these executives his friends. However, in mid-2008 he learned that Google was planning to release a new phone with iPhone-like features, such as swipe navigation. He threatened to sue Google if the company released a multi-touch smartphone, a feature that Apple had patented. The two sides met for a long meeting. Jobs demanded that certain features be withheld from the new Google phone. Google executives complied, but not for long. While the first smartphone running the Android operating system, the HTC Dream, turned out to be a flop, better ones were on the way. Google was in the process of developing other Android phones with multi-touch features, despite Jobs’s legal threats. In late 2008, Google partnered with Motorola and Verizon to develop a second Android phone, the Droid. It was released in October 2009, and Google marketed it by highlighting features that the iPhone didn’t have, such as the ability to run several tasks at once. In its first three months on the market, the Droid sold better than the iPhone! Then in January 2010, Google released a software update that enabled multi-touch navigation on the Droid. That same month, the company partnered with HTC again to release a third Android phone, the Nexus One, which also offered multi-touch features. As a result, Jobs quickly began legal proceedings over patent infringement, and this opening salvo kicked off a long battle between Apple and Google. While Jobs would have preferred to sue Google directly, he knew he was better off taking the phone manufacturers to court for copying patented iPhone features. After all, Google didn’t actually manufacture its phones, and it gave away its Android software for free. First Jobs sued HTC, the Taiwanese maker of the Nexus. And as Android began to be used in other smartphones, Apple filed patent lawsuits in nearly every industrialized country. By 2012, Apple had about 50 pending lawsuits in at least ten countries just against Samsung, the top distributor of Android-based smartphones. Apple hired 300 lawyers from 50 law firms to process the Samsung suits alone! In the summer of that same year, Apple won a $1 billion judgment in its high-stakes fight against Samsung. Sure, Apple wanted to protect the iPhone’s special features, but it also wanted to weaken its now biggest competitor in the smartphone market. Steve Jobs criticized Google publically at every turn, from 2008 until his death on October 5, 2011. And all the while, Google fought back in the market, releasing new products to chip away at the iPhone. In 2008, Google launched a new application called Google Voice that extended its mobile reach even further. This app allowed a person to make free voice calls online, combining phone numbers and email addresses into a single identification number. If someone calls you over Google Voice, your phone rings and a transcript of the caller’s voicemail is sent to your email. Considering how Google Voice functions, using the application meant that a user’s full contact database would end up on Google’s servers, even if that user was calling over an iPhone. This app could crush Apple, and the company knew it. As a result, when Google offered Google Voice to Apple for inclusion on the iPhone, Jobs rejected the offer. But this move made Apple look bad, as the company was withholding a popular and useful app from its user base. Amid the back and forth, media outlets began to portray Jobs as a control freak, and Apple users were turned off by the endless drama. The Federal Communications Commission even looked into the matter, suspecting that Apple was potentially violating FCC regulations by refusing to allow Google’s app on the iPhone. Jobs eventually caved in and included Google Voice in the Apple iTunes app store. Apple responded, however, by attacking Google’s dominance in mobile advertising and creating a service to replace Google Maps. In 2010, Apple launched its advertising platform, iAd. Just three years later, the company had already earned $200 million from this service. And in 2012, Apple revealed its alternative to Google Maps and incorporated the software in the iPhone 5. Yet Apple Maps failed terribly on release, as its maps misled drivers and even showed an incorrect location for the famous Washington monument in Washington, D.C. These developments were far from the end of the battle between Apple and Google, which seems set to continue for years to come. The key message in this book: Google and Apple started out as friendly companies with shared goals. As the market for mobile internet gained traction, however, the two firms began competing directly with each other in an effort to dominate the young industry, eventually ending up in the courts. Along the way, users have enjoyed an ever-improving stream of iPhones and Android-based smartphones.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

This analysis seems awfully cold and unromantic – an utterance more appropriate to lab workers than to lovers. Most of us want to believe that the laws of love transcend the harsh logic of supply and demand. But, as you’ll learn from these blinks, many of our “romantic” choices aren’t all that different from our buying decisions. If you can briefly ignore the protestations of the heart, you’ll be amazed at how economic factors influence our decisions about love and life partnership. In these blinks, you’ll learn what’s wrong with many online dating sites; how income inequality can lead to divorces; and why there are fewer virgins in colleges with fewer male students. If you were to compare your views on sexuality to those of your grandparents, there’s a good chance that your attitude would prove to be the less conservative one. Over time, most societies have grown more promiscuous, and that’s no longer a sign of declining morality. Today’s educated and independent women are more promiscuous than those of previous generations, and there’s an interesting economic explanation. The women of today can afford to be promiscuous. Most fundamentally, they have the means to buy their own contraceptives, which protect them from STDs and inopportune or unwanted pregnancies. What’s more, today’s women are sufficiently empowered to insist that the contraceptives are used correctly. If we go back just one or two generations, women weren’t half as free. Unmarried women who maintained sexual relationships with more than one man were essentially pariahs. They were publicly shamed and their reputations were forever tarnished. Today, however, premarital and extramarital relationships are far more socially acceptable. So are pregnancies that result from such relationships. Since the average educated woman earns much more now than she would have a generation ago, she is in a position to raise a child on her own if she so desires. And, if she chooses to terminate the pregnancy, that is also a socially acceptable, not to mention affordable, decision. Thanks to these developments, women today are better able to cope with the difficulties that often accompany an unexpected pregnancy. You might think that the introduction of safe and reliable contraceptives such as birth control pills would reduce pregnancies. However, premarital birth rates have actually increased over the years. This might sound contradictory, but remember that as contraceptives improved, the potential financial and social risks surrounding premarital sex dramatically decreased, leading to more active sex lives. If we go back to 1925, an unmarried woman actually had an 85-percent chance of getting pregnant if she had unprotected sex with a man. Back then, that was an even bigger deal than it is today. A premarital pregnancy would result in a damaged reputation and make it much harder to find a job or a husband. But it could also have major financial consequences. Let's apply some basic economics to this scenario. Say her lifetime income in 1925 is $45,000. We can take that 85-percent chance of pregnancy and multiply it by $45,000 to get the potential cost of premarital sex in 1925: 0.85 X $45,000 = $38,250. But let’s take this scenario a step further. If condoms had been available in 1925, it would have reduced the probability of pregnancy to 45 percent. While this wouldn’t change how much income was at risk, the potential cost of premarital sex would drop to $20,250. As risks decrease, it’s only natural that more people decided it’s worth it to have premarital sex. And when we add more lenient cultural attitudes toward promiscuity to the equation, people become even more willing to have intercourse before marriage. Such attitude changes happen gradually, however. People in liberal areas begin having premarital sex without getting stigmatized, which gets noticed by those living in more conservative areas. Eventually, those in the conservative areas shed their fear of other people’s opinions. In the long run, the more liberal attitude prevails. But as great as contraceptives are, they’re never 100-percent effective. In fact, 45 percent of all sexually active women still end up getting pregnant at some point, which is how we end up with a lot more pregnancies than before the introduction of contraceptives. If you didn’t get lucky in college, don’t feel too bad. After all, the marketplace may not have been in your favor. That’s right, when we look at sexual activity on college campuses, we can clearly see the laws of supply and demand in action. Unsurprisingly enough, heterosexual male students stand a better chance of having sex before graduation if they attend a college with a higher female population. And, happily for these heterosexual male undergrads, the number of female college students is on the rise. Indeed, at many colleges, the number of females exceeds the number of males. In fact, in Canada, only 42 percent of college students are male. In economic terms, colleges are a “buyer’s market” for heterosexual male students; their power in the overall sex marketplace increases as the number of female students increases. It’s straightforward supply and demand: if there’s an abundance of a certain product or service, all the competition ends up driving the price down. But in today’s particular marketplace, the women are the ones with the overabundance of (so to speak) goods and services. In this “sex market,” the women will put a lower “price” on their availability and might be more willing to push their limits and be more likely to offer sexual intimacy to interested young men. All because of these “market” forces. According to studies conducted by the authors Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker, in their book Premarital Sex in America, if a college campus is predominantly male, a female has a 45-percent chance of keeping her virginity. But the number drops to just 30 percent when the campus is predominantly female. All this suggests that, when men are scarce, women feel the need to change their attitudes about when they should or shouldn’t become sexually active. If you’ve had any experience with online dating, you know that these sites can have thousands of active members, and that it’s impossible to find the time to inspect every single profile. So, instead of scrolling for all eternity, you rely on the questions the site asks. You check a few boxes about your likes and dislikes, and you hope for the best. However, the extremely broad questions these dating sites ask often make the market ridiculously thin – drastically reducing the likelihood of your finding your ideal partner. Criteria like preferred age and height can shrink the marketplace of the online dating pool dramatically. Such a shrunken marketplace is, in economic terms, called “thin.” A thin market is one where it’s hard to find anyone to “trade” with because there are so few buyers or sellers interested in the same thing. In this kind of environment, you get people who are missing out on other opportunities and settling for bad deals. Such markets tend to leave no one satisfied. And the online dating marketplace usually isn’t very satisfying. Two people who might be the perfect match are forced to put in restrictive criteria that only serve to limit the chances of their meeting or even getting the chance to chat. So, to create a healthy marketplace that’ll be better at helping people find their soul mate, online dating services should de-emphasize quantitative data like height, and incorporate more experiential criteria. Experiential criteria are more reliable because they’re based on how we actually experience and interact with people. Thus, they’re less limiting. After all, a person’s sense of humor is more important than the size of their bank account or their TV-watching habits. Think of someone you really love. What are the chances that they would’ve made it through the filters imposed by strict dating-site criteria? It’s likely your true love could be a few inches taller or earn a little less money than your ideal preferences would indicate! Have you ever wondered why people get married? It’s a fair question. And, in truth, the answer likely has more to do with economics than romance. A household isn’t unlike a business with demands that need to be met. Like business partners, partners in marriage are, ideally, two people with complementary skills – skills that allow them to satisfy household demands better than either partner would alone. So marriage makes good business sense, since two people can maintain a household more efficiently than one – whether the household requires outside goods and services or the maintenance of in-house functions. And a well-functioning household presents a lot of jobs, or “services”: cleaning, laundry, keeping track of bills, the purchase of groceries. With two people, there’s a better chance that all of these jobs will be done well. Perhaps one person is better at carpentry while the other has a knack for bookkeeping; by dividing the jobs to suit the strengths of each partner, the household can be run successfully and efficiently. This applies to the bedroom as well. In economic terms, sex could be considered both a “good” that individuals need and a “service” that marriage provides in a more efficient manner. A lot of time and effort can be spent trying to acquire sex in the marketplace, so it makes good economic sense to have it be a part of your household. It also removes the risk of disease, violence and humiliation that comes with dating, and the risk of arrest that comes with an illegal sex market. It’s hard to argue that sex isn’t more efficiently provided within a marriage. According to a 2004 study by economics professors David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald, 76 percent of people who are married have sex two to three times per month, while only 57 percent of unmarried people report the same frequency. Have you ever wondered why some societies accept polygamous marriages? Though the idea of a man taking multiple wives might seem strange to you, there are, in some countries, clear reasons to condone the practice – specifically, economic reasons. From an economic standpoint, it makes good sense that a woman would prefer becoming the second or third wife of a wealthy man than the first and only wife of a poor man. While being an additional wife might come at a “cost,” that cost is nonetheless outweighed by the benefits. The advent of a new wife might impose a psychological cost on the rich man’s first wife, too, but, since each wife is economically better off than before, it’s worth it. And if the rich husband is happy, everyone wins, right? Well, yes and no. When you reduce the number of poor men and uneducated women, polygamous partnerships start to make less sense. After the Industrial Revolution and the move to the cities, it was better for men to have a few smart children rather than the many children who were necessary to maintain a vast farmland. Children needed to be smart in order to land a decent job, and the best way to ensure intelligence was to make sure their mother was an educated woman. These new economic necessities actually proved to be a boon for women, since the increased demand for skilled wives also gave women more freedom to choose a husband. Naturally, an educated woman with a range of skills is more likely to achieve financial independence. She will have the wherewithal to provide for herself and therefore needn’t resort to becoming someone’s second or third wife. If she so desired, she could even marry a penniless man. So, polygamy tends to become less common as societies become more educated. And, as we’ll learn next, education is also what keeps a monogamous relationship together. Most of us probably think that love is the glue that keeps most marriages together. But money and education play big roles as well. According to a recent study conducted by economics professors Philip Oreopoulos and Kjell Salvanes, those with a postgraduate degree only have a 3-percent chance of getting divorced, while those with a high school diploma have a 16-percent chance. It’s not that people with an advanced degree are better able to find a perfect match; it’s that people with a better education usually make more money. Financial instability tends to lead to stress, which is a well-known marriage-killer. Picture a small neighborhood where each family’s house looks the same. Each person wears similar clothes and drives similar cars. Now imagine one family begins to earn much more money. They build a fancy new house and start buying expensive new clothes and cars. The rest of the community would likely start to feel as though they deserved these things, too; no family wants to look like the poorest on the block. Maybe one or two families would start saving up, but, in reality, most would start taking out loans and racking up debt, making their situation worse and entering a downward spiral. When a family hits economic hardship like this, it creates a tough and stressful situation. As the threat of bankruptcy looms, they might take on more work, further increasing the stress, and, before long, the marriage will start to come apart at the seams. Unfortunately, this kind of economic inequality – and the marriage-killing status anxiety that goes along with it – is extremely common. The research of economists Adam Levine, Robert Frank and Oege Dijk shows that countries with high levels of inequality also have high rates of divorce. In fact, they’re so tightly linked that a 1-percent increase in a country’s financial inequality will increase its divorce rate by 1.2 percent. In other words, as a select portion of society reaps the benefits of financial gain, the matrimonies of the less financially fortunate suffer. The key message in this book: The world of love and sex isn’t merely a matter of oceanic desires and emotions. Our choices and their consequences actually make a whole lot of sense when we look at things from an economic standpoint. In fact, the logic of economics explains the otherwise mystifying world of dating, marriage and divorce. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

No event in recent decades has shaken the world to such an extent. Banks fell, governments went bankrupt and millions of people around the world lost their jobs and livelihoods. And yet, what has actually changed in the years since? You’d think that governments would have acted swiftly to implement policies to stop such a disaster from happening again – but they never did. Instead, the neoliberal policies that caused the disaster have persisted. Why? It all comes down to the type of language we use. When describing the economy and the financial collapse, we do so in terms that benefit conservatives. These blinks show you how this happens and, crucially, highlight some better ways to describe the economy – ways that inspire change and progress. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you should describe the economy like a car rather than a person; why it’s unwise to call the financial crisis a financial crisis; and how we can knock down the barriers to equality. Open up any newspaper and you’ll encounter politicians, analysts and journalists attributing all of society’s economic problems to the 2007 financial crisis. But in reality, there were deep economic problems long before that, especially with respect to wealth and income inequality. In the decades leading up the crisis, real wages (adjusted for inflation) were stagnant, even while corporate profits were skyrocketing and overall economic productivity was on the rise. As a result of these factors, wealth moved toward the top of society: today, 84 percent of wealth in the United States is owned by just 20 percent of Americans. And that’s a problem for two reasons, the first being psychological: studies show that societies with greater levels of inequality have lower levels of contentment overall, with grave psychological consequences for those at the bottom. The second reason is economic: the United States is dependent on consumer expenditure for economic growth. Since declining wages – and thus, declining disposable income – reduce consumer demand, economic output also declines as a result. So, as we’ve established, inequality was a problem long before the 2007 financial crisis. But that doesn’t mean that the economic collapse didn’t add insult to injury. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 25 percent of American households experienced zero or negative net growth in 2009, up from 18.7 percent of households in 2007. And even more shockingly, that number rises to 40 percent when only taking into account African-American households. Worst of all, individuals facing foreclosure, poverty and unemployment received no federal assistance after the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the financial sector was bailed out by the government. Taken together, the crisis revealed the intense financial pressure facing households in the United States’ middle- and low-income brackets. In the following blinks, we’ll find out how Americans responded, and whether the downturn led to any meaningful policy changes. We’ve just learned that the 2007 financial crisis exacerbated existing economic problems in the United States. However, the crisis did raise public awareness of income inequality and injustice. Following the financial collapse, there has been unprecedented public interest in political and economic issues, as well as widespread anger about the unfair system currently in place. Consider the fact that, in October 2008, Pre Research found that a full 70 percent of the notoriously apathetic American voting public was following economic news (the previous peak was 49 percent during the 1993 recession). Just think of Barack Obama’s successful 2008 presidential campaign, carried largely by a narrative of changing America to make it a fairer place, a stance that epitomized the public mood. It’s also worth noting that in this time of upheaval, progressive academics and policy experts appeared in the media more than ever before. Prior to the collapse, airtime went mainly to those who agreed with the conservative neoliberal agenda. But in the aftermath, the media finally started listening to left-wing economists and those with progressive views. Despite the public anger and the influx of progressive voices, however, nothing really changed. Ultimately, the conservatives won the post-2007 argument. Their message was that government interference in the economy had caused the crisis, and they argued that to solve the country’s economic woes, the government had to back off. If you look at the post-crisis elections, this message clearly got through to voters: Republicans won back Congress in the 2010 midterm elections. At the same time, the United States witnessed the rise of the anti-government, pro-free market Tea Party movement. In fact, according to a 2011 Bloomberg poll, 57 percent of those surveyed agreed that “spending/tax cuts will give businesses confidence to hire.” How did conservatives manage to pull off such an unlikely victory? Keep reading to find out. Why do we say that someone who likes to garden has “a green thumb?” Is just a predilection for poetry? Not at all. We naturally use metaphors (non-literal speech) to make sense of complex and abstract ideas and concepts. Example? The economy! This notion has been proven by the esteemed linguists George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, whose research shows that metaphors appear in our speech constantly – every ten to fifteen words, on average. To explain our love of the metaphor, Lakoff and Johnson argue that our brains are naturally wired to compare complex concepts to more tangible entities. However, the metaphors we use to frame concepts aren’t neutral. In fact, they profoundly influence our understanding of reality. There is compelling evidence to suggest that we judge concepts very differently depending on the metaphors we use to describe them: two Stanford psychologists found that people who read passages describing crime as a “beast” are much more likely to say they support crime-fighting measures through harsher law-and-order techniques. Conversely, those encouraged to think of crime as a “virus” were far more likely to support crime prevention measures. Ultimately, this study suggests that one group of participants subconsciously drew upon their assumptions about how to deal with a “beast” when they thought about how to deal with urban crime – you fight it! Meanwhile, thinking about the same problem, the other group relied on associations related to coping with a “virus,” such as immunization or washing one’s hands. All in all, using metaphors to simplify abstract concepts shapes our thinking, which, in turn, can have real-world consequences. Accordingly, the metaphors we use when discussing the US economy have had a major impact on the resulting economic debates. In the previous blink, we learned that metaphors have a massive impact on our thinking. Unfortunately for progressives, conservatives employ this insight extremely effectively. This becomes clear when evaluating the metaphors conservatives use to influence economic debates. For instance, Republicans consistently use language that frames the economy as a living entity, which greatly affects public opinion about desirable economic policies. Following the 2007 financial collapse, conservatives almost always referred to the economy as a patient, deploying words like “recovery,” “ailing” and “fragile.” This linguistic framing directly aligns with two core neoliberal principles: first, that financial crises occur naturally, just like the flu, meaning that no one is responsible for what has happened; and second, that just like a patient sick with the flu, the economy will recover on its own, without any undue interference. Similarly, conservatives often describe the economy as a medium for enforcing desirable moral behavior. According to this narrative, the economy rewards virtuous, hard-working people with wealth. Meanwhile, those with a lesser work ethic will be punished with poverty. This story incentivizes those on the lower economic rungs to emulate the purportedly honorable virtues of the affluent. Surely you recognize this narrative. You’ve heard it every time a conservative pundit or Republican politician has railed against the possibility of raising entitlement benefits. Here’s just one example: reacting to a presidential proposal to reduce the principal owed by those at risk of defaulting and having their homes foreclosed, Republican Senator Bob Corker (Tennessee) retorted, “People who acted responsibly in Tennessee will be paying for the bad behavior of [other] lenders and borrowers.” Once again, this kind of language encourages people to see economic fortune as an indicator of moral worth – a powerful approach to political persuasion. But don’t progressives also employ narratives? Conservatives are masterful at persuading the public to share their perspective on the economy, but  progressives struggle in this respect. What can they do to reframe the debate and advance their own agenda? One option could be to describe the economy as a moving car – maybe it’s “stuck in a rut,” “out of control” or “needs a jumpstart.” This framing would allow progressives to promote government intervention in the economy. After all, just imagine a moving car without a driver. Most people will associate the image with something dangerous and out of control. Thus, the metaphor would implicitly promote government involvement to “steer” the economy. Or, it might highlight the importance of imposing “rules of the road” on the financial industry.   In general, it would present the economy as a man-made entity, in accordance with the progressive notion that it can be altered to serve society’s best interests (and not vice versa). Another major advantage of using the car metaphor? It defines the economy as a vehicle that facilitates an individual’s financial journey through life. This narrative implies that helping all citizens develop their potential and realize their dreams is the true role of our economic system. Contrast this story with the conservative account, which holds that whatever the outcomes offered up by the economy, they are natural and right. To help promote this perspective, progressives can start using certain phrases: some people have “different starting points than others,” or are “carrying more baggage.” Both of those phrases succeed in conveying the progressive notion that certain individuals face unfair barriers to their progress through no fault of their own. And crucially, it also communicates the point that these unequal starting points can be changed if we remove barriers to basic necessities like employment or education.   Now that we know what progressives should be doing, let’s look at what they’re doing wrong. Because even when they’re passionately and sincerely arguing their own case, progressives rely on words that implicitly align with the conservative agenda. To start, even the simple word “crisis” carries ambiguous connotations, since it’s often used in a way that contradicts the progressive account. Remember, progressives must convey that the economic collapse of 2007 was a long time in the making; the result of deliberate actions, misdeeds and oversights; and that sound government intervention could prevent a similar calamity from happening in the future. Well, the word “crisis” doesn’t carry any of these connotations. Consider the dictionary definition of the word: “An emotionally significant event or radical change in a person's life, e.g., a midlife crisis; an identity crisis.” In this context, the word suggests an unexpected event that will sort itself out naturally without necessarily requiring outside intervention. This happens to be the exact message the progressives don’t want to communicate. Instead, they could employ other terms, like “economic blunder” or “damage,” which would frame the events in a more favorable light. Similarly, the term “financial reform” might be counterproductive if progressives wish to advocate for radical change to the financial system. After all, “reform” implies that the entity being reformed should remain in existence – that it should be, as per the dictionary, “reshaped from existing materials.” Thus, the term implicitly precludes a more radical rethink of the financial system – and thus, the neoliberal principles on which it rests. Consider, by way of contrast, what might be implied by phrases like “financial overhaul” or “consumer protections.” It’s easy to imagine how these terms would trigger associations related to more radical changes. Think about all those negligent, and sometimes even fraudulent, CEOs and traders who contributed to the 2007 financial crash. They evaded financial regulations and deliberately obscured the riskiness of derivative financial products. And yet, almost none of them have been held accountable! How is that even possible? Well, perhaps it’s not entirely surprising when we consider the ubiquity of passive language during economic discussions. Examples abound: We talk about how “the unemployment rate rose” or “the dollar fell.” You might hear a TV pundit say something like, “most people struggled with costs that were growing and paychecks that weren’t.” As mentioned earlier, the passive voice implies that events happen of their own accord, thus obscuring the mistakes and misdeeds that directly cause negative events. This ultimately prevents us from holding people accountable for their poor decisions. Because in reality, the dollar didn’t just fall on its own. Rather, economists and politicians made decisions that led to a currency depreciation. Just compare those two framings, and notice how the passive voice makes it easier for people to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. Besides, the passive voice makes it far easier for financial institutions to profit from the poor and get away with it. Look at one prevalent post-crash phrase: “people are losing their homes.” This formulation totally misses the point: people weren’t losing their homes at random, banks were taking them away! Moreover, by obscuring the real actors in the story, the passive voice carries the extra danger of lessening public empathy for the most disadvantaged people. Our brains are wired to fill in gaps and create a causal link between action and consequence. So, when we refuse to clearly name the forces and actors who made conscious decisions to the detriment of others, it implicitly puts the burden on those who are suffering from the consequences. In other words, we end up blaming the victim.   As we’ve discussed, inequality is on the rise in the United States; at the same time, social mobility is much lower than in many European nations. Even so, Americans continue to cling to the idea of the American Dream. Why? The answer is language, of course! Although phrases like “the top/bottom 20 percent” have been picked up by the political left in recent years, metaphors related to vertical height are problematic because they imply notions of hierarchy and deservedness, concepts that advance the conservative agenda. Just think of the preexisting associations we have with the concepts “up” and “down,” particularly the link between being “at the top” versus “feeling low.” We’ve also inherited historical notions about the upper classes being one’s “betters,” whereas belonging to the “lower” social classes is bound up with inferiority. Clearly, these vertical metaphors don’t send the right message. Instead, to energize public debate on the subject of socioeconomic inequality, progressives should talk about “imbalances” and/or “barriers.” One big advantage of both framings is that they don’t imply any kind of hierarchy, but they are still effective. After all, brief jaunts on a rollercoaster aside, people loathe the feeling of being off balance. Describing inequality as a “barrier” is similarly effective, especially since it connects to supplementary metaphors, like “being held back,” “roadblocks,” “being trapped in poverty” and “denied access to education.” There are three reasons this language helps underpin the progressive account: it underscores the structural causes of inequality; it stresses the fact that inequality is neither natural nor inevitable, but rather an alterable man-made phenomenon; and it takes the blame off the poor and puts the burden on those at the top, suggesting that those who have more have – perhaps deliberately – erected “barriers” to keep others out. It’s worth noting that Martin Luther King, Jr., actually used this barrier metaphor to great effect in the 1960s, when he successfully and movingly advocated for an end to racial segregation.   The key message: Unlike conservatives, who cannily use language to advance their political agendas, those on the progressive end of the political spectrum have long failed to carve out a distinct and persuasive narrative. To effectively counter the other side’s position and advocate for their own principles, progressives should rethink the metaphors they use to talk about the economy and social order. Actionable advice: Be wary of the metaphors you encounter. Be mindful of the fact that metaphors shape our thinking; especially during campaign season, a healthy dose of critical awareness will help you cut through the false narratives and develop genuine political views.

Theories that dazzle in textbooks end up leading us astray in the real world. Towering thinkers turn out to have feet of clay. But economic ideas can have extraordinary staying power. As the British economist John Maynard Keynes once wrote, “practical men” who prize their independent-mindedness are often “the slaves of some defunct economist.” Misleading claims remain on the shelf in the marketplace of ideas long past their sell-by date. Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics takes aim at an idea that’s long obsessed both economists and policymakers: endless growth. But her mission isn’t just theoretical. She argues that if we don’t kick our addiction to growth, we’ll end up destroying our planet. Neverending economic expansion isn’t just a defunct idea – it’s dangerous. What’s needed now is a bold, contemporary approach. Out with the old, in with the new. If we want to survive and thrive on Earth, it’s time to start thinking like it’s the twenty-first century. In these blinks, you’ll find out Why the answer to our present problems resembles a doughnut; How a great theorist of economics failed to credit his mother’s cooking; and Why a sense of fairness can trump self-interest. Economics is the world’s lingua franca, spoken by both business and government. Yet many of its basic assumptions are flawed. Crises like the 2008 financial crash have proved as much – economists just didn’t see it coming. Then there are the slow-burning issues of climate change and global inequality. If it wants to meet the challenges of the twenty-first-century head-on, economics needs to change. Fresh thinking is the order of the day. So where do we start? One idea that might help us out of our current predicament is the author Kate Raworth’s concept of the Doughnut. Picture a classic doughnut with a hole in the middle. It’s made up of two circles – one, the inside edge, and the other, the outside. The former can be thought of as the social foundation, while the latter represents an ecological ceiling. Between these two rings – in the dough, to stick to our metaphor – is what the author terms “a safe and just home for humanity.” A place defined by dynamic balance. Within it, all our social needs can be met without overburdening the planet. Let’s unpack the first concept: the Doughnut’s social foundation includes everything that humans need in order to live. That covers basics such as access to clean water and food, but there’s more to it than that. We don’t just want humans to simply survive, we want them to thrive. A full human life is about more than just having enough to eat. It also requires more abstract social goods like support networks, a sense of community, political representation and gender equality. And what about the ecological ceiling? Essentially, this is the ecological boundary we have to respect if we also want the earth to thrive. In 2009, a group of earth systems scientists, led by Johan Rockström and Will Steffen, identified nine processes vital to our planet’s ability to sustain human life. These processes are threatened by ozone layer depletion, ocean acidification, nitrogen and phosphorus loading, chemical pollution, freshwater depletion, land conversion, air pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss. The outer ring of the Doughnut functions as a “guardrail” to protect these key processes. If we cross it, we risk environmental catastrophe. The problem, however, is that we’ve already leaped over the rail at least four times! Climate change, nitrogen and phosphorus loading, land conversion and biodiversity loss are already well underway. The clock is already ticking and time is in short supply. If we want to get humanity into the Doughnut, we have to act now. But before we do anything, we need to change the way we think about the world. And that starts by challenging our obsession with endless growth. It’s worth remembering that economics wasn’t always about endless growth. Take the ancient Greeks. For them, economics meant the art of managing a household. To master the discipline was to understand how to make the most of limited resources. Making money and acquiring wealth was an entirely different kind of activity. In fact, they even had a different name for it – chrematistics. That all began to change in the mid-eighteenth century when economists began to redefine their field as a science rather than an art. By the nineteenth century, economists like John Stuart Mill were changing the focus of their discipline. They shifted the emphasis away from managing resources toward studying the general laws of economic life. Later economists such as Milton Friedman, the most important representative of the school of thought known as the Chicago school of economics, embraced this new view of things. They believed that the field should stop trying to change the world and instead simply describe things as they are. That left a void at the heart of economics. It no longer seemed to have any sense of purpose. So economists developed a new obsession: growth. By the end of the twentieth century, the discipline was addicted to measuring how much wealth nations were generating. But the metric used to gauge economic performance – gross domestic product, or GDP for short – doesn’t tell the whole story. Take it from American economist Simon Kuznets. In the 1930s, the US government commissioned Kuznets to figure out a method of measuring national income. Gross National Product – a measurement of value produced in countries later supplanted by GDP – was his solution. But Kuznets grew increasingly skeptical about GDP. By the 1960s, he was pointing out its shortcomings. Most importantly, he thought, it only captured parts of a nation’s total wealth – other parts were missing entirely. That’s because the concept only focused on one economic sector: the market. It ignores the value of goods and services produced by other actors like households, society or the state. If you want more growth, Kuznets argued, you should “specify more growth of what and for what.” He was ahead of his time. Unfortunately for us, few have heeded his advice. A classic economic model often used to explain the world is the circular flow diagram. It pictures the economy as a closed system in which income flows between businesses and households – with banks, governments and trade playing intermediary roles. It’s a powerful image that continues to shape the way we think about the economy. There’s just one catch – it’s wrong! However powerful the market is, it isn’t the only economic sector that creates value. The state provides goods and labor to lay roads and educate children. Then there are shared resources like public land or Wikipedia. Individual households also play a vital role in economic life, even if this sometimes goes unnoticed. A good example of this comes from the life of the famous Scottish economist Adam Smith. In his work, Smith eloquently described the way that markets mobilize individual self-interest to provide for the common good, such as how a grocer is motivated to sell someone everything they need to make dinner. So where did Smith write his great work The Wealth of Nations? Based on his theory, Smith should have been paying someone for the service of a comfortable lodging, right? In fact, he moved back in with his mother. While he was writing, she prepared meals and did chores. His work, in other words, depended on unpaid labor. Without it, he wouldn’t have been able to concentrate on his book. Yet he never mentions this in his work. Perhaps he just didn’t notice it. That hasn’t changed much since the eighteenth century. Mainstream economic theory still has a blind spot when it comes to unpaid household labor.   There’s another flaw in the circular flow model: The economy isn’t a truly closed system. All economic activity depends on the resources provided by the sun and our own planet. Herman Daly and other ecological economists deployed a useful term in the 1970s to describe this. According to them, the economy is an open subsystem of the earth’s closed system.   Without the energy and raw materials we get from the sun and the earth, economic life would grind to a halt. When we take more from the earth than it gives us and expect it to absorb more waste than it can handle, we find ourselves in a “full world.” Daly argues that we’re already living in a full world. The earth simply can’t replenish vital resources as quickly as we deplete them. That’s another reason to change the way we think about the economy! Fields investigating big subjects often begin by looking for the smallest unit in a system. For physicists, that’s the atom. For economists, it’s the Rational Economic Man. So who is this character? Essentially, he’s a theoretical model of the individual consumer. When this model was first developed in the eighteenth century, it provided a fairly nuanced picture of human behavior. By the 1970s, however, it had mutated into something much less sophisticated. Selfish, isolated, greedy and constantly calculating, Rational Economic Man was now an outright caricature. In fact, the model became so outlandish that even the caricaturists themselves were forced to admit its flaws. In 1844, John Stuart Mill added some flourishes to this cartoonish character in his Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy. Rational Economic Man’s character, Mill claimed, was also defined by his hatred of work and love of luxuries.  But even that, as he himself noted, amounted to “an arbitrary definition of man.” Despite its implausibility, this simplistic sketch of human behavior ended up changing the world. As the American economist Robert Frank put it, “Our beliefs about human nature help shape human nature itself.” Studies carried out in Germany, Israel and the US supported this view. They showed that students who spent time studying economics – and thus got to know Rational Economic Man personally – were more likely to approve of selfishness than other students. They behaved selfishly and expected others to do the same. This view has even changed the way we talk about the world. Take the word “citizen.” It was once a commonplace term in newspapers and books in the English-speaking world. After the 1970s, however, it was rapidly overtaken by the word “consumer.” That’s a problem. Modern economics needs to align itself with how people actually behave in real life. Rational Economic Man might make for an elegant model, but people’s behavior isn’t anywhere near as selfish or uniform as the model suggests. Take the Ultimatum Game. The rules are simple: Two strangers take part in the game. The first offers the second a share of a certain amount of money. If the latter rejects the proposal, neither player receives anything. It’s been played around the world countless times, and the results are fascinating. According to the Rational Economic Man model, the second player should always accept the first player’s offer. However small the amount, free money isn’t to be sniffed at. But in reality, players often refuse the deal if they regard it as unfair. North American college students regularly turn down offers of less than 20 percent of the total amount. Even when it costs them, they’re inclined to punish selfishness. That just goes to show that fairness can trump self-interest. “Supply and demand” is a famous phrase. Open up any entry-level economics textbook, and you’re likely to find a simple diagram explaining how it works. On one side, there’s an ascending line. On the other, a descending line. They overlap at the point where prices align with what consumers are willing to pay. Economists call this the equilibrium point. In the same way that a swinging pendulum is governed by the equilibrium-seeking laws of physics, so markets are governed by economic laws. Or that’s the theory at least. Unfortunately, equilibrium doesn’t work like that in the real world. In fact, the models used by economists often only make sense because they’re over-simplified. That’s because they often search for models that look like those used by scientists, such as physicists. But ironing out the messy reality of the world means making simplistic assumptions that don’t mirror the way things actually work. A representative consumer responding to events in predictable ways is one of those assumptions, and that’s dangerous because it overlooks the unpredictable boom-and-bust cycles of the market. Take the 2008 financial crisis. Because mainstream economists were convinced that markets naturally stabilize themselves, they overlooked the warning signs. They ignored the banking sector and failed to analyze its unique complexities and vulnerabilities. The US Federal Reserve didn’t even include private banks in its models! When the crash came, they were caught out. They hadn’t seen it coming because they were wearing theoretical blinkers. So how can future disasters be avoided? Economics in the twenty-first century needs to change. That means dropping mechanical metaphors and thinking about economies as systems. To do that we have to see economies for what they are – massive systems of interconnected variables. Equilibrium isn’t likely in these kinds of systems. Instead, individual components interact, reinforcing one another. To understand this, it’s a good idea to use the tools of system thinking. Take feedback loops. These can have two effects: In the first case, positive loops encourage something in a system. In the latter, balancing loops discourage something. You can understand how this works by imagining a flock of chickens living next to a road. There are two things chickens love to do: cross roads and lay eggs. The more eggs they lay, the more chickens there are. That, in turn, means more road crossings. That’s a positive – or reinforcing – loop. But say the road’s a busy one. More crossings mean more chickens being run over, sinking the total number of the flock. That’s a balancing loop. Thinking in terms of feedback loops lets us monitor the complex interactions of an economy, and that’s a much better approach than blind faith in the market’s ability to balance itself! “No pain, no gain” is a motto usually associated with bodybuilders, but it’s also a slogan mainstream economists have taken to heart. They claim that if you want to build a stronger economy, you have to take the economic pain. And that means accepting inequality.   The model that supposedly proves this is known as the Kuznets curve. It’s another staple of economics textbooks. Flick through virtually any edition, and you’ll find a bell-shaped diagram showing the interaction between income inequality and per capita earnings over time. Initially, inequality gets worse and worse. Once the line reaches the top of the bell, however, it begins to decline steeply. The model suggests that once a nation’s economy is rich enough, wealth begins to trickle down and inequality decreases. Sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it? Well, that’s because it is. Simon Kuznets himself admitted as much. His work on inequality had been carried out in the 1950s and was based on limited data and plenty of guesswork. By the 1990s, economists had much more data at their fingertips. When they tested the theory – by looking for historical examples of countries becoming more equal as they grew richer – they couldn’t find a single one. If the Kuznets curve were accurate, we’d expect to find very low levels of inequality in the richest countries. The data suggests otherwise: high-income countries are experiencing the highest levels of inequality in 30 years! Take the US. In 2015 there were over 500 billionaires in the country, but one in five children living below the federal poverty line. If rising incomes alone can’t make societies more equal, what can? A good place to start is better design. The Bangla-Pesa shows how this can be done. The currency was first issued in 2013 in the Bangladesh district of Mombasa, Kenya – an area in which business is generally unpredictable and money often scarce. The Bangla-Pesa wasn’t a replacement for the national currency – the Kenyan shilling – but a complementary tender. The idea was that it would be used to buy and sell goods within the district’s network of around 200 traders. It let users save their shillings for utilities like electricity which have to be paid for in cash. Everyday essentials such as bread, or hiring a carpenter, could be bought using the Bangla-Pesa. Because of this secondary currency, traders could still provide for themselves and their families, even if business drys up. When a power cut struck in 2014, local businessmen like barber John Wacharia was still able to buy food and essentials with the Bangla-Pesa. You’d think that nations would be scrambling to develop ecologically sustainable strategies given the looming environmental crisis, right? Unfortunately, many countries continue to ignore the threat of climate change. Economics is often part of the problem. Many economists depict an unpolluted natural environment as a luxury. Like greater equality, environmental protection is seen as something societies can only afford once they’ve reached a certain stage of development. But that’s a mistake. American economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger crunched the numbers in the 1990s. They compared GDP growth with air and water pollution. A pattern quickly emerged: as GDP grew, pollution initially increased before eventually decreasing. That, however, was misleading. As the authors admitted, they hadn’t included global pollution levels in their calculations. Despite resting on shaky foundations, the idea that GDP growth would see pollution levels automatically decline was hard to resist. Between 1990 and 2007, as GDP grew across high-income countries, so too did their environmental footprints. Once you take all ecological factors into account, the footprints of the UK and New Zealand grew by 30 percent in the same period, while those of Spain and the Netherlands increased by more than 50 percent. That’s a long way from the safe space of the Doughnut we explored earlier. So what do we have to do to get there? First of all, our linear economy has to become circular. Essentially, that means a shift from making disposable products to producing reusable goods. Whether it’s biological material like plants and soil or technical commodities like synthetics and metals, most things can be given a new lease of life. Coffee grounds, for example, can be used for an amazing array of things. You can grow mushrooms in them and then use them as livestock feed – especially handy since animal manure returns them to the soil in the form of natural fertilizer. A huge amount of “waste” can be turned into valuable resources in this way. Not bad given that less than one percent of the nutrient-rich bean ends up in a cup of coffee! The same applies to industrial products. In the Togolese capital of Lomé, workshops repurpose discarded computing equipment to build 3D printers using open-source designs, transforming waste products into a primary material. It’s not only environmentally friendly but a potential lifesaver; doctors use the devices to print medical equipment, which is much cheaper and quicker than ordering tools from abroad. All this just goes to show that reuse, repurposing and smart design aren’t luxuries – they’re essential! What’s the purpose of economics? Ask an economist, and she’ll likely say that the discipline helps to spur growth. But growth can’t last forever. In the end, something has to give. So what do we do when the inevitable happens, and our economies stop expanding? It’s a question worth posing. After all, our current growth goals aren’t environmentally sustainable. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 2014 report projected only moderate long-term growth in the global economy. But even this “mediocre” growth would double total greenhouse gas emissions by 2060! And that’s not the only problem. Other evidence suggests that growth is beginning to plateau in high-GDP, low-growth nations like Japan and Germany. The million-dollar question is whether GDP can be sustained during the transition to a “green growth” model. Can economies continue to grow even as they make the switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power? The only other option is to embrace “de-growth,” and accept that GDP might slow down, flatten out or even go into reverse. Perhaps the best course of action is to become less dependent on growth. One way of going about this would be to close tax loopholes. Governments are obsessed with GDP because it allows them to raise revenue without hiking taxes. But lots of money simply goes untaxed. It’s estimated that around $156 billion is lost each year to tax havens – that’s more than twice the amount needed to end extreme poverty. Another option is to make use of demurrage. At the moment, currency appreciates due to interest. If you have money, it makes sense to keep hold of it. The longer you sit on it, the more it grows – that’s the mindset of the financial sector. But that also means that money ends up getting trapped in that sector rather being invested in other things. But what if savings didn’t appreciate, but became less valuable the longer they went unspent? That’s the intriguing idea behind demurrage. It’s a potential game changer. People would have an incentive to spend their money rather than squirreling it away. Despite sounding like a radical new policy, it was almost implemented in the US during the Great Depression! These are just some of the ways to get us into the sweet spot inside the Doughnut. But however we do it, we have to kick our addiction to endless economic growth. Our planet depends on it. The key message in this book: We need to rethink economics to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. The Doughnut is a model that might just put us on the right path. It shows us how we can build economies that serve our social needs without overtaxing the planet’s limited resources. If we manage to get inside the Doughnut’s safe space, we’ll be well on the way toward a world in which both humanity and nature won’t just survive, but thrive.  Actionable advice: Think globally, act locally.  Reforming something as big and complex as the global economy is a daunting task. But small changes can make a difference too. You can help make the world a better place by buying sustainable coffee or choosing an ethical bank.

It’s worth learning about the history of something that is so intrinsic to our survival. These blinks address questions like, “Who first created a system for drinkable water?” and “When did we realize that untreated water is harmful to our health?”, so that we can learn to appreciate this life-giving liquid. Fresh water is a limited resource, but with some basic knowledge of it and the structures that facilitate its provision, we can work toward ensuring that there’s enough water for people around the world now and in the future. In these blinks, you’ll learn about a different John Snow, unrelated to Game of Thrones; how bottled water became so popular; and where 20 percent of the world’s fresh water is located. Though water may seem like a common element, it has a very interesting background. For many centuries, and across numerous societies, water wasn’t a preferred drink. For example, the Roman upper-classes perceived water as a beverage suitable only for children, slaves or women who couldn’t drink wine. Water continued to be perceived in the same way through to the Middle Ages and beyond, right up to and including the first pilgrims reaching the New World. Like upper-class Romans, the beer-loving pilgrims thought that water should be given only to the poorest members of the community. In the seventeenth century, there was even an English doctor who believed that drinking water could result in feeling melancholic. Despite this, many believed in its supposed magical powers. The idea of holy water and wells, springs or other sources holding enchanted water has been around for a long time. The Fountain of Youth, sought by the sixteenth-century Spanish explorer of the New World, Juan Ponce de León, is a famous example. It’s likely that Ponce de León’s pursuit of rejuvenating water was embellished after his death, as nearly every other culture claims very similar stories. According to Norse mythology, the god Odin searched for the transformative water that runs under Yggdrasil, a sacred tree that links all worlds. Another similar tale comes from the Muslim world. In it, Alexander the Great’s political adviser Khidr makes it through the Land of Darkness to come upon a spring that could grant him immortality. Heading into the fifteenth century, judge Sir John Fortescue said that the one reason to drink water was “for devotion.” In 1858, a miller’s daughter called Bernadette Soubirous apparently saw the Virgin Mary 18 times at a spring in Lourdes, France. Years after her death, Soubirous was declared a saint in 1933, and to this day, people travel from all over the world to try the water at Lourdes. Even though the Roman upper-classes preferred wine, the Romans greatly influenced our relationship with water. They were the first to bring water into private homes, and Roman governments were the first to give their people free water. The most impressive factor in this was the construction of aqueducts in ancient Rome, over 2,000 years ago. The fact that some of these water delivery systems still stand is a testament to Roman ingenuity. It took the Romans more than 500 years to build 11 aqueducts – including some that spanned over 50 miles – carrying a constant stream of 30 million gallons of fresh water at any given time. The free water was contained in public basins called lacūs. To have water flowing into your home, you had to pay a tax and get a pipe installed to connect to the aqueduct. It’s believed that aqueducts were originally introduced to supply the bathhouses, which were popular in the city, but the third aqueduct was built in 144 BC mainly to provide drinking water. Under the first Roman emperor, Augustus, the number of lacūs increased significantly because he was the first to realize that water could be politicized. The reign of Augustus signaled the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire, which is more or less like shifting from democracy to a dictatorship. In a bid to prevent uprisings, the emperor multiplied the number of lacūs in Rome from approximately 90 to 600, until they were located every 150 feet within the city. These public water stations were elaborately decorated with the words “Aqua Nomine Caesaris,” which means “water in the name of Caesar.” Thus, water was used to demonstrate to the citizens that life was much better now that Rome had become an empire. There are plenty of reasons why ancient societies preferred beer and wine over water, but the main one was that people sometimes got very sick when drinking H₂O. While people were aware that water could make you feel ill, it wasn’t clear why this was the case. This lack of knowledge resulted in awful living conditions in crowded urban areas like New York City. In 1748, New York City’s drinking water was so badly polluted by excrement, tadpoles and waste from slaughterhouses and tanneries that a journalist proclaimed, “horses from out of town wouldn’t drink it.” And yet people still drank the water. It was a long time before a clean and safe public water system was introduced. As a result of these delays, many people died in yellow fever and cholera epidemics, like during the wave of disease that claimed 3,500 lives in 1832. On the other hand, it didn’t take Philadelphia long to install a clean water system that connected to a nearby creek, due in large part to a generous donation from Benjamin Franklin. New York City followed suit after a councilman reported in 1835 that the main reason why Philadelphia was a much cleaner and healthier city was its water supply. Thus, it was only from the mid-nineteenth century onward that people began to grasp the importance of clean drinking water. Before that, it was a commonly held belief that diseases like cholera were caused by pathogens in the air, although crowded streets were increasingly flooded with dirty industrial runoff. Finally, the link between water and disease became apparent. London physician John Snow was an early advocate for clean water. Indeed, he more or less invented the field of epidemiology, which is the study of how disease functions in human populations. Snow used medical records, a map and surveys to determine that the 1854 cholera outbreak in London was linked to a water pump on Broad Street. Specifically, he found a dirty diaper near the water supply, which became the first-ever hard evidence that polluted water caused cholera. Once the importance of proper drainage and cleanliness was recognized, cities began to roll out effective sewer systems and increase the supply of clean water. As a result, life expectancies doubled. Around the turn of the twentieth century, the industrialized world started building infrastructure for clean water. Demand for drinkable water had increased, and the pressure was on to find new sources. This was especially difficult in New York City. After the arrival of the Dutch in Manhattan around the mid-seventeenth century, the only nearby water source was the Kalch-Hook, a seven-acre pond that was later called “the Collect.” The pond was described in a letter to the New York Evening Journal as containing “abominable fluid.” It was first connected to a water system built in the early 1800s by The Manhattan Company, which would later become the successful Chase Manhattan Bank. Run on as little money as possible, the initial project at Kalch-Hook was hardly successful, as people became ill from consuming the water. Eventually, a new water system was installed, with 45 miles of pipe laid to connect the city to the upstream waters in Croton. However, that wasn’t enough to satisfy the thirst of the population, and so more water had to be sourced from the Catskills and their watersheds, which were located 125 miles away. This is where a lot of New York City’s water comes from even today. Now let’s head over to London, where the city had a very similar problem. You would think that a river running through your city would mean that water was never in short supply. But just like the Collect, the nineteenth-century Thames contained contaminated water. Indeed, in 1858 London hosted the Great Stink, when the Thames was so polluted by industrial waste that the whole city was engulfed in a highly unpleasant odor. It was so bad that even Parliament announced it was going on an extended recess until the smell dissipated. Due to the progress made by John Snow and another supporter of clean water, lawyer Edwin Chadwick, government bodies finally realized that they had to stop the dumping of sewage into the Thames. After that, London never smelled quite as bad as it did in the mid-1800s. So we’ve established that sourcing drinkable water isn’t such an easy task. But that’s only the beginning. After that, you have to treat it and ensure it remains clean throughout its distribution. Contrary to expectations, sources of freshwater are generally dirty. Historically, this was because of wildlife excrement and bacteria found in lakes and rivers. Nowadays, however, there are even more undesirable things to watch out for. Populations of wildlife living near water sources all over the world have been found to have dangerous levels of endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors are organic chemicals that interact with hormones and lead to abnormalities in the immune and reproductive systems. For example, a beluga whale in Canada was found with levels of endocrine disruptors such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB, at ten times the minimum amount that would qualify as toxic waste. To make matters worse, we humans are probably responsible. A lot of our more common medications have chemicals that explicitly change the hormones in our body. Even if we refrain from throwing our meds down the drain, some of the ingredients that we ingest don’t get fully absorbed by our bodies and end up as bodily waste in the water. To put things into perspective, a 1999 study of streams across 30 states in the United States found that 80 percent of them had traces of pharmaceuticals and chemicals from personal care products. Though water may contain harmful things, there are increasingly effective ways of treating it – but it may still not be enough. In 1902, Middelkerke in Belgium was the first town to add chlorine to its water source and effectively kill dangerous bacteria. By 1941, chlorinated systems were found in 85 percent of the United States. Today, we have more advanced water-treatment systems that use ultraviolet exposure. The question is: Are these methods enough? A recent study of drinking water in certain US cities suggests perhaps not. The research found that treated water supplied to 40 million citizens tested positive for 56 different pharmaceuticals or contained traces of their by-products. In the film Batman Begins, the villain Scarecrow contaminates Gotham’s waters with a fatal toxin. The plot draws on our paranoia about someone poisoning our water supplies, a fear that isn’t as far-fetched as you’d think. There are three main stages of water provision: sourcing, treating and distribution. The last stage typically involves a storage facility, like an above-ground tower or an underground collection hub, that connects to individual taps in a neighborhood. It is also the stage at which the water is most susceptible to contamination. On March 28, 2006, it was announced that a water tower in Blackstone, Massachusetts had been broken into. Consequently, the town’s water had to be flushed out and tested, a process that cost $40,000. The culprits turned out to be teenagers who thought it’d be funny to pee in the water supply. The joke, however, becomes more sinister when you realize that it only takes the determination of a bored teen to potentially jeopardize the safety and health of an entire town. A more tragic case of contaminated water occurred in Gideon, Missouri in 1993, where seven people died from salmonella poisoning because bird poo ended up in the water supply. There are lots of facilities that safeguard their water tanks with bird deterrents and other elaborate protection measures – but others don’t. In the United States, protection measures are limited and resources differ greatly depending on the town or city. To put it in numbers, there are over 160,000 facilities connected by millions of miles of pipe handling water from over 75,000 sources. The good news is that water undergoes a certain amount of testing and monitoring before it is distributed. What’s more, while there are more than 60,000 chemicals in use all over the United States today, only 91 of them are legally considered contaminants. However, the effectiveness of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible for ensuring the cleanliness of our drinking water, is dependent on the current leadership and budget allowance. It was widespread knowledge that Bush’s administration neglected water-safety measures in the pursuit of industrial achievements. More than 1,500 bottles of water are opened per second in the United States. This was definitely not the case 40 years ago when those seeking water would be shown a hose or tap. There are three main reasons why bottled water has become such a popular drink. The big fitness boom in the 1970s led to the rise of bottled water, with Perrier one of the first to present its product as a healthy alternative to soda. The company had a massive marketing budget, which peaked when they sponsored the 1979 New York City marathon, in which 6,000 participants had the word Perrier emblazoned on their chests. The second reason is convenience. Early in the 1980s, Perrier was instrumental in promoting bottled water as healthy and trendy, and it wasn’t long before other brands entered the competition. Then, by the 1990s, Pepsi and Coke had introduced their own water brands – Aquafina and Dasani, respectively – and water was no longer sold in big and bulky bottles but in conveniently-sized plastic bottles. The third – and rather crucial – reason why bottled water has become so popular is that it’s a very profitable market. Whether sourced from a spring or municipal systems, a high markup easily makes bottled water a product with the largest profit margin. With the $1.50 that you pay for a bottle of their water, companies such as Coke and Pepsi can buy 1,000 gallons from municipal sources for bottling and resale. In some high-end restaurants, there are even water sommeliers to advise you on the most suitable variety to complement your meal. That might sound crazy to an American, but Europeans can discern the taste between different brands. After all, spring water that encounters limestone contains more magnesium and calcium. These kinds of minerals give the spring waters certain healthy and restorative traits that have garnered much attention. Given the rise of bottled water, one question must be raised: is it healthier than water direct from our faucets? Unfortunately, there’s no certain answer. But it’s likely not as healthy as you think. Dasani and Aquafina undergo several rounds of treatment, but these do not come close to the number of regulations and monitoring that is required of regular tap water. The Environmental Protection Agency has no authority over the quality of bottled water. While we know that New York City’s tap water is tested 330,000 times per year, we don’t know about the tests to which bottled water is subject. Whatever the tests are, the results aren’t encouraging. Recent studies carried out in Kansas and California found that different brands of bottled water carried harmful traces of arsenic and lead, among others. In Cleveland, 57 bottles were compared to tap water, and though 39 bottles were found to be cleaner than tap water, 15 had a higher level of bacteria. Another concern related to the popularity of bottled water is its impact on the environment. During the 1970s, about 300 million gallons of bottled water were sold. Fast forward to today, and that number has skyrocketed to almost nine billion annually – as has the amount of plastic required for production. The sight of all those plastic bottles is worrying, but the manufacturing of plastic itself requires water. Three to four liters of water are needed to create a one-liter plastic bottle, and each day an estimated 30 million bottles of water end up in the trash. The state of California alone is responsible for the disposal of one billion bottles every year. Even by today’s standards, ancient Rome’s water and sewage systems seem quite advanced. There are many areas of the modern world where basic needs – like the provision of clean, drinkable water – aren’t being met. In 2002, access to water was declared a basic human right at the United Nations’ Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It was recognized as a government’s responsibility to provide its citizens with water to prevent disease and dehydration. It might be interesting to note that Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States abstained from voting for the motion. Conversely, 15 other nations, including India and South Africa, refer to similar basic rights in their own legal systems. In 1996, the South African government amended its constitution after Apartheid was abolished, creating a new system that would provide each citizen with 6.6 gallons of free water per day. Anyone who went over the limit of 6.6 gallons could consume extra at a price. It was predicted that the money collected from consumers who went over the limit would be enough to cover the cost of the rest. However, this was not the case. In reality, it was much more difficult to collect the payment, and faulty pipes made it almost impossible to accurately record usage. Many poor people around the world don’t have access to enough water. This is due, in large part, to the high costs involved in building and maintaining water systems. In a bid to improve conditions in Argentina, stakeholders suggested privatizing the water system. One community leader opposed this notion, claiming that God gives water as a gift. That may be true, someone responded, but he didn’t lay the pipes. But it’s not only poor nations that experience difficulty maintaining and affording water systems. The United States has pipes in use that date back to the mid-1800s. Apparently a pipe bursts every two minutes, which equates to 6 billion gallons of lost water a day. In fact, fixing the old water infrastructure would cost the United States some $335 billion. While rain clouds disperse water over different areas of the earth, our planet never generates any new water. This may surprise you, but we are drinking the same water as the dinosaurs. Since we have no new sources of water, some people are trying to provide it to those in need, while others are fighting to protect what they have. A massive 20 percent of the world’s freshwater is contained in the Great Lakes between Canada and the United States. In 1998, US company the Nova Group was given a five-year license to transport 600 million liters of water from Lake Superior to areas in Asia that were in need. However, politicians hijacked this good deed and used the opportunity to gain media attention and win over voters. Consequently, the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact came into effect, banning the eight surrounding states from shipping large amounts of Great Lake water. A Nevada water official highlighted the ridiculousness of a population that represents only 14 percent of the country controlling a fifth of the planet’s water. On the other hand, there are people hunting for water that hasn’t been previously claimed. One such source is the icebergs found at the North Pole. These frozen chunks of freshwater are believed to contain some of the cleanest water in the world, which is why people are urgently trying to claim an iceberg and make a profit by turning it into drinking water. What’s more, researchers even went so far as to suggest that, in the right conditions, it’s feasible to move a seven-million-ton iceberg from Greenland to the Canary Islands and lose only three million tons along the way. Other options for securing water supplies are desalination, which is the process of turning saltwater into freshwater; improved treatment centers that can safely recycle sewage water; or building more dual-water systems, whereby one tap is assigned to drinking and cooking, and another is used for activities like washing the car. The key message in these blinks: Water is essential for our survival. However, our relationship with it isn’t so straightforward. Historically, people drank water that contained bacteria and other contaminants that led to fatal diseases and epidemics. The challenge now is to protect our existing systems, work out how to provide supplies to underdeveloped parts of the world and ensure that water is free of contaminants. Got feedback?

It’s a fair bet that you’ll notice row upon row of “eco” products, with green labels that tout the company’s “sustainable” credentials. From fast food to furniture, companies in every industry are trying to show the market that their practices are eco-friendly and if you buy their products, you’re doing your part to save the world. But this is far from the truth. As these blinks show, corporate sustainability practices today are mostly designed to increase profits and market share. Once you’ve discovered the secrets of corporate environmentalism, you may never look at another “green” product the same again. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Greenpeace and Coca-Cola share a common cause; how a company can track a single banana from Peru to your breakfast plate; and why a soft-drink company is more powerful than the United Nations. What comes to mind when you hear the term eco-business? You might think about a company that restructures its business practices out of concern for the environment. But in fact, the pursuit of profit is the main driver of the eco-business trend. How can this be? Well, increasing the sustainability of a company is, above all else, a great way to cut manufacturing costs and increase efficiency. In other words, becoming an eco-business allows a company to make and sell more goods. The Fairmont Royal York Hotel in Toronto invested $25,000 CAD to upgrade its water systems as part of an energy conservation program. The result? A more efficient and less wasteful system that generated over $200,000 CAD in annual savings. So from a business standpoint, being sustainable is smart. But isn’t it also good for society and the environment? Actually, not really. In the long term, eco-businesses have a negative impact on social justice and environmental conservation. That’s because, as we’ve mentioned, supply chain efficiency facilitates accelerated production at lower per-unit costs. In other words, companies make more stuff for less. As a result, the total environmental impact of an eco-business increases even as the per-unit consumption of water, energy, material and waste decreases. Consider Coca-Cola. A decreased per-unit cost of production means lower costs, which allows the beverage company to meet increasing demand. But this accelerated production has had a taxing effect on its sugar cane suppliers. In fact, soil fertility in Papua New Guinea has dropped by 40 percent within the last two decades, due to increased production of sugar cane. Coca-Cola’s story also hints at another influencing factor. As eco-business practices make corporations ever-more successful, their power over the economic system grows. And that’s why, according to the World Wildlife Fund, Coca-Cola has more power over commodity producers than does the United Nations. More and more, companies are jumping on the “eco” bandwagon. But what are the economic and social factors motivating this shift? The first big mover is globalization, which has forced companies to break down production processes to save costs. Adopting sustainable practices is a way for firms to maintain control over their outsourced manufacturing. That’s what American toy manufacturing company Mattel experienced after transferring its production to China in 2002. Since toy parts were being produced in so many different facilities, the company couldn’t fully control the process, leading to over 25 product recalls in a decade. To address quality issues, Mattel devised a strategy centered around efficiency and sustainability, implementing this strategy in over 5,000 Chinese factories. In the end, making the production process more “sustainable” led to a massive improvement in the quality of the company’s products. Commodity price fluctuations, a major threat to profitability, are another key factor in the rise of eco-businesses. For instance, the price of oil fell from $200 a barrel in 2013 to just $50 in 2014. Sharp fluctuations like these put enormous pressure on commodity-dependant companies. So under the banner of sustainability, companies have become involved in extraction processes, allowing them to better control price levels and mitigate price swings. Coca-Cola, for instance, has invested heavily in water production to stabilize the price of its supply. The final factor feeding the eco-business boom has to do with the large and growing middle class in developing countries. As an untapped source of revenue, this segment presents a huge opportunity for corporations. That’s why Hindustan Unilever added 500,000 new stores to its existing 6.1 million retail outlets in India in 2009. The expansion resulted in a 14 percent jump in sales volume! Of course, to meet increasing demand, companies have to produce a lot more products, which requires more sustainable (and thus, efficient) processes. So we’ve learned that businesses are adopting eco-practices to survive in today’s competitive market. But investing in sustainability isn’t just about staying afloat, it can also lead to tremendous profits. In fact, studies show that eco-business opportunities will be worth $6 trillion over the next 40 years. How can this be? Basically, efficiency-targeted practices tied to eco-businesses decrease operating costs and boost firms’ bottom-line earnings. After all, when Walmart reduced its in-store lighting from 32 to 25 watts, each of its stores saved $20,000 a year. With over 10,000 stores, Walmart’s cost savings totalled some $200 million annually. “Green” labeling is another major advantage of eco-businesses, as it fosters customer trust, thus leading to increased sales. For instance, homes labeled “Energy Star” are said to reduce operational costs in heating, cooling and water delivery by 20 or 30 percent, with regular annual energy savings. And according to research, homes with an “Energy Star” label add an average of nine percent to their selling value, compared to comparable homes with no green label. In addition to increased profits, there’s another opportunity associated with eco-business practices. This growing global obsession with optimization has essentially created new eco-related markets worth trillions of dollars. The information and communication technology (ICT) sector has become increasingly interested in cutting energy consumption, a major source of costs. So in an effort to monitor, track and reduce both energy consumption and costs, companies have started installing smart meters and grids. This technology has been shown to cut energy consumption by 40 percent, so it’s no surprise that so many companies are flocking to buy them. And so a massive new market has emerged – according to the Electronic Research Institute, the smart grid market will be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. As we’ve learned, companies have serious incentives to go “green.” And for many businesses, this means tracing – that is, taking control of the supply chain, right up to the extraction of raw materials. Through a process of documenting and controlling every stage of manufacturing, eco-businesses locate and eliminate waste, while also mitigating the threat of criticism or legal action. That’s exactly what Home Depot did, when the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) accused the home improvement company of selling endangered or old-growth wood. Home Depot responded to the allegations by examining its timber supply chain for each and every product sold and ensuring it knew from where each product was sourced. After seeing the results, RAN called off its boycott. Another advantage of supply-chain testing is that it allows companies to implement a life cycle assessment (LCA) to ensure efficiency at every stage of the manufacturing process. The idea here is to get a sense of where the most damage is being done; in this way, a company knows exactly where to make improvements. For instance, Swedish furniture company IKEA’s LCA showed that its board material supplier was using too much energy. So IKEA focused on improving efficiencies in this area. In the end, it improved the supplier’s energy efficiency by 37 percent, which saved the company €350,000 per year. But how do eco-businesses ensure that suppliers actually adopt green-friendly approaches? Companies can follow Hewlett Packard’s lead by establishing a sustainability code of conduct for suppliers. In 2000, HP became the first in its industry to establish this kind of program, and it’s efforts have paid off. HP now produces 8 percent less greenhouse gases than it did in 2010. Also, its new server system consumes 89 percent less energy and space, and costs 77 percent less than do traditional servers. Not to mention that HP now produces 37 percent less waste than it did in 2012. “Going green” is merely the first step in becoming an eco-business. The next step? Become recognized for your efforts. After all, credibility and trust are fundamental to brand reputation and consumer loyalty. To establish a “green” image and capture growing demand for eco-friendly products, many companies turn to eco-labeling. This can be lucrative, as General Electric was reportedly earning $17 billion in annual revenue from its green products and technologies just four years after launching its Ecomagination project. Of course, since more and more products are now stamped with “green” labels, consumers are growing cynical, which has led to diminishing returns. That’s why so many companies pursue eco-certification from government regulatory bodies, a surefire way of establishing a friendly, green image. If you can get a certified label (such as from the European Union’s standards body or from the U.S. Energy Star program) on your product, customers will be far more likely to trust it. However, to convince all these parties – customers, regulators and NGOs – that you really are as green as you say you are, you need to be transparent about your environmental credentials. This is important, because many companies are now being accused of greenwashing, or pretending to follow green principles for the sake of publicity. To avoid such criticism, more and more companies publish comprehensive information about their sustainability programs. The numbers are striking: In 2003, less than 20 percent of Fortune 500 companies were reporting carbon emissions. By 2010, that number was up to 75 percent. In another full-disclosure strategy, Disney allows customers to track online a Mickey Mouse T-shirt through each stage of its production, using the product’s unique tag number. Similarly, Dole allows customers to use Google Earth to track bananas all the way back to the farm in Peru where the fruit was first harvested. As we’ve mentioned, big brand sustainability pushes aren’t primarily concerned with solving environmental problems. And in the long run, such initiatives can create more problems than solutions. But that doesn’t mean eco-businesses have zero positive impact. Though corporate sustainability programs aren’t ideal, they do improve waste, energy, water and material management systems globally, often in new and dynamic ways. This is a crucial point, as environmental regulations and standards are still weak globally. But collaborating with eco-businesses is one way governments and NGOs can make dramatic progress. That’s what Greenpeace did in 2009 when it joined forces with Coca-Cola. The beverage company agreed to invest $50 million to develop hydrofluorocarbon-free vending machines and coolers, and to use these all throughout its supply chain. This was a huge pact. Fully eliminating hydrofluorocarbons in the commercial refrigeration industry would be equivalent to eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions of Germany. But it’s important to tread carefully. Collaboration can bring good things, but it can also create problems. When you give corporations too much power, they sometimes take advantage of it. For instance, corporations could work together to fix prices on eco-products. In fact, the European Commission had to fine Unilever and Procter & Gamble more than $450 million for doing just that, colluding and setting prices when introducing an eco-friendly laundry detergent. The close, collaborative relationship between corporations and NGOs poses another problem, as it reduces the NGO’s ability to criticize its partner. To that end, it’s possible to imagine a scenario in which Greenpeace turns a blind eye to some of Coca-Cola’s bad practices, since it’s relying on the company to curb carbon emissions – and doesn’t want to damage the relationship. The key message in this book: Eco-business is ultimately about expansion and profit, not environmental protection or social justice. That’s because the same eco practices which companies use to address water, energy, material and waste issues in the short term also lead to increased consumption in the long term. Thus in general many “green” initiatives just don’t benefit the environment. Actionable advice: If you really care about environmental issues, ignore the eco hype.  Instead of buying into the green credentials of different brands, shoppers can have the biggest impact on the environment by decreasing consumption altogether.

As a clear-eyed observer of the world, Nobel Prize-winning French economist Jean Tirole can draw upon decades of economic expertise to illuminate common features of the world in a surprising, and often downright counterintuitive, light. Between demonstrating why an anti-poaching NGO should sell confiscated ivory tusks rather than destroy them and explaining the debt crisis in southern Europe, Tirole takes a look at the big topics that shape our present and will determine our future. Why do we need finance markets even after speculators demonstrated their recklessness in the 2008 financial crash? What stops us from tackling the looming threat of drastic climate change, despite the repeated warnings of scientists? And how can the state and free markets best be brought together to guarantee growth, innovation and the common good? These are just some of the burning questions these blinks will take on. You’ll also find out what makes the tragedy of the commons so tragic; what economists can learn from their colleagues in the humanities; and how the 2008 financial crisis started with dodgy mortgages. The way we see the world is shaped by our beliefs. We emphasize facts that confirm ideas we already hold, which is why we read newspapers that echo our own political views and seek out like-minded friends. Economics is no different; our preexisting beliefs mold our attitudes toward the facts. This means we often don’t make the wisest economic decisions. Instead of looking at the evidence and making decisions accordingly, we look for simple rules that we can apply to every new situation. This approach can lead us astray because economics can be deeply counterintuitive. Imagine an environmental NGO that campaigns against poaching. It’s just managed to intercept a consignment of ivory tusks being shipped by a group of poachers who kill endangered elephants. What should it do with the confiscated ivory? Moral intuition tells us that the trade in illegal ivory is reprehensible, which means we should destroy it, right? No! Economic reasoning suggests that the best option would be to do what the poachers were attempting to and sell the ivory. But, you may ask, wouldn’t that just put the NGO in the same shoes as the poachers? Not quite. Selling the ivory would raise the needed funds that would allow the organization to continue its work in the future. Not only that, releasing the ivory onto the market would depress the value of elephant tusks by making them less scarce thus reducing the incentive of poachers to kill other elephants. As you can see, taking a long-term perspective of the kind offered by economics changes the moral calculus involved in all sorts of decisions. This doesn’t mean that economics is purely about cold rationality. Think of a market. At its simplest, it’s just a mechanism to allocate scarce resources; buyers and sellers meet in the marketplace to consensually exchange goods and services. But markets aren’t the infallible mechanisms they’re sometimes perceived to be. Not every good can be bought and sold freely, and some things, like ivory, need to be more strictly regulated than others. Imagine, for example, a market in which babies could be traded for cash by parents (the sellers) and adopters (the buyers). It’s easy enough to envisage both parties reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. But here, economists would raise an objection. From their point of view, this exchange fails because it neglects the interests of a third party, namely the baby. This kind of market failure is the result of what economists call an externality – the cost of an exchange borne by a third party who can’t consent to the exchange. And that’s where regulation comes in. It’s an attempt to safeguard the interests of all parties to an exchange, whether they’re those of babies, elephants or the environment. What exactly is it that economists do? Lots of things in fact, but two roles stand out. Because they’re often ensconced in the ivory towers of academia, one of economists’ most important tasks is contributing to our knowledge of the world. But they also have another, less theoretical, role: economists try to make the world a better place by providing insights that policymakers can act upon. That means economists often play an important part in public debates. Take climate change, for example. Scientists tell us that the best way to prevent catastrophic global warming is to stay within our allocated annual “carbon budget” and cut the amount of greenhouse gases we emit each year. Because knowing about budgets is pretty much in economists’ job description, they’re ideally placed to help us figure out the most efficient – and least costly – way of allocating our carbon budget. So how do economists go about tackling problems like this? They rely on models to analyze actors’ behavior. Two theories are particularly suited to this purpose. The first is game theory. This is essentially a way of modelling the behavior and strategies of self-interested actors who are also interdependent and affected by each other’s actions. A famous example is the “prisoner’s dilemma,” a thought experiment that looks at how two prisoners will behave without knowing what the other is doing – will they betray each other in search of a more lenient sentence or keep quiet? Game theory asks two questions about this kind of situation: First, what’s the best decision for the individual? And second, what’s the best decision for multiple parties collectively? Another helpful tool is information theory, which centers on the way individuals make use of private information. To get an idea of how this works, imagine a tenant farmer and a landlord. The owner of the land has private information – something that only he knows – about the fertility of a parcel of land that he wants to lease to a farmer. When the time comes to draw up the contract with his new tenant, he might well propose a profit-sharing model rather than renting the land for a fixed sum. After all, he knows how fertile the land is and is confident that it will generate large returns. Analyzing private information lets economists make informed predictions about individual behavior. And knowing what people are likely to do in certain situations is a great basis for making policy recommendations. Economic theory begins with a fairy tale. Once upon a time, it says, there was the homo economicus. This fabled character from economics 101 textbooks is the self-interested and rationally calculating decision maker. But as anyone who’s ever felt the lure of unhealthy junk food knows all too well, humans just aren’t perfectly rational creatures. What else drives us then? One place economists can look for answers is in the social and human sciences. From philosophy to law, history to psychology or sociology to political science, all these disciplines have one thing in common: they’re all concerned with what makes people, groups and organizations tick. Their attempts to get at the heart of the human condition have introduced us to a whole raft of characters to complement homo economicus. Take psychology’s homo psychologicus. He’s far from rational, and psychologists are largely interested in exploring the hidden drives that lead him to make decisions that sacrifice his long-term interests for short-term pleasures. Why, for example, does he spend all his money today rather than putting a portion of it away for a rainy day or his retirement? Psychology is also useful if you want to understand behavior that isn’t self-interested. What makes us empathetic and capable of giving without expecting anything in return? Sociology adds another character to our expanding cast – homo socialis. What can an economist learn from this figure? Well, economies are social systems that depend on values like trust. Because we don’t always have access to all the information we need to make informed decisions, we often buy things because we trust the seller or a recommendation from someone else. But it’s not just trust that underpins economies. If you want to understand why someone obeys the rules and pays their taxes (or doesn’t), it’s useful to get a handle on another character, homo juridicus, since behavior is shaped both by legal and social norms. The market and the state are frequently depicted as belonging to entirely separate spheres. But contrary to what is often said about them, they don’t compete with each other; in fact, each needs the other to work properly. That’s because they do different things. Take markets. Without them, there’d be little competition or innovation. Yet without the state and the rule of law, markets would descend into anarchy. After all, businesses need protecting and contracts have to be enforced for a market to work at all. And, as we’ve seen, it’s the state that provides a regulatory oversight that protects the common good when markets fail. But it’s not just markets that occasionally fail – states can too. Consider politicians. What they want above all else is to be elected or reelected, which is logical enough since they’d be unable to do anything if they didn’t have power. But that search for approval at the ballot box can also distort their decision making. This is a common theme on the campaign trail, when politicians exploit voters prejudices or ignorance rather than try to change people’s minds. A more dangerous practice is pandering to special interest groups. Promising groups of voters what they want is a great way of getting them to turn out come election day, but it’s not necessarily a brilliant way of crafting economic policy. Promises are easy to make and hard to deliver on. That’s especially true in the case of spending commitments, because their true cost can be difficult to calculate. Investing in creaky public transport infrastructure might sound like a no-brainer during a stump speech, but what if the state needs to borrow money to fix the transit system? The final bill can easily exceed the rough-and-ready arithmetic of politicians casting around for votes! Businesses face a similar quandary when it comes to decision making. Who gets to make the decisions and why? Every business has multiple stakeholders – groups affected by how a business operates. Balancing the interests of different stakeholders can be a tricky matter. Take two stakeholders found in virtually every business: investors and employees. If the former dictate policy, they might be tempted to ignore the interests of the company’s workers and end up slashing jobs in search of bigger profit margins. Conversely, if employees get the upper hand, they might also let short-term gains get in the way of long-term strategies and simply raise their own wages while leaving too little for reinvestments. Therefore, both the state and businesses can fail when they don’t make informed choices that take into account the interests of all stakeholders. From rising sea levels to extreme weather events and more frequent droughts, the effects of global climate change are likely to be catastrophic unless we take action soon. But policies like reducing greenhouse gas emissions that would help to counteract global warming are extremely difficult to implement – and economists can help us understand why. Failure to take action on climate change is an example of what economists call the tragedy of the commons, which essentially refers to a conflict of interest between individuals and the common good. Imagine what would happen if greenhouse gas emissions were reduced globally. Everyone would benefit, right? The problem is that this could only be brought about by individual countries implementing the right policies. But because the switch to cleaner energy sources and lowering emissions is costly, there’s a strong disincentive to put those policies in place at the national level. That’s compounded by the fact that each country represents only a small fraction of the total population of the earth. At the national level, the benefits of environmentally friendly policies would be relatively small. So there’s a strong incentive to free ride. Countries that fail to change their individual behavior and continue polluting the atmosphere can still stand to benefit from difficult changes made by others. The tragedy of the commons is the result of widespread free riding. Everyone needs to adopt policies that counteract the effects of climate change, but no one has an incentive to implement them individually. It’s because of this situation that voluntary measures to fight climate change have failed. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol is a good example. Although a large number of countries signed up to an agreement to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, there was plenty of free riding, notably by countries like the United States, which never ratified the protocol. Economists have come up with two policy proposals that they think might be able to cut through this Gordian knot. The first is a global carbon tax. Polluters would be charged a fixed price per ton of emitted carbon dioxide, wherever they were in the world, by the responsible state authority. The second option proposed by economists is a system of tradable emission permits. This would require setting a global ceiling for the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted each year. Governments would then issue permits to emit a certain tonnage of carbon dioxide, which could be freely traded by companies. Millions of Europeans are worried about their economic future – and it’s no wonder. The continent’s economy faces a number of serious challenges, especially in southern European countries. Unemployment in countries like Greece, Spain and France is sky-high when compared to the countries of northern Europe, the United States and Canada. It’s especially bad for two distinct age groups: young people aged between 15 and 24 at the start of their careers, and older people between 55 and 65 at the end of their careers. Worse still, many of these people are experiencing long-term unemployment. The labor market itself is a daunting prospect for job-seekers. Many jobs are short-term, unfulfilling and insecure, while better-paid jobs require extensive training, the cost of which is a burden mostly borne by taxpayers. Southern Europe has other problems, too. The introduction of the euro as a common currency in 1999 was designed to increase European integration and hasten economic development, but it has come at a high cost. Since 1999, many countries in southern Europe have seen salaries rise faster than productivity. That has made their economies much less competitive than they need to be in today’s global economy. Before the euro, they could devalue their individual currencies to boost competitiveness, but that option has been off the table since the introduction of a common currency controlled by a European central bank. Both private and public debt has been piling up over the same period. High debt means high interest rates, especially once banks start to worry about whether countries are capable of servicing their debt at all. That has added to the pressure on southern European treasuries. So what’s to be done? One ambitious proposal is to move toward a federal European state in which risks are shared equally by all member countries. Few topics in economics are as fiercely and emotionally contested as finance. That’s partly a legacy of the financial crisis of 2008, and the resulting widespread view of bankers as reckless speculators who crashed the global economy. But finance is one of those things we just can’t do without – if we could, we’d have already gotten rid of it and spared ourselves the expensive and tricky public bailouts of recent years! So what is finance? Basically, it’s a service for borrowers. Consider a mortgage; the bank provides borrowers with credit to acquire something they couldn’t otherwise. It’s not just households that borrow money though – businesses and governments also need ready access to credit to keep the show on the road. It’s hard to imagine an economy functioning without borrowing and lending. The finance sector also provides insurance against risk. Without that safety net, borrowers could easily end up in trouble. A good example of this is the aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Most of the company’s earnings are in dollars, while its expenses are paid in euros. That means it’s vulnerable to sudden fluctuations in the dollar-euro exchange rate – if the dollar dropped sharply, the company would have trouble paying its bills. Insurance against fluctuations of this nature is a vital safety mechanism for Airbus. But as the financial crisis demonstrated, financial speculation can also destabilize the economy. This happens when otherwise useful financial products turn toxic, and a major cause of that is securitization, the financial practice of pooling different kinds of debt and selling it to a third party. Let’s return to our example of a mortgage on a house. Once the bank has lent you the money, it can either decide to keep the loan on its books and collect the repayments over the next 30 or 40 years, or it can sell the loan to another bank. There’s nothing wrong with trading in loans in principle – in fact, it’s essential if a bank wants to diversify its portfolio or reinvest its assets. So what’s the catch? Well, if a bank knows it can always flip a mortgage, and get someone else to bear the risks, it’s likely that it’ll become less scrupulous in deciding who’s eligible for a loan. That’s precisely what happened in 2008. Once people started to notice that a huge number of mortgages had been given to people who couldn’t repay the debt, the whole financial system collapsed like a house of cards. People realized that they were holding assets that weren’t worth the paper they were written on and scrambled to get rid of them, bankrupting many banks in the process. We’ve already seen how the state and the market are like the yin and yang of economic life, two interdependent and complementary forces in a larger system. In this blink, we’ll take a closer look at their relationship. Paradoxical as it may seem, the state is the at the heart of economic life in every market economy, because it plays three distinctive and important roles within the market. The first role is one of public procurement. Here, the state becomes a buyer of goods and services for everything from the construction of public buildings, roads and railways to the running of hospitals. This has the beneficial knock-on effect of boosting competition among suppliers. But the state isn’t only part of the market – it’s also above the market. As a legislative and executive power, it sets the parameters of the market economy by issuing permits and licenses for things like taxi firms, supermarkets and even airline landing rights. In that role, the state is also a referee of markets. The state is an observer of the play of economic forces, intervening to make sure the rules of the game are upheld and dominant players don’t abuse their power. So what’s the market’s role then? Open competition in free markets provides several goods that the state on its own can’t. Take affordability. Monopolies can charge whatever they want for their services because customers can’t go anywhere else. Unsurprisingly, prices are often sky high. Competition means that suppliers have to convince customers to buy their services rather than someone else’s, and lowering their prices is often the most convincing argument of all! But if you’re a supplier and you want to lower your prices, you’ll also have to find a way to lower your costs. Innovation and efficiency are the side effects of suppliers’ bid to offer competitive prices. We’re already living in the digital economy. We shop and bank online, catch up on news and gossip on our smartphones and stay in touch with friends on Facebook. What the platforms of the new digital economy all have in common is that they’re examples of two-sided markets, markets in which buyers and sellers interact via an intermediary. Globalization has made the world a smaller place, which means that buyers and sellers from every corner of the earth can exchange goods and services. But as the world has gotten smaller, the global economy has gotten a lot bigger. So how do we decide who to do business with? Two-sided markets like Amazon make this a lot easier. By providing a digital marketplace, they bring buyers and sellers together wherever they are. But unlike traditional marketplaces, these platforms also act as regulators to ensure that transactions are fair and smooth. In some cases, they even regulate prices – think of Apple’s iTunes, which limits the charge for downloads to $0.99 per song. But there’s a catch. Digital platforms only work when we trust them not to misuse our personal data. How can you tell which websites are safe? The answer, troublingly, is that you often can’t. Even large companies have been subject to massive credit card theft in recent years. Forty million customers of Target had their details hacked in 2013, while another 56 million Home Depot customers had theirs stolen the following year and 80 million customers of the health insurance company Anthem had theirs ripped off in 2015. Add to the mix the often dubious terms of use that many websites make users sign and there’s plenty of cause for concern. So how can trust be reestablished? One solution is legislation that protects users against one-sided clauses. We don’t need to look far to see what that might look like in practice, since we already have laws of this kind in the offline world. Think of a parking lot. If you leave your car there, you accept the property owner’s terms of use. But these terms are strictly limited – they can’t include a clause that says it’s fine for the parking lot owner to take off in your car! Innovation is the motor that keeps the economy humming and the wheels of economic growth spinning. But safeguarding innovation requires intellectual property rights. That might seem like a paradox. Surely it’d be better if innovations were free for all to use and improve upon, right? Actually, no. The problem is one we’ve encountered before: free-riding. If every innovation were publically available for all to make use of, there would be little incentive for anyone to devote resources to the research and development that underpins all innovation. That’s why it’s important to protect the income of innovators. By guaranteeing that they’ll profit from their work, tomorrow’s innovators are given an incentive to continue their often difficult and time-consuming work today. That’s where intellectual property rights come in. When the state enforces intellectual property rights, it’s effectively granting the creator of an innovation an exclusive license to market and profit from a given product. So, intellectual property rights and innovation go hand in hand. But this isn’t the only way of boosting innovation; various governments have experimented with alternative models. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, for example, both Britain and France granted prizes to innovators in public competitions. Once the winner had collected his award, the innovation was made accessible to everyone. While this was a great incentive for innovators to compete amongst themselves, there was also a downside. Innovation is usually unpredictable – no one knows what tomorrow’s technology will look like. But if you want to give someone a prize, you have to know what criteria you’ll be using to judge his submission; this condition, in turn, narrows the field of innovation. Companies have also experimented with novel approaches. One idea is patent pools, an agreement among competing firms in the same industry to jointly control patents that they can all use. That is known as coopetition, a portmanteau of the words “cooperation” and “competition,” and has been used to try to lower the price of innovations. The key message in this book: The science of economics is, like the world it attempts to describe, complex. There are rarely clear-cut rules that can be applied to all situations; instead, there are trade-offs between different and equally valuable goods. Failure is often a result of not striking the right balance, whether it’s in the sphere of the state or markets. Getting it right requires an understanding of economics, a discipline that can help us achieve the common good when it comes to the most urgent issues of the day, like climate change and the transition to a digital economy.

You’re probably not alone. Yet economics is more than just a bunch of boring numbers – it plays a critical, intimate role in our day-to-day lives. From the clothes on your back to the screen on which you’re reading this text – literally everything we interact with – is the result of a series of economic transactions that end with a product in your hands. In these blinks, you’ll learn how economics molds our lives and how it has also changed over the last few centuries. With an in-depth look at the history of economics, you’ll better understand how our society has been sculpted by its laws and practices. Moreover, you’ll get a crash course on the specific mechanisms that shape economic behavior, and gain the knowledge necessary to examine a country’s economic health. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: why we shouldn’t really worry about why and how sumo wrestlers cheat; why a plane made of solid gold might not be worth that much; and how spending less at the grocery store could mean a pink slip for the cashier. If you’ve ever read the book Freakonomics (as many millions of people have) then you’ve seen the variety of ways that economics can be applied to situations not directly related to “the economy.” For example, the book’s authors attempt to explain why sumo wrestlers might cheat by using the economic theory of rational choice, which assumes that each person’s decisions are calculated to produce the best possible outcome. But why would a sumo wrestler cheat? Imagine that two sumo wrestlers are facing each other in a match. They also happen to be best friends. However, since one has already qualified for the next tournament, it’s rational for him to lose on purpose to increase the odds that his friend advances. This is merely one example. In fact, economic theories have been used to describe a whole host of phenomena. And while interesting, we shouldn’t neglect the most important application of economics: studying the economy. Indeed, among the most important elements of economics is the way in which money makes economic systems function. In essence, money is the measurement of what society owes you, usually as a result of your labor. However, sometimes money is given away freely, through a process called money transfer. In welfare systems, for example, money is usually transferred from those who have it to those who don’t, to provide for basic needs, such as shelter or food. Money can be used toward the consumption of goods and services produced by organizations that have a specific combination of labor (workers) and capital (machines and tools necessary for production). Your mobile device, for example, came to be through this combination: its processors were invented by workers (labor) and then produced with the help of machines (capital). It is these types of relationships, far more than the dilemma of a sumo wrestler, which are the heart of economic theory. The pros and cons of capitalism is a hot topic. Indeed, in recent years an ideological war has raged, with statements such as “Capitalism is in crisis” or “Capitalism creates jobs” parried back and forth. But what exactly is capitalism? One of the most influential early definitions of capitalism comes from Scottish economist Adam Smith in his seminal work, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in the eighteenth century. According to Smith, capitalism is a system of natural liberty, in which the central aim of political and economic systems is the accumulation of profit. One of Smith’s key insights into capitalism was his connection between increased productivity and the division of labor. To illustrate this, he examined pin manufacturing. He noticed that when a worker was given a limited yet well-defined role within the production process, such as either forging metal or creating molds, the worker’s unique specialization allowed him to work more productively than if he tried to produce a finished pin, from start to finish, himself. It’s insights such as these that categorize Smith’s book as a groundbreaking description of a capitalist economy, and its influence is felt even today. Yet a lot has changed since the eighteenth century! Economic actors and institutions are vastly different from those in Smith’s world. Back then, businesses were owned by individuals who were actually involved in the production process – such as the village blacksmith or butcher. Today many companies are owned by a multitude of shareholders who are almost completely divorced from the day-to-day management of their enterprises. Markets as well have changed. In Smith’s time, most markets were regional, or national at their very largest. Consequently, most companies were small. Today, globalization has made markets international and has enabled the growth of huge multinational corporations. We’ve seen just how significantly the global economy has changed in the last few centuries. But which events helped bring about this change? Importantly, the politics of powerful Western nations at the time of the Industrial Revolution led to the rapid development of the economies of these countries. During the Industrial Revolution, from the late 1700s to the early 1800s, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom had a policy of protectionism, enforced through industry tariffs. If companies from foreign countries wanted to sell their products to US or UK consumers, they would have to pay additional tariffs or fees, which made their products more expensive. This, in turn, helped make domestic products both cheaper and more popular. Meanwhile, these same governments forced countries in Latin America and Asia into free-trade contracts – trade without tariffs – opening these markets to highly competitive Western products. It is precisely this imbalance in historic trade policy that brought about the economic conditions we know today, with Western economies being the richest and most developed. And then came the Great Depression, which shocked governments into taking more control over the economy. On October 24, 1929, the US stock market experienced a sudden crash which left the economy reeling. Confidence plummeted, and few people were willing to invest. This led to a long-lasting economic depression, with high unemployment and poverty for millions across the globe. Faced with desperate circumstances, governments sought to better manage the economy, attempting to influence it in a way that would ensure that citizens would have enough to survive, or better, prosper. The US Social Security Act in 1935 was one such intervention, introducing old age pension and unemployment insurance. Even if people couldn’t work, they wouldn’t be left destitute. Gradually, with such protections, workers in Western countries became increasingly economically comfortable, and with a few exceptions, remain so today. When you watch the news, often you’ll witness two economists arguing over which theory should guide government economic policy. But why are there so many differing viewpoints? The science of economics has been divided into many different schools of thought, simply because the workings of any economy is inherently complex and often difficult to understand. Let’s look at some of the more influential schools of economic thought. The Neoclassical School, first elucidated by economists in the 1870s, is the preferred theory for most modern economists. It focuses its attention on individual actors, and advocates intervention only when markets malfunction. As the name implies, the Neoclassical School draws from two central ideas of the Classical School that emerged around the time of Adam Smith. The first idea is that economic actors – whether businesses, producers or consumers – are driven by self-interest. As actors pursue things they want, the competition that emerges between actors will generate the best possible outcome for everyone. For example, if every car manufacturer competes for the most sales of the same model of car, then the price of that model will fall, meaning increased sales for merchants and more affordable prices for consumers. The second idea is that markets are self-equilibrating; that is, markets will reorganize to an optimum level after an external shock, such as an oil crisis or war. This implies that markets – in most cases – shouldn’t be tampered with, as they can take care of themselves. The Neoclassical School differs from the Classical School in that it views the value of a product as dependent both on its production cost as well as its valuation by consumers. Say an airplane made of solid gold is for sale. According to the Classical School, the plane’s high production cost would give it a very high value. However, no airline would purchase such a heavy, impractical airplane, as it would be unable to fly! Thus according to the Neoclassical School, the plane’s actual value would be much lower. But if the market works so perfectly – as Neoclassical economists suggest – why are so many people out of work? This is where the Keynesian School steps in. According to the Keynesian School, long-term unemployment as well as products that cannot be sold, such as our solid gold airplane, contradict the Neoclassical insistence on markets’ self-equilibrating power. If a product goes unsold for a prolonged period, Keynesian economists say, then the money typically used for consuming such a product must have been spent somewhere else. Usually, the money instead will have gone into savings. And when people save money instead of spending it, they essentially remove money from the economy and thus help create unemployment. To illustrate this, imagine two people working at a supermarket where three customers are shopping. If the three customers decide to not spend all of their salary but instead save a third of it, this would have the same effect as if the supermarket had only two customers. However, a supermarket with only two customers requires only one working employee, thus resulting in the other employee becoming unemployed. To prevent unemployment, Keynesian economists suggest that the government should intervene as to maintain investment in the economy. When investors and consumers save money, overall spending falls. This in turn reduces income, as consumer spending is essentially the income of other employees. To compensate for this, the government should invest in the economy when overall investment is low, for instance, during financial crises when people are too scared to spend money. This government intervention ideally can help prevent shrinking incomes and even possible recession. To do this, the government could invest in infrastructure projects, such as building airports or improving highways. Such projects would provide people with both labor and wages, thus allowing them to spend money on goods and services and therefore provide others with jobs. Now that we’ve explained the major schools of economic thought, these next blinks will examine methods to measure the health of an economy. As individuals compete on a sports field, countries compete against each other in global markets. Some countries are seen as economic champions, others as struggling. Yet how do we determine exactly how well a country performs economically? The prevalent measure of a nation’s economic health is its Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. GDP represents the monetary value of everything a country has produced within a given period of time. Specifically, it only accounts for the added value, that is, the difference between the value of the final product and the value of intermediate inputs. For example, a bakery has $150,000 in revenue. Over the course of a year, the baker had to buy $100,000 worth of baking ingredients, his intermediate inputs. The added value, then, is $50,000. Another important measure of economic health is Gross Domestic Income, or GDI, the sum of citizens’ income in one country. Unlike GDP, we can’t use GDI to compare countries, as each country’s cost of living is different. While an iPod might cost $200 in the United States, it might cost only $150 in India. Thus, if India and the United States had equal GDIs, that wouldn’t necessarily equate the same level of wealth. To use GDI as a means to compare countries, economists developed the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP), which measures a currency’s purchasing power with regards to the price of specific goods. It then asks: How much of these goods can I purchase with my income in my country? In India, the PPP conversion factor from 2009 to 2013 was 0.3, meaning that if you exchanged US dollars for Indian rupees, to buy milk you would need only 30 percent of the money in India than you would in the United States. Now that we know that GDP is one of the main indicators of economic health, what exactly can we say about a country’s economy with reference to its GDP growth? Not much. Sometimes GDP growth isn’t a good indicator of a country’s economic development. Just look at Equatorial Guinea, a country where GDP grew 18.6 percent per year from 1995 to 2010. That’s more than twice the GDP growth of China, 9.1 percent, in the same period. However, nobody talks about Equatorial Guinea as being a growth superstar, while many people have made excited references to the “Chinese economic miracle.“ Why is that? In part, this is due to size, as Equatorial Guinea has a population of only 700,000 people. More important, however, is that the small country’s GDP growth didn’t result from increased productivity. Rather, the discovery of a large oil reserve in 1996 led to an influx of foreign investment. A better indicator for economic health is economic development, which describes a country’s economic growth resulting from an increase in its productive capabilities, that is, the ability to organize and transform production activities. Purchasing new machines or an improved communication infrastructure, for example, are a few indications of economic development. Another good measurement of economic development is the share of investment in GDP. When firms in a country invest more profits into fixed capital, or the machines and infrastructure that make production possible, we can view this as a good sign of a country’s development potential. A great example of such an investment is computer numerical control (CNC) machines. These machines can be programmed to translate models into an actual product, and are far superior in terms of speed to machines that require manual operators. Essentially, if a company is investing in machines that allow for faster production, then that company can produce and sell more goods in a shorter period of time. The pursuit of equality is intrinsic to human nature, and people instinctively try to avoid situations in which a few lay claim to all the resources we collectively need to live. Indeed, our shared history is full of examples where people have fought for equality. The French Revolution is just one poignant example, with its motto: “Liberty, equality, fraternity or death.” It’s good that equality is a concept we naturally seek, as inequality is bad for an economy. Inequality in a country often leads to political and social instability, which can frighten off potential investors. Compare, for example, the investments made in Austria and in Somalia in 2011. Despite its larger population, the highly unstable state of Somalia received $100 million while Austria, a stable electoral democracy, received $10 billion. High inequality also implies limited social mobility, or the possibility of individuals to climb the social ladder. When only some people can afford an expensive, high-quality education, they’ll be the ones who land the best jobs. Those who can’t afford a quality education, even if they might be better suited for a job, will never have the opportunity to compete, which in turn hurts the economy. One way to measure inequality is to use what’s called the Gini coefficient, which measures the degree to which the actual distribution of income differs from an optimal (or equal) distribution of income. The smaller the Gini coefficient, the more equally income is distributed. A value of “0“ indicates perfect distribution. As values approach “1,“ fewer and fewer people have almost everything and the rest has near to nothing. In most developed countries, Gini coefficients range from 0.3 (in Italy) to 0.5 (the United States), and are therefore situated between these two extremes. The next blinks will examine how governments can use information like inequality measurements to determine how to better support an economy. Despite a majority opinion among economists that the economy works best when it’s left alone, there are some instances that make government action mandatory. In a completely free market, for example, there would be no taxation. However, if a government needs to build a road, it needs money to do so. So who will pay for the road? To ensure that there is enough money to build a road and that everyone pays his fair share, a government can levy taxes from the population. Or what about when a company has no competition in its market segment? These natural monopolies most often develop in sectors where the cost of entry is simply too steep for the competition to get a foothold, such as in energy, water or public transportation. In this case, a government needs to step in to ensure fair practices, such as by imposing price controls or otherwise interfering in the market. There are two major ways in which a government can affect a market. The first is through fiscal policy. Governments can decide to spend more or less, or raise or lower taxes. Fostering highway expansion or other public works projects using public funds are examples of fiscal policy in action. The second is through monetary policy. A government can either directly influence the amount of physical currency in circulation or adjust interest rates on the loans banks receive from the country’s central bank, or a combination of both. If a government lowers interest rates for borrowing money from the central bank, then the cost of borrowing across the country becomes cheaper as a consequence. This in turn encourages companies to take out loans at this new, lower interest rate, allowing them to more affordably invest in new fixed capital, such as machines, or hire new employees. Armed with the knowledge of how a government can intervene in the market, the final blinks will more closely scrutinize our modern global economy. You may think of a bank as simply the place you go to deposit a paycheck or open a savings account. Today’s banks however are far more varied. In fact, there are two different kinds of banks. The first is a commercial or deposit bank, which interacts directly with individuals. Germany’s Sparkasse or America’s Bank of America are examples of deposit banks, which offer a place for individuals to shelter their money. The second is an investment bank, the original purpose of which was to help companies (not individuals) raise money from investors. Goldman Sachs or the now-defunct Lehman Brothers, the bank that played a critical role in the 2008 financial crisis, are both examples of investment banks. Since the 1980s, investment banks have increasingly focused on creating and trading new kinds of financial products – as we’ve seen, with disastrous results. One such financial innovation which also played a major role in the financial crisis is called an asset-backed security (ABS). An ABS pools a large number of loans, such as mortgages or student loans, in order to turn them into a bigger bond, thus making them more attractive to investors. Pooling these liabilities makes the bonds appear very secure. If you pool thousands of mortgages together, you can be sure that, on average, most people will be able to make their payments. Some might default, but these defaults will be covered by other secured payments. At least, that was the idea. Many ABSs were in fact highly overvalued and carried increasingly more risk, as more people began to default on their loans. This led to a devaluation of ABSs as well as other similar financial products. Once the reality of the situation became clearer, many banks that traded in ABSs were unable to sell them, and were thus hit with huge losses, the effects of which cascaded across the global economy. Although we now spend most of our time at work, we actually spend far less time in the office than workers did less than two centuries ago. Up until the nineteenth century, people typically worked between 70 and 80 hours per week. Today those numbers are much smaller: in Greece, the average person works nearly 40 hours per week, compared to only 35.6 hours in Germany. Nevertheless, our time spent at work is still a very large proportion of our waking hours. This has serious implications, as work has a noticeable impact on our psychological and physical well-being. Some jobs, like construction work, are physically demanding and can be hazardous. Working long hours can make people tired and ultimately unhealthy. Furthermore, our psychological well-being is influenced at least in part by how much we like our work – those who are satisfied tend to be happier than those who aren’t. Far more stressful than an unsatisfying job, however, is having no job at all. Economists divide unemployment into three main types. Frictional unemployment occurs “naturally“ when companies shrink or when employees quit in search of a different or better opportunity. Frictional unemployment then describes the time a potential worker spends between jobs. Technological unemployment occurs when machines replace workers, which was the case during the Industrial Revolution when manual textile weavers were replaced by steam-driven machines. This sort of unemployment continues today, as technology improves and manual work is made redundant. Then there is cyclical unemployment, caused by a lack of demand for labor due to external circumstances, such as during the Great Depression. People may want work, but they can’t find it. While these distinctions do little to raise the spirits of the unemployed, they are useful in determining how exactly to combat unemployment. When you decide how to spend your money – for example, by buying a new home, a car or even an ice cream sandwich – you essentially make that decision yourself. How companies decide to spend money, however, is generally far less straightforward. Unlike individuals, corporate decision making is influenced by shareholders and management. Many corporations are owned by many shareholders. However, only very few companies have an individual shareholder with enough shares as to determine a company’s future alone, as is the case with Sweden’s Wallenberg family, which owns 40 percent of Saab, a car and aircraft manufacturer. In contrast, the managers of companies have effective control, being more directly involved in day-to-day decision making. This can of course cause problems when the interests of shareholders and managers differ. A manager is looking for prestige, which is positively linked to the size of the company she manages. In contrast, shareholders care more about profit than prestige, which isn’t necessarily related to a company’s size. To shareholders, higher profits mean higher dividends and thus a higher rate of survivability, since a company with high profits is less likely to experience a liquidity crisis. It is conflicts of interest such as these that can lead to conflicts between shareholders and managers. Sometimes, too, governments or even workers can affect corporate decision making. Workers can  organize in trade or labor unions, which help fight for higher wages or to improve working conditions. Some companies too are partially owned by governments. The German government holds a 25-percent stake in the country’s second-largest bank, Commerzbank, which gives the federal government a direct say in the bank’s corporate decision making. Have you noticed that wherever you may be in the world, you can still find a can of Coca-Cola? The reason for this is international trade, or the exchange of capital, goods and services across international borders. In fact, international trade has increased dramatically in the past 50 years. In the early 1960s, trade between countries accounted for 12 percent of global GDP, but by 2010, had risen to as high as 29 percent. The effects of international trade on markets and services can be best illustrated through the following examples. First, many technology companies are outsourcing services, such as customer service call centers and software development, to countries where wages are lower. Second, manufacturing has become a global business, with manufacturing’s share in the world merchandise trade (the global trade of products) in 2010 as high as 69 percent. And lastly, developing countries are playing a larger role in the world economy thanks to international trade. China, for example, in 1980 accounted for only 0.8 percent of world manufacturing compared to 16.8 percent in 2012. Participation in the global economy of course requires money; this can come from many sources. Some money comes from the trade surplus that accrues when countries export more than they import. Sometimes, however, the opposite occurs, and a country will experience a trade deficit. To pay for trade deficits, countries can draw from investment income, or money that comes from the country’s financial investments abroad, such as dividends from shares of foreign companies held by the country’s residents. Another option is to procure money in the form of foreign aid, or grants given by other governments. If those funds aren’t enough to cover trade deficits, countries may have to either borrow money or to sell assets, for example, in the form of bonds. As we look to the future, globalization will only make international trade that much more important. The key message in this book: The economy has changed significantly over the last 300 years. Not only have the economic actors changed, but also the structure of corporations and global trade make us more connected than ever. To understand the structure of our societies and the complex relationships between countries, it’s critical to have a foundational understanding of economics.

When you’re faced with the possible collapse of the current world order and its globalized economic system, there’s no better guide than internationally renowned economist Dambisa Moyo. Economics and the political order can be tough subjects to get your head around, whether you’re trained in the field or not. But these blinks give you the prognosis. They explain how the world economic system should be functioning to ensure that it’s working in everybody’s favor. What’s more, they go into what’s currently going wrong, and how the forces of protectionism, anti-globalization and populism will only worsen these problems. But these blinks are no lamentation to a lost world; they also offer a practical guide, telling you what you can do to ensure the preservation of liberal democracy and a healthy economic system that can ultimately serve to protect and nourish us all. In these blinks, you’ll learn why Chinese economic growth might not be all it’s cracked up to be; just how good Americans are at math compared to the rest of the world; and how much was raised in contributions for the 2016 US presidential election. Economics is a rich and complex field of study. But when you read or see a news report about how a particular company or country is doing, it all gets boiled down to a few bare figures. And most of the time, what’s being talked about is growth. We’re obsessed with it and we expect it: if a country’s economic growth is stagnating, then you can be sure that some politician is going to come in for criticism. But let’s backtrack a bit. Just why is growth so desirable? Simply put, growth brings economic opportunity, upward mobility and increased living standards. China is the example par excellence here. Its growth over the last 40 years has been stupendous and it now stands as the world’s second-largest economy. By 2014, China’s purchasing power parity – how much a country's money can buy in other countries – was $17.6 trillion, surpassing the United States’ $17.4 trillion. China's economic growth also brought economic opportunity. Its economy created new jobs, especially for the rural poor; in just one generation, over 300 million Chinese were lifted out of poverty. In 2013, the Chinese State Council’s income distribution plan made clear how the economy would be directed. China would work toward minimizing income inequality by raising low wages, increasing education spending and providing more affordable housing. This begs the question: what factors result in a country failing to grow? As we know from Argentina, when economic growth fails to materialize, it’s often down to political instability and short-term thinking. Back in 1913, Argentina was, per capita, the world’s tenth-richest country. But between 1930 and the mid-1970s, the country experienced six military coups. Alongside this political instability, three separate bouts of hyperinflation exceeded 500 percent per year, while economic “growth” rates sank below zero for several years. Furthermore, Argentine governments weren’t exactly thinking long-term about what could be done to benefit the country. They failed to invest in education and instead preferred to build up a cheap, poorly educated agricultural labor force – hardly a strategy for economic success. In fact, during the 1940s, Argentina had the lowest rate of secondary-school attendance in the world, and the result of poor education was ultimately a lack of innovation and a competitiveness shortfall. The full effects were felt in Argentina’s 1998-2002 economic and political crisis. Unemployment peaked at 25 percent, the currency lost 75 percent of its value and poverty went from 35 percent in 2001 to 54.3 percent in 2002. Getting the economy right is tricky, but one thing is clear: growth matters. If you’re managing a household budget, going into debt can be terrifying. But when it comes to national economies, the situation is quite different. Believe it or not, going into debt can actually stimulate economic growth. Let’s look at the United States as an example. After the Second World War, the country took on a massive amount of debt to fund education, health care and infrastructure. A great deal of capital was put aside in 1956 for an expansive interstate highway system. The same was true of the 1944 G.I. Bill, which sought to educate and offer business loans to war veterans. As a result, over 2 million veterans attended college and over 5.5 million received training; the quality of the US workforce was improved. That said, debt isn’t always a good thing. If it gets too high, trouble is sure to be close at hand – that much is clear from the 2007 global financial crisis. Thanks to high debt levels, Greece, Italy and Ireland all saw a decline in growth. Their interest payments on public debt increased to 10 percent of tax revenue, and any funds each government had needed to be redirected to debt repayment instead of measures like improving education. This debt crisis further hampered economic growth. But there are other issues that hamstring economic growth. For instance, global population growth increases the demand for natural resources, even as their finite supply dwindles. Within just 60 years, the world's population has soared from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 7 billion in 2011. It will probably hit 9 billion by 2050. As the world’s resources are limited, commodity prices will inevitably rise. As these increases permeate through the economy, this is sure to result in inflation and, in turn, negatively impact both the economy and individuals’ living standards. Water is a good example. Even though 70 percent of the Earth is covered by water, about 97 percent of it is too salty to be used for drinking or irrigation. As demand for water rises with the population, water shortages are likely to thwart the cultivation of food and the generation of hydroelectricity in many countries. Global food markets and economic growth are sure to suffer as a result of this shortage. Economies are fragile things: one misstep and the whole edifice can come crumbling down. It may seem counterintuitive, but one of the biggest threats an economy faces is people, and specifically its workforce – that is to say, the people in an economy who actively contribute to its growth. In the developed world, both the quantity and quality of workforces are in decline, and this poses a major problem. The core issue is aging populations, which the United Nations has identified as a global phenomenon. According to the UN’s forecasts, one in six people will be older than 65 in 2050, as compared to one in 12 in 2015. An aging population raises the dependency ratio of retirees to workers, which in turn hampers productivity. With people living longer, we can expect longer retirements. This means more has to be spent on health care and on pensions, which is no small economic burden. In particular, developed nations are dealing with aging populations. Take Japan; forecasts estimate that 40 percent of the country’s population will be over 65 by 2060. As Japan will have fewer younger workers, it will face labor shortages, decreased productivity and stagnating economic growth. Numbers aren’t the only problem: the quality of the workforce will decline too. Thanks to long-standing underinvestment in education, the United States is already witnessing the start of this phenomenon. In the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test, 15-year-old American students ranked thirteenth out of 35 countries in math. When this generation of students joins the workforce, the United States will likely cease to remain competitive in technological innovation. A further threat to the economy comes in the form of automation. Technology is increasingly rendering jobs redundant, which leads to greater income inequality. A 2013 Oxford Martin School report estimated that 47 percent of all jobs in the United States were vulnerable to automation. The arrival of driverless vehicles was identified as particularly problematic. And just think, the trucking industry alone accounts for 3.4 to 4.5 million jobs in the United States. Truck drivers, bus drivers and taxi drivers could all be affected. Critically, as technology will replace low-wage jobs first, this is sure to exacerbate income inequality. And these same income disparities are also bound to increase the risk of social and political instability, as more people lose trust in the governmental and economic systems. Two events in 2016 seemed to indicate that the global economic consensus was turning a corner. First, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in the Brexit referendum. Then, later in the year, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. These indicate that the world is steering away from globalization and back to protectionism. Unfortunately, protectionist trade policies damage the global and national economies alike. The global economy struggles because protectionist tariffs and quotas on imported goods and services end up limiting trade and thus squeezing the flow of cross-border capital. That’s understandable, of course. But, ironically, national economies are the second victim of protectionism. Just consider the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which enforced an effective tax rate of 60 percent on over 3,200 products imported into the United States. Theoretically, protectionist policies are meant to safeguard local businesses and therefore bolster the domestic economy. But the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act didn’t achieve this goal at all. Instead, other countries retaliated by imposing tariffs on American products. The result was job losses and lower living standards: America’s GDP plummeted from $104.6 billion in 1929 to only $57.2 billion in 1933. On top of that, protectionism negatively affects producers in developing countries, with EU and US farm subsidies constituting prime examples. Although these measures were designed to subsidize domestic farmers in the domestic market, farmers in South America, Africa and Asia naturally struggle to compete in those markets. Consequently, agricultural trade in developing countries is unable to bring in money that could be used for building infrastructure and the like. Also important to remember is the fact that developing countries account for more than 80 percent of the world’s population. A third consequence of protectionism is global labor imbalance. According to the International Labour Organization, globally there are 73.4 million people between the ages of 18 and 24 who are unemployed. But, simultaneously, there are labor shortages in developed countries, such as Japan, due to their aging populations. One way to deal with labor shortages is to enforce effective immigration policies. Canada and Australia faced just this problem; so, to bring in labor from countries that had a surplus, they established a points-based system, which was designed to judge migrants on their academic achievements and work experience. Hundreds of millions of people in the developing world live on less than a dollar a day. When the biggest concern is whether there will be food on the table every night, it’s understandable that calls for political freedom become secondary. That’s why many people in the world prioritize economic growth over a flawless, transparent democracy. China is an excellent example in this regard. It has developed a form of authoritarian state capitalism that has served the country well by fostering economic growth. It does this by prioritizing collectivism over individual rights and freedoms. Record economic growth there has resulted in a reduction in poverty that is historically unprecedented. One key strategy of the Chinese government in reducing income inequality is to increase spending on affordable housing and education. Chinese secondary school attendance currently stands at 94 percent, which is mind-boggling considering that it was just 28 percent in 1970. The government has also established an impressive infrastructure initiative. Now, thanks to an ever-expanding network of highways built in the last 15 years, China has more paved roads than the United States. But not all that glitters is gold. Amazing as China’s success appears at first glance, in reality, government control and intervention can actually endanger long-term economic growth. The George W. Bush administration ran into just that problem. Through its “Housing for All” policy, the US government tried to incentivize American households to invest their wealth in housing instead of stocks, goods and cash. To do so, the government essentially started participating in financial markets, acting as a de facto mortgage lender. It offered affordable mortgages through two government-sponsored enterprises known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Many Americans ended up buying property they couldn’t afford and found themselves burdened by crippling debt; these very transactions played a key role in triggering the cataclysmic 2008 financial crisis. It just goes to show that emerging economies should be aware of the weaknesses of an economic system built on state intervention. State-centric system such as China’s won’t be able to print money forever. The last decade has seen the rise of populism and growing economic uncertainty; it has become increasingly clear that Western democracies have to adapt. Radical reforms are needed to ensure that good decision-making remains a key pillar in Western democracies. What’s more, it’s us who need to force the issue. First of all, we need to make it difficult for policymakers to easily revoke legislation. As things stand, it’s fairly straightforward for policymakers to void their predecessors’ decisions. This changeability of policy creates uncertainty that discourages investment, which, in turn, is detrimental to long-term economic growth. Just take the Paris Agreement on climate change. President Barack Obama signed it in December 2015 to great fanfare, only for his successor, Donald Trump, to withdraw in 2017. It’s clear, then, that what’s needed are international agreements that bind governments to already signed policies. This might include agreements made by the World Trade Organization (WTO) or NATO security agreements. Secondly, we should ensure that campaign contributions are strictly limited. That way, the disproportional impact of wealthy interest groups on democratic elections can be constrained. Think about it: an estimated – and mind-boggling – $2 billion was raised in campaign contributions during the 2016 US presidential election. Campaign contributions in the United States have skyrocketed in successive elections, and this has resulted in a political system in which wealth is the only thing that matters. Politicians have adjusted their policies to benefit rich donors instead of the voting public at large. Third, policymakers should be paid more. That way, working in the public sector will be more attractive to talented people. As things stand, the significant pay gap between private and public sectors means that the public sector is left looking like the poorer – and less skilled – cousin. By way of comparison, the average CEO’s income in the United States increased tenfold from $1.5 million to $15 million between 1979 to 2013. As for the President of the United States’ wage package? It wheezed its way from $100,000 in 1969 to $400,000 in 2001. Reforming the political system is no easy task, but it’s a necessary one. And there are three more aspects that need changing. For starters, we should extend politicians’ terms in office, but simultaneously impose term limits. Longer terms in office allow leaders to focus on long-term solutions due to increased accountability. Mexico is a good example here. Francisco I. Madero won the country’s presidential election in 1910, campaigning under the slogan, “Valid voting and no reelection.” Since then, Mexican presidents have only been able to hold a single six-year term in office, once. The result has been a relatively stable political environment and high rates of economic growth compared to Mexico's Latin American neighbors. Secondly, there needs to be some sort of minimum requirement for candidates, particularly in terms of “real-world” experience. Just look at the British House of Commons. A 2012 study by the British House of Commons Library showed that the percentage of parliamentary representatives with backgrounds in manual labor dropped dramatically from over 70 percent to 25 percent between 1983 and 2010. We should recognize that politicians who lack such “real-world” experience tend to lack understanding and empathy for people facing real economic challenges. They're more likely to make policy decisions in favor of the upper classes – or basically whatever it takes to keep their seats in parliament. Therefore, we should stipulate that in order to run for office, a candidate should already serve a certain number years of work outside the political sphere. Finally, voting needs to be mandatory. According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, only 36 percent of eligible voters in the United States voted in November 2014. It was the lowest turnout in over 70 years and part of a startling trend. Since voters are fundamentally responsible for electing politicians and the policies they implement, it's essential that turnout is increased. Fines are one way this might be achieved. Australia has just such a system. There, you’re fined $20 the first time you don’t vote, and $50 for each subsequent no-show on election days. The result? The country’s turnout rate is above 90 percent. And Australia isn’t alone in this; Singapore and Belgium also enforce compulsory voting. These countries are on their way to ensuring that their democracies survive into the future. The key message in these blinks: We need long-term economic growth to achieve higher living standards, which encompass everything from increased wages and better education, to reduced income inequality and access to health care. However, current liberal democracies are beginning to favor short-term policies and protectionism. If we don’t manage to steer our democracies away from this path, economic stagnation and lower standards of living are sure to follow. Got feedback?

It’s a basic fabric today, one that seems humbler than, say, silk or satin. But you might be surprised to learn how complexly interwoven cotton is with the development of the modern world – from Columbus’s discovery of the New World to industrialization to the American Civil War and beyond. Before Wall Street, there was cotton – a global mover and shaker, an economic powerhouse. These blinks give the whole story. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the broader connection between slavery and cotton; cotton’s role in the divide between the developed and developing world; and who the big players of cotton are today.  Today, cotton is everywhere you look. Chances are, you’re wearing some at this very moment. With such a pervasive presence in society, it’s little wonder that cotton also has a long and captivating history. Cotton has been used by humans for thousands of years, beginning with peoples in Africa, Asia and America, who independently discovered cotton and its perfect suitability for cloth making. By the early 1500s, people in twelve small villages on the Pacific coast of modern-day Mexico were using the plant to pay tribute to their Aztec overlords. In the same period, in Gujrat, India, and on the west coast of Africa, people were growing the plant. These growers would harvest the white fluff and make cloth by hand at home, sometimes transporting it to local markets to be sold. In fifteenth-century China, cotton cloth was even used to pay taxes! Back then, cotton weavers were still growing and processing the plant independently. In other words, the cotton growers of Africa had no contact with those in Mexico. However, that all changed when Europeans entered the scene, elevating cotton production to a global scale. Before this shift began, around the year 1500, Europeans wore wool and linen, totally unaware that cotton existed. As they began exploring the world and claiming new territory – as in the expeditions of Christopher Columbus – they were introduced to the wonders of cotton, which feels much better against the skin than wool or linen and is also easier to wash. Between 1600 and 1800, European settlers, driven by their love for this new cloth, launched a violent but profitable cotton triangle that bridged three continents. Armed merchants would go to India to buy cotton. They would then trade it with African leaders for slaves and transport these slaves to the Americas where they would work in cotton fields on newly stolen lands. In this way, the global cotton empire was born. But in the years that followed, it would grow and transform in innumerable ways. In the year 1784, Samuel Greg made history when he opened the first mechanized cotton mill outside of Manchester, England. The mill, which sat on the banks of the river Bollin, was powered by the flow of the river’s waters. From that point, mechanization only improved and spread, and the world of cotton was transformed. In fact, mechanization had a major economic impact for British manufacturers as it enabled them to undercut the weavers of India. Mechanization meant booming productivity and plummeting costs. This put Indian manufacturers at a serious disadvantage. Eighteenth-century Indian spinners, the world leaders of cotton production in their day, required 50,000 hours to spin 100 pounds of cotton. By 1825, British workers operating machinery needed just 135 hours to process the same amount. Because of this incredible change, between 1795 and 1811, British cotton prices dropped by up to 50 percent, enabling Britain to emerge as the world’s leader in cotton exports. In 20 years, the annual value of British cotton goods exports increased by a factor of sixteen, hitting £5,854,057 in 1800. Many other countries also caught on, making the most of mechanization. France, Germany and Belgium each took active steps to protect their domestic cotton producers from foreign competition, especially from Britain. From 1806 to 1814, the French blocked all British cotton goods, effectively kick-starting the continental European cotton market. Due to this market insulation, the cotton industry, along with other mechanized fields, became stronger on the continent, enabling these countries to industrialize before others. Protecting the developing industry required a strong state, with a powerful police force and military to guard the border; countries also needed a stellar legal system, in case of disputes. Naturally, some countries, such as India, which had been weakened by British colonization, lacked such state development. State strength made all the difference. The countries that had industrialized early experienced burgeoning cotton industries, while those that hadn’t, like India and Brazil, fell behind, forming the divide that can be seen to this day between developed and developing nations. So manufacturing changed the world and, as it did, the demand for raw cotton steadily grew. By 1790, Britain was spinning six times more cotton than it had been in 1781. But where did all this cotton come from? Well, a huge amount originated in the European colonies, but, eventually, even they couldn’t produce enough to meet demand. Here’s what happened: In the late eighteenth century, the vast majority of raw cotton imported to Britain was from expropriated lands in the Americas, worked by slave labor. For instance, Barbados, then a part of the British West Indies, exported 2.6 million pounds of cotton in 1789 alone. But colonies like this were soon faced with problems. After all, an island only has so much available land. Further complicating matters, many colonies faced slave rebellions. St. Dominique is a good example. In 1791, the slaves there overthrew their French colonizers, creating what is now modern-day Haiti. It was in this climate that the Southern United States emerged as the perfect solution for cotton importers. The South had lots of advantages for cotton growing, a perfect climate among them. By killing or evicting the indigenous people who lived there, the United States easily quelled any social resistance while gaining access to pristine agricultural land. Meanwhile, a steady stream of slaves offered a source of low-cost labor. Between 1783 and 1808, 170,000 slaves were brought from Africa to Southern US plantations and, by 1830, one million people – one out of every thirteen Americans – were growing cotton. To maintain this system, plantation owners imposed brutal conditions; as a matter of course, slaves were beaten and tortured. This bloody program catapulted the Southern United States into its position as the world leader in cotton production. Histories of the industrial revolution tend to focus on inventors like James Watt, whose steam engine transformed the face of the earth. Without a doubt, bright minds and groundbreaking inventions made progress possible. However, the real fuel of industrialization was the millions of workers whose stories didn’t make it into the textbooks. In the United Kingdom, the first industrialized nation, working conditions were atrocious. Ellen Hooton, a woman who, as a child, worked in a cotton factory in Wigan, England, is one of the few workers whose story has reached us. In 1833, she testified during a Manchester Commission investigation into child factory labor. She began working at the age of seven. Her day started at 5:30 a.m. and ended at 8:00 p.m., and if she ever made a mistake or arrived late to work, she would be beaten or publicly shamed. During a productive, week she would earn two shillings and seven and a half pennies, the equivalent of around $9.80 in 2005 dollars. Her story is emblematic of general working conditions at the time. Millions of workers came to work in factories every single day, following a new rhythm of work – not the rhythm of the sun or the seasons like farmers, but the relentless beat of the machine. Why were these workers willing to toil under such brutal conditions? Well, most had no other option. After all, homemade cotton goods could never compete with the cheap cloth made by manufacturers. Factory production put household weavers out of business, forcing them to find work in factories. Since these home-based weavers were largely women, women also predominated in the factories. For example, during the mid-1820s, 89 percent of the workers at England’s New Hampshire-based Dover Mill were women. However, factories also recruited other vulnerable groups, especially children from orphanages and poor families desperate for income. So industrialization was a major boon to cotton production and by the mid-nineteenth century, millions of people were working in the newly built factories that produced cotton goods. But that’s not the only way the cotton industry was evolving. Merchants were also transforming the way business was done. This emergent merchant class of middlemen was increasingly necessary in the early nineteenth century, as the cotton industry became ever more global. More and more, merchants were coordinating the work of growers, slaves, manufacturers and investors across the world, from farmers in Gujarat, India, to spinners in the English town of Oldham, to the factories of Manchester and the bazaars of Istanbul. By facilitating this interconnection, they laid the foundation for the globalized, modern capitalist world we live in today. At the same time, manufacturers were buying more and more cotton from brokers rather than dealers. The difference between the two was that the former, unlike the latter, didn’t actually own cotton. Rather, they oversaw deals between manufacturers and cotton importers. This development made networking essential to business success in the industry. In the rocky world of cotton trading, you had to be able to trust your broker and your merchant. It was a risky business; a single undelivered order or bad deal could mean bankruptcy. The most successful players in this high-risk game were those who built trusting networks, often around family, religion or geography. Just take Nathan Mayer Rothschild, of the famous Rothschild family, who, in 1799, went to Manchester to enter the cotton game. The majority of what he sold was bought by fellow Jews from his home city of Frankfurt. Rothschild knew these people would buy from him so, when he arrived in Manchester, he could buy in bulk. Since the people he did business with trusted him, they even gave him credit to invest in Manchester-based factories. In no time at all, he tripled his initial investment, kick-starting his investment career. Around the same time that the cotton industry was kicking into high gear, two groups of US capitalists were also coming into heated conflict. A new class of American industrial capitalists – merchants, to be exact – were employing wage labor and wanted to expand their operations to cotton-plantation rich lands around the world. But the old Southern planter elite wasn’t about to part with its slaves without a fight. They wanted to maintain slavery and even extend it west. Both sides worked hard to sway the government and, soon enough, the mounting domestic tensions resulted in a civil war that shook the global cotton industry to its foundations. This was the American Civil War, of course, whose first shots were fired at Fort Sumter, in April of 1861. Before the South’s eventual surrender, the US cotton-export industry would be absolutely decimated; by 1862, British cotton imports from the United States were a whopping 96-percent lower than the previous year. It was in this chaos that European manufacturers rushed to secure new sources, like those in India, where British colonial officials had recently constructed fresh infrastructure. In fact, during the first year of the Civil War, British spending in India on infrastructure, mainly railroads, nearly doubled. Britain also reduced its import taxes from 10 percent to 5 percent for Indian cotton products, thereby boosting the Indian market. Naturally, India began exporting a lot more raw cotton as a result and, by 1862, 75 percent of British cotton and 70 percent of French cotton was of Indian origin. But, however calamitous the Civil War might have been, it wasn’t the end of US cotton. In 1865, the war came to a close. The end of American slavery deprived the Southern cotton powerhouse of its labor. However, the cotton growers soon found a new workforce. As slavery ended, the American cotton workforce shrank dramatically. But the demand for cotton was rising as fast as ever. In fact, between 1860 and 1890, global consumption of cotton doubled. Who was going to toil in the fields to meet this demand? Well, it wouldn’t be long before a new work relationship replaced slavery. Here’s what happened: Once released from the bondage of slavery, many recent slaves demanded land so they could grow crops for their own subsistence and live independently. However, most land in the American South belonged to plantation owners. Even land that was confiscated during the Civil War had been returned to its prior owners by 1865. So a new system – called sharecropping – was born. It was essentially a compromise. Freedpeople would work on land owned by former plantation masters and, in return, receive a share of the crops they grew. Meanwhile, in other regions of the globe, property rights were being introduced, changing the nature of agriculture in the process. One such place was India. Traditionally, Indian farmland was owned communally, with those who worked on the land being entitled to a share of the communal harvest. But that all changed in the second half of the nineteenth century when the British began enforcing property rights. All of a sudden, every farmer owned a smaller plot individually and could keep all the crops he grew. The problem was that individuals didn’t have enough money to buy the seeds and farm tools they needed. As a result, they were forced to take out loans from sowkars, or moneylenders, basically mortgaging their newly acquired land. For these loans, they paid absurd interest rates of up to 30 percent, which forced them to grow more and more cotton to pay off their debt. Of course, new systems of this type greatly benefited cotton-buying manufacturers. By 1894, the price of cotton for a US buyer was seven cents, even lower than the pre-Civil War cost of eleven cents. Around the turn of the twentieth century, new world powers – namely, Russia and Japan – had begun entering the cotton game. Both of these nations grew cotton in their colonies and, for Japan in particular, cotton demand soared in the first years of the twentieth century. For instance, in 1893, the country imported just 125 million pounds of raw cotton. By 1902 that number had increased to 446 million, the majority of it coming from India and the United States. This trend continued and, by 1920, Japan was importing over 1 billion pounds of cotton a year. That being said, the Japanese were wary of depending on imports from other countries. They sought to secure “raw material independence” for themselves, working to get their cotton from their own territories. To do so, they began farming cotton in their own colonies. Korea was one such colony. Between 1916 and 1920, 165 million pounds of raw cotton were grown in Korea, compared to just 30 million pounds between 1904 and 1908. Simultaneously, Russia exploited its colonies in Central Asia, like Turkestan, and the United States stole new land from indigenous Americans for cotton production. Because of these colonial cotton expansions, between 1860 and 1920, at least 55 million acres of new land became cotton fields in Africa, Asia and the Americas. But in order to make such expansions, colonial powers first had to undermine the pre-existing industries in these places. This process, known as deindustrialization, involved the imposition of tariffs and duties on colonies, which effectively squashed the local production of cotton goods. The colonizers then built infrastructure, like massive railroads, that were geared toward global cotton growers rather than home weavers. In India alone, between two and six million people employed in traditional cotton spinning or weaving lost their jobs between 1830 and 1860. The results were catastrophic. Locals soon came to depend on the global price of cotton, putting them at the mercy of world market fluctuations. For example, in the 1890s, global cotton prices tanked while Indian food prices steadily increased, resulting in 19 million people dying from famine. The twentieth century was a time of sweeping changes and the cotton industry was no exception. In large part, that’s because during this time conditions became favorable for newly industrializing nations. After all, old industrial countries like Britain and Germany had powerful labor unions that increased the rights and wages of workers. For instance, in Germany, spinners took home 53 percent more in 1913 than they had in 1865. Meanwhile, in countries new to the industrial map, like China and India, wages were absurdly low. Naturally, a new class of capitalist merchants emerged to take advantage of this fact and they were bolstered in their efforts by government support. For example, in China in 1910, a spinner earned just 6.1 percent of what his American counterpart did. To maintain this difference, the state protected and assisted mill owners. Just consider the 1920s, when the government stood by as thousands of left-wing labor leaders were assassinated in a coordinated effort by mill owners in Shanghai. It’s no wonder that these industrializing countries soon dominated the cotton industry. Though China didn’t adopt mechanized cotton manufacturing until late in the game, Chinese production was booming by World War I. The timing was perfect for China. The Great War knocked the Western manufacturers out of the game, effectively insulating Chinese industry from competition. As a result, between 1913 and 1931, the total number of spindles in China rose by 297 percent, the fastest growth worldwide. At the same time, Britain, once the world’s leading manufacturer of cotton, was experiencing the opposite trend. Between 1919 and 1939, 43 percent of all British cotton looms were put out of commission, largely because of rising wages. This history is still visible today. China remains the world’s largest producer in cotton, making up 29 percent of global production. India ranks second, with 21 percent, and the United States is still a major player, with 14 percent. But in cotton, as you now know, nothing is fixed. Who can say how the global playing field will shift in the coming decades. The key message in this book: Who would think that a simple plant like cotton could shape the course of history? Well, that’s precisely what it did; for centuries, cotton production has transformed global economic relations. It’s launched wars and, arguably, it laid the foundations of global capitalism.

Will your neighborhood gas station soon only sell biofuel? Will the world be powered by giant wind farms? Can we stop global warming with carbon sequestration? Depending on who you listen to, all four scenarios are either impossible or just around the corner. These polar standpoints are what makes the global energy debate often so confusing: politicians, environmental groups and corporations are all shamelessly promoting their own agendas so it’s hard to know what’s fact and what’s fiction. In these blinks, you’ll find several myths about global energy examined critically and scientifically. You’ll find out: why civilization won’t end anytime soon due to a lack of crude oil, why adopting biofuels on a large scale would mean choosing between fuel and food, and why you wouldn’t want a carbon sequestration site in your backyard. In the 1990s, a group of retired geologists, in conjunction with the scientist Richard Duncan put forth a radical new theory known as peak oil. According to this theory, humanity was depleting the world’s oil supplies at such a rate that a drastic shortage of oil was imminent. They also argued that the end of the oil era would be a turning point for humanity, prompting the end of industrial civilization as soon as 2025! But in fact, these claims are completely unfounded and unjustified: A big part of the problem in peak oil theories is that they are overly focused on the supply side of the equation, meaning global oil production, neglecting the demand side and how it is influenced by oil prices. They believe that progressively lower oil production we’ve seen over the years is indicative of a physical shortage of oil, when in fact it’s merely due to a decrease in demand. This phenomenon was evident after the oil price hikes of 1978 and 2004, for example. What’s more, our future need for oil will likely decrease thanks to our increasing use of alternative fuels as well as technological innovations, efficiency improvements and better resource management. So while humanity will eventually transition away from oil due to depleted supplies and the rising cost of its extraction, our reduction in crude oil usage will not mean the end of civilization, rather just a gradual transition to something else. Peak oil theories are also unjustified in claiming to know how much oil is left in the ground, but really the amount of this estimated ultimately recoverable (EUR) oil remains uncertain. Recent assessments show there are still significant untapped oil resources, and global EUR oil is estimated at 400 billion barrels – almost triple what most peak oil theories claim. And this figure does not even include unconventional oil reserves like tar sands or bitumen, which further add to the potential reserves. Recently, there’s been a great deal of debate about how to counteract the global warming effect caused by excessive emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. As China and many developing countries increase their energy consumption, it is clear that global CO2 emissions will rise significantly over the next decades. Some experts have proposed so-called carbon sequestration as the solution: capturing and storing greenhouse gases so they don’t affect the atmosphere. But is this really a valid solution? No, it is costly and inefficient. This method cannot remove enough CO2 from the atmosphere to even noticeably slow down the buildup of the gas. What’s more, artificial carbon sequestration would demand setting up approximately 160,000 CO2 capture towers, also known as “artificial trees,” which would be very costly, not to mention the added expense of compressing, transporting and storing the gas.. Of course, plants are continuously sequestering carbon, as they inhale CO2. But to intervene in global warming with plant-driven carbon sequestration would demand a lot of land, resources and time for the plants to grow – 40 to 80 years. What’s more, storing the sequestered carbon is also difficult and risky. The acidity of the carbon could well eat away at the storage facility, eventually allowing the carbon to leak out again. And at the moment, storage capacity only exists for a quarter of annual global carbon output, so many more storage sites would have to be built for large-scale sequestration. Herein is the problem that people don’t want carbon storage sites near their homes because the sites are inherently hazardous: toxic metals could seep into the drinking water supply due to the stored carbon’s high acidity. Lately, there’s been a lot of buzz about ethanol produced from plants as a perfect green energy source. Its proponents say it would make us independent from crude oil, lower our carbon emission and stabilize incomes for grain farmers, who would provide the raw material for its production. Unfortunately, it’s not so simple. Producing biofuel from plants is costly and environmentally damaging. It requires vast amounts of land to grow the crops. For example, if we were to use sugar cane as a source for biofuel to replace traditional fuel, we would need to marshall almost 40 percent of the world’s cultivated land for this purpose alone. What’s more, by 2050 the global population will reach nine billion, and we simply can’t devote so much land to producing biofuel when people also need to grow food crops to eat. Nor can we clear more land for the purpose, since deforestation is already a problem, and clearing forest on such a massive scale would have severe climatological consequences. Also, biofuel does not represent a sensible solution in many oil-based vehicles. For example, in the US, many cars have such dismal fuel efficiency that from an environmental perspective, it would make more sense to improve this factor than to convert them to run on biofuel. Also, many of today’s road vehicles, ships and airplanes are built to use refined oil products that biofuel cannot replace. Therefore before any kind of large-scale biofuel production is implemented, the overall transport system should be improved and optimized to address these issues. If you’ve ever been caught outside in a storm, you know the wind has incredible power. Indeed, simulations show that in terms of energy potential, winds at the altitude of 100 meters could generate as much as 78 terawatts globally. In the US alone, wind energy potential is almost twenty times greater than all the electricity the country generates now. Sound good? Unfortunately, a closer look reveals that wind energy doesn’t have what it takes to be a dominant energy source, 25 years from now. Why? First of all, the energy potential of the most powerful winds is difficult to harness because they blow in the jetstream, some eleven kilometers above the earth. Their location also tends to shift depending on the seasons, so utilizing them would be very inconvenient: it would require deploying massive amounts of flying generators tethered to the earth with aluminum lines. Second, the traditional wind farms also have their problems: they require large amounts of land because the turbines need to be spaced apart from each other, and this means they produce relatively little power per square kilometer. What’s more, locals may object to wind farms due to their appearance, feeling that the ugly things spoil their view of the countryside or waterfront. And turbines are also loud and pose a threat to local bird and bat populations. It is for these reasons that in 2007, only about 1.25 percent of the world’s energy was produced by wind turbines. Third, wind energy is dependent on the wind, which is notoriously fickle. Wind speeds vary depending on the time of year and geographic location, meaning that if wind was the world’s predominant power source, a vast network of intercontinental high-voltage transmission lines would be needed to even out the shifting imbalances in global production. The wind fluctuations would create great price fluctuations. As you are probably beginning to see, when it comes to energy policy, there is no silver bullet, no easy and quick solution. Patience and careful analysis are needed. Remember these few rules of thumb when someone claims that the world’s energy landscape will change radically very quickly: First, don’t underestimate how long the conventional energy sources will linger. Shifting to new kinds of fuels or energy production methods is always a gradual process. Analysis has shown that established energy supply patterns can persist over generations. So rather than rushing to embrace a new energy source like biofuel on a large scale, we should first focus on optimizing efficiency in the production and use of the incumbent sources. Second, be distrustful when someone claims a new energy source will be adopted very rapidly and enthusiastically on a global level. Even energy technologies that are clearly superior will be adopted only gradually. What’s more, various players in the energy debate have their own agendas, and therefore often deliberately use misleading arguments or misinterpret data from scientific studies to bolster their claim that something will happen quickly. And even if you find an objective source, it’s impossible to forecast in detail just how people and industry will convert to a new energy source. There are always unforeseen setbacks and obstacles. Third, remember that any major adoption of a new energy innovation will probably require extensive and very expensive changes to the infrastructure. These changes demand large investments as well as overcoming legal and environmental issues, which takes time. As humanity debates how to power our globe for the next decades, it would do well to keep in mind these three factors: First, there are many competing ideologies and interests at play, but energy policy decisions must be made based on a rational and objective cost-benefit analysis. For example, at the moment the oil and gas industry is lobbying powerfully for carbon sequestration as the answer to global warming, but they are hardly objective experts: the ability to store carbon would be a new revenue stream for them, while at the same time making them look less responsible for global warming. Second, remember that there are vast regional differences in terms of energy demand and production. For example, it may be that some energy innovations are easier to implement in developing countries than in developed ones, because the latter already have fully fledged economies running on fossil fuels, and people used to having cheap power to charge their iPads. Third, all decisions should adhere to the maxim that avoiding or minimizing environmental damage is always better than trying to neutralize it afterwards. Case in point: In 2005 and 2006, biofuels were promoted grandiosely, only for later analysis to reveal how harmful their production is for the environment. Meanwhile, instead of fixating on ways to sequester the carbon already in the atmosphere, affluent nations should focus on managing their own energy use so they become less dependent on fossil fuels and can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Key message in this book: Civilization as we know it will not end due to oil wells going dry. Carbon sequestration will not magically stop global warming. Wind energy and biofuels are not the energy sources of the future. In fact, likely any change in global energy production and consumption will happen very slowly, and therefore the decisions we make about energy should only be founded on rational, patient analysis.

It’s just one of the many cryptocurrencies that’ve been making headlines in recent years. Cryptocurrencies are often touted as the next big thing in finance, but few people really understand how they work. In fact, rather than the currencies themselves, it’s the technology that powers them – known as blockchain technology – that has the truly revolutionary potential. Some people believe that blockchains offer so many benefits that they’ll eventually render banks obsolete. Others think they also represent the future of contracts and secure data storage. And there are still others who see all this technology as nothing but a fad that will eventually implode. After reading these blinks, you’ll have a good idea of what blockchain expert Henning Diedrich thinks, and why it might be still too early to tell where Ethereum will take us. In these blinks, you’ll discover why b-money was just a few years ahead of its time; which country uses as much electricity in a year as one Bitcoin blockchain; and why Ethereum may surpass Bitcoin as the blockchain of choice. In the 1980s, the world entered the computer age, with PCs becoming part of many homes and workplaces. To some people, however, this development was anything but welcome. To them, it seemed to foreshadow the rise of a complete surveillance state, not unlike something out George Orwell’s 1984. So a handful of computer programmers decided to fight back, and their weapon was code. Thus, in the late eighties, the cypherpunk movement began. Their main aim was the protection of people’s privacy in the digital world. One of the founders, the American programmer Eric Hughes, cataloged their goals and intentions in the 1993 book A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto. The cypherpunks wished to see safe, encrypted communication in the digital world; this would allow people to make anonymous transactions. Unlike credit card transactions, where the payer and sender can be identified, cypherpunks desired a digital currency where people could send and receive money without being tracked – not unlike paying with cash at the local corner store. They took the first step toward a private communication system in 1997, by launching the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer (CDR), which was basically an anonymous, decentralized email system. Not long afterward, came the first version of a cryptocurrency, called b-money, whose invention is credited to an individual with the online handle “Wei Dai.” Remarkably, b-money worked similarly to how bitcoin works today: all users of the currency held a copy of the transaction log, so that each payment was posted for all to see and potentially approve or dispute. The big difference between b-money and bitcoin is this: in b-money’s day, there was no decentralized way to maintain the accounts. Nevertheless, other attempts at cryptocurrencies followed, but each died when the dot-com bubble burst around the turn of the century. Nearly a decade of silence followed. And then, in 2008, bitcoin emerged, becoming the world’s first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin’s inventor is known as “Satoshi Nakamoto,” but his real name remains a mystery. However, Nakamoto did make his intentions clear. He wanted to make the concept of a traditional bank – that is, of a central financial institution – obsolete. This is why Bitcoin doesn’t operate on any central registry and why all transactions are made directly between the users. Now that you know how cryptocurrencies were born, let’s look at how they work. If you’ve read about bitcoin, you might have seen the word “blockchain” and wondered, what the heck is that? The simplest way to understand a blockchain is to think of it as a secure and shared database that contains transactions. Blockchains can be used for many purposes, but Bitcoin has become the most well known. For the purpose of this digital currency, the blockchain is used to hold transactional information about how many bitcoins are being transferred between two accounts. So the data would read something like, “Account A transfers 10 bitcoins to account B.” The database is called a blockchain because the data is stored in sections known as blocks, and these blocks are organized in a precise way that basically creates a chain of data. The first block of data is called the genesis block, and each block that follows contains information about the preceding block, thereby linking them together like a chain. However, a more appropriate analogy might be a series of Russian nesting dolls, with each block containing the information from previous blocks inside it. The real defining feature of a blockchain database is that it’s decentralized. This is an important feature for a number of reasons, the most important being that it prevents trickery. Generally speaking, most digital things can be easily duplicated – just consider how easy it is to email someone a JPEG or an MP3. But a digital currency, in order to have real value, needs to be protected against duplication. Blockchain technology overcomes this challenge by decentralizing the database. So if you have five bitcoins, this data isn’t being stored on one central computer; it’s constantly being synchronized over a whole network of computers. If you tried to go in and quickly change your bitcoin amount from five to fifteen, this change would show up on everyone’s copy of the blockchain and anyone can disagree and prevent it from becoming official. The other level of security provided by blockchain is its use of cryptography, which is why the term “cryptocurrency” is used to describe bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital currencies. Cryptography allows for secure communication and secure storage of information and provides added levels of authentication within the blockchain. Every transaction requires a digital signature that uses cryptography to authenticate transactions and ensure that past transactions aren’t tampered with. To get a better understanding of how cryptocurrencies work without the aid of a central banking authority, we need to look at the step-by-step process of a transaction. Blockchains operate through a consensus protocol known as proof-of-work. This protocol ensures that the blockchain always accurately represents every transaction made. This works by having all the individual computers in the network, called nodes, agree on one “true” version of the blockchain. The nodes that actively participate in the consensus-building process are called miners or validators. Obviously, it can be a challenge for all the nodes to agree on everything, from the order in which the transactions should be processed to what the next block should look like. And it’s not uncommon for nodes to contend with different, and sometimes conflicting, proposals on what the next block should be. However, aside from the different proposals, there is always a “longest chain” or “heaviest chain.” This is the one chain that is ultimately approved and considered “true” by the consensus protocol. It’s referred to as the “world state.” All of this work and building of the blockchain takes a lot of energy. In fact, maintaining the bitcoin blockchain for one year consumes as much energy as the entire country of Ireland uses in that same time period. Therefore, to help them cover their electricity costs, miners and validators are allowed to give themselves 12 bitcoins for every block they add. As you might imagine, the decentralized nature of blockchain makes the process a bit slow compared to conventional databases. In a conventional database like MySQL or VoltDB, a new entry takes a few milliseconds. However, for the Ethereum blockchain, which represents today’s most advanced blockchain, a new entry takes an average of three minutes. Nonetheless, that means blockchains are a thousand times faster than transactions made on the stock market, which take around three days to finalize. And compared to credit card payments, which take around four months, a blockchain transaction is about 100,000 times faster. Blockchains aren’t just a database for digital currency, though. They can also be used to create a binding contract between two or more parties. In the world of contracts, any number of things can cause one or more of the parties to fail to fulfill their contractual obligations. And this can result in endless and exhausting periods of litigation. Blockchains may obviate many contractual issues, however, since they can manage smart contracts. A smart contract not only stores the details of an agreement; it can execute the terms of the agreement as well. Smart contracts are essentially a legal text written as a computer program and inscribed into a blockchain. And since blockchains never forget anything, a smart contract is certain to execute on time. So a blockchain smart contract can be used to trigger a payment at a certain time, whether the payment is made in cryptocurrency or with a traditional credit card. Or it could guarantee that digital goods, such as a music or video file, are transferred to a party’s email account. Through the use of smart contracts, blockchains make it possible for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to operate. Bitcoin and Ethereum are just two examples of this kind of organization. A DAO is essentially a company built out of computer code and managed by blockchain. It functions through a series of smart contracts that interact with each other in order to perform certain functions. You could think of a DAO as a car that not only drives itself but also regularly tunes itself up and takes care of itself. Some smart contracts function as the engine and keep it running, while others pay for gas or charge the battery. And though the car represents its own organization, it could also be part of an Uber-like network. However, while things can run smoothly in a DAO, there can come a time when a problem arises and, with it, a question: Who should be held responsible? One thing should be clear by now: blockchains are not a fad. It’s already been proven that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize commerce and finance. But there are some issues that need to be worked out. One of the most important problems is that blockchains can lose data. This isn’t a common or likely problem, but it is something that’s already happened to the Bitcoin blockchain. This happens when two or more of the large groups in the computer network – the ones responsible for storing the information – are unable to agree on the correct state of the blockchain. When this occurs, the network forks, or splits. So you could ask two nodes about your Bitcoin account, and if each node is on a different side of the split network, you could get two different account statements. Obviously, this would be a nightmare for every financial institution using the blockchain. A split can also occur if the connection between the nodes is cut. This would cause the formation of isolated groups within the network. But such a split would be resolved as soon as the connection is reestablished. The network will always accept the group with the highest computing power as the “true” state of the blockchain. This is because the “longest” chain requires the most power and is considered the most up-to-date. Unfortunately, this would mean that all transactions made on the smaller, rejected chain would be lost. Another issue with blockchains is that it’s impossible to be completely anonymous or confidential. Every transaction requires a sender address and a receiver address. These addresses are also called pseudonyms, and are only a long string of letters and numbers – things like “17fHXHDB8.” But the details of every transaction can be seen by everyone. So if someone’s paying close attention, it’s quite possible for the patterns and details of your transactions to reveal your true identity. This lack of confidentiality, especially as it pertains to extremely sensitive data such as medical information, might prevent blockchain becoming widely popular. But there’s also hope that the issue could soon be resolved. Unless you’re really familiar with blockchain or digital currencies, chances are you haven’t heard of Ethereum. But let’s have a look at this recent development in blockchain. Bitcoin may be the first blockchain, but it’s also limited. It’s focused exclusively on money, whereas Ethereum is a general-purpose blockchain, which makes it much more versatile. In addition to cryptocurrencies, Ethereum enables you to build such things as land-title registries and the kind of rating systems used on eBay and Amazon. Ethereum was invented in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, who wanted to avoid the problem that highly specialized blockchains were experiencing when being employed for other uses. So, even at the time of its conception, Ethereum was meant to do many things well, and this is the reason it’s the most advanced blockchain to date. Like other DAOs, Ethereum isn’t owned by anyone. It’s also free and highly accessible, thanks to an intuitive programming language called Solidity. Ethereum does come with its own digital currency – or its own bitcoin, so to speak – called ether. This is the currency you’d use on the Ethereum blockchain to pay for transactions, running calculations or storing data. While Bitcoin may be the king of the cryptocurrency world today, ether, thanks to its more adaptable blockchain, could become the preferred digital-payment method of the future. Now that we’ve taken a broad look at Ethereum, let’s put some of the specifics under the microscope. There are a number of ideas and potential applications of the Ethereum blockchain that make it quite exciting. For example, the Ethereum blockchain could make voting virtually tamperproof. Every voter could use their signature to make an entry in the blockchain that would represent their vote. In this system, no one could change it since the proof-of-work process would forbid it. Plus, the process of vote counting would be completely transparent. Another possibility for Ethereum is in the management of land titles, especially in developing countries where the confusion over land ownership has held back the economy. The Ethereum blockchain would again make this process fully transparent and straightforward. And then there’s banking. It comes as no surprise that most major banking corporations have been funding research of blockchain technology. The financial market, along with trading in stocks and other assets, could benefit greatly from the transparent and programmable nature of blockchains. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Ethereum could also improve escrow payments, social networking, ridesharing, employment services, crowdfunding platforms and much more. However, since Ethereum is open-source software and without warranties, there is concern about how trustworthy it really is. This is an important issue for big corporations, since they’ll never agree to use something that isn’t fully reliable and bug-free. In this respect, Ethereum’s developers have yet to make real efforts to make it ready for corporate use. Finally, there’s the issue of the imposition of government regulations in the future. Blockchains can be used for criminal activities, like money laundering or black market sales, which could result in some governments imposing heavy regulations or even outlawing blockchain technology. But the fact remains that blockchains have the potential to change our world just as profoundly as the internet did. And as it stands now, Ethereum could be the blockchain of the future, since it is by far the most advanced we’ve seen to date. The key message in this book: Blockchains are not a hype. They have real potential to bring about major change and Ethereum is the most advanced blockchain to emerge. This is because it isn’t highly specified, but rather a general-purpose blockchain that can be used in a wide variety of social and commercial spheres. Got feedback?

Whether it’s inflating our benevolent characteristics in a survey about our lifestyle or not telling the full story about the sorts of weird stuff we do when no one is looking, everybody practices a bit of deceit in his day-to-day life. But with the increasingly vast amounts of data that are collected through, for instance, Google searches, we can go beneath the surface and see the truth. With such an impossibly large accumulation of data on countless aspects of human existence, a pool of information collectively known as big data, it is now possible to analyze revealing patterns in our behavior and identify preferences that we never knew about before. In these blinks, you’ll learn about what big data has to offer, from reporting on the state of our health, to revealing strange human quirks, to helping conduct endless randomized, controlled experiments. You’ll also discover what kinky preference some women have that involves apples; how big data reveals the cities in which the American dream lives on; and whether big data should be used to prevent suicide. You’ve heard the term, but what exactly is big data? The clue is in the name. Big data refers to an immense volume of data. A volume that’s so vast, in fact, that the human mind can hardly comprehend it. In other word, big data is data for which computational power is required to recognize patterns. Paradoxically, however, despite its remarkable scale, data science has an intuitive aspect to it. After all, if you think about it, we’re all data scientists in a way. The author points to his grandmother. One Thanksgiving, she started suggesting to the author what his ideal partner should be like – at least as far as she was concerned! The partner needed to be clever, nice, funny, sociable and pretty (though no supermodels needed apply). At 88, his grandma had seen plenty of relationships come and go. She was using years of information and data gathering to articulate the characteristics she saw as essential in successful relationships. She was utilizing information to spot patterns and predict how certain variables would impact one another – just as a data scientist would. However, although data science is an intuitive process, intuition itself isn’t actually science. That’s why utilizing gathered data correctly is essential to refining one’s worldview. Data provides us with the material to confirm or rebut our initial gut feelings. It helps us identify more precise patterns and predictions than personal experience alone ever could. Let’s return to grandma; she was convinced that relationships last longer if partners have mutual friends. This notion was based on her own experience, as she and her husband had spent many an evening with their friends in Queens, New York. But in reality, her sample size was too small and the hard data suggests that she was mistaken. A 2014 study by Lars Backstrom and Jon Kleinberg, based on Facebook data, showed couples with more friends in common were more likely to change their relationship status from “in a relationship” to “single.” This goes to show that though a gut feeling may get us far, data refine even the most intuitive person’s perspective. Data science is a useful tool. But what makes it special is not the amount of collected data, but rather that the data is useful; in other words, it’s the kind of data that can reveal patterns or make predictions. Google is a case in point. Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s search engine, founded in 1998, became such a giant not simply because they were able to collect lots of data. Rather, what set Google apart was that the collected data could be used efficiently. Before Google, when you typed “Bill Clinton” into a search engine, you’d just be given websites that contained the phrase most frequently. Often you’d get a load of irrelevant hits. Brin and Page’s algorithm worked differently. They figured out that a website was likely more relevant to someone if it had more links from other sites that took a user to it. So, Bill Clinton’s official White House website, which was the target of thousands of links, would be more useful than, for example, a site with only a hundred links, even though it might mention him by name more often. They aggregated all that data about links and were able to spot patterns and predict what information was most relevant to the user. In the following blinks, we’ll explain four reasons why big data is so powerful. Google’s approach is a good example of the first reason: big data is entirely novel. It offers us a constant stream of new information. Before the days of big data, you had to wait for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect and calculate the current unemployment rates by way of phone surveys, or wait for a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to learn about infection rates for certain illnesses. But now, you could potentially use Google's big data to track both of these – and that’s exactly what Google engineer Jeremy Ginsberg did. He showed that flu-related Google searches, such as “flu symptoms,” indicate of the spread of influenza, and can be used to track the spread of the disease across geographical areas and over time. Recently, graduates at the University of Maryland were surveyed about their grade point averages, or GPA. Among the respondents, two percent admitted they had graduated with a GPA lower than 2.5 on a four-point scale. However, according to official records, the number was much higher, at 11 percent. While this is just one example, it demonstrates a universal truth about surveying: people lie. But why? Well, it’s natural that we want to look good, both to ourselves and others, so people adapt their answers to make a more positive view of themselves. This behavior of giving answers that make us look better is called social desirability bias. In addition, there’s often a readiness among respondents to want to impress the person administering the survey. We want to make a good impression, whether we're anonymous or not. To take an extreme example, if you were answering questions from someone who looked like your dad, you might be unwilling to detail college drug experiences. It's a human propensity to tell untruths, which makes surveys unreliable when it comes to trying to understand behavior, thoughts, desires and beliefs. This brings us to the second reason why big data is so powerful: it doesn’t lie. Because it's collected through unfiltered online behavior, it will always reveal the truth. After all, people are far less likely to lie or skew results entering terms into search engines when no questioner is involved. Let’s consider the subject of anal play. Would most people admit in a survey or interview that they liked using the occasional piece of fruit in their sexual fantasies? It depends on the survey, but probably not. But when the author analyzed data from the porn site PornHub, he found that some women were searching for “anal apple.” This just goes to show that big data can reveal some surprising things about people that they might not have wanted to share directly with another human being. It’s difficult to get your head around just how big big data is. Each day, staggering amounts of data fly through Google alone, not to mention other search engines or other websites in general. The volume of this data means we can now do things we could never do before. This is the third great power of big data: the size of the datasets means we can zoom in on a subset and reliably extract information from it. Let’s consider a real-world example. Harvard professor Raj Chetty wanted to investigate whether people thought the American dream was still alive. He decided to use big data to help form an answer to a more precise question: can people whose parents are poor grow up to become rich themselves? Chetty’s team used tax records gathered by the US Internal Revenue Service. In total, they had more than one billion tax observations. The data was revealing. It showed that when compared with other developed countries like Denmark and Canada, the situation in the United States wasn’t great for poor people. A poor American stood a 7.5-percent chance of achieving success in her chosen field. But for Danes and Canadians, the chances were 11.7 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively. That was the big picture, but the beauty of big data is that Chetty could zoom in on different states, cities, towns and neighborhoods. When he did so, he found the data revealed that the American dream did exist – but only in a few places. In San Jose, California, a poor American stood a 12.9 percent chance of getting rich, which is better than in Denmark. But for an American growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina, the chances were only 4.4 percent. It’s this ability to zoom in that demonstrates how big data can give us a nuanced understanding of the world, wherever and at whatever scale we choose. Every day, we’re bombarded with stories about correlations. A food is linked with a disease. A habit is linked with success. These correlations seem credible at first, but correlation doesn’t necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship. In reality, to learn about the causal effect of something, you’d need to establish causality by using randomized, controlled experiments, commonly called A/B tests. For instance, a study might report that people who drink alcohol only moderately are usually healthier. But does that imply that drinking moderately causes our health to improve? Of course not. In order to test whether drinking moderately improves health, you’d need to have a pool of randomly selected individuals split into two groups. One group would drink, say, a glass of red wine each day, while the other group wouldn't drink at all. After a year, the two groups would be compared. If the first group were healthier than group two, that would imply that drinking moderately was a cause of improved health. Big data makes it a lot easier to conduct A/B tests, and this is the fourth reason why big data is so powerful. Before big data came along, running A/B tests was highly demanding. For instance, to test a commercial’s impact, you’d have to recruit participants, survey them and analyze the results. But now, Data scientists can write a program that analyzes data from A/B tests. Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign famously employed this approach. Obama campaign directors wanted to design a website that would entice people to sign up and donate. They used different combinations of pictures and text, and were then able to analyze the relevant data to deduce which layout was most successful. By now, we’ve established a number of positive aspects of big data. Next, let's turn to the negatives. Although there are definite advantages to big data, it isn’t flawless. Its biggest limitation becomes patently clear in datasets with many variables: it’s difficult to extract reliable answers because the number of variables obscures possible findings. Let’s consider the work of the behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin. In 1998, he thought he had found a gene, IGF2r, that was indicative of people’s IQ. He had obtained a dataset compiled from several hundred students containing information about DNA and IQ levels. Plomin compared their DNA with low and high IQs, and found that IGF2r was two times as likely to occur in students with high IQs. Unfortunately, the correlation was a fluke. When Plomin repeated the dataset comparison a few years later, the correlation between IQ and the occurrence of the IGF2r was nowhere to be seen. It’s easy to see why. The human genome consists of thousands of genes; if correlations do occur, it’s always possible that they just happen through chance. There are so many variables that patterns can occur randomly. There’s another problem with big data. It often lacks so-called small data, the kind of data that is about the human experience. Big data can measure a lot, but sometimes measurable answers aren’t necessarily what we’re after. For instance, Facebook can easily measure clicks and likes using big data. But doing so would tell the company nothing about people’s experience with the site. In circumstances like these, small data is essential. Facebook gathers this sort of data through other methods, namely by using smaller-scale surveys to ask users about their opinions and experiences on the site. Facebook also employs psychologists and sociologists to help the company get a sense of nonmeasurable user experiences. This goes to show that big data isn’t perfect – and the problems go deeper still. Every time you type in a Google search or shop for a product online, you’re contributing to big data – what about the ethical considerations? What if the government had access to this data? What could they do with it? Say someone typed “I want to kill myself” into a search engine. Should the local police be notified? In cases like these, authorities simply don’t and can’t act on an individual level – and with good reason. Every month, there are 3.5 million suicide-related Google searches in the United States. By contrast, the number of suicides in the country is lower than 4,000 a month. This would imply a huge waste of police resources if they decided to locate the individual in question every time a suicidal thought was typed into a computer. But there’s also an ethical dimension we shouldn’t forget. Should governments even be allowed to possess and use search data pertaining to individuals? After all, this would amount to an invasion of privacy. These ethical considerations haven’t stopped governments from using big data on a regional level, particularly because more and more evidence points to a correlation between online searches and subsequent action. For example, researchers Christine Ma-Kellams, Flora Or, Ji Hyun Baek and Ichiro Kawachi found in a 2016 study that suicide-related Google searches are significantly correlated with actual suicide rates. But that correlation was only valid at the state level. So how could state authorities and police departments use such data? Well, they could use it in suicide prevention programs in specific, local areas, such as at state or municipal levels. They could disseminate information in radio and TV commercials, with tips on where to go or whom to call if people needed help. It goes to show that, as well as revealing all sorts of interesting things about humans, big data can also be used productively in real-life situations as well. The key message in this book: People rarely fill out surveys honestly, which skews our understanding of the world. But with the rise of big data – that is, the collection of incredibly large amounts of data from, for example, Google searches – we are able to spot patterns in human behavior and identify preferences that we never knew about before.  Actionable advice: Don’t fret if you have kinky sexual fantasies.  You’re not alone! Although you probably won’t get everyone to admit to their fetishes, this may be just because some individuals worry they’ll be socially excluded. So, if you dare, speak up about your true preferences! You’re likely to get some weird looks, but as big data reveals, there’s almost certainly someone out there like you. Instead of hiding it, you can make all the kinky and strange stuff you normally type into Google a topic of conversation. Maybe then you can start normalizing some of the unspoken aspects of human behavior. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maybe you know someone who uses a 3D printer to manufacture cute little action figures – or something equally inconsequential – in his living room. Sure, 3D printing is neat, but it doesn’t seem very revolutionary. Well, what we’re seeing today is actually just the tip of iceberg. Over the next few decades, 3D printing is going to change many areas of our lives – from the working world to cooking to the ways we treat serious illnesses. These blinks will tell you more about the latent power of this emergent technology. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you soon won’t have to be rich to become a producer; about designer legs; and whether 3D printing is going to save the environment. Even if you’re not very computer literate, you probably know how to use an everyday inkjet printer. You click “print” and the machine spits out a piece of paper with some words or maybe a photograph printed on it. A 3D printer is a whole other story. Rather than imprinting a two-dimensional piece of paper with ink, a 3D printer is designed to build objects, varying in size and shape, out of a wide array of materials. Like a standard printer, a 3D printer can’t do anything without a computer to tell it what to print. The computer is needed to send the 3D printer information from a design file, which is basically an electronic blueprint for what you want to build. So if you want to print a copy of your favorite seventeenth-century brass vase, for instance, you have to first get the right design file. With that, the computer can tell the printer to fabricate a replica that is an exact match in each and every way. The printer does this by painstakingly building a three-dimensional object, one layer at a time. For your brass vase, it would start with the bottom, creating a thin, flat layer of brass that represents the base. Once that solidifies, another layer is added to the top of the first one. And this process continues – a new layer being added after the solidification of the last one – until the entire vase is finished. By changing the dimensions of each layer, an object of any shape can be created. Using this process, anyone can fabricate any object, as long as the details are contained in the design file. In the blinks that follow, we’ll explore the major impact 3D printing will have on our lives, the economy and the environment. But first, we’ll take a closer look at the software that makes it all possible. Did you know that most of the furniture in your home was probably designed digitally with the help of sophisticated computer software? In all likelihood, that lamp on your desk, or even the desk itself, was once a concept that only existed as ones and zeros in a computer file. What’s great about design software is that it offers designers and engineers the opportunity to shape and model their designs in a three-dimensional environment. This is extremely useful since it offers a world filled with geometric possibilities that two-dimensional blueprints simply lack. Take a look around. Everything you see – the entire world – is made up of countless interacting shapes. Obviously, it’s hard to accurately represent the three-dimensionality of all these shapes on a flat piece of paper. But with the help of 3D design software, you can create a perfect model of whatever object you wish to create – be it a house, a car, a coffee mug or even a flower. The software creates these accurate reproductions by using an XYZ coordinate system and programing that involves highly complicated mathematical equations. This allows you to move your object around, observe it from any conceivable angle and design the tiniest details. If you want to turn your object upside down or look at it from directly above, you can; the XYZ coordinates will readjust to whatever angle you desire. You can also adjust the proportions of your object. Widening your vase’s aperture, for instance, is just a matter of stretching it out on the screen. Making it smaller is just as easy. All of this can be done with ease; it’s not necessary to redesign the entire thing. Thus, 3D design software provides an invaluable service. It gives you a safe environment to experiment and realize your vision. In the next blink, we’ll see how 3D printing differs from traditional production methods. You might be asking yourself: What advantages does 3D printing really provide? After all, traditional production methods have worked so far, right? Sure, today’s methods of mass production enable the efficient production of specific products. But we run into problems when the product needs to be changed. When a production line is set up, every piece of machinery and each worker is assigned a very specific task so that work can be done precisely and at a low cost. This works well if you want to churn out millions of copies of the same product. On the other hand, it also makes it difficult to change even one design detail. Say you make toothbrushes. One day, inspiration strikes, and you have a genius idea for a new and improved model. Well, unfortunately for you and your company, this would mean major changes: production couldn’t get rolling until personnel were retrained and assigned new tasks. As you can imagine, the more complicated the new product, the trickier the reorganization process. Okay, but let’s say you’re an artisan of some kind. Artisanal production is the polar opposite of mass production. Products are usually hand crafted and one-of-a-kind – things that can’t be made on an assembly line. Artisanal products take more time and money to produce but they also give the producer more freedom. It’s easy enough to alter a design or add custom touches. If a customer wants to order a personalized vase, for instance, there’s no problem. The sculptor could even add a unique inscription. The downside is that artisanal businesses can only produce so many products. But there are compensatory perks: less overhead, for example, and the fact that customers are usually willing to pay more money for a unique product. But wouldn’t it be nice to find the middle ground between artisanal and mass production? Well, that’s where 3D printing comes in. Like mass production, 3D printing allows you to make an endless number of precise reproductions. Though the printing process can’t be broken down into simple steps that would increase output and lower the price per unit, it does allow for freedom of design changes. At any time, product design can be easily altered without fear of business repercussions. Over a century ago, the assembly line disrupted the manufacturing status quo. It forever transformed the job market and the way companies do business. And this is exactly the kind of disruptive potential 3D printing has. First of all, traditional production systems could be revolutionized by cloud manufacturing. Nowadays, the majority of manufacturing is done by a few giant factories. But cloud manufacturing works by decentralizing production and spreading it over a network of small contributors. If you have a product, you can simply add your design file to the cloud and the system will match it with the appropriate manufacturer and make sure that they receive your order and deliver it to your address. With this method, you can have a wide array of options. You can get a big order printed, a single part or anything in between. Maybe you spent the past few months designing your own bike and want to test it out. Using cloud manufacturing, you could get the parts of your bike delivered the next day and assemble them yourself to give it a test ride. This business model shifts the focus away from big factories, expensive machinery and the engineers needed to operate them. It allows small-scale manufacturing companies to enter the marketplace, which will inevitably change the way the business world operates. We’ll no longer have to rely on mass production; cloud manufacturing gives anyone with a design file the chance to start a business. This business model will also lead to more innovation since it greatly reduces risk and cost. Since today’s big manufacturing companies use enormous, complex and expensive equipment and technology, any attempt at innovation requires a huge investment. Such an investment represents a considerable risk since any failed attempt can leave a company with severe losses. 3D printing removes the costs and risks of experimentation. If you want to print a test run of a new product, just prepare the design file, click “print” and see what happens. Perhaps the most exciting thing about 3D printing is the limitless possibilities. In addition to making it easy to print standard material goods, the technology also has the potential to save lives. People are already climbing what’s known as 3D printing’s “ladder of life.” The ladder of life is a model that represents complexity, with each rung signifying how difficult it is to print a certain thing. The lower rungs are occupied by things that are relatively easy to print – inanimate objects such as hearing aids or artificial joints. Halfway up the ladder, things get more complicated: living tissues, bones, skin and veins. After that come organs like the liver, kidney and heart. At the top of the ladder are living creatures. We’re a long way from the top of the ladder of life, but we’re getting pretty good at printing things from the lower rungs, such as replacement bones that are designed to fit perfectly into a person’s body. There’s even a start-up in California called Bespoke Innovations that prints custom-made prosthetic legs that not only fit an individual’s body but are designed to complement that person’s lifestyle and personality. In the future, we’ll probably start 3D printing food. Sometimes, after a long day’s work, the last thing you want to do is prepare a meal. Well, imagine sending an email from work that tells your 3D printer to have lasagne and tiramisu ready for you when you get home. That idea isn’t so far-fetched: 3D food printers are already being tested in laboratories. One design team by the name of Zigelbaum & Coelho has created Cornucopia, a project consisting of four different 3D food printers, each devoted to a different type of “cooking.” One of them even prints out chocolate. In our final blink, we’ll take a look at some of the concerns raised by 3D printing. 3D printing has given rise to a slew of concerns. Foremost among them is its carbon footprint. Today, most manufacturing companies still use petroleum-based fuels to manufacture and transport their products and, as a result, harm the environment with their large carbon footprint. These companies also produce enormous amounts of non-recyclable waste that pollutes the earth and the ocean. Unfortunately, 3D printing doesn’t solve environmental problems related to regular ways of manufacturing. In fact, when compared with current mass-production standards, its carbon footprint and waste production can be worse. Of all wasteful materials, plastic is among the worst. It’s everywhere and just about everything comes packaged in it. And plastic, though versatile and cheap, isn’t environmentally friendly. This remains a major issue for 3D printing. According to researchers at the University of Nottingham, 3D printers are voracious consumers of energy. For example, if you tell an average 3D printer and a traditional production machine to make an object of equal weight, the 3D printer will consume up to 10 times more electricity than its more traditional counterpart. And since many industrial-sized 3D printers use thermoset plastic, a material that can’t be recycled after it is heated, they actually create more waste. It’s not all bad news, however. The researchers at the University of Nottingham did spot some benefits too. After traditional manufacturers heat up their plastic and press it into molds, they use “release agents” to pry the plastic out. These substances are generally toxic chemicals that add to the harmful waste that gets produced. 3D printing avoids the need for release agents since the plastic never reaches the same degree of heat in the process. Another good example of an environmental advantage to 3D printing is metal. Traditional metal manufacturing results in literally tons of wasteful byproduct. When making airplane parts, for instance, manufacturers will process 15 kilograms of metal to make a part that weighs just one kilogram. In contrast, nearly 100 percent of the leftover metal powder that 3D printers use can be recycled. Clearly, 3D printing can’t solve all the world’s problems, but it’s still early days and there are benefits and exciting possibilities that make the technology a fascinating tool that will continue to be explored. The key message in this book: The age of 3D printing is upon us, and it has the potential to change our lives. Even though the technology is still in its infancy and comes with disadvantages in certain areas compared to mass production, it will certainly provide great opportunities and innovative remedies in the future.

Cheap production in China, Taiwan and Indonesia, combined with government support, has driven down the prices of manufactured goods in America. Furniture manufacturing took a particularly hard hit. American factories closed. Mass swaths of employees were laid off. Entire towns were decimated. These blinks are the story of offshoring’s attack on American furniture manufacturing, through the lens of a Virginian family business, that fought back. It’s about how an industry came together to fight the low prices of Chinese furniture, and learned that their brand was more than just a sticker on the bottom of a kitchen table. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to fight offshoring; why making prices as low as possible isn’t a good strategy; and how China’s government helps its companies get the upper hand. On the tail end of the industrial revolution, the early 1900s were marked by innovation in technology and manufacturing. Computers, automation and global networks were yet to come, and people willing to break a sweat were the driving force of new potential. It was the ideal climate for traditional American industry, such as furniture-making. As people relocated from rural areas to towns and cities, to be closer to the new factories and industry in which they worked, demand for mass-produced furniture boomed. The expansion of the railroad networks made it possible to transport these large pieces of furniture easily, such that a furniture manufacturer could service customers across the United States. John David Basset Sr., who began making bedroom furniture in Virginia in 1902, profited greatly from the era’s economic climate. Seeing the potential of using his family’s land and forests to build furniture, he procured a loan from his uncle and began producing bedroom furniture, shipping it as far as Canada. At the time, furniture-makers profited from cheap labor, which kept the production costs at bay. Although factory jobs offered low, often unfair wages, they were preferable to the alternative jobs of the time – working outdoors in fields or mines. The first workers in Basset’s factory worked for only five cents per hour! African-American workers were a cheap source of labor, having been freed from slavery only half a century prior and still subject to discrimination, alienation and unequal treatment. Until 1933, the Basset Factory was one of the few that hired black workers, albeit at a fraction of the hourly wage given to their white counterparts. In any case, employing cheap labor allowed the Basset family to produce at a lower cost than its competitors. During the first half of the twentieth century, the Bassets and other American furniture-makers competed almost exclusively within the American market. However, the cost of manufacturing in America increased, partially due to regulations around factory conditions and labor laws; and simultaneously, less-regulated, cheap manufacturing emerged abroad. In the late 1970s American companies started offshoring to Asia, taking advantage of cheap labor abroad. The first foreign-owned factory in China was a purse manufacturer, which opened its doors in 1978. At the time, no one thought that offshoring was feasible for products as large and unwieldy as furniture. But within only one year it proved possible: small pieces of Asian furniture, such as cocktail tables, entered the American market. In the late 1970s, a furniture worker in America earned $5.25/hour, whereas his Taiwanese counterpart earned only $1.40/hour. Furniture workers in China earned even less: 35 cents/hour. One by one, American furniture manufacturers started the process of offshoring, buying certain parts or even finished products from Asian companies and then selling them under their own trademark in the US.   Eventually, Asian factories began producing the furniture completely independently and selling it in America. Soon, Asian furniture factories were providing more than just cheap labor. They were now in direct competition with American factories. Larry Moh was the first to build a furniture factory in Hong Kong with the intent to export that furniture to the American market. He practically copied models of American companies like Basset, selling them for 20 to 30 percent less, even after considering the transportation costs. In less than a decade, his company Universal Furniture became the fourth largest furniture-maker in the world! Things only got worse for American manufacturers when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. In fact, from late 2000 to 2002, Chinese furniture exports jumped by 121 percent! When Asian companies started selling their products in America, Americans could have used their purchasing power to support America. But they didn’t. Consumers soon welcomed the Asian furniture because of the lower prices, and shifted their attitudes to be ok with buying from overseas. Of course, shipping from Asia to America proved difficult at first. Customer service, for example, was under-developed: how could you have defective furniture repaired from across the ocean? But American customers soon became hooked on the lower prices. Why pay $1,000 for a bookshelf when you can pay $500? In addition, the disposability of lower-cost furniture entered the consumer mentality. Even if the Asian products weren’t as high quality or durable as the American-made ones, consumers didn’t care. After all, no one expected to leave their bed frame to their grandchildren. These attitudes took a considerable toll on the American furniture manufacturing market. In fact, by 1998 one third of all wooden furniture sold in the US was imported. American companies, too, began embracing Asian products. Retail chains profited greatly from Asian products, as their cheap prices outweighed their shipping costs. Asian factories were likewise eager to export their wares, so they offered competitive prices. Even American furniture-makers had an interest in shifting production from the United States to Asia. After all, offshoring gave them deep discounts in labor costs and netted them enormous profits, thus allowing them to compete with their Asian counterparts. Asia offered a way for American companies to produce more cheaply, and pass these benefits on to the consumer in the form of low costs. So what’s the problem? As you’ll see in our following blinks, offshoring and importing actually hurts everyone. The problem American companies faced when competing with Asian imports wasn’t simply that they had to compete with cheaper producers. Rather, the nature of competition was simply unfair. Cheap imports can create a cycle of price competition that eventually drives businesses into the ground. Domestic companies are essentially forced to import in order to match the prices from foreign competition. As a result, many companies simply can’t compete and are driven out of business. Take Kincaid Furniture, for example. In the early eighties, Kincaid had 12 factories and employed over 4,000 workers. However, it soon ended up on the wrong side of a price war, and was forced to start importing. Their best-seller, a dining room chair selling at $220, was copied by Universal Furniture and sold for a faction of the price: only $39. Even after Kincaid started importing, they simply couldn’t compete with Universal, and in 1989 they were finally bought out. Further complicating the issue is that Chinese factories are sponsored by their government – an advantage that American companies aren’t typically afforded. Asian manufacturers are clearly advantaged in terms of labor, but they still have to pay for materials and transportation. That’s where the government comes in: In China, for instance, export policy centers around improving the standard of living for locals. To do that, local companies have to enter the American market, meaning that their prices had to be very low to compete. Keeping prices so low meant possibly losing money, so the government created subsidies to keep these export businesses profitable. How can American companies possibly compete in this scenario? Even if they move their production offshore, they still need to break even, and without government support, that means selling at a higher price than Chinese companies. American manufacturers have it bad when it comes to competition with foreign imports. But the real loser is actually the American factory worker. As American companies offshore more and more aspects of production, large numbers of American factory workers are finding themselves without work. For this reason, it’s important that conversations about foreign trade don’t focus on management and board of directors, at the expense of the people who are actually working at the factories. One after another, American furniture producers have been driven to close their local plants, leaving thousands of factory workers without jobs. Since China’s admittance into the World Trade Organization in 2001, 63,300 American factories closed their doors, leaving five million American factory workers without a paycheck. Adding to this misery, most of these displaced workers are unable to find jobs after a factory closure. Some argue that getting laid off is simply a risk that everyone faces in the job market. You simply have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and find another job. The reality is different for factory workers, who find themselves out of other options. If you’re an accountant, for example, and you get laid off, you can find another accounting job somewhere else. But if you get laid off as a factory worker, where do you go when all the factories are closed? While work training programs exist to help people change industries, most former factory workers don’t take advantage of them. Having worked a factory job their whole lives, many aging workers lack the skills or self-confidence to find work in another field, or are simply too busy trying to scrape some money together through part time jobs. Despite these depressing facts, there’s still good news: falling victim to a globalized economy isn’t a matter of fate. Our final blinks reveal how American factories can get back on their feet. Something feels awfully immoral about the prospect of factory closures and widespread unemployment, due to unfair competition. But it’s not just immoral; it’s illegal! According to the standards adopted by members of the World Trade Organization, it is illegal to dump; that is, it is illegal for a country’s government to actively try to run companies in another country out of business by setting prices that are lower than the actual production costs, or lower than the ones set by its own local market. If a country can prove that dumping has forced domestic companies to close factories or has led to higher rates of unemployment, then that instance of dumping is considered illegal by WTO standards. In essence, local factories have the right to protection from artificially-priced Asian imports. If American businesses can prove an instance of illegal dumping, then they can even have grounds to seek government aid. The protections offered by the WTO work in concert with laws such as the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act of 2000, which levies compensation fees, or duties, onto the worst dumping offenders. The fees gathered then flow right back to the American businesses that were affected. So, for example, if the three biggest factories in China hurt 20 American factories by dumping, these 20 factories can receive the new duties imposed on the three Chinese factories, and thus repair the harm done to their businesses. All in all, the law is on the side of American businesses when it comes to competing with cheap foreign imports. Knowing that the law is on their side, why don’t American companies take their legal claims to the courtrooms? Well, American companies certainly can work against dumping by taking legal action, but it’s not easy. To initiate a Commerce Department investigation on dumping, companies need to gather petitions from 51 percent of the industry, and must also dig deep in their pockets for research and legal costs. These costs are especially difficult to surmount when competing companies are already so concerned with cutting prices and lowering costs. But that doesn’t mean it’s not possible! A prime example of this is John D. Basset III, the grandson of the original Basset founder, who fought tirelessly to initiate an investigation against the People’s Republic of China. Many of his colleagues mocked his efforts, and former business partners cancelled deals out of anger that he was trying to stop the low-cost parade. But John persisted. He spent hours on the phone, at meetings and in conferences, giving interviews and speeches and trying to mobilize people to be as passionate about keeping American jobs as he was. It took him about a year, but eventually, in October 2003, he managed to get 57 percent of the remaining American furniture producers to file a petition against the People’s Republic. As a result, the Department of Commerce started an investigation and determined that Chinese factories were indeed dumping, and thus granted John and his co-petitioners the right to collect on the duties imposed on the biggest dumpers. With enough determination, American companies can compete foreign companies no matter how low their prices. Instead of moving offshore the minute things get tough, companies can think of more imaginative ways to fight cheap imports. In John’s case, he was able to use the duties he received to modernize his plants, and found ways to increase efficiency and thus regain a competitive edge.    What motivated John D. Basset III to fight so hard against dumpers? Wouldn’t he have been better off closing the local factories, moving production offshore and counting his earnings on a beach somewhere? A business doesn’t just make money; it delivers value. As the leader of a company, you have to ask yourself what your company does: does it generate profit or does it do something more? Since the 1980s, the majority of the furniture manufacturers have moved production offshore, closing almost every factory on American soil. They’ve gone from importing certain parts of their wares to moving the entire production process to Asia, stamping it with their brand name and shipping it to the US. At that point, whose product is it really? Can an American brand be considered American based on the brand name alone? Even if it was produced on the other side of the world by foreign workers using foreign materials? Probably not. Companies have a duty, both to their workers and to the community. Furniture-making companies have traditions, and in many cases, these factories have employed generations of factory workers, all relying on the company to provide for them. Consider the Bassets, whose business started in 1902. Although family quabbles caused John D. Basset III to distance himself from the original family company and take the reins of his uncle Vaughan-Basset’s company, he continued to feel responsible to his workers and fought hard for the company’s best interests. By his hard work and determination, he saved 700 jobs in Galax, Virginia alone. The key message in this book: The uncontrolled import of furniture from Asia has led thousands of American factories to close, and has left millions of Americans without a paycheck. But it doesn’t have to be this way: companies can take a stand for their workers and communities, and combat the negative effects of globalization.

Is this all due to climate, natural resources, and the different mentalities of the people in those nations? Or can it all be chalked up to choices made by their respective governments? Why is it that the United States and Argentina followed extremely different trajectories even though they started out with similar economic conditions? These blinks will explore all these questions as you learn about the economic histories of several globally important nations. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: about parasitic cities; why there’s so much asparagus in Peru; and how oil can make a society extremely volatile. Have you ever wondered why a country like the United States is a giant in the world economy, while a country like Argentina has continually struggled? As we’ll see, this was not something that happened by chance. As a matter of fact, Argentina and the United States started out in very similar situations. The United States officially became an independent nation when its constitution came into effect in 1789. Argentina was particularly inspired by the American revolution, and in 1816 Argentinian rebels took control of their government to establish their own independence. And as these two countries started out, both nations had similar economic outlooks based on rich agricultural promise and plenty of fertile land. But the two paths diverged when the countries made different choices on how to develop their land. America chose to divide their land up between skilled individuals and families. Capable farmers from Europe arrived to make the most of the opportunity, and they helped expand and settle America’s western frontier. Conversely, Argentina decided to divide its land among a select few rich and powerful landlords. As a result, its agricultural potential was stunted because the policy failed to attract skilled laborers and farmers to develop the land. The two nation’s paths continued to diverge following twentieth-century industrialization. While the United States embraced the manufacturing industries and the foreign trade possibilities they presented, Argentina shut itself off in an effort to become self-sufficient. Argentina rejected the interests of foreign investors and the risky business of globalization, preferring instead to protect its government monopolies. So, as the US economy flourished in the twentieth century, Argentina continued to seal off its manufacturing businesses by keeping out imports and heavily taxing exports. In 2001, in its efforts to be self-reliant, Argentina was forced into one of the largest government bankruptcies in history. You may have noticed that major cities can serve as a good representation of a nation’s economic success or failure. That’s because the tricky business of development and urbanization can play a big role in a country’s economic prosperity. For instance, nations with unstable governments will often have a bloated capital cities that reflect their problems. During the time of the Roman Empire, Rome was a city that represented both abundant growth and the instability of the government. As well as being the center of commerce and industry, it was also filled with citizens demanding food, jobs and welfare. To support the outsized city, the surrounding areas were heavily taxed and made unsafe by constant warfare. Today, overpopulated cities like Buenos Aires and Mexico City are similar in the way they reflect the lack of opportunity elsewhere in their countries. In fact, 35 percent of the entire nation of Argentina resides in Buenos Aires. This statistic shows how the country’s failed agricultural programs have provided citizens with few options for prosperity other than by finding work in the city. The same situation is visible in many of Africa’s cities, as well. When a country rushes towards urbanization, it can often happen at the expense of the rest of the nation. The development of Zambia’s capital city of Lusaka was paid for by taxing the countryside. As a result, farmers were driven out of business, and forced to move to the city and live in slums known as shantytowns. A successful city, by contrast, is one that contributes to a diversified national economy in more than one way. Cities like Madrid and Chicago have thrived and remained healthy because their success is not dependent on one kind of business or technology. This is in stark contrast to a city like Detroit which relied too heavily on the automotive industry and ended up in economic despair when the industry dried up. Have you ever been grocery shopping in the United States and wondered why the asparagus comes all the way from Peru? It actually goes back to the 1980s when the two countries made a trade agreement. As a result, the United States gets tens of millions of dollars worth of asparagus every year and Peruvian farmers have an incentive that keeps them from making cocaine. Decisions like these can play a big part in determining a country’s economic stability. Take Egypt, for example. Centuries ago, the country grew its own wheat. But doing so today would take up a sixth of Egypt’s water supply, making it an economically unwise decision. Instead, the country, with a population of around 80 million, is the world’s second biggest importer of wheat. On the other hand, crops like herbs and vegetables take far less water to grow. So Middle Eastern countries like Egypt find stability by growing these for export while importing water-depleting foods like grains and meats. For some countries, instability can prevent them from having a lucrative export business. Many African nations could be reaping the benefits of the booming coffee industry. But civil wars and dangerous military regimes have closed off shipping routes, making it increasingly difficult to get goods out of the countries. Just to get across the border from Uganda to the shipping ports of Kenya can take 24 hours. Therefore, the price of keeping things refrigerated and getting safely through dangerous border crossings can be too costly for many businesses to earn a profit. You probably wouldn’t think that finding oil or a diamond mine in your backyard would be a bad thing. But for many countries, this kind of discovery has brought more economic chaos than prosperity. Oil can bring economic stability, but only if you know how to manage it properly. The oil-rich nation of Saudi Arabia might appear successful with a per capita income of $15,000. But it hasn’t been using that money to generate jobs. A closer look reveals an unemployment rate of 25 percent, a figure that is affecting many of the country’s young men. And since half of Saudi Arabia’s male population is under the age of 22, the country is dealing with a large group of frustrated people. So it isn’t surprising that the nation’s society has become uneasy and volatile. Let’s compare to Norway: the country has managed its oil resources well, putting any excess revenue into a national oil stabilization fund. The nation of Chile also uses a similar system for money earned from its copper resources. Stabilization funds like these allow for responsible spending and ensure that one natural resource isn’t relied upon as the only source of revenue. African nations also reveal how a natural resource such as diamonds or copper can result in prosperity or unending turmoil. The African nation of Sierra Leone is one of the world’s top diamond-producing nations. But the abundance of their natural resource led to illicit trading that helped prolong a civil war for eleven years. In an effort to get rich quick, the African nation of Zambia pushed out foreign investors interested in their copper mines. But their inexperience and mismanagement of the resource has led to a highly unstable government. The diamond-rich African nation of Botswana made a better decision by partnering with the foreign company De Beers. They established a long-term revenue sharing agreement, with De Beers handling the difficult task of managing the diamond mine. This allowed Botswana to create a national fund and achieve economic stability through a stable source of revenue. How big a role does religion play in determining a nation’s economic success? It’s a question that has been written about since 1905, when German sociologist Max Weber suggested that Protestants were more successful in business than Catholics. But history has gone on to prove Weber wrong. Weber’s theories were based on the 19th-century successes of predominantly Protestant countries like England and the Netherlands. But, since then, the advancements of predominantly Catholic nations such as Italy, Spain and Ireland have shown these ideas to be flimsy. Similar theories about the economic effect of religion on Asian and Middle Eastern countries have also been disproven. In the 1980s, it was fashionable to look at the cultural traditions of Hong Kong and Taiwan as having an influence on their economic boom at the time. It was thought that their values, which emphasized social solidarity over individualism, were better suited to capitalism. Yet, the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s proved that these countries were just as vulnerable to collapse as any other. There have also been theories suggesting that Islamic countries like Afghanistan struggle with economic success more than others. While it is possible that some Islamic societies are resistant to change and reform, the poor choices that these governments make are largely unrelated to religion. For example, the governments of largely Islamic countries like Malaysia and Indonesia made markedly wise economic decisions. It is too simplistic to look at religion as being the deciding factor in a country’s economic success or misfortune. Ultimately, it comes down to the important choices that government leaders make. Political corruption can’t benefit an economy, can it? Well, just because a nation’s leader is honest, it doesn’t mean he’ll make the right choices that will lead to a prosperous economy. Take Indonesia, which thrived under a corrupt president, and Tanzania, which crumbled under an honest one. In 1968, Indonesia had a fractured government and a struggling economy. That year, President Suharto seized control in a terrifying takeover, killing thousands who opposed him while rebuilding the government with his own appointed personnel. But, as brutal as he was, his conservative political policies proved to be economically wise. He opened up the Indonesia’s borders to international trading and shipping, attracted foreign investment, reduced poverty and quickly balanced the budget of the country. As for Tanzania, from 1964 to 1985, the nation’s president was Julius Nyerere: a former teacher who was honest and quite unlike many other corrupt African rulers. Unfortunately, his poor decisions as president led to economic stagnation. Nyerere tried to create a self-sustaining Tanzania and built policies that closed the country off to trade and investors. He also socialized the nation’s farmers which resulted in widespread extortion and bribery over the distribution of goods and services. This resulted in a nationwide disaster and Nyerere was eventually forced to give up on his ideas of collectivization. This shows that even political corruption doesn’t automatically determine a nation’s economic prosperity. It comes down to the choices and policies the governments make. In the animal kingdom, natural evolution can lead to a dead end like the giant panda: a species that can barely survive or reproduce and has no hopes of changing. Fortunately, in world economics, it’s never too late to change. Let’s take a look at why, of two countries with similar backgrounds, one managed to change and the other didn’t. Russia is a good example of a country that tried, but ultimately failed, to change. In the 1990s, after centuries of Tsarism and Communism, Russia attempted to transition into a free-market economy. But the nation quickly learned that it was ill prepared for this abrupt economic shift and ended up defaulting on its economic debt in 1998. Russia then experienced a backlash against the free market and its unpredictability. As a result, Vladimir Putin restored the nation to a Tsarist-like state: he drove out foreign companies and placed the nation’s energy industry back under governmental control. Though much of the economy hinges on its oil and gas reserves, the centralization of power has restored a sense of stability to the Russian citizens. Though it has come at a price, with the loss of free media and fair elections. To see how a country can actually make fundamental changes, we can look at China. China took a different approach to entering the free-market economy. Despite China’s history of being suspicious of foreign investors and businesses, the financial success of Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s proved that a diversified and open marketplace can lead to success. So, when Hong Kong reverted back to Chinese control in 1997, the nation was able to follow the economic path of similar governments, including Taiwan and Singapore. Unlike Russia, China didn’t seal itself off from opportunities: it recognized the advantages a diversified economy has for creating potential revenue. As with the other countries we’ve looked at, it’s clear that the economic outcomes of Russia and China were not written in stone. They are, in fact, the result of important choices the nations have made. The key message in this book: The current world economic landscape is the result of ongoing globalization. Some countries have put policies in place to take advantage of this and found economic success, while others have closed themselves off and found economic hardship.

Rajan","summary":"Even though years have past, many of us are still feeling the effects of the financial crisis that rocked the world in 2008. There are still unanswered questions about the crash, and prominent among them is how exactly the crisis happened in the first place. While it’s easy to point fingers at bankers or mortgage lenders, the “blame” for the crisis goes deeper still. Try to think of the crisis as an earthquake: what makes the earth tremble and buildings fall has little to do with individuals, but something bigger, something deep beneath the earth’s surface. As these blinks explain, fault lines – deep, systemic flaws, not unlike the rifts that cause the earth to tremble – were rife within not only the U.S. economy but also the world economy. At the peak of the crisis, these fault lines gave way; yet they had been lurking underneath the surface for some time. You’ll learn what exactly caused these fault lines to appear and become more dangerous as time went on, through the lens of U.S. unemployment, global economic decisions and much more. In the following blinks, you’ll discover how German and Japanese auto manufacturing contributed to the crisis; how to tweak bonuses so bankers are encouraged to tone down risky behavior; and why the world was blind to the financial crisis growing right before its eyes. One of the most significant fault lines that led to the global financial crisis was growing income inequality in the United States. In the years leading up to the crisis, the wage gap grew. While the average income of top earners increased, the average median income stayed nearly the same. For example, in 1997, the median household income was $51,704, yet by 2009, it had barely budged to $52,196. Why the growing gap? Basically, the country’s workforce couldn’t meet the labor demands of the market. America needed more and more highly educated people to work in the growing technological sector, but schools weren’t producing enough qualified candidates. This drove the top income level up while the median stagnated. It also explains why the income gap was strongly related to education level: In 2008, the median income of a high school graduate was $28 per hour, while the median for a college undergraduate was $48, some 72 percent more. Every worker is a potential voter, of course; so U.S. politicians sought to do something about the problem. Seeing that their electorate needed more money, they encouraged cheap loans. With the support of politicians, banks began expanding easy credit, especially to low-income households. This so-called subprime lending, which we'll look at more closely later became popular, while interest rates were lowered. The immediate positive effects were straightforward: more spending meant more growth. Yet the growth was fueled by debt. People were essentially just postponing paying their bills. And as you'll see in the following blinks, this American spending spree didn’t just affect the United States but also the rest of the world. You’re probably well aware that your cell phone was made in China, your car in Japan and your shirt in India. Yet did you know that global manufacturing was another fault line in the 2008 financial crisis? In the years before 2008, there existed a huge imbalance in the number of import and export nations, meaning countries that produce more or less than they consume, exporting or importing the difference. The problem at the time was that there were too many exporters. This situation began after World War II. The economies of Germany and Japan were in tatters, their populations impoverished and infrastructure destroyed. To recover economically, these countries decided to focus on production, becoming exporters and selling goods to richer countries, like the United States. As exports grew, the countries profited and became wealthier. Germany and Japan set an example for other developing nations, such as China and India. These nations could harness cheap labor to produce goods competitively, and became exporters as well. These exporting countries gradually earned big surpluses from exports, and so wanted to invest them. Yet following the financial crisis in Asia in 1997, investors were wary of Asia, given the risks of a financial system that was not entirely transparent to foreign investors. Thus investment flowed into the United States, a country already overstimulated and consuming more than it should; while the rest of the world wasn’t consuming enough, nor receiving sufficient stimulus to correct the global imbalance. The American economy was faced with the burden of stimulating global growth by absorbing all the exporting countries' goods in addition to their investment capital. Prior to the crisis, the world’s economies relied on the United States to stimulate growth, so U.S. citizens had to keep consuming and buying. Of course to keep buying, they needed income from jobs, but at the time there weren’t any. In earlier recessions, the American economy had bounced back quickly, both in terms of economic growth and employment. After 1991, however, recoveries changed shape into so-called jobless recoveries. While growth and production came back strongly, job creation did not. In the 1991 recession, production bounced back after just three quarters; in 2001, it came back after just one quarter. Yet it took nearly two years to recover the jobs lost in 1991, and over three years to recover those shed in 2001. Job creation and loss is a concern for the Federal Reserve Bank, which is tasked with ensuring high employment. One way it does this is by keeping interest rates low, to entice businesses to invest in growth and hire new employees. After the crisis , politicians also supported low interest rates, as they were under pressure to create more jobs, and this message was made clear to the Fed. No central banker would dare raise interest rates when job growth was meager at best. But low interest rates also put the Fed in a pickle, as its other major responsibility is to guarantee price stability and try to prevent inflation or deflation. Low interest rates meant cheaper mortgages, an opportunity which raised the demand for housing and drive housing prices up, eventually causing a bubble. Investors across the globe saw American real estate as a very profitable investment, pouring money in. And the pop of the housing bubble triggered the crisis. So, let’s review the fault lines: debt-fueled overspending, trade and investment imbalances, and the overheated U.S. housing market. So how did these fault lines converge in the global financial sector, and importantly, how did no one see the dangers ahead? While one financial fault line is a potential threat, the convergence of many can cause a full-on crisis, as we experienced in 2008. So what brought these fault lines together, to such disastrous effect? The introduction of subprime mortgages was a key harbinger of the coming crash. They were designed especially for people with bad credit ratings. Essentially second-class loans, subprime mortgages also came with very high interest rates. Subprime lending was heavily promoted by both Democrats and Republicans. It was seen as the answer to the country's stagnant pay and low employment rates. Even though income wasn't increasing, at least more people could buy a home, is how the thinking went. Yet spending was based on high levels of debt. While subprime lending served short-term needs, it was the decisive stroke in setting other economic fault lines trembling. Stuck with stagnant incomes, American citizens still wanted to consume. Subprime mortgages allowed them to do so, even if they had bad credit. This, in turn, satisfied politicians who'd promoted subprime mortgages. Sure, they hadn’t created more jobs, but voters were at least placated for the moment. Foreign exporters too had export surpluses burning a hole in their pockets. The United States was ripe for investing, as consumption (fueled by cheap loans) was so high. Investors could also take advantage of the booming housing market, by buying subprime mortgage-backed securities – clusters of subprime mortgages that banks sold to investors. What at first glance looked win-win for everyone, came with extreme risk. In retrospect, the bursting of this exuberant bubble should've been predictable. So how did no one see it coming? The gears of the global economy were running smoothly before the crisis, and it seemed as if there was nothing to worry about. If there was an issue, warning signs such as price changes would have popped up. If a financial product or service is risky and the probability of a loss is high, the price for that product should fall. Prices are an important economic indicator, because a functioning market relies on accurate prices. Before the crisis however, prices weren’t accurate, but distorted! This distortion was the result of too many foreign investors financing subprime lending. These investors bid up the prices for subprime mortgage-backed securities, which made those securities look more attractive than they really were. These investors typically came from export nations looking to invest their surpluses. Germany was a leading export nation at the time, and its Landesbanks, for instance, made huge investments, and thus incurred huge losses, in the course of the crisis. Mathematical financial models can also assess risks. Older market data is fed into programs to calculate the probability of future losses. Yet according to the calculations, everything was fine. How did we get it so wrong? The problem was that the old market data didn’t fit the new financial situation. Subprime lending was an entirely new concept, so there was no data for it at all. Calculations thus were completely arbitrary, as there was no way to accurately predict what could happen in the future. So aside from prices changes and computer models, what are the other alarm bells that should sound if the economy is drifting sideways? Rating agencies are also tasked with assessing the risks of financial products. So why didn’t these agencies see the crash coming? Interestingly, rating agencies gave subprime mortgage-backed securities very good ratings. According to them, such financial investments were completely safe. During the lending boom, roughly 60 percent of subprime mortgage-backed securities were rated AAA, meaning they were considered as safe an investment as a U.S. Treasury Bill, which is among the safest investments in the world! On the surface, it may seem like rating agencies were involved in a bit of a con game. Yet the ratings were legitimate, according to the design of the securities. The trick was that bankers were packaging subprime mortgages from different parts of the United States and from different points of origin, such as banks or brokers, together. This practice is called diversification. Diversification supposedly made the mortgages safer by minimizing risk. It meant that a mortgage could only default if a large number of people failed to pay it. At the time, it seemed unlikely that so many people would be unable to pay back their mortgages at once. So there were a number of factors that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Yet even though all these problems converged, we still want to point a finger at someone. But at whom? We all want a scapegoat for the crisis. Weren’t the greedy bankers to blame? Well, yes and no. In a sense the crisis was the fault of the banks, because of the enormous investment risks bankers took. The crisis took place in the financial sector, after all. At the heart of dealings in the financial sector is risk management. It is a banker’s job to monitor potential risks and avoid extreme risk whenever possible. Thus only a fool could say that bankers didn’t know what they were getting into. They should have curbed their greed and been more skeptical of figures that were too good to be true. So in this regard, bankers did fail to do their job properly. Bankers are not only to blame, however. The financial sector was merely the epicenter where the fault lines met. There were many other factors that contributed to the crisis. The government was responsible as well. Its intervention into the economy – in particular the promotion of subprime lending – made risk-taking much more attractive. Naturally, that made a crash much more likely. And instead of putting a halt to excessive risk-taking, they applauded the bankers for their efforts. There were other culprits too: Central bankers share some responsibility as they kept interest rates so low, while foreign investors financed the whole charade. And many others irresponsibly took out mortgages they couldn’t afford. Furthermore, economists whose very job is to assess the economy failed to see the warning signs. Yet all these people were simply doing what they thought was best for themselves. The entire system was flawed, really, as no one could tell that they were doing something harmful. The economic system is supposed to balance all these varying interests and actors. Unfortunately, responsible economic actors caused huge losses, yet taxpayers had to pay for their mistakes. This is wrong: people who aren’t responsible for the problem shouldn’t have to foot the bill!  Since 2008, very little has been done to eliminate the systemic problems that caused the crash in the first place. Everything is now “back to normal,” which unfortunately means a crisis could easily happen again! The financial sector needs reforming. We shouldn’t forget, however, that a healthy financial sector is absolutely vital to a well-functioning economy. It allocates resources and stimulates growth. Thus the system needs to be fixed in such a way that society can still harness the financial sector's benefits while limiting its potential destructive effects. One of the main causes of the crash was that bankers were incentivized to take big risks. Instead, we need an incentive structure that penalizes dangerous risk-taking. Prior to the crisis, it didn’t matter if bankers engaged in risky behavior as they received their huge bonuses based on short-term profits. If those risks caused massive losses years later, it didn’t matter. We’ve now learned that bonuses should not be paid out immediately, but instead after a few years, to better assess the long-term risk and benefit of such actions. So if a banker earns a bonus, part of it should be held back. This will discourage those in the financial sector from taking long-term risks. Another way we can prevent banks from taking excessive risks is to make their risk exposures public. If markets could see what kind of risks financial firms were taking, firms would be under more pressure to explain their behavior or simply avoid such strategies. This data is sensitive, however. We can’t start making such data public during difficult economic times, as it could just trigger more market panic. When an economy is stable, such revelations are much easier to digest. You'll remember that all of this trouble started because median income in the United States wasn’t rising and job recovery was slow. Politicians gave people cheap loans and subprime mortgages to appease them. What they didn’t do, however, was address the actual roots of the problem: the lack of education and social safety nets. Growing income inequality in the United States was caused by a scarcity of well-educated employees. The more educated you are, the more you get paid. America needs a better education system, and it needs to be more accessible – especially to people from low-income backgrounds. People who grew up in poverty are less likely to attend or graduate from college. Only 34 percent of people from low-income families (meaning families in the bottom 20 percent of the income range) make it to college. For people from high-income families (families in the top 20 percent), that figure is 79 percent. This means financial aid programs for youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are important. Studies suggest that these kinds of programs help boost college attendance. The American social system also needs to change, as it doesn’t adequately insure people against long periods of joblessness. Unemployment benefits in the United States run out after an average of six months, but following the recession of 2000-2001, it took more than three years for jobs to return. Americans have good reason to be worried if they lose their job! Yet politicians nearly always respond to long periods of high unemployment by extending short-term benefits. Workers still suffer, as they can’t trust that the benefits will last enough long to cover them while they’re looking for work. They also can’t know if they’ll qualify for extended benefits, either. Instead, benefit extensions should be tied to a predetermined formula, and not depend on the whims of politicians. People need to know they can rely on support when times are tough. The key message in this book: The 2008 financial crisis wasn’t the fault of a single actor but a coming together of many factors. These “fault lines” included historically low interest rates, a global economy that relied on the consumption habits of one nation, an irresponsible binging on subprime loans and a systemic failure to assess market risks. If as a society we want to avoid similar future crises, we need to fix these deep financial fissures in our global economic system. Suggested further reading: Beyond Outrage by Robert B. Reich Beyond Outrage provides a sobering analysis of what has gone wrong in American politics and economics. Looking at the distribution of wealth and income imbalance, it convincingly argues that we must wrest government from the hands of the regressive right.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

First, we have a tragic event such as 9/11, followed by a farcical one like the financial crisis of 2007-8. Both events were at least partly borne of the same global system; the first one was truly horrendous, the second almost absurd. Why does this happen? Why, after tragic events, do we persist with the methods that eventually produce farcical ones? To put it differently, why do we continue with a capitalist system, which over the last decades has led to so many crises? These blinks, based on the thinking of influential modern philosopher Slavoj Žižek, try to explain why. They also provide a hint of what could be a better system: communism. Curious about that? Let’s get into it. In these blinks, you’ll discover why, although you have many permissions, you have very few rights; why crises in capitalism actually make it stronger; and why communism is nothing like you think it is. People who have grown up under capitalism view it as the perfectly natural evolution of social organization; but they would be wrong. While capitalism is often presented as a completely neutral method of organization that makes the economic system work like a well-oiled machine, the fact is that capitalism is an ideology – a system of ideas that makes us do what we do. Too often, capitalism is portrayed in technical terms as something that simply works, and not as something that is imbued with ideas about how the world works. However, the fact that capitalism can function in any sort of civilization with systems of meaning, such as Buddhism, Christianity or the belief in the welfare state, is proof that capitalism doesn’t just work. These systems of meaning serve as a type of security that people can rely on when their dreams of self-made success – dreams embedded in the capitalist ideology – inevitably crumble, unfulfilled. If capitalism were natural or neutral, we wouldn’t need these systems of meaning to fall back on. So why do so many of us consider capitalism to be natural and desirable, and continue to trust in a system that goes through crisis after crisis? Well, each crisis of capitalism acts as a type of shock therapy that keeps us dreaming. While crises can sometimes make us challenge our beliefs, they more often make us go back to basics. Rather than critically reflecting on the dominant ideology, we instead view crisis as the result of not adhering to the ideology strictly enough. For example, when socialist regimes were faced with the crises that led to their demise, the response from the leaders was, it’s not socialist enough. When the people of Eastern Europe rebelled against their Soviet-supported governments in the twentieth century, they were met not with compromise, but with even more ardently socialist regimes.  A more contemporary example is the 2008 financial crisis, which has been described as the result of too much state intervention, laws and regulation. In reality, it was a result of woefully inadequate regulation. Conventional wisdom states that free trade and open markets – both of which are essential tenets of capitalism – are the basis for freedom and democracy. But is this really the case? As you’ll soon find out, not really. In the capitalist society we live in, many of the freedoms and rights we enjoy are portrayed as a result of capitalism, when they are in fact the result of revolutionary politics. Universal suffrage, labor laws and freedom of the press, just to name a few examples, are all results of revolutionary, emancipatory movements – to which capitalists in power consistently stood in fierce opposition. Similarly, the list of rights demanded at the end of Karl Marx's and Friedrich Engels’s Communist Manifesto were achieved (with the notable exception of the abolition of private property) through pressure from left-wing groups. In the same way that capitalism steals credit for things it never accomplished, it allows us to turn a blind eye to our own responsibility for its errors. For instance, we see our roles in public life (like our job or role as a parent) as something removed from our sense of who we “really are.” We believe that there is something innate in us, our truer self, that is different from the things we do, our jobs or capitalistic self. This outlook removes our responsibility, and indeed everyone's responsibility, for the injustices within the system; our public behavior is not considered part of our private, human self.  An example of this is a report of an Israeli soldier who was helping remove Palestinians from their appropriated homes. When confronted, one soldier tried to explain that he was only human, showed pictures of his baby daughter and insisted that he was just doing his duty.  By removing his private self from his so-called duties, he could carry on without having to think about the consequences of his actions.  Moreover, the idea of the private self makes collective action difficult, as it is seen as oppressive to the inner self and our individualism. Despite offering some hopeful prospects, the freedoms we’ve achieved in spite of capitalism have failed to establish an equal society.  Capitalism has reached a new stage that has less clearly defined hierarchical structures than in the past. Since the 1970s, capitalism has turned away from an organizational structure whereby the boss at the top controlled everything below. Instead, modern-day labor is organized into teams and projects, which at first glance appear to constitute a more egalitarian and equal distribution of power.  But this structure just serves to conceal the fact that there is still someone at the top of the ladder, like the CEO or department head, even if the rest of the organization doesn’t follow the classical capitalist model. In this stage of capitalism, there hasn’t been a real shift in power; rather, we simply have permission from the ones with power to do new things. Permissions are different than rights, in the sense that permissions can still be revoked by those who have the rights to do so – that is, those who have the power. We can see this in collaborative and participatory systems of labor organization, where workers have permission to be involved in decision making, yet never have the final say. Instead, that power still lies with boss, who is the ultimate decision maker.  Similarly, LGBT people, minorities and other marginalized groups have gotten more permissions in recent history, like the legitimation of same-sex marriage, without having attained any actual power.  For example, when Proposition 8, the law approving same-sex marriages in California, was revoked, it was clear that extending the right to marry to same-sex couples still hadn’t given same-sex couples the power to truly exercise that right.  The result has been a society that is perceived to be more egalitarian, but has not undergone any real restructuring of the allocation of power. What if the conflicts around the world actually weren’t the real conflicts at the root of global problems? In capitalism, we latch onto ideological fetishes that hide the harsh truths behind other ideas. In modern usage, the word fetish evokes thoughts of bizarre sexual activities. The older meaning of the word, however, is simply “an object that has been given a greater value or quality.” For example, when someone’s grandmother dies, they might keep an object that is somehow connected with the deceased, like a book or a piece of jewelry, through which their grandmother can “live on.” Western Buddhism offers a perfect example of an ideological fetish. Buddhism enables us to take part in the frantic, fast-paced capitalist society that surrounds us while maintaining the lie of mindfulness and inner peace. Fetishes can also be used to cover up real conflict by acting as a conduit for people’s frustrations. For anti-Semites, the fetish is “the Jew,” who is portrayed as an almost mythical force that rules the world. This fetish – which in this case takes the role of a scapegoat – buries a very real problem, namely the class conflict between the capitalists and the rest of society. Convincing people from the working class that this particular fetish only masks their actual, continual conflict with the ruling class is very difficult. For example, in the 1920s, many German Communists joined the Nazi party, but the reverse was extremely rare.  We find a similar example in the way Jews and the State of Israel are used by Islamo-Fascist ideology. Here, the State of Israel is a fetish that represents the true problem of an impoverished region where all revolutionary politics have failed.  The real problem, of course, is the fact that the people in these countries have been robbed of all hope of a true revolution and an egalitarian society. Once the fetish is removed, however, the real system and the harsh reality it perpetuates is uncovered.   What motivates you to buy one brand of, say, toothpaste over another? While it may be the material or economic benefit that one brand has over the other, in all likelihood the reality is far more complicated. Consumption has shifted from a symbol of culture, experiences and identity to actually being an experience in itself. In other words, the act of buying and choosing what to buy is the real experience; the usage of the product is secondary. In this way, the act of consuming is less about procuring something useful and more about demonstrating our beliefs. Take one Starbucks advertising campaign, for example, which portrayed their coffee as both environmentally friendly and good for the workers in the field; the tagline was “ethical coffee.” Of course, this tagline downplays the fact that Starbucks is a huge capitalist corporation, designed to accumulate wealth for its capitalist owners rather than for the people who work for them (least of all the poor souls who pick the coffee beans).  When we buy Starbucks’s “ethical coffee,” we’re really buying an experience: the experience of making a seemingly positive ethical decision. We can buy coffee anywhere, but Starbucks gives us the opportunity to have the experience of doing something good – even if the political impact of our action is negligible. But consumption isn’t just about the inward satisfaction of positive experiences. It also emanates outward, as our consumption decisions show people who we are. When companies ask us what we want from them, they’re really asking us who we are, or who we want to be. We respond by buying products or brands that demonstrate how we perceive ourselves and want others to perceive us. This quest for authentic experiences transforms consumption into a way to find meaning in our existence. When we consume organic food, for example, it’s not just for the taste – it’s an expression of who we are: caring, environmentally conscious people. What comes to mind when you hear the word “communism”? For most people, the word conjures up atrocities committed by Joseph Stalin or other communist leaders. But could there ever be a viable communist alternative to the capitalist system? If this is to be the case, as the author believes, communism must be re-thought from the ground up in order to lay the foundation for collective action. Vladimir Lenin himself wrote that the only viable versions of communism “begin from the beginning,” rather than trying to build upon the systems that preceded them. In this way, an egalitarian revolution isn’t a movement of gradual change; instead, it repeatedly starts from scratch in order to become better than previous attempts. Philosopher Alain Badiou calls this approach the communist hypothesis. According to Badiou, the idea of communism is worth pursuing, but the historical focus on the state’s expropriation of property as well as other implementations of communism might be misplaced.  Still, the fundamental drive behind communism is collective action, without which there is no possibility for a better, egalitarian society. The question of how we relate to property and ownership is what makes communism both unique and ultimately the only real means of achieving an egalitarian society. Whereas capitalism is the support and defense of private property, and socialism of state property, communism questions the very idea of property in any form. This is a crucial insight, as there are some things that we can probably all agree shouldn’t be owned by anyone due to their importance for survival. For example, most people would agree that the air that we breathe shouldn’t be a commodity. The question of property comes into focus when we look at the problems in today’s world; the following blinks will reveal exactly how. So which problems in our capitalist world act as antagonisms – essential battlegrounds and arenas for resistance – that communism is best positioned to respond to? The first three antagonisms in today’s world center around our survival. They all involve the shared resources, or commons, of our societies The first, the commons of culture, are things like language, means of communication and education, as well as shared infrastructure. Today these commons of culture are privatized under the banner of “intellectual property,” which restricts access to culture. The second is commons of external nature, that is, our natural habitat. Environmental disaster threatens our very survival, be that through climate change, the extinction of species or limited access to clean water. This particular problem can’t be solved by national governments or private companies, as it is a global problem that all humanity faces. Finally, there is the commons of internal nature, which refers to what it means to be human. Today’s advances in genetics have opened up endless possibilities for remodeling our very nature. Imagine what could happen if a state or a company was the sole owner of such technology? These antagonisms create the need for a new global organization. If they are not handled in a way that is good for all people, we risk destroying the planet’s resources and forcing ourselves to genetically enhance ourselves to cope, all the while consuming culture to maintain some semblance of humanity.  And guess who will ultimately profit from these modifications and cultural consumption, made necessary by the very havoc they wreaked. Yep. You got it: capitalists.  But even if we address these three antagonisms, we still won’t move toward an equal and functioning society without looking at the fourth, which we’ll explore in the next blink. While the previous three antagonisms focus on the survival of the human race, the fourth is the division between the Included and the Excluded. It is this antagonism that is most crucial, and also the one that requires a radically new way of thinking. The Excluded comprises all those who don’t have a place in the social order and are thus excluded from decision making. This group forms a “part of no-part”: their place is exactly that they have no place in the public sphere of debate. Once they’re included in society, however, they cease being the Excluded. One good example is paperless immigrants. They are truly a “part of no-part,” as they legally don’t belong to any country. As long as they are in this position, they essentially have no rights at all. Once they acquire papers and are finally granted citizenship, they stop being Excluded and are then Included. Once Included, the paperless immigrant virtually disappears. Thus, paperless immigrants are either Excluded from the ruling group or simply cease to exist in society. The proletariat, or the working class, is similarly Excluded from the socio-political process. Those who want an open liberal democracy try to bring in as many voices from the Excluded as they can. However, as soon as the proletariat is included in the political decision-making process, they cease being Excluded, cease being proletarians and become part of the same oppressive political machinery that oppressed them to begin with. Communism’s solution is to prioritize the perspective of the Excluded instead of the Included. Rather than enact reforms that try to make as many people Included as possible, it instead tries to transform society to fit the needs of the Excluded by making them the base for politics.  By giving political power to the most marginalized groups in society, the institutional distinctions between Excluded and Included begin to disappear. Many people dismiss communism as something that belongs in the dustbin of history. After all, hasn’t it already been proven not to work? On the contrary! In fact, no truly communistic society has ever existed.  The failure of the USSR, often touted as the final nail in the coffin proving the inadequacy of communism, was actually a result of socialism, not communism. In a socialist society, the commons are owned by the state, and within the socialist state people are assigned a role in the community. We call this communitarianism. This, however, is not to be misconceived as the egalitarian collective of communism. Under socialism, bureaucrats are still the decision makers (the Included) while the proletarians remain Excluded, thus making true equality impossible.  Moreover, many of the “communist” societies throughout history have, in actual fact, greatly benefited capitalism. The economic models employed in Asia offer a perfect example. Lee Quan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister, introduced the concept of Capitalism with Asian Values, which has since become the model for China’s economy. This type of economic system might not look like capitalism at first glance, as it features heavy planning from central authorities and totalitarian regimes. The foundation this model in China was achieved through the extreme shock therapy of Mao Zedong's cultural revolution, during which millions were persecuted, abused and even killed. Instead of providing a legacy that challenges capitalism, it paved the way for it. As we can see, capitalism does not necessarily lead to democracy. Both Singapore and China are capitalist, but also totalitarian non-democracies. In the long run, the only way capitalism will survive is through socialism in one way or another. To avoid the communistic revolution that will abolish property altogether, capitalists need to appease people through strong government programs. These can be hidden, as is the case with communitarianism, or overt, like the state planning found among the Asian capitalists. The key message in this book: Capitalist ideology permeates the world around us, constantly influencing the way we think and act. And yet,  it remains hidden from view most of the time. The only real way to create a free, egalitarian society that can handle today’s critical issues is to challenge this ideology, and ultimately replace it with something better.

Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner","summary":"At this very moment, there are probably countless people who wish to affect your behavior: politicians, police, your doctor, your boss, your parents or your spouse, to name just a few. Although the tactics used may vary from threats and bribes to charm and deceit, all attempts have something in common: they rely on incentives. An incentive is simply a means of urging people to do more of a good thing or less of a bad thing. Incentives fall into three general categories: economic, social and moral. Most successful incentives – the ones that attain the desired change in behavior – combine all three types. One area where incentives are crucial is in the field of crime. People regularly have opportunities to cheat, steal and defraud, so it’s interesting to examine what incentives keep them from doing so. The risk of going to prison and the related loss of employment, house and freedom are all essentially economic in nature, and certainly form a strong incentive against crime. There is also a strong moral incentive, as people don’t want to do something that they feel is wrong. And finally there is a strong social incentive, as people do not want to be seen by others as doing something wrong. Often, depending on the crime, this can be a stronger incentive than economic penalties. It is this combination of all three types of incentives that encourage most people to refrain from crime. Incentives can affect your wallet, your pride or your conscience. We are all familiar with attempts to incentivize behavior. Whether it is parents offering small treats to their children for doing schoolwork or companies paying bonuses to employees who hit their sales targets, everyone has had incentives dangled in front of them. However, influencing behavior by adding incentives is often a more complicated affair than it might first seem. Incentives often operate in an environment where small changes can have a dramatic impact, and not always in the way those initiating the changes would hope. In a study of day care centers in Haifa, Israel, economists tried to reduce the number of parents arriving late to pick up their children. To accomplish this, they introduced the economic disincentive of a small $3 fine. But rather than reduce the number of late pick-ups, the change actually doubled them. How could adding this disincentive have backfired? One problem may have been that the amount was not big enough, signaling to the parents that late pick-ups were not a significant problem. The main issue, however, was that this small economic disincentive replaced an existing moral disincentive: the guilt parents felt when arriving late. Parents could now effectively buy off their guilt for a few dollars, so they were less worried about being late. Furthermore, once the signal had been sent, the effect could not be undone. The removal of the fines had no remedial effect on the number of late pick-ups. As the example shows, setting incentives can be tricky, especially when other forms of incentive are already present. When introducing incentives, think carefully about whether they might displace existing ones. Introducing incentives can often have unintended consequences on people’s behavior. Have you ever robbed a bank? Probably not, since there are a variety of disincentives (e.g., prison, loss of social stature, a guilty conscience) that keep you from trying. And yet, some people do rob banks even though they face the same disincentives. Why? Because different people react differently to the same incentives. This is fairly self-evident, but more surprisingly, even one and the same person may respond differently to the same incentives on different occasions. Consider the data collected by Paul Feldman, who ran a business providing bagels to office snack rooms. With the bagels, he left an unattended cash-box for customers to pay in, and picked up the cash and leftovers at the end of each day. Each customer had the same incentives to pay – the desire to be and look honest – so the variations in payment rates each day and at the different locations revealed some interesting trends about honesty in changing conditions. The key contributing factor in how honest his customers were seemed to have been personal mood, which was in turn affected by other factors: The weather played a big role with higher payment rates on unseasonably warm days and lower rates on unseasonably cold days. Stressful holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving dramatically reduced payment rates while more relaxed holidays pushed the rates up. Similarly, office morale played a part, with people in happy offices being more likely to pay. There was also a universal increase in payment rates following 9/11, which the author attributes to a general surge in empathy. The lesson is that the incentives that work for some people on some days may not work for the same people on other days, depending on shifts in global, local or personal circumstances that affect their moods. Incentives are context dependent: what works when it’s sunny might not when it’s raining.  Everyone needs the advice of an expert from time to time. Whether you are having something repaired, making a big purchase or dealing with a legal issue, you rely on someone with specialist knowledge to help you navigate through unfamiliar territory. Experts have access to a wealth of information that the layperson does not, meaning an information asymmetry exists. Although the experts are usually paid a fee or commission for their expertise, they can also use their informational advantage to cheat laypeople for additional gain. Consider real estate: For most people, selling a house is one of the biggest financial transactions they will make in their lifetime. It can be a complicated business, which is why you rely on your real estate agent who has all the relevant information on property prices and market trends and is presumably also motivated to get the best price possible to raise her commission. You feel assured knowing you have this level of expertise on your side. While reassuring, this thinking is a little too simplistic. A broader view of the incentive story reveals that although the estate agent’s commission is linked to the final sale price, the additional benefit is small relative to that of just closing the deal. The agent’s incentive to make a new sale quickly outweighs the part of the incentive that is meant to be aligned with the customers’ goal. A comparison study reveals that when estate agents sell their own houses they leave them on the market longer and get a higher price than when commissioned by clients. Hence beware; when an estate agent encourages you to take the first decent offer on your house, it is not to maximize your profit but their own. Experts can use their informational advantage to exploit laypeople for economic benefit. The unknown can be pretty scary. In any transaction in an area you have little knowledge or information about, you will likely be worried and anxious. Experts frequently leverage this fear for financial gain. This can happen in a number of ways: A car salesman can convince you not to buy a cheaper model by instilling the fear that it is unsafe. A real estate agent can play on your fear of missing out on your dream house to get you to put in a higher bid. A stockbroker can tell you that if you don’t invest in a certain stock now, you’ll miss the boat and have to live with the regret for the rest of your life. Fear undermines our rational decision-making ability, which is why experts use it to scare us into making decisions we may otherwise not have made. In face-to-face situations, social fears can exacerbate this problem: the expert can exploit our fears of looking stupid, cheap or dishonorable. Imagine the stressful situation of arranging the funeral of a loved one. The funeral director, knowing you know little about his business, can use your anxieties about giving your loved one a proper burial to steer you to a more expensive casket than you would have otherwise chosen. Be wary of situations where an expert seems to be playing on your fears, particularly when you’re told you need to make an immediate decision. In such cases, try to have strategies in place that will buy you valuable time and space to consider your choices in peace, such as saying you need to get a second opinion. You can also try to even out the information asymmetry by researching the topic of the transaction in advance. Experts can use fear and anxiety to cheat laypeople. In the 1990s, the price of life insurance fell dramatically. There was no similar trend in other forms of insurance, or any significant shifts in the life insurance business or customer base itself. So, why this sudden drop in prices? The answer lies with the emergence of the Internet, or more specifically of price comparison websites. These websites enabled customers to compare insurance prices offered by dozens of different companies in mere seconds. Price information that had been extremely time-consuming to gather just a few years earlier was available at the click of a mouse. As the policies were fairly similar in nature, the more expensive companies had no choice but to lower their prices, driving down the overall price of the policies. This example demonstrates how important the Internet has been in eroding and reducing information asymmetries all over the world. At its core, it is a highly efficient medium for sharing and redistributing information from those that have it to those who do not. Consumers are now able to quickly and conveniently gather information about products and prices before dealing with an expert, providing themselves with a much better idea of what they should pay and what should be included for that price, removing much of the expert’s informational advantage and hence unfair financial gain. If you are buying a house today, for example, you can go online and find out for yourself what a reasonable offer would be rather than relying on the word of your estate agent. The Internet has greatly helped reduce the informational advantage of experts. One of the side effects of a culture of information asymmetry is that even a lack of information – real or perceived – can have a powerful effect. For example, it is commonly understood that once a new car is bought it will instantly lose as much as a quarter of its value. Someone who had paid $20,000 for a car yesterday can expect to get less than $15,000 for it today. Why this absurd drop in value in 24 hours? The reason lies in information asymmetry. The buyer cannot know the true reasons why the seller is selling their new car, so they logically assume that there is something wrong with it. Even if this is not the case, the buyer assumes that the seller has information they are not revealing, and fills this information gap with his or her own assumption. Effectively, the seller is punished because of the information asymmetry. A study of online dating sites provides another example of this effect. Results show that the single worst thing a user can do to lower the amount of interest they generate is to omit their photo. When others see they have done this, they assume the worst. The lesson is that in any transaction, it is clearly important to not only focus on the information you provide but also consider the information the other party expects you to provide, and what conclusions they are likely to jump to if you omit it. When sellers leave out information, customers often penalize them by assuming the worst. When it comes to assessing risks, we are far less rational than we would like to believe. One factor that disproportionately influences our assessment is how readily we can imagine the risk in question. Although they are in fact quite rare, we can easily imagine plane crashes, gun crime or terrorist attacks occurring due to their excessive coverage in the media. This leads us to over-assess the risk of these threats. As another example, ask yourself: Would you feel safer if your child was playing at a friend’s house where a gun is kept or playing at a house with a swimming pool? The thought of a child being shot with a gun is horrifying and creates outrage. Swimming pools do not, so we would probably feel safer about the swimming pool. But actually, the likelihood of a child being killed by gunshot is much smaller than that of being killed in a swimming pool accident. A second factor in our evaluation of risk is how in control we feel. This may explain people’s disproportionate fear of flying compared to driving: we feel in control when we’re actually holding the steering wheel of a car, whereas we feel helpless on a plane. But the risk of death in either form of transport is in fact about the same. Being aware of our biases in these respects is the first step in resisting them. The second is seeking out solid facts about risks to help counter gut reactions and make more rational evaluations. People worry disproportionately about risks that are particularly prominent or over which they have little control. Despite having similar populations, the city of Washington DC has three times the number of police officers as Denver and eight times the number of homicides. Would you assume that the additional officers are causing the higher rate of homicide? When we see that an increase in a certain factor, X, corresponds with an increase in another factor, Y, it is tempting to think that the relationship is causal and that the increase in X caused the increase in Y. This is a human tendency: we assume causality when in fact there may only be correlation. Consider the example of money and politics. Most people would agree that money has a strong influence on the outcome of elections, and in fact data shows that candidates with the most expensive campaigns usually win. We tend to logically infer that money is the cause of the victory. But is this really the case? People who contribute to political campaigns are generally pragmatic, and therefore use one of two tactics: they either try to make a difference in a close race or back a clear favorite. They believe that the candidate they don't support is not worth their effort. These trends result in successful candidates attracting more money. But did the money contribute to the success or vice versa? By studying candidates that run in successive elections, it was found that actually the amount of money spent has hardly any effect on the results. A winning candidate could cut his or her spending in half and lose only 1% of the vote, whereas a losing candidate could double the amount spent but only expect a 1% increase in their vote. It seems money does not win elections after all. We often incorrectly assume that just because two things happen simultaneously, one is causing the other. In addition to jumping to conclusions about causality between two events, we also tend to look for that causality in the most immediate and obvious places, ignoring more distant or indirect causes. Consider crime: At the end of 1989 in the United States, crime figures seemed to be going through the roof. Violent crime had increased by 80% over the previous 15 years, and experts were predicting the situation would only get worse. So it came as something of a surprise when crime figures suddenly and dramatically dropped in the early 1990s. The same experts now rushed to explain the drop. The proposed causes included the improving economy, tougher gun control, innovative policing, increases in police numbers and increased reliance on prisons. Despite the popularity and plausibility of these explanations, later analysis has shown that most of these factors only had a small effect on crime rates. In fact, the factor that had the biggest effect was not even mentioned at the time: abortions. Two of the biggest predictors of a child’s future criminal behavior are growing up in a single-parent household and living in poverty. These happen to coincide with the most common reasons people choose to have an abortion. So when the landmark ruling of Roe v. Wade legalized abortion across the United States in 1973, women in such circumstances were suddenly able to have abortions. This greatly reduced the cohort of likely criminals who would be turning 16 in 1989 or after, hence contributing to the drop in crime from then on. The lesson here is to be wary of obvious and immediate causes – even experts can be fooled by them. When attributing causality, we tend to overlook remote causes in favor of more immediate ones. The key message in this book: From raising children to selling a house, our everyday lives are full of seemingly simple decisions and interactions. By challenging conventional wisdom, examining how we’re affected by incentives and analyzing data from the world around us, Freakonomics gets to the heart of interactions from all walks of life to reveal unexpected and often irrational factors at play. Only by acknowledging these hidden aspects can we begin to understand and develop strategies to counteract them.  The questions this book answered: What should you take into account when assessing incentives and their impact? Incentives can affect your wallet, your pride or your conscience. Introducing incentives can often have unintended consequences on people’s behavior Incentives are context dependent: what works when it’s sunny might not when it’s raining. How does the distribution of information in a transaction affect the parties involved? Experts can use their informational advantage to exploit laypeople for economic benefit. Experts can use fear and anxiety to cheat laypeople. The Internet has greatly helped reduce the informational advantage of experts. When sellers leave out information, customers often penalize them by assuming the worst. What human biases affect our assessments of risk and causality? People worry disproportionately about risks that are particularly prominent or over which they have little control. We often incorrectly assume that just because two things happen simultaneously, one is causing the other. When attributing causality, we tend to overlook distant or remote causes in favor of more immediate ones. Suggested further reading: Think Like a Freak by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J.

However, this is wrong; in reality, government intervention creates confusion in the functioning of the market. This is because when the government intervenes in the market, it distorts the signals that tell consumers the true value of a good or service. For example, during gasoline shortages in the 1970s, the government limited the price that gas stations could charge to keep gas affordable. The direct result of this was a flood of people buying gas at the same time, leading to increased demand and further shortages. Because the price did not rise naturally in response to the shortage, as it would have done in a free market, consumers did not choose to conserve or find alternatives to gasoline. Government action therefore exacerbated the crisis. Without the proper price transmitting information to consumers, they are unable to know how to spend their money in the most efficient ways. So although it might seem strange, the best way to ensure that the market works effectively is to leave it alone. This way, the market is left to individuals voluntarily pursuing their own self-interests. Only by making individual consumers the main actors in the market will the proper value of goods and services, based on their demand and supply, be transmitted. One of the most well-known examples of such voluntary action actually comes from outside the economic market: the development of language. This developed from the bottom up with no central control. People cooperated with each other because it was in the interest of the individual as well as the group to share and create common communication. When people freely traded words, it benefited both parties – no control or planning by a central authority was needed. When governments attempt to control parts of the economy, it often comes from a well-meaning assumption that they can level the economic playing field, making society fairer.  However, by controlling the economy, the government are in effect merely controlling the people who operate within it. And as the ability to choose how you spend your own money is essential to human freedom, government intervention actually leads to unfairer societies. This can be seen with the use of government tariffs to “protect” jobs and workers from “unfair” competition. These tariffs hurt individuals because they reduce consumer choice. They add costs to everyday goods and prevent competition from companies who provide cheaper alternatives. This leads to fewer choices and higher prices. Since buying from the cheapest source and selling at the highest price benefits every human being, the government is undermining your individual freedom by taking choices away from you. The government may claim that voters want specific economic regulations. Yet so often after elections, governments spend taxpayer money in ways that may conflict with your own preferences. Aside from voting once at election time, you are not free to choose how the government spends your money. They make the decision for you; and once again your personal freedom is curbed. Historically, the highest levels of free market economic activity correspond with the largest amount of individual freedom. Compare India in 1947 and Japan in 1867. In these years, massive political change allowed these nations to pursue the chance to massively expand their economies. Japan dismantled its feudal structure, increased social and economic freedom and relied on free markets. Conversely, India raised taxes, heavily restricted business operations, and controlled wages and prices. Where Japan relied on efficiency to dictate development, India relied on bureaucratic planning. There was no question which route was best. Japan flourished, and its free population grew richer, whereas the economy of India stagnated and its population remained poor.   By the early twentieth century, large banks in the United States developed a system by which they could limit the damage and destruction caused by banking crises. The system worked liked this: when the economy started to waver, consumers would rush to withdraw their money from banks, causing a panic and furthering the crisis. In response, healthy banks would band together to give loans to unstable ones and limit the amount of cash that was available for depositors. Though this strategy did have small negative effects on workers and businesses, it worked efficiently to prevent bank runs, and the typical crisis lasted only a few months. Yet, after a series of bank runs in the early 1900s, political pressure mounted for government to intervene, and so the Federal Reserve (the Fed) was born. This was a central bank that could lend to commercial banks during times of crisis by printing new money or borrowing money itself. Instantly, the Fed instilled a sense of confidence in bankers and citizens, as they presumed their banks and their money would be protected at all times by the Fed. At first the Federal Reserve corrected some banking crises in the 1920s by lending money to banks in trouble. Yet when it came to the Great Depression, it approached the crisis in a completely different way. The Fed did the complete opposite of what it was expected to do after the stock market collapsed in 1929: it began to decrease the amount of available money. Because banks were accustomed to emergency loans from the Fed, they never restricted funds and operated as if nothing was wrong. They had expected the Fed to offer economic help, so when it didn’t they were left in serious trouble. Thus, between 1930 and 1934, there was a series of devastating bank runs, and the depression lingered on for ten years. Inflation occurs when the quantity of money rises more rapidly than the amount of goods and services available. When the total amount of money increases, it creates a greater demand for goods. And if the amount of goods does not increase, the only way to deal with demand is to increase prices. The worst effect of inflation is that it is a hidden tax on individuals. For example, if you save $100 in the bank, hoping to spend it on $100 worth of goods, and the rate of inflation is 3 percent, then after one year it would cost you $103 to purchase the same amount of goods. You have effectively paid a 3 percent tax on holding the money. Inflation is the direct result of government policy. It occurs because governments have the ability to print money. There is no example in history of a substantial increase in inflation that did not correspond with an increase in the quantity of money. For example, the American government financed itself during the Civil War by printing money. Inflation grew 10 percent per month from 1861 to 1864, and the prices of all common goods skyrocketed. It was only after the war, when the government reduced the physical stock of money, that inflation subsided. In America today, inflation is caused by a rapid growth in government spending and the mistaken policies of the Federal Reserve. The government has an incentive to create money from the printing press because this allows politicians to fund programs favored by the special interest groups who support them. And because the government controls the Federal Reserve, it can make the decision to print money without the need for citizens to vote for any tax increases. The only cure for inflation is the reduction in monetary growth: restricting the amount of money created by government. Although the modern welfare state provides benefits for the poor and underprivileged, it fails to provide the most efficient assistance. This is because, despite the good intentions of helping the poor, when government bureaucrats take control of the purse strings, spending spirals out of control. When money is given to bureaucrats to spend, it changes their behavior. They are spending money that’s not theirs, on people other than themselves. This destroys the incentive to get the most value for the fewest dollars. In contrast, when individuals spend their own money, they have a natural incentive to get the best goods or services at the best price, even if their spending is for charity. And the problems of the welfare state go further. A government’s attempts to redistribute income in fact disproportionately hurts the poor. Social security, for example, is a regressive tax that bears most heavily on those earning low wages. The younger and poorer pay a greater percentage of their income to these taxes, while the rich pay less and receive benefits in retirement they do not need. Astonishingly, this results in the transfer of wealth from poor to rich. There are two further disadvantages for the poor when the government raises taxes and diverts money for charitable purposes. First, the poor have fewer political connections, which makes it nearly impossible to succeed in the political scramble for extra funds. Second, the amount of money used for welfare will be less than the amount taxed for the purpose. Funds are immediately siphoned toward legislators, political campaigns and regulators, all of which contribute nothing to the welfare of the poor. Only human kindness or self-interest ensures that the money is spent in the most beneficial way. When people are free to spend their own money in charitable ways, they make better decisions and the outcomes are vastly more efficient. For the past few decades, public schools have declined in quality as costs have risen dramatically. The main reason for the drop in quality is that control of education has been taken away from local communities and centralized in Washington DC. In the early 1800s, although school was neither compulsory nor free, it was nearly universal. Yet, in the 1840s, a movement was created not by parents but by teachers and government officials to replace the diverse system of private schools with free schools. Although they argued that government-run schools were in the “public interest,” they knew that regulation would grant them higher pay, better job security, and a greater degree of control over the students and parents. Unfortunately, this process has continued over time. More and more schools have been taken over by the state, decreasing the quality of education by producing three terrible effects: larger schools and classrooms, severe reduction in school choice, and the growth of administrative power. Distressingly, as money pours into education to “fix” these problems, it only serves to make them worse. Over the past 50 years, the number of students has increased only modestly, while the number of teachers, administrators and staff has skyrocketed. Perhaps the saddest outcome of centralized control is that bad schools adversely affect the poor they were intended to help. With regards to schooling, wealthy parents have a number of choices. They can send their children to private school or move to a wealthier district with parent-supported schools. The poor, on the other hand, are stuck without the ability to move or to support their local school by providing extra fundraising. As it stands today, parents and students have little say in the quality of their education even while the payrolls of teachers, administrators and staff still continue to expand. The government often argues that if sellers are left to act via their own self interest they will deceive customers by overcharging them or selling them shoddy products. Governments therefore promote the implementation of rules and regulations to “protect” the consumer. Yet this often has the opposite effect: worse conditions for consumers. Attempts to “protect the consumer” are inherently anti-growth, because complying with increasingly complex government regulations imposes heavy costs on industries, and these costs are passed on to the consumer. The rising cost of goods results in periods of slow growth, where unemployment rises and wages stagnate. There are many historical examples of economic growth suffering when regulatory agencies are created. For example, the New Deal – a package of progressive reforms in the 1930s – quickened the pace of federal intervention in the economy and was followed by slow growth. By the 1960s, there were 21 new regulatory agencies, and economic growth slowed dramatically. Government intervention also limits competition by protecting powerful special interests. For example, in the late 1800s competition between private railroad companies was fierce, and the industry grew and was highly innovative. However, activists and faltering railroad companies began to complain about unfair prices. They lobbied the government to intervene, which led to the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. This body was designed to regulate the railroad industry, but unbelievably the railroad companies themselves helped write their own regulations. They effectively placed themselves in control of their industry. Soon prices were raised and fresh competition was prevented from entering the market. The best way to protect consumers is to increase competition and decrease regulations. With fewer regulations, competition drives down prices and requires businesses to sell better products. The very nature of competition helps protect consumers, because in a market with more choices they can easily choose to spend their money elsewhere.   In the past two centuries, workers in economically advanced societies have seen their conditions improve drastically. But the government and labor unions, despite their rhetoric, are not the reason for this development. In fact, counter to their mission to keep workers gainfully employed, unions themselves have an adverse effect on unemployment. Because unions are granted special privileges from the government, they can give benefits to their workers at the expense of non-union workers, who are left unemployed or compelled to work for lower wages. Take the doctors union, the American Medical Association: they keep the number of doctors artificially low, which raises the cost of medical care and prevents competition by unlicensed doctors who then cannot practice. Another goal of unions is to enforce high wages, but raising income this way is artificial and destructive. The minimum wage in the United States is one great example. Though the minimum wage is designed to protect workers, it creates high unemployment and disproportionately affects poor black teenagers. These poor teenagers educated in sub-standard schools have no skills with which to earn a high-paying wage, yet they are prevented by the law from working for low wages, even though these positions could provide them with on-the-job training. Their job opportunities are therefore extremely limited. The minimum wage protects highly skilled workers at the expense of the less skilled. As attempts to protect workers actually harms them by creating a shortage of both workers and employers, another approach is needed. It is in fact better to leave the provision and price of labor to the free market. A freer market provides both workers and employers alike with natural protection from exploitation, because it expands the choice of jobs and employees. An exploited employee can easily move to another more suitable job, and employers can avoid exploitation because they have a large pool of workers to choose from.   The power and size of the government has continued to grow over time and has led to control over many aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, increasing the size of the government has led to spiralling costs and less efficient spending. For example, in Washington DC, government employees are spending taxpayer money devising ways to get us to quit smoking, while on the other side of town, different government employees are spending taxpayer money to subsidize tobacco farmers. Unbelievably, we are paying huge amounts for people to write laws that effectively cancel each other out. Another problem is that when government grows and more departments and legislation are introduced, citizens find it much harder to understand what their government is doing. This is because there are too many laws to understand and different agendas to follow. It is impossible to run a massive government without hiring bureaucrats to deal with the ever-expanding complexities, and this further separates the people and their government. In order to return the power to the people, we must lay down broad rules covering what the government can and cannot do. One idea is an economic Bill of Rights that would serve to limit government power in economic areas. If we limit the total budget of the government, for example, this would limit the power of politicians to cater to special interest groups. Suddenly, everyone would have to compete for a piece of a pie that is fixed in size, instead of colluding with the government to make the pie bigger each year. The greatest threat to human freedom is the concentration of power, whether that of the government or of other entities. We must remember that power granted even with good intentions can have a debilitating effect on freedom. Fortunately, we are still free to choose the direction of the country, and hopefully we will work to prevent further concentrations of power.   The key message of this book is: Economic freedom is essential to personal freedom. Government attempts to control individuals through economic commands actually ends up hurting individuals and taking away their all important freedom of choice. Actionable ideas in this book: Voucher programs could help improve our schools. A voucher program in which parents are given a voucher worth the cost of their child’s education would enable school choice and open a whole new range of options for the poor, who are presently stuck with crumbling schools. Vouchers would create much needed competition, forcing schools to improve in order to attract more students.  Support an economic Bill of Rights. Adding an amendment to the constitution to protect the economic rights of individuals would go a long way to ensuring that our freedoms are not continuously eroded by government regulations and spending. By limiting the federal government to a fixed budget every year rather than allowing them to forever increase spending, bureaucrats would be forced to spend taxpayer funds more wisely. Any way to increase the efficiency of tax dollar spending is good for the citizens that must pay them.","headers":["The power of the market lies in voluntary actions by individuals, not in government intervention.","Economic control by governments over individuals erodes personal freedom.","The Great Depression was caused by the very institution created to prevent it: the Federal Reserve.","Inflation is a direct result of government manipulation of the economy and is a hidden tax on the population.","The modern welfare state is inefficient and routinely hurts the poor it was designed to help.","Our education system has deteriorated as local and parental control has been replaced by federal bureaucrats. ","The government’s desire to protect consumers impedes economic growth and causes prices to rise.","Attempting to protect workers interferes with the natural protection provided by the free market.","We can regain our freedom by limiting the power of government and returning control to the people.","Final Summary"],"category":"Economics","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/52f113e23565360011000000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"Free to Choose (1980) explores the relationship between freedom and the choices an individual is allowed to make in regards to the economy.

Garten","summary":"Human societies as we know them didn’t appear overnight. Over the course of centuries, great politicians, entrepreneurs and explorers fashioned the best systems for human beings to live in and thrive. From the emperor Genghis Khan to the British East India Company, from the famous Rothschild banking family to business magnates such as John D. Rockefeller, let’s take a closer look at the big players of world economic history – the people who set the stage for the globalized, interconnected world we know today. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the bank that had more power than all of today’s major banks combined; how brutal conquerors and politicians also bring about prosperity and progress; and how China became a global power poised to rival the United States. Temüjin, more commonly known as Genghis Khan, was one of history’s most famous emperors. Living during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, his military conquests helped the Mongolian Empire grow to include nearly 20 percent of the world’s land mass. But this obviously didn’t happen without a fight. Genghis Khan was an especially brutal commander, and his troops murdered tens of thousands of people. In this way, he differed from many of his contemporaries. For instance, when conquering a city or village, many emperors would give people the option to live under their rule. But Genghis Khan tended to go a different route: he would kill as many people as was necessary to crush the existing social hierarchy and establish his own rules without resistance. Word of this practice spread quickly and many believed that he’d kill every grown man in a village if it could help him advance his goals even a little bit. So, while Genghis Khan was indeed a violent war monger, he nevertheless established a firm and highly effective administration. Meanwhile, he went to work improving the Silk Road, the world’s most famous trading route, which stretched from East Asia to Europe and marked one of the first steps toward globalized trade. The Silk Road also played a key role in consolidating his immense empire. Khan established trading posts on the route, encouraging people from all over his empire to travel and trade knowledge and innovations. He used the resulting information exchange to increase his military power by incorporating knowledge from the Mongol, Islamic and Chinese armies. Beyond that, he was a profound believer in religious freedom and abolished many of the antiquated social structures present in the territories he conquered. This, in turn, served his own expansionist interests: people were no longer granted high social status because of wealth or family ties, but because they were educated and thus useful to the ever-expanding empire. Prince Henry of Portugal, also known as The Navigator, lived from 1394 to 1460, during which time he spread European knowledge around the globe. To do so, he pushed his captains to sail far beyond the limits of contemporary maps, eventually discovering new fortunes and lands. But exploring the uncharted regions of the world wasn’t all he did. As a younger man, Prince Henry dabbled in warfare, albeit with mixed results. In 1415, Henry managed to conquer a key Moroccan trading center, the city of Ceuta. But as he pushed further into African and Islamic territories, it quickly became evident that his military prowess couldn’t match that of his opponents. For instance, when he attacked Tangier in 1437, the city was well defended. His army was not only pushed back and surrounded in a matter of days, but his brother Fernando was taken hostage. He tasted victory and suffered defeat, but Prince Henry’s true legacy lies in his exploration and exploitation of the African continent. After facing harsh criticism from Portugal’s high society, Henry turned his attention to exploring unknown parts of the world. One of his more important accomplishments came when he ordered his men to sail beyond the Bulging Cape, also known as Cape Bojador, on the northern coast of what is today Western Sahara. The order was a bold one, since the area was feared by superstitious sailors who refused to go beyond this point. His contribution to new and indispensable maritime knowledge paved the way for Columbus to discover the Americas and for Vasco de Gama to chart a maritime route to India. Yet despite such bold decisions, his expensive explorations yielded only modest financial rewards for years. While Henry was driven by a deep religious need to convert people to Christianity, he also needed a way to pay for such ventures. In Africa, he found a solution – and a horrific one at that. He became the first person to establish slave trading, importing somewhere around 15,000 to 20,000 African slaves into Portugal. To this day, the British East India Company evokes an image of tremendous power and, during its heyday, it was so important that it was known simply as The Company. This international trade powerhouse once employed tens of thousands of British as well as Indian citizens and, while many people contributed to its meteoric rise, no one played as active a role as Sir Robert Clive. While most people know of India as a former British colony, that only happened after a long struggle between French, Indian and British forces. In the 1740s, as these events were unfolding, Robert Clive was living a tumultuous life in England, burdened by depression and a disapproving father. When he arrived in India as a teenager in 1744, he came with nothing but debt and the ragged clothes on his back. But his luck would soon turn. After joining the army and becoming a merchant soldier, he helped win impossibly difficult battles for the British, helping to build an administrative empire for his country and a small fortune for himself. The vast majority of this wealth came from plundering Indian riches and maximizing agricultural profits at the expense of the local population. Two of Clive’s most important victories were at the battles of Arcut and Passay. These triumphs paved the way for the East India Company to gain power over huge swathes of Indian territory. As a result of such conquests, the East India Company became so powerful that it ruled India for several decades. Even after Clive’s death, the company’s power and influence continued to grow, and it came to control major ports, ships and even insurance companies. The Company was not only one of the largest sources of income for wealthy Brits at the time, it also collected taxes from India and maintained an army of over 100,000 troops. In fact, by 1757, it had become so powerful that the British parliament became wary of its influence as an independent entity. To keep it in check, an act of parliament established Britain’s sovereign authority over the company and brought its administration firmly under control of the British crown. While banking giants and international finance organizations like the International Monetary Fund now span the globe, there’s never been a bank in history that rivaled the power of the Rothschild Bank. It was one of the first international banking empires, and it had a tremendous impact on the development of global finance. Founded in the mid-eighteenth century by Mayer Amschel Rothschild of Frankfurt, this once humble banking business developed into the largest financial company of its time. Rothschild's family went on to run a variety of businesses and fund everything from the Napoleonic wars to the construction of railways and modern roads. In every major European city from London to Vienna, the family had a bank that lent money and funded projects, thereby influencing the development of entire countries. They even gave financial advice to kings and queens across Europe. Around the same time as the Rothschilds were revolutionizing the world through finance, a second major event took place: the transatlantic sea cables were laid, enabling virtually instant communication between continents. This massive project, undertaken by the American businessman Cyrus Field, took over 13 years to complete, cost millions of dollars and necessitated several trips across the Atlantic. Field and his company faced tremendous obstacles, from torrential storms to snapping cables to ships that came close to capsizing and investors who lost faith in the colossal project. But when it finally came to fruition in 1866, the impact was incredible. All of a sudden, people on opposite sides of the Atlantic could communicate in real time, instead of waiting weeks or months for mail. The change was sensational and, in just its first month of operation, the cable couriered over 1,000 messages between the two continents. There are few names so intimately tied to wealth as that of John D. Rockefeller, and that’s no coincidence. Rockefeller was both a ruthless businessman and a great philanthropist. His company, Standard Oil, essentially controlled the entire US oil market and was well ahead of its time in terms of its treatment of workers. For instance, employees were encouraged to make time for both business and family, rather than spending every waking moment working for Standard Oil. But the company wasn’t all cookies and cream. In fact, Standard Oil forced the majority of its rivals out of the market and had to be broken up by the US government, which feared the oil giant’s sheer power. Nonetheless, Standard Oil’s successor companies, like Chevron and ExxonMobil, continue to rank among the largest multinational companies in existence. But Rockefeller was more than just an oil tycoon. He also supported countless philanthropic projects, and the Rockefeller Foundation funded a variety of research groups like the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, which focused on curing diseases like pneumonia and typhoid fever. While Rockefeller was building his fortune and giving money to charity, on the other side of the Atlantic, a French political economist was hard at work trying to overcome national boundaries and unite Europe. His name was Jean Monnet and he grew up in a Cognac trading family, which meant he spent his childhood in several different countries. During the First World War, he worked for the allies, helping them improve their international trade. Although he never officially held a political position, his work radically transformed modern Europe. He spent the majority of his life working to establish supranational organizations that could extend beyond national boundaries and unite Europe. His most impressive achievements include the 1951 establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, or ECSC, and convincing the United States to join the Allies during the Second World War. As a result of his efforts, the ECSC, now known as the European Union, has enjoyed almost 50 years of peace and prosperity. When it comes to British politics, there’s probably no woman quite as controversial as Margaret Thatcher, also known as the Iron Lady. She served as Britain’s first female prime minister, from 1979 until 1990. So, why is public opinion about Thatcher so divided? Well, her politics were harsh. She abhorred consensus and pushed determinedly to implement her conservative ideas and neoliberal ideology. Her most well-known political moves include a harsh military reaction to the invasion of the Falkland Islands by Argentina in 1982; dramatic cuts to spending on social welfare; opening up London’s financial district to the international market and privatizing publicly owned companies. These policies were defined by her highly autocratic style of governance. Thatcher made every decision and never allowed the opposition Labour Party to so much as participate in most decision-making processes. Through her domineering leadership, she pushed the conservative ideals of a highly capitalistic society that could only prosper if the government took a step back and allowed private competition to rule the market. This won her the support of the companies and business leaders to whom she gave opportunities, but Thatcher’s tough policies also produced tremendous problems. A good example is the infamous year-long fight she waged against striking miners’ unions. Before Thatcher’s time in office, the mining industry lobbied the government to support new mines, which eventually led to a massive overproduction of coal. In 1984, when Thatcher began cutting support and applying pressure to the mining companies, the unions, fearing for their livelihood, fought back and went on strike. The Iron Lady treated this situation like a war, which she ultimately won, causing thousands to lose their jobs. Many other similar situations meant that the Thatcher government put tens of thousands out of work while making drastic cuts to social welfare programs. Nowadays, if you buy anything from a plastic toy to a flat-screen TV, there’s a good chance it was manufactured in China. But this wasn’t always the case. So how did China become the manufacturing powerhouse it is today? It all began with Deng Xiaoping, a Chinese politician who transformed his country into a modern global player. He began his political career at a relatively young age and spent many years working with hardline communists, even serving as a primary advisor to Mao Zedong. But when Xiaoping took over the party leadership 1978, he opened Chinese markets to foreign investments. To bolster the country’s economy, he invited foreign companies to invest in China and actively supported them in moving their operations there. He also pushed China to export goods across the globe and helped the country join the World Trade Organization. As a result, China became – and has remained – one of the fastest-growing economic markets in the world, with Chinese factories now producing nearly half of the products sold worldwide. But Xiaoping was no pioneer when it came to global capitalism. He had already learned a great deal from a trip he made to the United States in 1979, at a time when businessmen were reforming their companies. One such man was Andrew Grove, a Hungarian-American businessman who transformed modern technology and management in his adopted homeland. Grove fled his native Hungary in 1956 and immigrated to the United States. After completing his studies in chemical engineering, he joined the digital technology firm Intel in an upper management position. Grove’s leadership style was tight and controlling, and he made employees accountable for both their successes and failures. He knew that the biggest problem within any production system wasn’t the shoddy work of particular departments, but rather miscommunication between them. Based on this understanding, he rebuilt the company’s structure, making it more horizontal, and made a point of investing in research and development, even during recessions. In fact, he was the one behind Intel’s focus on microprocessors, small chips that serve a variety of functions and which are now central components in everything from smartphones to spaceships.

Six years later, we’ve never felt a greater need for a new model of economics. As Forecast shows, basic assumptions made by economists are so divorced from the economic reality that they almost invalidate the contemporary economic models. By explaining the flaws in our current economic models and thinking, physicist Mark Buchanan lays the groundwork for a new economics, in which we learn to think of, and analyze, the economy much in the same way meteorologists predict the weather. Using his knowledge of other fields of research, like biology, physics, psychology or meteorology, Buchanan derives insights that, he argues, could help us to advance the scientific study of the economy. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how economics began and what the invisible hand refers to; about limitations and flaws in current economics; why new financial phenomena, like High Frequency Trading and Leveraging, make economies both more efficient and less stable; and why economic forecasts should be more similar to weather forecasts. As any economist worth her salt will know, Adam Smith played a major role in developing economics – the scientific study of the economy in the eighteenth century. In 1776, Smith wrote the influential The Wealth of Nations, in which he explained how the division of labor could increase a company’s productivity. Let’s say a company produces pins. If every employee were responsible for just one step in the production chain – for example, one person to cast the metal, and another to smelt it – the company would be far more productive. Smith also introduced another major concept: the invisible hand. According to his theory, if everyone pursued his or her selfish interests, eventually this would lead to beneficial outcomes for our society. If we apply this concept to the pin company example, if the company introduces a division of labor into its production process, the result is that it can offer its pins at a cheaper price, hence benefiting itself (more sales) and society (cheaper prices). In order to give these early discoveries scientific credibility, economists adopted the concept of equilibrium. They invoked the Greek physicist Archimedes, who used equilibrium to explain the workings of levers and other simple mechanisms. Equilibrium, for Archimedes, was achieved when both arms of a lever bore an equal weight at an equal distance. Early economists also used Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity to lend credibility to the equilibrium concept. With his theory, Newton claimed that unbalanced forces affect every object, essentially accelerating it until it reaches a state of equilibrium. According to Newton, an apple falling from a tree reaches its equilibrium when it hits the ground. It was in such august company as Archimedes and Newton that, in 1874, economist Léon Walras adopted the concept of equilibrium in order to explain Smith’s theory of the invisible hand. Using mathematics, Walras demonstrated the way in which both supply and demand eventually come to a state of equilibrium, where the total demand is satisfied by a sufficient supply. As we’ll see in the following blinks, the concept of equilibrium still plays a major role in modern economics. We say that a market is in equilibrium when it contains many suppliers, and product prices decrease until they hit an optimal price point for both buyers and sellers. Thus, as they satisfy both buyer and seller, markets in equilibrium are optimal – or, in other words, they’re efficient. In 1954, economists were able to show that for every saleable good, there is a specific price at which supply equals demand. Let’s say that a supermarket sells 100 apples at a price of $1 per apple, and that there are 80 people willing to pay that price. In this scenario, there are 20 apples unsold. However, if the supermarket offers the apples at a price of 90 cents, it will sell all 100 apples. This is an example of economic equilibrium. But that wasn’t all that economists were able to demonstrate. They could also show that the resulting equilibrium of supply and demand is pareto optimal. This means that the equilibrium represents the best overall outcome for society; i.e., the price or quantity of a good can’t be changed without making someone in society worse off. If we consider the above example, decreasing the prices of apples would likely lower the supermarket’s revenue. On the other hand, increasing the prices would make the apples too expensive for some households. In financial markets, the concept of efficiency refers to the rational use of information. In 1970, economist Eugene Fama developed the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). According to this hypothesis, financial markets are efficient because all new information is immediately reflected in the value of financial goods, much like stocks. If Apple presents a new, exciting product, investors capitalize on that information and buy shares in the company, which drives up the value of its stock. The rational use of information causes prices to fluctuate in random, unpredictable patterns, because new information continues to appear unexpectedly. Markets are considered efficient because they use resources in an efficient way and produce optimal outcomes for society. But is the EMH realistic? Do investors use information in the most efficient way? In a 2009 study, economists wanted to find empirical evidence for the EMH. They analyzed how information affected the price level of more than 900 stocks over a period of two years. One key statistic they were investigating was the volatility of prices. Volatility describes the fluctuation in prices within a given period. If the price doesn’t change much, volatility is low. If it changes a lot, it’s high. They also investigated the relation between, on the one hand, the volatility of the observed stock prices, and on the other, information, such as news announced in publications like The New York Times. If the EMH were true, the volatility of stock prices would rise immediately after important news announcements, and stocks would stabilize when they reach a price that reflects its new value. In contrast, if there is no news coming up, the prices should remain fairly stable.   What did their investigation reveal? In fact, the results of the study contradicted the EMH. In their examination of stock volatility, they discovered that a change in price levels stabilizes much more quickly if it occurs following some news, than if it happens after no news at all. Why? Basic human nature. When we don’t know why something is happening, we panic. If people can’t observe an obvious cause for the fluctuation of their stock price, they lose their nerve and sell. In contrast, when there’s a clear, observable cause for price fluctuation – say a company announces liquidity problems – the stock prices will drop as well. The defining difference here is that investors know the reason for the drop in price – they have all the information they need. The result is that they don’t become as nervous, allowing prices to stabilize more rapidly. The EMH claims that price changes of financial goods are caused solely by information. In reality, however, that’s not the case. And even if it were, do people actually use information in the optimal way all the time? At the basis of the EMH is the assumption that people are consistently rational. However, this is far from the truth. Richard Thaler, an economist from the University of Chicago, placed an ad in the Financial Times, inviting people to play a simple game. Participants had to choose a number between 0 and 100. The winner? The one who chooses the number closest to two thirds of the average of everyone else’s choice. What would be the best choice? It is 0. If all guesses average to 50, then 33 is actually the best guess. Thus, a lot of people might decide to choose 33 instead of 50. However, that will make 22 the best guess. So, if you carry this through to its logical end, you’ll eventually see that 0 is the optimal answer. If we lived in a world where people consistently used information rationally and optimally, everybody would choose 0. Of course, in Thaler’s game, that didn’t happen. The average of all guesses was 18.9, with the winning entry being 13. In fact, it’s questionable whether absolute rationality can exist at all. When we carry a supposedly “rational” process through to its logical conclusion, we observe an absurd chain of events that reveals rationality to be an illusion. Let’s say that the price of a stock you’ve invested in is falling rapidly, and you’re therefore thinking of selling it. But before making a decision, you have to carry out research, gathering information, so that you’ll ultimately be able to take the best course of action: to sell up or hold onto your stock. If you were a fully rational creature, you’d spend the optimal amount of time on research and then make a decision. But how can you possibly know what that amount of time is? To determine it, you’d have to decide how much time to spend on thinking about the optimal amount of time for research – which presents the problem of how much time you should take for that step. As we’ve seen, economic models assume people to be completely rational. However, people don’t behave rationally all the time and it is even debatable whether pure rationality exists. In 2007, the world witnessed the beginning of a major banking crisis, which destroyed a great deal of money. Even though there are countless expert economists out there trying to make sense of our economy, almost none of them anticipated the severity of this crisis. In an effort to ensure that we’ll never be as blind to such possible outcomes in the future, and thus to help us prevent similar disasters from reoccurring, economists are constantly testing their knowledge of the market. In one example of this, researchers created a virtual model of the economy. First, some hedge funds (organizations which invest money) were created to invest in stocks. In addition, these funds competed for investors who would invest in the fund that promised the largest return. Second, these hedge funds could borrow money from banks in order to increase their returns. This tactic is leveraging – when you invest with borrowed money in addition to your own. Third, these banks restricted the leveraging of hedge funds. To do so, they used a ratio that helped them to determine how much money hedge funds could borrow by looking at how much money the funds already have. If the ratio is 15, a fund could borrow 15 times as much money as it currently has and invest that. In this simulation, leveraging increases the efficiency of the market. It enables hedge funds to borrow a lot of money that they can then invest, and because of this the stock prices stayed close to their realistic value. The problem is that leveraging also makes markets less stable. In studying their virtual model, the researchers observed extreme events happening more frequently with “high leveraging.” If a stock price drops, it essentially reduces the money that a fund possesses. This forces hedge funds to sell off some of their stocks, thus driving the price of these stocks down also. In turn, this price drop might force other funds to sell their stocks, resulting in a selling race that can destroy a lot of wealth. In conclusion, leveraging makes markets more efficient but less stable. And markets that are unstable cannot be described as being in equilibrium. Today, computer algorithms play a major role in our culture. They’re hard at work gathering data while we fritter away time on Facebook, and they even play Cupid for many people looking for their perfect match. It’s unsurprising, then, that algorithms are an integral part of contemporary stock trading. Designed to buy and sell mispriced stocks, such algorithms analyze market data and, on the basis of the results, decide whether or not to sell. This enables traders to turn a large profit by trading massive volumes of that stock. This practice is known as High Frequency Trading (HFT) and it makes stock trading much cheaper. And though HFT is quite rare, it has a great impact on the economy. In 2010, for instance, even though less than two percent of firms that were actively trading were engaged in HFT, it nevertheless accounted for 73 percent of the total volume traded. And because the efficiency of the algorithms used massively increases the demand for stock trading, HFT actually drives down market prices. But there’s one problem: HFT decreases the stability of financial markets. For instance, in May 2010, US stock markets experienced what is now known as a flash crash. HFT algorithms sometimes have an emergency system that automatically sells stocks when a stock price drops below a certain threshold. This happened on a large scale in 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average index dropped 9 percent within 10 minutes. Some stocks lost their value, causing the emergency system of some traders to kick in and automatically sell stocks. This resulted in a chain reaction in which more and more emergency systems kicked in, automatically selling a tremendous amount of stocks. Although the stock markets quickly regained their value and were back to normal 30 minutes later, the damage was done and many investors lost a lot of money. Much like leveraging, HFT is an example of an instrument that, on the one hand, helps people to drive down stock prices, and on the other, places market stability at risk. These examples reveal serious flaws in conventional economic thinking. So, how could we improve it? One way is to look towards scientific understanding in other fields, to see what it might teach us about our economy. What do major earthquakes and market crises have in common? They’re both extremely difficult to predict. The basic mechanism behind earthquakes is pretty straightforward. While two tectonic plates slide together, one plate gets forced under the other. The resulting friction causes the plates to stick together and store a massive amount of energy that is released when the plates finally slip: the earthquake. And yet, as straightforward as that may seem, no one was able to predict the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in terms of its timing, location and magnitude. The same is often true of economic crises: even though we’re able to understand why and how it happened, only a handful of people predicted the recent global economic crisis which began in 2008. But the similarities don’t end there. Just like extreme earthquakes, devastating market crises occur less often than moderate ones. Throughout history you can find extreme economic crises occurring with regularity, but less frequently than minor crises. And strong earthquakes happen less often than weak ones. Moreover, even the aftershocks of earthquakes and stock crashes are similar. Following an extreme market event, such as the global crash of 1987, the probability of big market movements decreases over time. For instance, the stock prices fluctuated greatly immediately following the crash, but these big fluctuations occurred less often as time passed. A very similar thing happens after major earthquakes: the likelihood of the occurrence of an aftershock is higher immediately following the quake, and decreases proportionally over time. For example, on the first day after an earthquake the chance of an aftershock is 50 percent. By day 10, however, it’s as low as 10 percent. Although they’re different phenomena, earthquakes and economic crises share astonishing similarities – so many, in fact, that economists might benefit from studying research in the field of earthquakes to apply to their own field. What’s the best time to go to a bar? When it’s quiet enough to get a seat? Or when there’s enough of a crowd to create a good atmosphere? Rather than making rational decisions, people tend to rely on theories and strategies, a phenomenon that was illustrated by a puzzle created by Stanford economist Brian Arthur. Imagine a bar that would be very popular with students. The bar, however, is very small, so if more than 60 percent of the students go, it will become overcrowded. In this scenario, it would be better to stay at home or to find some other form of entertainment for the night. Let’s now assume that none of the students can discuss their decision with each other beforehand, and that everybody has to decide simultaneously whether or not to go to the bar. In order to decide, students would likely come up with a theory or two, like, “If it was crowded last week, a lot of students won’t go this week.“ Or, “If it was crowded two weeks in a row, it’s likely to be crowded again this week.” After running a virtual simulation of students using various strategies to make a decision, Arthur noticed something interesting: the weekly attendance quickly averaged at about 60 percent, but it was never stable. Rather, it always fluctuated around this number. This demonstrates that a situation can be highly static – every week, students have to make the same decision – and still not arrive at a state of equilibrium. Arthur’s discovery can help us to make economics more realistic. Compared to the equilibrium theory, in which supply and demand will over time become equal and create a stable equilibrium, Arthur’s bar example represents a more realistic model of the economic world: There’s no such thing as a stable equilibrium, but prices will fluctuate unpredictably around a certain number, sometimes even resulting in rallies and crashes. Peer pressure: we’ve all experienced it. Whether we like it or not, as social creatures, we tend to conform to the influences of those around us. In 1951, US psychologist Solomon Asch ran an experiment. He asked people to say which of three lines of different lengths matched the length of another line. The lengths of the three lines differed so much that the correct answer should’ve been obvious. But when the participants overheard the same wrong answer being given repeatedly, many of them also gave the same wrong answer. This process of conforming is an automatic and unconscious one. But social influence doesn’t merely cause us to conform in our behavior. Surprisingly, it also involves a shift in our perception. In one experiment, researchers investigated what happens in people’s brains when they’re confronted with other people giving the same wrong answer to a question, similar to the Asch experiment mentioned above. The researchers found that the social influence of other people shifted people’s perception: rather than merely conforming to a social “norm,” the participants actually saw what the other people saw. There was activity in the brain region associated with sight, and no activity in the brain region associated with decision-making (which would have to be the case if they’d consciously decided to conform). Since social influence plays an important role in decision-making, it should be incorporated into economic theory. Scientists could run economic simulations, similar to the leveraging simulation mentioned in the previous blink, in which they investigated how leveraging made the market more efficient but less stable. They could include social influence as a factor in these simulations: What happens if player A influences player B? What if it’s the other way around? Since social influence so strongly affects our decision-making and behavior, it should be integrated into economic models. If we’re able to predict the weather, could it be possible to do the same for the economy? Thanks to modern computers and simulation algorithms, it’s possible to forecast the weather with a high degree of accuracy. Take the two supercomputers at the heart of Reading’s European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts. These computers analyze a virtual atmosphere: by taking different meteorological aspects into account, such as air pressure, they simulate possible scenarios. By simulating and analyzing all kinds of possible scenarios, these supercomputers can forecast wind, temperature and humidity at more than 20 million points from the earth’s surface. The global economy is far more complex than the weather. Yet, because of the incredible power of modern computers and algorithms, it’s possible that we could use a similar approach for analyzing and forecasting the economy. Researchers could collaborate and oversee massive simulations that replicate dynamic interactions among the world’s largest financial players. Computers would calculate and test scenarios taking into account factors like leveraging, risk, density of interconnection, different financial transactions or social influence, in order to evaluate weak points or the resilience of a financial system. But this would require the collection of tremendous amounts of data. How could we possibly source it? Luckily, we’re now at a stage where we can install data-collection technology in many everyday objects. Mass data collection may be most useful in analyzing how we interact. From our smartphones we can now track our daily lives: for example, we could link data of our location, browsing habits and communications to special patches, which, when attached to our body would record our hormone levels. With this data, we’d be able to analyze all manner of human behaviors and learn about the force which directs the economy the most – us. The key message in this book: Modern economics is fundamentally flawed. It relies on assumptions that are anything but realistic, essentially diminishing the validity of its concepts and models. By looking at discoveries in other scientific fields, such as psychology or physics, economics might develop and thus, capture more precisely what is happening in our economy. Actionable advice: Look beyond the field of economics to find answers to the most pressing economic issues. Researchers in the field of economics should take discoveries of important related fields into account in attempts to advance economic theory.   Suggested further reading: Economics: The User’s Guide by Ha-Joon Chang  Economics: The Users Guide lays out the foundational concepts of economics in an easily relatable and compelling way.

Kotlikoff, Philip Moeller and Paul Solman","summary":"What do you think of when you hear the words “social security”? Most of us will be thinking of poor retirees, struggling to live on tiny state pensions. We think that if we want to be comfortable in our old age, we must invest in the stock market, or buy bonds. Anything to avoid surviving on social security. And yet, this view is completely wrong. When we get close to the age of retirement, social security will be worth far more to us than our savings or investments, if we play it right! But how do you pull that off? These blinks will show you why multiple divorces will help you when it comes to retirement age; why, if you can, you should wait as long as possible before claiming; and just how many conditions there are in the social security rule book. If you look back a hundred years in many countries, reaching old age meant economic strife, because people who were forced into retirement lost their incomes and struggled to survive. Those who didn’t have family or friends to support them were faced with frightening prospects, even starvation. So why don’t we experience this problem any more? Because of two little words: social security. At present, social security has expanded into a massive enterprise. In 2014 it paid over $812 billion in benefits while accommodating 180,000 visitors for consultations and 450,000 phone calls daily. But isn’t social security just for poor people? Absolutely not, it’s for every tax-paying citizen who invested in it and everyone who is entitled to should reap its benefits. Why? Because income from social security is safe. You could lose your home to a mortgage default, your investments could plummet in value, but social security is guaranteed to retain value. For instance, over the two decades between 1991 and 2011, the average US investor actually incurred a net loss after accounting for costs and inflation. But over the same period, social security grew – it’s designed to increase with inflation. So social security is a safe investment, but there’s a problem. It can be confusing and people often find themselves perplexed as to what they’re entitled to. For example, the social security system abides by 2,728 core rules. For married couples alone, the formula for calculating the benefit of each spouse consists of ten complicated mathematical functions! Not just that, but social security staff aren’t exactly the most helpful. In fact, they can only provide you information, never advice. So how can you be certain to get what you’re entitled to? Social security is best understood from the bottom up and that means learning the basic terms and calculations of the system. For instance, while you can file for social security at age 62, your Full Retirement Age – or FRA – when your benefits are the highest, depends on when you were born. Since most people retiring today were born between 1943 and 1954, they have an FRA of 66. But you don’t have to take social security upon reaching your FRA. You can keep working until 70. In fact, for every year after your FRA that you don’t accept social security you’ll accrue a Delayed Retirement Credit, or DRC, of eight percent interest! Now, who’s eligible for social security? Anyone who worked a social security-covered job for 40 quarters of a year in total. If you meet this requirement you can collect benefits not just for yourself, but for your spouse or dependants too. The amount you receive is based on the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings, or AIME, the average of your 35 highest annual incomes adjusted for inflation. But for years that you weren’t covered by social security your income will be considered $0. Therefore, the more years you work a social security-covered job, the better. For example, a person earning $50,000 a year for 40 years is better off than one earning $100,000 for 20 years. Because the first person’s data amounts to earning $50,000 a year for 35 years while the second’s amounts to earning $100,000 a year for 20 years and $0 for 15 years. So, you’ve reached FRA and you start collecting social security. You’ll receive what’s called the Primary Insurance Amount, or PIA, a figure based on a system wherein the more you earn, the progressively less you get in social security. For instance, for the first $826 of wages that your AIME marks, you’ll receive 90 percent back in social security, for anything between $826 and $4,980 you’ll get 32 percent and for anything higher you’ll get 15 percent. Did you know that your social security eligibility changes depending on how many times you were married? Many people don’t. But even if you were never married it’s key to understand some general guidelines. The first rule to maximizing your social security is patience, because the longer you wait, the more you’ll collect. For instance, any benefits you claim before reaching your FRA will be reduced. But it’s not just benefits from your work that you’re trying to maximize, spousal benefits are 43 percent higher at FRA than when collected at age 62, and benefits taken by surviving relatives are 40 percent higher at FRA than at age 60. However, there are limits. Neither of these benefits increase further between your FRA and age 70. The only additional money you accrue during this time is a result of your rising retirement benefit. The second rule is to take all available benefits. These could be from your spouse and even your ex-spouse. But first it’s key to know what you’re eligible for. For example, to receive spousal benefits you must have been married for at least one year, while for ex-spouse benefits you’re required to have been married for ten years. And remember, it doesn’t matter whether you were married a decade ago as long as you meet the requirements. A simple jog of your memory could unearth a gold mine! Finally, rule number three is to get the timing right. Why? Because you can’t collect two benefits at once. Therefore, good timing is essential to reaping certain benefits while letting others grow. For instance, if your spousal benefit exceeds your own, you’re only entitled to that from your spouse. For this reason it’s often a good idea to collect your spousal benefit upon reaching your FRA, while leaving your own benefit to grow bigger. But don’t jump the gun – filing for any benefits before reaching FRA requires you to take all that are available to you. So be sure to wait for that magic age! Have you planned for the future? Are you going to settle down and get married? While most of us make decisions like this based on love, it might be in your best interests to consider how life decisions can affect your social security benefits. For example, spousal benefits can be a major source of income if you handle them correctly. In fact, a spousal benefit can amount to as much as half what your partner would receive upon reaching FRA. It doesn’t even matter if they filed for benefits earlier as long as you wait for FRA to collect. Here’s how it works. To get spousal benefits your spouse must first file for social security, which as you now know is best done upon reaching FRA. Once your spouse files they can suspend collection of their social security, thereby letting it accrue value and allowing you and your dependants to enjoy what you’re entitled to. However, life isn’t always so simple and sometimes you need to take retirement before reaching FRA. This is especially true when your spouse needs the money in advance of their retirement age. But this doesn’t mean settling for a considerably smaller benefit, as long as you use the stop–start strategy. How? Start by claiming your benefits early; you’ll receive a smaller amount but when you do reach FRA you can suspend your collection. This will let your benefits appreciate a few final years of interest before you reach 70. Unfortunately, despite the various combinations of benefits for spouses and dependents, like children or disabled relatives, there is a limit. It’s called the Family Maximum Benefit or FMA, a collection amount which, once passed, results in reductions to your various sources of social security until you collect less than the FMA threshold once more. Say you’ve been married for almost ten years and decide you want a divorce. While some things just aren’t meant to be, if you wait the few extra months to reach that magic decade you’ll be thanking yourself for years to come. But that’s just one way your marriage choices can affect your social security. Actually, social security might even incentivize you to get divorced. For instance, when married couples claim benefits, only one is entitled to spousal benefits. However, divorced couples who were married for at least ten years can both claim spousal benefits. Not just that, but claiming your ex-spouse benefit does not require your ex-spouse to file for social security as your current one would have to. As long as you’ve been divorced for more than two years, your ex-spouse only needs to turn 62 for you to cash in. However, to get the most you’ll need to know how much your ex earns. Unfortunately, if you’re not on good terms with them it will probably be hard to get the accurate information you need and you can’t rely on the social security companies because, due to privacy regulations, they’re barred from divulging this information. But divorce and marriage can affect your social security in other ways. For example, every time you remarry you lose the benefits you’re entitled by your previous marriages. However, if you get divorced again you’re once again eligible for all ex-spousal benefits. So remember, if you want to claim ex-spousal benefits, divorce is the only option. That is, until you reach age 60, at which point your current marriage no longer affects the benefits of your prior ones. Another thing to keep in mind is the importance of survivor benefits, to which you’re entitled after nine months of marriage. The amount you can collect is based on the PIA of your deceased spouse. So make sure you get the benefits that ten million surviving spouses did in 2013! Hang in there, you’ve nearly mastered social security. There are just a few more details you’ll need to receive maximum benefits. One such detail relates to the circumstances around same-sex marriages. For instance, if the marriage was officiated in a state where same-sex marriage is legal, but the social security filing made in a state where it’s not, the benefits will be put on hold. In fact, unless the status of gay marriage in that state changes, it will be turned down entirely. So, to ensure you collect the social security benefits you are entitled to via your same-sex partner, it’s essential to file in a state that has legalized same-sex marriage (although thanks to the Supreme Court decision of June 2015, this may have changed!). But even if you receive benefits you may be required to pay taxes. For example, in cases where your combined income, meaning your non-social-security income plus any tax-exempt interests, such as you would get from government securities, plus half your social security benefits, totals over $25,000 per year, or $32,000 for joint filers, you’re required to pay federal income taxes. The rules get even more complicated if you had non-covered income, meaning income that did not pay into social security. For example, for work done in or for foreign countries. In such cases, even if you have worked enough to be eligible for social security, it is likely that you’ll not receive a high amount if you also have a pension or other benefits from a non-covered role. This is because of the Windfall Elimination Provision, a rule that results in decreased social security for people with non-social-security pensions who didn’t work covered jobs for at least 30 years. But having these kinds of non-social-security pensions also limits what your spouse is entitled to. For this reason, it’s essential to be cautious about non-covered earnings and pensions to Get What’s Yours! The key message in this book: Social security is an important source of income for retired Americans and essential to ensuring that you spend your last years in peace. But to make sure you reap the full benefits you’re entitled to you’ll need to take a professional and well-timed approach.  Actionable advice: Don’t gamble your retirement. Some people think it’s wise to take their social security benefits early and invest them, assuming that the reduced payments they receive will be easily replaced by their appreciating stocks and bonds. But the fact is, the average investor loses often and you don’t have the time to spare. So keep your money in social security where it’s safe. Suggested further reading: Millennial Money by Patrick O’Shaughnessy Although technological advances have made it easier than ever to invest in the stock market, today’s Millennials (young adults born between 1980 and 2000) tend to be risk-averse. But this kind of thinking is misguided. Given that benefits like Social Security and retirement pensions are imperiled, it has never been more important for young people to start investing in their future financial security. Got feedback?

And it’s true: rich countries are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. However, it’s wrong to proclaim that things are bad and only getting worse with each successive generation. In fact, the average quality of life is at an historical high. People might not be equally wealthy in all parts of the world, but wealth might not be everything that matters. In the following blinks, you’ll learn: why our average quality of life is steadily getting higher and higher, why there is no one method to help a country grow its wealth, why pessimism is not the only possible answer to current global economic development, and what we can do to make the world an even better place. Most people know that there is not only an income gap within economies but also across different countries. But do you know how large this gap actually is? Here’s a fact that’ll shock you: around 1 billion people in the world live on less than a dollar a day. But how is this possible when Western countries have developed so much over the past fifty years? One reason is that there has been a forty-year stagnation in African incomes since the 1960s. For example, Senegal had an income per capita of $1,776 in 1960 and $1,407 in 2004. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the United States, in contrast, was around seven times greater than in Senegal in 1960 and around twenty-six times larger in 2004. And while the average rural Zambian can expect to earn an approximate lifetime income of about $10,000, the average resident of New York City will earn $4.5 million. Another reason why the gap is so large is that rich countries have always grown more rapidly than poor countries have. In fact, the richest-poorest gap between countries grew from around thirty-three-fold in 1950 to around 127-fold today. For example, in 1850, the Netherlands was the richest country in the world, with an income per capita of $2,371. In 2008, income per capita in the Netherlands was $24,695, while in that same year, in Congo-Zaire, income per capita was only $249. Or consider India in the 1990s: in 1993, India's bottom 40-percent had an income comparable to that of an English peasant in the 1400s! Now that you know more about the actual gap between the richest and poorest countries in the world, you understand how lucky you are if you live in one of the richer countries. Did you know that economists do not have a master plan for launching poor countries toward sustained economic growth? This is because economic growth theories simply do not work. The main problem is that economic growth theories generally assume all countries work alike. But in fact, most theories do not accurately fit the evidence on the ground, and therefore don’t tell us much about the causes of economic growth. Let’s take a look at the relationship between investment and growth. Countries often see high investment and low growth, or low investment and high growth. But if we look at Zambia, according to an early “investment-to-growth“ model, the country should be rich by now: considering their high investment rate from 1960 to 1994, by the end of the period they should have had a GDP per capita of around $20,000 – but in fact it was only $600. Another reason why economic growth theories are weak is that it’s way easier for us to locate causes for our current wealth in the past than to make strong statements about even medium-term future growth. A final problem with economic growth theories is that the cause of economic growth in one country is unique to that particular country. This is because economic growth is a highly complex, context-dependent phenomenon; so complex even that economist Francisco Rodríguez argues that there is only one valid scientific paper with empirical merit that can be written using cross-country growth data. All this paper would state is that the answer to the question, “What causes economic growth?” is not “X” or “Y,” but – “It depends”! When even economists don't know how to foster economic growth, it seems like the only way out for poor countries is trial and error. But does that sound satisfying to you? Have you ever considered that most of us today are living lives that our ancestors only a hundred years ago couldn’t have even imagined? In fact, when we look at almost any measure of quality of life – except income – we observe rapid and massive worldwide progress. This observation is true for measures of health, education, civil and political rights, access to infrastructure, communication and culture. For example, since 1960 the global average infant mortality rate is down by half and the number of people who say they are happy has been rising everywhere. Furthermore, between 1970 and 1999, the literacy rate in Sub-Saharan Africa has doubled, from less than one-third of the population to more than two-thirds. And in only forty years, between 1962 and 2002, life expectancy in the Middle East and North Africa has increased from around forty-eight years to sixty-nine years. And this development isn’t just happening in specific parts of the world – quality of life is increasing around the world. In fact, there is a growing equality in quality of life across countries. Not only does today's global population share the highest average level of health at any point in history, it also shares the most equitable distribution of good health at any point in the last few hundred years. And there has been a close to universal increase in global average life expectancy, from around thirty-one years in 1900 to sixty-six years by 2000 – a statistic that holds even in the poorest of developing countries. So next time you grumble about your quality of life, think about how amazing it is to live today and not in the Middle Ages! Did you know that the good life has never been less dependent on high income than it is today? Why is this the case? Because the global supply and demand of technology and ideas have reduced the costs of living. A vital technological factor for the global decrease in the costs of living – as well as the threat of widespread famine – is the improvement in agricultural productivity. This has led to food prices falling by approximately 50 percent in the second half of the twentieth century. And access to sufficient calories has become so inexpensive and easily available that even in low-income regions, obesity is becoming an epidemic. Another way our quality of life has been recently improved is by the global spread of certain ideas concerning hygiene, practices that have helped radically improve people's health at a low cost. For example, programs that encourage people in developing countries to add small amounts of bleach to their drinking water have helped reduce diarrhea cases by 50 to over 80 percent. And oral rehydration with a solution of sugar, salt and water has effectively treated cholera, and prevented deaths from other causes of diarrhea. On top of these improvements, the cost of a good life is still declining. This is due to governments improving the delivery of services such as education, health care and access to political organizations. And in the future, new technologies and ideas will make services like these even more accessible and affordable. Most people think that income growth is the central factor when it comes to measuring development. But aren’t they forgetting about the development of quality of life? In fact, income growth is not the best indicator of progress. This common misconception is due to the confusion of economic growth with “development.” Development is better measured in terms of quality of life, such as life expectancy, education or political liberties. For example, in 1870, the life expectancy for someone living in a country with an income of $300 per capita was one-third of that of a person living in a country with an income of $30,000 per capita. But by 1999, even though incomes hadn’t changed, the life expectancy of the poorer country had increased to half that of the richer country. This shows that even though income is an important factor for development, it is not the central factor. So if development is about more than just economic growth, what is it exactly? What we really want from development are improvements in health care, education and security, while income is only a means to those ends. And despite still existing global economic disparities, we are getting there: humanity has never been in better shape than today, and is still getting better. For example, rates of absolute poverty have fallen dramatically on a global level, and infant mortality has become a rarity while life expectancy has significantly risen. This means that if we want to get an accurate picture of human progress, we need to set aside our pessimistic prejudices and take a broader view of “development” and the good life. If there is no golden rule for economic development, what rules are there for creating economic policy? The answer is simple: policies should be centered on developing quality of life. However, some people worry that focusing on quality of life can damage long-term economic growth. In fact, even though improvements in health care, education or political rights may not immediately lead to economic growth, there is at least some evidence for these elements affecting economic results over a longer period of time. For example, the reduction in child mortality that results from improved health care leads to a reduction in birth rates. The resulting demographic transition toward more adults per child can then be linked to better economic performance over the medium term. But even if these policies fail to promote economic growth, they are still a great success if they lead to an accelerated progress in quality of life. For example, supporting governmental structures allows for the better dissemination of knowledge about health and hygiene. And a quality education leads to more opportunities in life. Above all, policymakers should avoid policies that call for sacrifices in quality of life in the name of rapid income growth. This is because we do not have knowledge we can trust about growth-inducing reforms, and because fundamentally, income is only a means to an end for a better quality of life. For example, history shows that extreme economic philosophies, such as communism or neo-liberalism, that are centered around rapid economic growth actually have a relatively low impact on long-term economic growth. So even if there is no golden rule for economic growth, there is one for economic development in general: policies should aim at quality-of-life progress. So what can be done on a global level to help accelerate the trend toward better quality of life, without disrupting global markets? The rich countries should promote useful trade, migration and military policies. For example, since migration is the driving force for overall income convergence within countries, it is indispensable to follow reasonable migration policies and allow a freer flow of people across borders. The global community should also try to achieve on a global level their nationally acknowledged universal beliefs, such as providing a peaceful society, solid infrastructure, quality health care and education. On a national level it appears to be a widely unquestioned principle that we should reduce inequality, and facilitate access to universal goods such as health care and education. And since the logic guiding such principles doesn’t just stop at any border, everyone around the world should also be allowed to engage in healthy, sustainable and productive activity. Furthermore, just like on a national level, the costs for ensuring such a state of affairs would be remarkably lower than the benefits. Importantly, a certain level of uncertainty regarding the best approaches to improving our global quality of life should not prevent us from doing our best to help. However uncertain we are about the most efficient way to do this in developing countries, this does not diminish the imperative to act. For example, a dollar spent on another flat-screen TV may not have any impact on the wellbeing of a child in the United States. But we do know the likely impact of a dollar spent on an insecticide-treated bed net on the health of a child in Africa: a better life. The key message in this book: Contrary to common belief, we have actually made serious progress toward improving quality of life on a global level. This becomes clearer when we accurately measure development not by income growth but by quality-of-life improvements. Therefore, even if we do not understand how to foster income growth, we can still improve the world by supporting programs that develop quality of life. Or as the author puts it: “Humanity has never been in better shape – and despite growing challenges of global sustainability, the future should be even brighter.” Actionable advice: Put things into perspective. Next time you start worrying about the world, think of the immense overall progress in quality of life we have already experienced. Invest your money where it’s needed. Before you spend your money on stuff you don't need, think about supporting the poorest countries in the world – and improve quality of life for those people instead.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

With so many different social and cultural factors involved, it’s tough to predict what exactly will generate positive responses. But these blinks can help. They’ll show you some important characteristics of hits and outline some strategies that help a product stand out. Once you know more about what makes a hit, you’ll be one step closer to breaking into the mainstream. In these blinks, you’ll find out why repetition is so important; how awards can actually diminish your popularity; and what happened to the laugh track. Meandering through an art gallery or museum, you might assume that you’re seeing the cream of the crop when it comes to works of fine art. But the reality is that things become popular for plenty of reasons besides their actual quality. Just take the paintings of Claude Monet. Many of them, like The Japanese Footbridge, depict ponds filled with colorful water lilies. These water lily paintings are world famous, with museumgoers forming small crowds around them just to catch a glimpse. Now compare this popularity to that of another impressionist painter, Gustave Caillebotte. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. held a special exhibition of his paintings, in which the gallery described him as a relatively unknown French impressionist. This description was accurate, since few people had heard of him. But despite this lack of name recognition, Caillebotte’s work is incredible. His paintings depict nineteenth-century Paris in an exquisitely delicate impressionistic style. In his own time, around 1876, he was seen as one of the most innovative impressionists around. In other words, Caillebotte’s work was at least on par with Monet’s, but Monet became famous while Caillebotte remains obscure. Why? Simply put, it’s because of exposure to an audience, which is a fundamental ingredient in popularity. In addition to being an artist, Caillebotte was himself an art collector who was fond of the work of his impressionist friends. Three years after his death in 1894, some of the paintings in his collection were displayed in the first large exhibit of impressionist work at the Musée du Luxembourg. Among them were several paintings by Monet, Degas and five other impressionists, but none of Caillebotte’s own works. As a result, the seven impressionists chosen for the exhibit rose to recognition and remain famous to this day, just because they were thrust into the spotlight at the right moment. For most people, a bullet train or a soda fountain doesn’t conjure thoughts about the history of design. But behind every object lies a story, and the history behind these sorts of objects in particular has much to tell us about the ways people perceive and consume everyday goods. The common factor between them is Raymond Loewy, a French orphan with a talent for drawing who single-handedly brought modern design to the United States. When Loewy arrived on US soil in 1919, he found inspiration in the modernist buildings of New York’s skyline. In just two decades, he channeled this inspiration into a project to redefine American design. He produced plans for trains and cars in sleek, aerodynamic shapes, as well as classic objects of American culture like the Lucky Strike cigarette package and the first ever Coca-Cola soda fountains. In producing these hallmarks of design, Loewy was abiding by what was then an undiscovered recipe for good design: a combination of familiarity with more exciting or novel characteristics. In so doing, Loewy developed the first theory of what people like and, therefore, what becomes fashionable. His findings led him to a principle he called MAYA, or most advanced yet acceptable. The idea is simply that people are drawn to two things in an object. First, they like things that are typically recognizable, and second, they grow weary of overly familiar things. Because of this, he reasoned, successful designs are those that strike a balance between these two aspects, a notion that has been confirmed by subsequent studies. For instance, Paul Hekkert, a Dutch professor of design and psychology did a study in 2011 on why people like or dislike various objects. In the experiment, he had participants rate objects like cars and phones in terms of their typicality, novelty and overall aesthetic appeal. Unsurprisingly, the study found that people prefer objects that encompass both typical and novel elements. As an example, while Loewy’s train designs were clearly recognizable as trains, the streamlined, bullet shape of his locomotives set them apart. When you stumble upon a new song that you love, do you find yourself listening to it on repeat? You’re not alone. Human taste in pop music gravitates toward repetition. In fact, 90 percent of the music people listen to is music they have heard before. You need look no further than the Billboard Hot 100, which tracks the popularity of music in America, to know that once a song becomes popular, it stays popular for months. But this desire for repetition doesn’t just materialize in binge listening to a new hit single; it also means that people seek out songs with something familiar about them. This familiarity lets people predict, to some extent, how the tune will go and makes them feel good. Now you’re probably thinking, why don’t people get bored of all that familiarity? Well, because of the way human brains are wired, slight variations are sufficient to popularize a repetitive musical pattern. Funny enough, this is a trait humans share with mice, and experiments on these rodents can explain the human attraction to repetitive music. If you play a mouse a B note, it will pay attention initially and, as it gets used to the sound, will stop listening. But if you add a minor variation to the sound, say a C note, the mouse will become suddenly alert. The C doesn’t just grab the mouse’s attention, it also makes it so that when the tune goes back to B, it keeps listening. This single variation is sufficient to break the mouse’s complacency and return its interest to the music. In the experiment that proved this, the most effective pattern for keeping a rodent’s attention was BBBBC-BBBC-BBC-BC-D, which is uncannily similar to the structure of successful pop songs that follow a pattern of verse-verse, chorus, verse-chorus, bridge. In this way, the human taste for music is much akin to that for design objects; as long as they contain a slight variation, people are profoundly drawn to repetitive and familiar sounds. A few years back, the model, actress and athlete Geena Davis was watching a children’s TV show with her daughter and was appalled by what she saw. Davis realized that popular culture readily enforces sexism, a tendency that’s particularly pronounced in the American entertainment industry. So, in 2009, Davis, along with the entertainer Madeline Di Nonno, founded the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which endeavors to explore and expose the ways popular culture promotes sexism. Between 2010 and 2013, the foundation studied 120 recent movies that enjoyed popularity in the United States and abroad, focusing especially on the gender roles of the protagonists. The foundation found that under a third of the thousands of protagonists it studied were female, and female lead actors only appeared in 23 percent of the films. When it came to film characters with powerful business positions, things got even worse. Out of such characters, just 14 percent were female, which unfortunately reflects the current gender ratio of CEOs in the United States. Similarly, when films depicted scientists or government officials, just 12 percent were women. Simultaneously, women were regularly depicted in sexualized clothing – twice as often as men, in fact. And comments on their good looks were five times more common than for their male counterparts. One obvious explanation for these clear trends is structural; Hollywood is a male-dominated industry and men occupy the vast majority of powerful positions, like those of producers and directors. But beyond that, sexism is actually popular with audiences. Audiences rate movies lower when they feature women who act in stereotypically masculine ways or men who act in feminine ways. And therein lies a major downside of popularity: it favors and often reinforces biased views of differences like gender, rather than actively challenging them. Authorities and peers can have a big impact on popularity. If an authoritative or famous person calls something popular – boom, it is! Likewise, some Facebook pages look popular, but they’ve been artificially boosted by fake likes. The good news is, this kind of manipulation only goes so far. Even the most adept marketing won’t be able to convince an audience to buy a poor-quality product, or, for that matter, a work of art that’s entirely at odds with their sensibilities. For instance, Lady Gaga’s album Artpop received a scathing rating on an initial test release done through the website SoundOut. Nonetheless, her label refused to be deterred and aggressively promoted the album, which went on to sell poorly compared to her other hit albums. It just goes to show that audiences have some autonomy from marketing. That being said, popularity might not actually be that desirable; in fact, it can actually deter people from desiring a product. For instance, the market researchers Balazs Kovacs and Amanda J. Sharkey conducted a 2014 study of book reviews on goodreads.com. They found that books that had earned awards were not as highly rated as those with no formal accolades. Why? Well, books that have received awards produce higher expectations from readers, but they also attract readers who might not have chosen a book of that style in the first place. This broader audience, with inflated expectations, is set up for disappointment. The experiment also uncovered a more surprising discovery: when books become too popular, say after receiving an award, a backlash is unleashed against them. Basically, once a book attains a certain level of popularity, some people decide that it simply can’t be good if that many people like it. The book loses its exclusivity and no longer appeals to the snobbish taste of discerning readers. So, popularity has its downsides – but it also rarely lasts forever. You’ll learn why in the next blink. A priest and a rabbi walk into a bar. The bartender looks at them and asks, “what is this, some kind of joke?” Did this make you laugh? If it did, science can explain why. One of the reasons people find things funny is that they violate expectations, but in a nonoffensive way. At least that’s the conclusion drawn by the sociologist Peter McGraw in his 2010 book, Benign Violation Theory. According to McGraw, people laugh the most at jokes that contradict their expectations, but without being overtly politically incorrect or otherwise unacceptable. For instance, the question that the bartender asks in the joke above surprises the audience, while also avoiding treading on sensitivities related to religion. Beyond that, people are more likely to laugh at something if they perceive others as doing the same – in other words, when it’s popular. After all, others’ laughter is a sure sign that a joke is both funny and acceptable in a particular social context. And that’s why the laugh track was the true star of American TV in the 1960s. The laugh track, an effect that plays the sound of laughter at key moments in a show, was invented by Charles Douglass in the 1950s, readily making punchlines feel popular and, therefore, safe. That being said, in humor, as in other arenas, popularity can fade away – and the laugh track again provides a good example. In the twenty-first century, this motif has all but vanished from TV shows because, at a certain point, it failed to add any humor. TV series used be like theater sketches and, in this context, a laugh track to punctuate the scene was absolutely appropriate. But as shows became more cinematic, creating the illusion of an alternative reality, laugh tracks only served to disrupt the illusion. In other words, since the world is always changing, popularity is fickle and virtually impossible to control. Many a star would sell his soul, along with that of his grandmother, if he knew it would cement his enduring popularity in the public eye. Ultimately, however, popularity isn’t something that can be controlled – at least not entirely. In the end, chance plays a major role in determining the appeal of any given thing or person. Just take Duncan Watts, a Microsoft computer scientist who studied the reactions of thousands of interconnected people to a new product by way of a simulation in a model universe. In Watts’s simulation, two elements were used to decide whether a product would become popular in a given population: vulnerability, or how open people are to trying something new, and density, how well connected each person is. For instance, a hermit might be extremely flexible and feel ready to try all kinds of new products, but since she comes into contact with very few people, she’s unlikely to influence other people’s opinions of these products. After setting these factors, Watts ran the simulation a number of times. He found that points of vulnerability and density easily led to cascades, wherein information rapidly moved from point to point, lighting up the entire network. That being said, such cascades were incredibly rare, occurring in only 0.1 percent of cases. So, even if all the ingredients are perfectly measured, the success of a product depends on various other uncontrollable elements. It’s this sheer randomness that means yesterday’s flop can easily become tomorrow’s hit. This is precisely what happened with the song “Rock Around the Clock.” When it first came out on the radio in 1954, audiences didn’t much care for it. But a year later, the song made its way into the soundtrack for the film Blackboard Jungle, a revolutionary movie about an interracial school. The movie took off and the song did along with it, eventually earning its place among the most famous rock ‘n’ roll hits of all time. The internet is awash with sudden, and often puzzling, instances of popularity. For instance, who would think that audiences would go wild for a potbellied man singing and dancing to a song like “Gangnam Style”? We all talk about videos like this going viral, but the truth is actually a bit different. In fact, the entire notion of a viral hit is a myth. According to the theory behind this supposed phenomenon, if you produce something with enough appeal, a single internet user can share it, prompting a landslide of further shares and ultimately incredible popularity. But in reality, this is never what happens. In 2012, scientists at Yahoo were studying how content spreads on platforms like Twitter, and found that 90 percent of tweets don’t get shared at all. Not only that, but out of the 1 percent that did get shared more than seven times, not a single one in their study actually went viral. What’s at play instead is the power of broadcasting. In other words, rather than moving from person to person, content that actually spreads like wildfire is moving from a single, well-connected source to thousands or millions of people. Obvious examples are large sporting events like the Super Bowl, which is viewed by around 100 million people, or major online news sites that have audiences of similar sizes. Because of this mass base, when the New York Times publishes a spinach pancake recipe, it’s sure to reach a huge audience. People go on to talk about it and assume that the recipe went viral. But the reality is that a single, extremely powerful broadcaster has just fed the information to millions of people. It’s just one more example of how there’s no perfect recipe for popularity. Sure, you can seek greater exposure and work to generate innovative yet familiar ideas – but in the end, chance and sheer interconnectivity will always be important factors. And remember, popularity isn’t necessarily all it’s cracked up to be; some of the greatest feats of human creativity will never be recognized by the mass audiences they deserve. The key message in this book: There’s a science to popularity, but it’s not an exact one. While factors like exposure, the proper balance of familiarity with novelty and the influence of repetition can explain the appeal of many popular people and things, in the end, sheer chance plays a key role in determining what people like, and what makes it into the mainstream consciousness.

Other Asian countries – such as Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines – have attempted to follow in their footsteps. However, the economic growth achieved by the latter was only sustainable for a short period of time. So what was it that made these economies develop so differently?  To achieve successful development, there are certain steps that states can take – and they must be taken in the right order. After all, we learn to walk before we run. Now we will explore these steps and policies and see how a state can be transformed into an economic powerhouse.  In these blinks, you’ll find out why financial deregulation can be harmful for economic development; why farming is actually less efficient on large scale than a small one; and why South Korea promoted three different car manufacturers on their small market. For a long time, Asia lagged behind the West’s technological advances. But then Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and, most recently, China, started to catch up and have now transformed into economic powerhouses. How did they do it? Successful Asian states promoted small-scale household farming instead of moving prematurely to large-scale farming. Household farming maximizes output by effectively using the available labor force, while large-scale farming generates few jobs and low agricultural output. This may seem counterintuitive at first, as huge farms appear to be the most efficient method of agricultural production. However, unlike in the manufacturing sector, increasing scale in agriculture doesn’t create higher output or better quality. Only fertilizer and intensive labor can improve yields and quality. What’s more, the mechanization that comes along with large-scale farming can be harmful in poor countries because it reduces the amount of farming jobs available and the yield each plant can produce. Mechanization only makes sense if labor is scarce, which is typically not the case in poor countries. In fact, human labor-intensive techniques are crucial to getting the highest yields possible.  For example, shade-tolerant vegetables like celery can be cultivated in the shade of taller plants, which makes it possible to grow more within the same area – but this requires planting and harvesting by hand. Such techniques create agricultural outputs that dwarf those of machines and large-scale farming.   Promoting household farming also has other positive effects: it creates jobs in developing countries. Since the industry and service sectors are not strong in poor countries, the labor force has no other employment alternative than agriculture. That’s why it makes sense to have an agricultural sector composed of household farms that offer lots of jobs until better alternatives of employment come along. So how exactly do you promote household farming? First you need to solve the problem of land: Who owns it and who needs it?  The solution is land reform: the redistribution of land among the people. Let’s look at some countries where land reform helped successfully develop their economies. Take Japan, where, after World War II, the US-backed regulation was struggling to gain popular support, in part because of the unpopularity of the American forces themselves. Wolf Ladejinsky, an agricultural adviser, had the answer: as a witness to the Russian Revolution, he understood that land reform was crucial to creating support from the working class. And his input led to surprisingly radical legislation. At its center was a maximum three-hectare limit for farms. This meant that wealthy landlords had to turn over their excess land, which was then redistributed among poorer farmers. As a result, by the early ’50s, rural output and consumption had grown above pre-war levels, and economic inequality was considerably reduced. Another example of a successful land reform occurred in Taiwan after the Chinese civil war, when the defeated Kuomintang government was forced to flee to the island state. By 1953, advised by American policy makers, they decided to seek more popular support by implementing land reform. The results were staggering. By redistributing land worth the equivalent of 13 percent of the country’s GDP, the amount of farmers who possessed their own land rose from 30 percent in 1945 to 64 percent by 1960. At the same time, the Gini coefficient – the standard measure of inequality, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 perfect inequality – improved from 0.56 at the beginning of the 1950s to 0.33 by the mid-1960s. Following these land reforms, gross output of foodstuffs increased by half in Japan, and three-quarters in Taiwan, which created a stable economic base for further growth. You might be thinking: successful modern economies can’t be based solely on agriculture, right?  Right. But agricultural policy is the starting point of development. Once the foundation of a strong agricultural sector is created, the economy can shift toward more value-adding industries.   In fact, the next logical step to developing an economy is boosting the manufacturing industry. Why?  There are two reasons why promoting manufacturing industries like steel, cars and textiles is the best policy to create growth – after all, it’s much more effective than trying to enhance the service sector. First, manufacturing does not need a highly educated workforce because it relies heavily on machines that can be used with minimal training. Second, manufactured goods trade more easily on the global market than services, which often require the free movement of labor. That said, the manufacturing industry can’t grow without some help. In fact, a local manufacturing industry needs to be protected before it can become competitive. In developed countries, many people believe that all you need to generate wealth is competition, which is promoted, for example, through free trade. However, apart from offshore financial centers like Hong Kong or Singapore, no country has become a worldwide contender through free trade alone. In fact, many economic giants like Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom used protectionist policies, i.e., policies that protect an industry against competition by limiting imports, to nurture their early industries until they were strong enough to face global competition.  They did this for a good reason: when industries are sheltered from global competition, the companies can imitate and improve foreign technologies until they’re able to produce competitive products themselves. This holds true for developing countries today, and while free trade should be a country’s ultimate goal, it’s only feasible once its manufacturing industry has been developed. It’s clear that a developed economy doesn’t emerge overnight. It takes decades, if not centuries, of careful planning and action.  So where does the journey begin? First, the government must actively invest in the manufacturing sector. For example, Japan’s industrialization began in 1870 when the government started a number of pilot factories in basic manufacturing industries like silk reeling, mining and cement. Both machinery and professional workers were imported to bring the companies up to international standards.  Their first goods were mostly poor imitations, inferior to Western products. However, they served the local economy’s needs and, after being sold to private entrepreneurs in the 1880s, most of the pilot companies started generating profit.  The second step is when the manufacturing industry starts to stand on its own two legs – at which point the government needs to use legislation to support entrepreneurs. For example, it might be necessary to lift import duties on certain goods to ensure an industry gets a necessary supply of raw materials – even if that damages local economies by exposing them to foreign competition. In Japan, this step was taken when the entrepreneur Shibusawa opened a giant steam-powered cotton mill in 1882.  It was the biggest investment ever made in the Japanese cotton industry and signposted the arrival of economies of scale in Japan. The government supported Shibusawa by lifting import duties on raw cotton, thereby sacrificing the interests of local cotton farmers, who were then at the mercy of global competitors. But this decision boosted Japan’s economy overall: the Shibusawa mill singlehandedly ended Japan's chronic trade deficit, and by 1914 cotton textiles accounted for 60 percent of all Japanese exports.  In the next blink, you’ll learn about the third factor of a successful industrialization policy: export discipline. We’ve seen how important it is to protect new local companies from international competition. But companies eventually have to reach a stage of maturity when they can survive on their own.  This process takes a long time, and successful governments have to keep spurring companies’ development through two key measures: promoting exports and building domestic competition.  For example, countries like Taiwan and Japan promoted exports by subsidizing the companies that exported the most.  But South Korea took things one step further. It gave companies access to bank credit depending on how much they exported. Companies that didn’t export enough lost all state support. They were thus forced to merge with their more successful peers or go out of business altogether.  South Korea also knew it needed domestic competition to prepare its companies for the world market. When it started its car industry in 1973, South Korea ensured vigorous competition by setting up three private firms to compete in a domestic market of only 30,000 cars per year.  Other Asian governments who ignored the importance of competition did so at their own peril.  Take Malaysia, which let a state monopoly supply its much larger domestic market of 90,000 cars a year. At first, things seemed fine – but the gulf between the competitive and noncompetitive nations eventually became clear. During the ’80s and ’90s, Asia experienced its “boom years” of high growth. This concealed the lack of a competitive industry in certain countries. But when a financial crisis shook the Asian world in 1997, the Northern countries, which had bolstered export and competition, recovered much faster than the Southern countries, like Malaysia and Thailand. Despite having similar GDP levels at the end of World War II, today Korea and Taiwan have GDPs per capita four times larger than Thailand and Indonesia. We often hear economists lobbying for financial deregulation – but is this always the best policy? If deregulation is premature, it can actually undermine the government’s ability to develop a competitive technological industry.   Consider the case of Malaysia, which deregulated its stock exchange in 1989. As a result, money crucial to the development of the economy was instead diverted into speculation: banks were quick to lend money to high-earning speculators, leaving little money for businesses requiring loans. Indeed, a study in the 1990s by the central bank found that Malaysian companies could only obtain a very small fraction of the financing they needed from banks. Due to insufficient support from the financial sector, technological development and a world-class manufacturing industry became nearly impossible.   Other countries were wiser, regulating their financial sector to direct money to the right causes.  In Japan, Korea and Taiwan, the state maintained control over the financial system during crucial phases of development and limited financial speculation. Banks were given incentives to invest according to the government’s interests, with central banks giving discounted loans to banks to facilitate exports or upgrade technology.  Despite the fact that financial systems were still quite wasteful and inefficient, these incentives were enough to ensure that the most important projects were financed. Under certain circumstances, early financial deregulation can even work for upcoming states. Singapore and Hong Kong are two such exceptions. Their location makes them perfect shipping hubs, and because of their small and concentrated population, they don’t require a lot of jobs that could only be provided by manufacturing or agriculture. Instead, they could concentrate on building financial services and trade from the start. Let’s use what we’ve learned, and look at China’s development. For a long time, China’s economy stagnated because of two communist policy mistakes:      First, the communists believed agriculture was only efficient at mass scale. But the process of collectivization led to widespread famine and 30 million people died from starvation. Secondly, they wanted to be self-sufficient, but didn’t understand that trade was necessary to develop their manufacturing industry. By limiting international trade, China was cut off from the foreign technology it required to develop its industries. This all changed when Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping kick-started China’s progress with three development strategies other northeastern Asian states had already used: First, he gave peasants more autonomy by reinstating household farming. Under Mao, farmers had received compensation for meeting a quota of produced goods, but there was no reward for exceeding this quota. But Xiaoping implemented the “household responsibility system.” In this system, quotas were reduced and farmers were allowed to sell their excess production on an unregulated market. This new system led to a massive boost in agricultural output: today, Chinese rice yields are among the highest in the world.  Second, he helped develop competitive products by opening China up to international trade and technology. It began in 1980 when China made a deal with the power company Westinghouse, which allowed the company to share the technology necessary to start producing basic turbines in China. Today, the three biggest thermal turbine producers in the world are Chinese companies. Finally, he took control of the financial institutions and invested in development. Nowadays, almost all banking assets in China are owned by banks run by the state. And the three policy banks established in 1994 – the Export-Import Bank of China, the Agricultural Development Bank of China and the China Development Bank – are still the main forces driving development policies like export discipline and agricultural output through their investments. Does China’s economic shift mean it’s about to become a rich industrial country?  Not quite. There are still big problems to solve in China. For one, it depends too much on state-controlled businesses. State companies have shown they can thrive in industries where technology – such as thermal turbines – evolves predictably. But modern consumer markets need a higher level of flexibility.  For example, the state runs many large automotive companies. But, instead of developing their own cars, they rely on foreign joint ventures for new designs and technology that consumers desire. And because the state-owned companies flood the market with cars developed by foreign companies, China’s private automotive manufacturers like Geely and Chery struggle to develop their own popular products. Before the country can truly thrive, it needs to start supporting and protecting its own firms. Another big problem is the high income gap between rural and urban areas. On average, an urban income in China is three times larger than a rural one, whereas in northeastern Asia the two are roughly equal. The government has already implemented some policies to tackle the problem. In 2006, local governments were banned from levying taxes on farmers and subsidies to farmers were increased. Also, a stimulus program invested heavily in transportation, medical, educational and farming infrastructure in rural areas. These seem like steps in the right direction, but the income gap hasn’t decreased since the policies were implemented. One reason might be that peasants don’t own their land in China, making them reluctant to invest in and develop their farms, and their incomes do not improve. They also can’t sell their land for a profit. What’s worse, the government can always terminate the farmer’s contract and repossess their land if deemed necessary, leaving the farmer high and dry. If China really wants to reduce the income gap, they’ll need to take land reform to the next level, and allow farmers to own land, following in the footsteps of Japan and Taiwan. The key message in this book: To kick-start economic advancement in developing countries, governments should promote household farming, build a competitive manufacturing industry and harness the power of the financial sector to benefit the economy as a whole.

Or why brands you saw all over the place not too long ago seem to have vanished into thin air? Cell phone manufacturer Nokia and photography company Kodak spring to mind. Just where have they all gone? How the Mighty Fall explains why some companies go from massive success to crushing failure. The author argues that the failure of successful businesses isn’t due to the changing economic climate or bad luck, but to their leaders who steer them in the wrong direction and exacerbate crises through mismanagement. The book is based on years of research on successful and not-so-successful businesses. It follows the best-selling works Built to Last and Good to Great, and shows you what type of leader a business needs, and what kind it definitely needs to avoid. In these blinks, you’ll learn why nobody has a Nokia anymore, where it’s OK to make a hole in a boat and why one company tried to launch a product a day! In the first few centuries after the birth of Christ, the Roman Empire dominated Europe and the Middle East. It was massive, stretching from Portugal in the West to Iran in the East. Among those alive back then, there would have been no doubt: this gigantic, all-powerful empire would last forever. Alas, it did not: within just a few centuries it was gone, banished to the trash heap of history. The decline of the Roman Empire shows that, no matter how vast or successful something is, it will always be in danger of collapsing. But what causes decline? What can make a huge entity come crashing down? The decline of a large organization is always self-inflicted: collapse isn’t the fault of outside factors or bad luck; it’s the direct result of mismanagement. Remember how everybody had a Nokia phone 15 years ago? In the years since, the company has gone from being the market leader to having a mere 3 percent market share. Why? While their competitors, such as Apple and Samsung, were researching and innovating in smartphone technology, Nokia’s management decided to innovate in other, less profitable areas. Thus, when smartphones became popular, Nokia was completely out of the race. At this point, it’s important to point out that we’re not talking about laziness. Successful firms very rarely collapse because they fail to act: usually it’s because they act in the wrong way. In fact, failing firms often show very high levels of innovation and energy. Bank of America is a great example of this: in the 1980s, the bank was eager to update outmoded practices. They hired a young, energetic CEO, they closed huge swathes of loss-making branches and they ended the practice of hiring people for life. Yet throughout this period, the company posted some of the most spectacular losses in banking history. You may or may not be familiar with Greek tragedy. In Greek tragedies, we often find the heroes in trouble after succumbing to hubris, i.e., they’re so overly confident that they strive for too much and end up failing. But the ancient Greeks aren’t unique in their susceptibility to hubris: successful companies also run the risk of letting their confidence get the better of them. Take cell phone manufacturer Motorola. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, Motorola enjoyed a period of fantastic success and their annual revenues rocketed from $5 billion to $27 billion. A success which led to massive overconfidence and big mistakes. One such mistake was the development of the StarTAC cell phone. The StarTAC had a problem: it used an analog system at a time when other phone manufacturers were starting to go digital. Instead of stopping production of an outdated product, Motorola succumbed to hubris: it pushed on with StarTAC, boasting that “43 million analog customers can’t be wrong.” Of course, the phone failed and Motorola’s market share plummeted from 50 percent to 17 percent. Another danger from overconfidence is arrogant neglect, i.e., when companies lose interest in their core business. When companies become successful, they often look to branch out from their main market into new areas. Sometimes their desire is so strong that they forget about what brought them success in the first place. This is what happened to Circuit City, a consumer electronics corporation. After achieving a lot of success, they started exploring other markets, from selling used cars to renting DVDs. In order to be successful in these areas, they invested a lot of time and resources – so much so, in fact, that the consumer electronics business was left to rot. Losing this main area of business hit the company hard, and it eventually went to the wall. Why do successful companies fail? Is it out of laziness? Actually, most of them fail for the complete opposite reason: they try to be too innovative and grow too quickly. When companies push for unsustainable levels of innovation, they fail to maintain good business practices, such as keeping costs down or concentrating on profitable markets. And a company that forgets the basics can never succeed. Household items manufacturer Rubbermaid is a great example of this. Once declared by Fortune magazine to be America's \"most-admired company,\" it has since fallen out of popularity. Rubbermaid was admired for its high levels of innovation, yet the company took it to an extreme, aiming to introduce one new product to their range per day: a strategy that led them to create nearly 1,000 new products in just three years. But all this innovation came at a cost. In pushing so hard for new products, they totally lost control of their costs and constantly failed to meet their orders. Their lack of discipline undermined their innovations and they suffered a rapid decline until they were eventually taken over by a rival.    Companies can also overreach by looking to grow too fast. This is especially dangerous for publicly listed companies with lots of shareholders to please, often under immense pressure to chase profits as quickly as possible. For example, before the financial crisis of 2008, banks chased quick profits at all costs. This led them to borrow heavily, invest in risky, yet highly profitable products, and ignore costs. While striving for growth in this way brought them short-term rewards, overreaching left them massively at risk in the long term. When the system failed in 2008, many of them incurred major losses and some even went bankrupt. What do we do when someone criticizes our heroes? Do we take their comments into consideration? Or do we ignore their criticisms and continue to believe our heroes are perfect? Usually, when someone tells us something we don’t want to hear, we shut out their views and put our rose-colored glasses on. Companies can also fall into this trap. And in their case, ignoring valid criticisms can lead them to gigantic mistakes. This is what happened to Motorola. In the 1980s, the company was a huge force in the cell phone market. At the time, cell phones were very expensive and wouldn’t work in certain locations. Motorola thought they had the perfect solution: a satellite phone that would work anywhere. Over the next few years, they started developing a satellite phone named Iridium. But, as they were developing it, the quality of normal cell phones grew and their cost plummeted. It soon became clear that the quality of a cell phone would far outclass Iridium. So what did Motorola do? They put on their rose-colored glasses and ignored the criticisms. When Iridium finally came out, it was pricier and lower in quality than the competition and, not surprisingly, it failed. In total, the project cost Motorola $2 billion, most of which could have been salvaged had they stopped it when they had the chance. However, ignoring criticism is just one way that companies fail to deal with bad news. Firms also seek to blame their own failures on others. The best way for any company to deal with bad news is to use it in a constructive, practical way. Yet so many firms don’t do this. They prefer to simply blame their situation on outside factors and continue on the wrong path. If you’ve ever been on a sinking boat, you know that the natural response to crisis is panic. It’s also the response most business leaders have when decline sets in. Which, in turn, can lead them to make rushed decisions that only deepen the crisis. One such response is to search for the silver bullet, or one sweeping solution that will solve all problems. Many firms think that the best solution is to do something completely different from the way they’d always done things. For example, they try to implement a new, unproven technology or change the culture of the business – or even look for a new market altogether. Although these sweeping changes sometimes provide a short-lived boost, they’re rarely able to reverse the decline. A great example of the use and failure of a silver bullet can be seen by the actions of Hewlett Packard (HP) in the 1990s. Faced with low growth, HP made sweeping changes to its business culture. First it got rid of its old, rather predictable CEO and replaced him with Carly Fiorina, a flashy, media-savvy figure who, through a series of advertisements and media appearances, sought to completely update the company’s image. She thought that a more modern-looking company would do better. But it didn’t work. Too much change actually caused the company to lose drive and focus. HP’s progress continued to falter and within a few years Fiorina was fired. But there is a more drastic solution to decline than the silver bullet: a company can simply give up. This is what happened to the once-proud company Scott Paper. After trying in vain to stop the rot, they ended up giving in. A new CEO was brought in to cut the company’s losses, which cost it 11,000 jobs, and what was left of it was sold to their archrival. So far we’ve seen what leaders do wrong to put their businesses in danger. Now we’ll look at what leaders should do to ensure that this never happens. We’ll start with the most important factor for making the best decisions: having the right attitude. The right attitude starts with admitting that you’re not as brilliant as you think you are. So many successful leaders think their achievements are purely down to them, a mindset that can lead them to become arrogant and single minded. Instead, leaders must always remember that success is at least in part due to luck. If they realize the role that fortune plays, it’ll help temper their arrogant behavior. The next step is for leaders to admit that there’s always more to learn. Leaders usually fall into two categories: knowing people, who think they know everything already, and learning people, who never stop asking “Why is this happening?” and “What can this teach me?” The most successful leaders are learning people. One example of such a leader was Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart. On one occasion, some Brazilian entrepreneurs came to him to ask about how to do business. However, their roles soon reversed and he ended up wanting to learn from them! Finally, a leader should never let hubris take hold, and instead remember where they came from. Only when leaders remember this can they stop their companies from overreaching: just remember the unfortunate case of Circuit City. There’s nothing wrong with entering new arenas and doing research on innovations as long as you stay focused on your core business: where your success came from. Taking risks is something all business leaders will have to contemplate in their careers, especially when their business is struggling. There’s nothing wrong with adopting a risky strategy as long as you remember that it might fail. When thinking about taking a risky strategy, you need to ask yourself, “What will happen if things go wrong? Will the consequences severely hurt the company or will we be able to recover?” A good way to understand what risks are worth taking is to consider the waterline principle. Imagine you’re on boat and a hole is blown in the hull every time you make a wrong decision. Whether the hole is above the waterline, where repairs can be made, or below it, where water will rush in and sink you, depends on the decision you make. You need to ensure that you only take risks whose damage you can repair, never those that will sink your boat. So, you now know that you shouldn’t take dangerous risks, but how do you know which risks are most dangerous? The general rule of thumb is to never make sweeping changes to how you do things. Risking massive alterations to your business strategy will only lead to instability and lack of focus. Remember HP: it hired a new CEO who made extensive changes to its culture and image, but the changes only led to stuttering performance as the company lost its business discipline. Instead of making big changes, you need to take small steps. If you have to take a risk, make it a small, manageable risk. If it’s a success, you can build upon it with another. When you’re in deep trouble and it seems like there’s no way out, the natural temptation is to give up and walk away. Companies in dire straits often feel this way, too, seeing surrender as the only option to their plight. But there’s no reason to react this way: a firm can turn things around until that fat lady starts singing. That is: if they act the right way. The first thing business leaders must do to reverse decline is adopt the right attitude. They need to believe in themselves and their company even if everybody else thinks they’re done for. Winston Churchill is a great example of someone who believed in himself when no else did. In the early 1930s, he found himself out of government, blamed for causing Britain’s poor economic position, and, to top it all off, he was suffering from depression. Everybody thought he was a spent force. Yet Churchill never gave in and, at the start of the next decade, he was the British prime minister and a war leader. The rest, as they say, is history. Bouncing back from failure doesn’t only depend on the right attitude but also a lot of hard work. Photocopying company Xerox did just that when they realized just how deep the trouble was that they were wading in: their stock value had dropped an incredible 92 percent in less than two years. And so, Anne Mulcahy came on board as the new CEO and immediately got to work. In four years, she didn’t take a single weekend off in the battle to make the firm profitable again. Her rigorous schedule and devotion to the cause eventually paid off: only five years after it looked like it was going under, the company posted an annual profit of $1 billion. The key message in this book: Any company, no matter how big and powerful, can experience failure and decline. And often, when decline sets in, it’s exacerbated by the company’s panic-driven actions. To avoid this, leaders must stick to good business practices, try to stay calm, and continue to do what the company does best. Actionable advice: Take baby steps. Whatever you want to achieve, never try and leap too far: you’ll have a much higher chance of succeeding if you advance step-by-step. Your failure is no one else’s fault. If something is going wrong, don’t ignore it or blame someone else: look at why it’s happening and see how you can solve it yourself.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Wells once said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.” Unfortunately, a strong understanding of statistics that would allow for “statistical thinking” still has yet to take root in greater society, making How to Lie with Statistics all the more relevant for today’s readers. In today’s world, our daily lives are saturated with statistical language: your OJ contains “26 percent more juice”; “four out of five doctors agree”; your toothpaste “kills 23 percent more germs,” and the list goes on. On the surface, these all seem like meaningful claims that offer you more information about the products and services you’re considering buying. But, as these blinks will show you, the truth is far more complicated because people can use statistics to their own advantage. In these blinks you’ll find out: why it may be safer to drive in bad weather, why one magazine failed at predicting the 1936 presidential elections, and why it’s so hard to count all the beans. Let’s imagine that you want to figure out how many red beans are in the bean barrels of Bob’s Bean Production Plant. The only way to know for certain is to dump out every single barrel of beans and count them all individually. But doing that is not only time consuming: it’s also incredibly expensive. Luckily, using statistics, there’s an easier way. In order to make statistical estimates, you need to create a sample, i.e., a carefully chosen data set used to represent the whole of whatever it is you want to analyze. And since sampling is the basis for drawing conclusions in statistics, creating a good sample is absolutely crucial. But for a sample to be “good,” it must possess two qualities: it must be large enough to be statistically significant and it must be random. We’ll address sample size a little later and focus first on randomness – because the only kind of sample that gives true statistical data is one that is purely random. For example, if you’re interviewing 25-year-old women about how often they play guitar, you would have to randomly select 25-year-old women regardless of their income, social class or anything else. But getting a truly random sample is easier said than done. Laborious and expensive as it is to “count every bean” by hand, finding creative ways to reach a truly randomized sample is also extremely difficult. Looking back to our barrels of Bob’s Beans, a good sample is easy to find if the beans are randomly mixed. You just pull out a handful and you have your sample. But what if the barrel wasn’t mixed and you take a handful from the top where only white beans are? If you’d based your sample on that and concluded that the barrel is full of white beans, you’d have fallen victim to sample bias. In the same way, non-randomized samples can bias an experiment or study. Knowing what we know now, how can we avoid biased samples without having to count “all the beans”? One way is to employ a strategy called stratified random sampling: First, divide your universe, i.e., the specific group of people you’ll be studying, into subgroups in proportion to their commonness. Pinpointing that proportion, however, is extremely difficult. For example, if your universe is comprised of vegetarians, how can you know what proportion of them are a particular race, gender or age group? Without an immense databank at your disposal, it’s difficult to know. Second, get a random sample within each subgroup. Have a list of possible interviewees from each subgroup, and then randomly interview people from your list of, for example, black vegetarians, vegetarians under 18, and so on. As weird as it might sound, it’s actually quite difficult to keep your sample truly random. For instance: How will you make contact with a random group of vegetarians under 18? Will you use email? Well, not all people under 18 check or have access to email. Will you call them? They don’t all have phones, either. Nevertheless, if you can’t achieve a random sample, your study will suffer from sample bias. Literary Digest learned this the hard way when they tried to predict the outcome of the 1936 presidential election by polling their readers, who had correctly predicted the past four elections. Readers said that Alf Landon would win, but it was FDR who ended up winning by a landslide. So why did the poll fail this time but not others? The answer lies in non-random sampling: the readers’ predictions were biased because the survey was only carried out over the telephone. This was important because, at the time, those who could afford Literary Digest and a telephone were mostly Republican voters, thus skewing their results. In order to produce a better survey, Literary Digest should have proportionally divided the subgroups within their readership, produced a random sample within each, and then used diverse methods to reach them. Imagine you’re looking to buy a new house and you run across a real estate agent eager to move you into his neighborhood. Hoping to entice you, he tells you that the average income in that neighborhood is $100,000 per year. A year later, he comes back to you saying that the average income is only $20,000 per year, even though wages stayed the same and nobody moved in or out of the neighborhood. So what happened? Is he a liar? Not precisely: he just used statistics to his advantage. His trick was to use different kinds of “averages” to change your perception. There are, in fact, three different types of averages: the mean, the median and the mode, and each is distinct. The mean, also known as the “arithmetic average,” is the one he used to come up with the “average” of $100,000. The mean is found by adding up all your variables and then dividing the total by the number of variables. In this case, our real estate agent added up the incomes of each family in the area and then divided them by the number of families to arrive at $100,000. So where did the $20,000 come from? This number was derived from the median, which describes the middle point in your sample. For example, the median of 1, 2, 6, 12 and 23 is 6, because half of the values are above 6 and half are below. Looking back at our neighborhood, if the median is $20,000, then half families have an income below $20,000 and half of them above it. The agent could have also used the mode, which describes the most common income in the area. If most families earn a yearly income of, for example, $22,000, then $22,000 would be the mode. As you can see, the word “average” isn’t as straightforward as we might think, so it’s always worth asking exactly which “average” people are talking about. In the first blink, we learned that our sample has to be large enough to be considered good statistical evidence. Because if a sample is too small, it’s not “statistically significant.” To get an idea of why that is, ask yourself what the probability is of getting heads in a coin toss? 50 percent, right? Now, find a coin and toss it ten times. How often did it come up heads? Five times? It’s possible, but unlikely. So why didn’t it come up heads 50 percent of the time as predicted? Well, because the experiment wasn’t repeated often enough; it became biased by chance. The more often we repeat the coin toss, the closer we get to the “real” probability of 50 percent. Therefore, reliable studies use a statistically significant sample in order to ensure that the outcome of the experiment or study is not biased by chance, like our coin toss. However, when studies fail to use statistically significant samples, they can succumb to significance bias and consequently produce sensational results. Yet, for those who want to impress us with new products or services, significance bias can be a useful tool. For example, you’ve probably heard things like “Users report 23 percent fewer cavities with XYZ’s toothpaste” before. But are these claims trustworthy? Even if they insist that the study was conducted by an independent third party, there is reason to be skeptical. Rather than create a controlled, statistically significant experiment, it’s very possible that they’ve simply used a small sample to get a good headline. Think about it: if you try out a new toothpaste to test its effectiveness against cavities, what are all the possible outcomes? Fewer cavities, more cavities or the same amount of cavities. If, after a period of time, the people in a study’s sample haven’t actually seen any improvements, then the researchers simply ignore the results and continue to conduct the experiment until the cavities heal by chance, thus rigging their experiment for the desired results. Have you ever heard something that was just too good to be true? The same thing can happen when we’re talking about statistics. Luckily, in statistics, you have an easy way to find out whether someone is trying to dupe you: just find the standard error. No measurement can be perfectly accurate because, as we’ve seen, it’s extremely difficult to “count all the beans” or create a perfect sample. We have to take into account the standard error, or the average imprecision of how our data was measured. In order to understand the nature of the standard error, imagine you’re taking an IQ test, where 100 is the accepted average IQ for human beings. Let’s assume you scored a perfectly average 100 on your first try, 110 on the second and 90 on the third try. Knowing that there is deviation each time you take the test, you’ll to need to find the standard error to gain the best understanding of your IQ. But how? Start with the average IQ. In this case, 100. Then add the deviation from each result to the average. For the first try, the deviation is 0 (100 to 100); for the second (110 to 100) and the third (90 to 100), it’s 10. You then divide your total sum of deviations (0+10+10=20) by the number of results (here, three) and voila: you have your standard error of 6.67 (20/3=6.67). But how is this helpful? We now know that all IQs ranging from roughly 93 to 107 are considered “normal” for you. In other words: your IQ is 100 +/- 7. As we learned earlier regarding statistical significance, this number becomes more precise the more often you test your IQ, and the same applies to anything that you want to accurately test using statistical methods, such as the national or even world “average” IQ for human beings. What do you do if you want to convince someone of something, but you just don’t have the proof? One way is to simply demonstrate something else as being true and then pretend it’s the same thing. This method, which statisticians sometimes call the semi-attached figure, is among the most common deceptions in statistics. Creating a semi-attached figure is fairly easy: you pick two or more things that sound the same – but explicitly aren’t – and draw a comparison between them. You can think of this as jumping over a gap in your argument in order to achieve a desired conclusion. Here’s a good example: if you want to sell a cold medicine, but can’t actually prove that it works, then simply publish your laboratory report demonstrating that half an ounce of your medicine killed 40,523 germs in a test tube in under seven seconds. Now all you need is a photo of a handsome doctor, and your advertisement is ready to go! Of course, your study did not demonstrate that the medicine actually works in the human body, or even that it wouldn’t kill your patients. However, to the untrained ear, your study might seem quite convincing! Or consider this: your local newspaper claims that there are four times as many fatalities on the highways at 7 p.m. than at 7 a.m. The implication is that it’s more dangerous to drive at 7 p.m., but is this true? No. There are simply more people on the highways to be killed. Another great way to deceive people with comparisons is to use percentages. All you have to do is “forget” to mention what you are actually comparing. For example, if you drink a glass of OJ with your breakfast that contains “26 percent more juice,” you might feel like you’re making a healthy choice. But what, exactly, is it 26 percent more of? Or if you use shampoo that “makes hair up to 60 percent shinier,” shinier than what? Are we comparing it to when you use rocks? Really, it could be anything. Not all statistical errors hide a malicious intent. Some errors result from simple misunderstandings, such as the post-hoc fallacy, which says that we often assume causal relationships between two things simply because they occur at the same time. However, just because two things happen simultaneously doesn’t mean that’s the case. In fact, when A and B happen together, we can’t necessarily know whether A causes B or whether it was the other way around. It could even be the case that both A and B are actually the product of some unknown factor, C! Nevertheless, in statistics, we often look for correlations, i.e., the degree to which things show a tendency to vary together, in order to explain the world around us. But these correlations can be demonstrably wacky. For example, you might notice that, recently, the ozone layer got thinner as the number of gay marriages increased. Does it make any sense to assume that one caused the other? To make matters even more complicated, there are several different types of correlations. One is entirely produced by chance: if you repeat an experiment enough times and with a small enough sample, you’re bound to produce the spectacular correlation of your choice eventually (remember the toothpaste example from earlier). Another type of correlation fallacy is covariation. Here, the relationship between two variables is real and demonstrable, but the direction (whether A causes B, B causes A, or A and B both influence each other) is either unclear or impossible to determine. For example, we know that wealth and stock ownership are related. But do people with more wealth buy more stocks? Or does buying stocks make you wealthy? Which influences which, and to what degree? There are other types of correlation-causality fallacies as well, but they all come down to one simple fact: correlation is a necessary argument for causality, but is insufficient on its own. By now, you should understand the basics of how to lie with statistics. But these “lies” are not always born of ill motives, and many statistical errors can be caused unintentionally by simple incompetence. That said, it’s still worth noting that most of these errors inflate and sensationalize statistics and their meanings rather than deflate and level them. So what can you do to defend yourself against bad statistics? First and foremost, ask yourself the right questions. Consider who conducted the study and what their motives might be. For example, studies conducted or sponsored by companies should always be scrutinized carefully because the companies are strongly motivated to produce results that favor them somehow. Second, you should be suspicious of both stated and unstated data. Be on the lookout for small or poorly selected samples, as we know they produce biased results. What about any reported correlations? Are their samples big enough to make them significant? Remember the coin-toss example and use your common sense: Does the study involve enough carefully selected participants? Did they pass over any important groups? Do the authors give you the standard error? Do they specify the types of average they’re using? If not, then something is aloof. The best case is that they simply forgot to mention this valuable information. Otherwise, you should be aware that someone might be trying to tinker with the results. Finally, watch out for a sudden change of subject. This could be something as simple as jumping from raw data to a conclusion without connecting the dots. Ask yourself: Do these numbers actually lead to their conclusion? Or is the person creating false causality? Unfortunately, it’s not likely that marketers, businesses and public relations experts are going to suddenly adopt a scientifically accurate, honest and ethical way of presenting information to the public. So it’s up to you to stay alert and ask the right questions if you want to keep yourself from getting duped. The key message in this book: Statistics is a powerful and complex tool that can easily be misused or misinterpreted to produce biased results. In order to keep yourself from getting duped by statistics, you’ll have keep a keen eye out for the tricks used to deceive us. Actionable advice: If there’s no sample size given, be suspicious! Samples are only useful if they’re statistically significant. If they aren’t, then the experimenters have free rein to manipulate the results as they wish by changing the parameters of their experiment until they’ve reached the desired results, thus allowing them to make sensational claims under the guise of scientific language.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

From Greeks suffering under austerity measures to Americans unable to get a housing loan to rising unemployment figures all around the globe, the crisis is still with us. How did we get here? Why was such risk allowed to build up in the financial system, and importantly, why didn’t anyone do something to stop it? These blinks help to explain the big mistakes and base greed which paved the way for the crash, and crucially, show why little was done to prevent us from flying over a financial cliff. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why communism actually raised living standards in capitalist economies; why it’s not wise to lend money to people who have no money at all; and why it’s perfectly acceptable to blame the bankers for the crash, after all! What caused the global financial crash in 2008? Although things like poor government regulations and financial greed played a role, to truly understand why the crash happened, we need to look at the bigger picture. The excesses of our modern financial system were born from a certain political climate that emerged after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Let’s look at the climate before the fall, to better understand what came afterward. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union represented two competing political and economic systems, capitalism and communism, respectively. And as it happens, the capitalist West actually benefitted from its conflict with the communist world. That’s because the United States and its allies were essentially competing in an ideological beauty contest. Capitalists and communists alike strove to persuade the world that their system produced a better way of life. Thus, capitalist systems supported by democratic governments did everything possible to show the advantages of their side. This led to unprecedented benefits for the middle and lower classes (groups not naturally favored by the free market), such as free education, steadily growing incomes, a strong welfare system and so on. But when the Berlin Wall fell, the communist system fell too and the beauty contest came to an abrupt end. And thus victorious capitalists no longer had to act as if they cared for the poor and dispossessed. In other words, there was no longer a political incentive to limit inequality. And so, the wealth of the people at the very top – the 0.1 percent – exploded. Since 1980, the average income for this group has jumped by more than 700 percent. And meanwhile, the income of everyone else stayed more or less the same. As we’ve learned, our capitalist economies have engendered increasing wealth inequality. But how did we come to adopt and champion such an imperfect economic system? Well, our form of capitalism – called Anglo-Saxon capitalism – was first implemented in the United States and the United Kingdom, where it produced such staggering wealth that it was soon adopted by countries all over world. Let’s dig a little deeper to understand what Anglo-Saxon capitalism is all about. Ultimately, this form of capitalism is based on the assumption that a pure and free market is resilient and self-correcting. Thus, proponents of Anglo-Saxon capitalism believe that there should be minimal government regulation, taxation or spending by the state – all to ensure that private firms (especially banks) are unconstrained in their pursuit of profit. The underlying idea: when it comes to making money, companies know best. And to a certain extent, this kind of capitalism works. The gross domestic product (GDP) of both the United States and the United Kingdom grew massively, and other countries sought to emulate such growth. Russia, Ireland, Poland and Australia all worked to deregulate their own markets and adopt the Anglo-Saxon capitalist system. As a consequence, the financial system too started to boom. Consider that from 1973 to 1985, financial services made up 16 percent of all U.S. corporate profits; yet in the past decade alone, financial services totaled 41 percent. How can we account for this? Without government regulation, bankers were free to invent new money-making mechanisms – and they did. Today, the financial industry no longer revolves solely around selling stocks and shares; rather, bankers deal with much more complicated and risky financial products. And we’ll find out all about these products – and what makes them so risky – in the following blinks. In the late 1970s, the banking system underwent a crucial change with the development of new, highly profitable financial products called derivatives. What’s a derivative? It’s basically the right to buy something – and you can sell or trade this right to someone else. For example, a farmer agrees to sell to you next year’s harvest for a certain price. Congratulations, you’ve purchased a derivative! Now, if the harvest is more profitable than expected, you’ve earned some money, since you agreed to buy the harvest below its actual value. However, if your contract to buy is higher than the actual value, you end up essentially losing money. This example is straightforward, but financial derivatives tend to be far more complex and thus, incredibly risky – potentially leading to huge losses. The credit default swap (CDS) – an insurance on debt – was one of these highly dangerous derivatives, and it was widespread in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Here’s how a CDS works. Let’s say Joe takes out a mortgage, and then the bank sells the debt to a trader. The trader buying the debt is taking on risk, because if Joe defaults, the trader’s investment will be worthless. However, if the trader takes out a CDS for an annual fee, then the loss will be protected in the event that Joe defaults. At this point, the CDS can also be traded; here, the buyer of the CDS would get the annual fee but still have the obligation to pay out. Ultimately, CDS contracts were incredibly risky as they were often packaged with other forms of derivatives, creating very complex bonds. Furthermore, these bonds were sold all over the world, spreading the hidden risks. After all, a buyer on the other side of the world would have no way of knowing whether the original mortgage borrower was likely to default! Derivatives changed the rules of banking by hiding risk and spreading it globally. While this was a risky strategy, if the original mortgage borrower pays back his loan with no problem, the risk for a credit default swap (CDS) derivative holder is minimal. Unfortunately, another risky practice succeeded in undermining this already risky system. Banks began to issue subprime mortgages, or mortgages for low-income individuals or people with poor credit scores. Let’s back up a bit. The financial system at the time was booming, yet it needed new fuel to keep growing at the rates that the equally booming financial sector was demanding. And that’s where subprime mortgages come in. In the past, risky mortgages like subprime mortgages were rare. But this changed for two reasons. One, the financial system was hungry for cash; and two, the proliferation of derivatives made it easy to sell debt. Thus people for whom it was near impossible to get a mortgage previously were now offered huge loans to purchase houses they really couldn’t afford. And to make matters worse, as subprime lending increased, another derivative came into existence in order to trade all this newly created debt: the CDO (collateralized debt obligation). CDOs work like this. First, debt from subprime mortgages was collected together into huge pools. Then the pools were spliced and mortgages with similar risk levels were collected together, creating packages which were then sold globally. So, what’s the problem with this practice? Well no one could possibly know whether the borrowers would actually pay back their loans. Since subprime mortgages were new, there was zero data on the level of risk. Yet bankers didn’t hesitate. They thought by trading CDOs, they were passing the risk to someone else. Thanks to a boom in subprime mortgages and CDOs, profits were flowing into the financial sector. Yet the good times led to more greed. Bankers became increasingly willing to try anything to keep the cash coming in, leading to predatory lending practices. Mortgage brokers would do anything to sign up new borrowers, whether they were capable of paying back the debt or not – and often at unusually high interest rates. These debts were then bundled into new CDOs, and sold. To understand just how underhanded predatory lending became, consider that Wells Fargo, America’s fourth-largest bank, systematically targeted African-American church members for subprime mortgages – even though many could qualify for better loans. Here’s the truly villainous part: in an effort to push these terrible mortgages, the bank even persuaded church leaders to encourage their congregations to take out subprime loans. But how could these practices be allowed? Subprime lending was like the Wild West: there were no rules. Before the crash, there were 250,000 mortgage brokers in the United States. And these people didn’t need a license or any qualifications at all to make contact with potential borrowers. Even worse, borrowers weren’t required to give any proof of income, and could apply for a mortgage using “stated income” – that is, a borrower could say anything and the broker would believe it. Unsurprisingly, in a 2007 survey some 60 percent of subprime borrowers said that they had lied about their income. And from this scenario, you can guess what happened. People defaulted on mortgages, and the housing bubble burst. And as all this risk was compounded and sold across the globe, no one was immune once it all came tumbling down. And yet, looking back, the folly of subprime mortgages and derivatives seems obvious. Why didn’t anyone realize what was happening and try to put the brakes on? So why didn’t anyone see the crash coming? There are two broad reasons. One lies with the mathematical models used in the banking system, and the other has to do with human nature. Starting with the models, it’s important to realize that banking is all about assessing risk. The financial sector hires thousands of mathematicians (called “quants”) solely tasked with building complex mathematical models to calculate risk. And although the predictive powers of quants seemed unimpeachable at first, their complex models and formulas failed to predict the eventual crash. To understand how badly they failed, consider that according to financial models created by analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs, a crash could only occur if there were “25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row.” That’s math-speak for, “It’s about as likely as winning the lottery. Twenty-five times. In a row.” However, the crash happened. So obviously the math was wrong! But where was common sense in all of this? Bankers aren’t stupid; everyone knew they were participating in risky practices. So why did they choose to ignore the risks? It comes down to biology. When we take risks, our cognitive understanding is limited. In other words, humans are not capable of acting completely rationally. In fact, as psychologist-economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have shown, our brains are hardwired to make certain mistakes when it comes to assessing risk. And it doesn’t help that the banking system is especially tolerant of risk, since risk is linked to higher profits. So while you may try to avoid risk at all costs, bankers see it as a path to potential profit. They actively seek it out and spread it through the system. And the faulty math? That just meant they could take even more risks. You may wonder, where were the rating agencies, and why weren’t they working to downgrade toxic debt, to keep it from spreading through the system? The unbelievable answer is that many of them simply didn’t want to. There’s a reason for this. The rating agencies were paid by the very same banks and investors whose products they were supposed to grade. Therefore, they had a strong incentive to ignore risk and hand out good grades, or firms and investors would simply go to a competing rating agency. So ultimately, it was simply more profitable for rating agencies to ignore the warning signs. And of course at this time too the market for subprime mortgage-backed securities took off, so there was a lot of money involved for rating agencies, too. In fact, an obscene amount of money, as the fee for rating CDOs was three times higher than what was paid for more traditional financial products, like corporate bonds. So business boomed for everyone. Moody’s, a leading rating agency, saw revenues double from 2002 to 2006. And so rating agencies gave AAA grades – the highest grade possible, one which was intended only for the most secure investments – to 90 percent of mortgage-backed CDOs. Did you miss that? We’ll repeat: Rating agencies claimed that financial products that were based on mortgages nefariously issued to uncreditworthy borrowers were some of the safest investments you could make. Many people blame the government for the financial crisis. While the government didn’t cause the crisis, it definitely could have prevented it by regulating the banking system. So why wasn’t there more government oversight of the banking industry? Part of the answer lies with the prevalence of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, nearly every Western government committed itself to the idea of free markets, and thus, the financial crisis was preluded by years of deregulation. In other words, the government let banks write their own rules. This was true even in the case of new, risky derivatives (like CDOs and CDSs) that might have been subject to government oversight. The banks preempted regulation by creating the ISDA – the International Swaps and Derivatives Association – which fought battles with governments all over the world. And eventually, governments gave up and industry won the right to regulate itself. Of course, the ISDA had an advantage over the government: legislators had almost no clue what derivatives were or how they worked. Financial lobbyists could tell the government anything, and officials had little choice but to believe them. In the end, banking lobbyists not only managed to bypass government regulations but also actually persuaded the U.S. Congress to pass a law forbidding any regulation on derivatives. It’s easy to blame the government, but to be fair – legislators simply didn’t understand the risks of these new financial practices. However, a few governments did manage to adequately regulate derivatives, and those governments were much better off in the period following the financial collapse. Canada, for instance, had far more financial sector oversight than most countries. And as a result, it was the only G8 country that didn’t have to bail out its banks. And in fact, Canada is a great example of a thriving economy without an unconstrained financial sector. Since 2004, Canada’s average income has risen by 11 percent; meanwhile, incomes in the United States rose by only 5 percent in the same period. The key message in this book: Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, free-market capitalism became the dominant economic system and the financial industry grew to massive proportions. At the same time, unregulated financial products transformed the banking system. Ultimately, questionable practices and irresponsible behavior facilitated an enormous build-up of risk, ultimately leading to financial collapse.

Developing nations face international pressure to establish free-market economies, democratize their governments and improve workers’ rights. These blinks show that Western leaders tend to preach one message of economic development, and practice another. Far from being the bastions of free trade and liberty, Western nations protected their economies from foreign competition and exploited their labor force. In short they built their economies by doing the “wrong” things. High employment levels and just political rights are ubiquitous aims, though arriving at those standards can have a detrimental economic cost on developing nations. In these blinks, we will examine why fair economic and political standards can come at the cost of wealth and power, and how some countries have attempted to close the gap between fairness and prosperity. These blinks will show: why Britain employed child labor much later than you think; why America wasn’t always a free-trade advocate; and what prompted women’s right to vote in Switzerland. What does the flag of the United States stand for? Along with liberty and democracy, one of the most common answers to this question is free trade and the free market. The United States often represents the image of free economic practices, unfettered by controlling government interference or high tariffs. Yet, despite this motto of free trade, the early history of the US shows it was actually governmental regulations that led to its prosperity and power. In the late eighteenth century, after a long struggle, the United States threw off British rule to become an independent nation. The new country faced many problems: its industry was undeveloped and weak in comparison to the European powers. The newly independent United States turned to the opposite of free trade: protectionism. This meant that any foreign product entering the country would be subject to a five percent customs duty. The policy kept the price of US products comparably cheaper, harboring domestic economic growth. Protectionism continued as domestic industry grew; in fact, the customs tariff climbed. In 1812, to pay for another war with Britain, it was increased to 25 percent. When the war ended a few years later, the tariff continued to climb – to a whopping 40 percent by 1820. Incredibly, protectionism policy continued well into the twentieth century. Before the Second World War, the US was considered to have the most protected economy in the world, second only to Russia. Although long-term protectionism may sound counter to modern economic ideals, it was undoubtedly successful. Protected behind the customs barriers, US industry grew to become the strongest in the world. Only when the US achieved this position of dominance did it open its borders to free trade. Britain’s naval fleet ruled the waters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, marking the small island’s status in world trade. How did this little, cold and wet island achieve such economic standing? As with the United States, the answer lies in the country’s adoption of protectionism. We have to revisit fifteenth century Britain to gain a deeper understanding of its protectionist strategy. At that time, England was a rather impoverished nation. Its main export was raw wool which it sold to the sophisticated textile industry of The Low Countries (modern day Belgium and Holland).  England had very little industry of its own. One English king, Henry VII resolved to change this. He wanted to build up England’s own textile industry and he realized that protectionism was the best way. So, beginning in 1489, he initiated laws protecting domestic industry. First, England poached skillful workers from the Low Countries who had years of textile experience. Then the export of raw wool (needed to turn into cloth) was banned, providing English manufacturing with the materials to succeed, simultaneously depriving foreign competitors of the raw material. Henry VII’s new laws effectively spurred the growth of English textiles. In fact, protectionism worked so well that Britain used it again in the eighteenth century to build its manufacturing industries. Through trade tariffs, the government encouraged the import of raw materials like cotton and iron ore and the export of manufactured goods, such as cloth and steam engines. Its policies effectively capitalized on the low cost of abundant imported materials and the huge global demand of manufactured goods, turning the small nation into a world-leading economy. Why do you think some countries are rich and others poor? The reason, according to many people, is because certain wealthy and more powerful countries are able to use their position to exploit and impoverish the others. Is this true? Well, if you look at the historical evidence it certainly appears this way. Let’s look at one particular example from the past which displays this unfair relationship between rich and poor. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Britain acquired colonies on the Eastern coast of North America. The British government resolved to use the resources of these colonies to make itself wealthy. The raw materials, abundant in North America, such as furs, tobacco and timber, were stripped domestically and sent for British manufacturers to use. Then at the same time, the colonists themselves were prevented from growing their own industries. For example, Britain outlawed the construction of rolling and steel mills in America. This act forced the colonists to specialize in more primitive, less profitable products like pig and bar iron, instead of high value steel production. Of course this benefited British steel manufacturers as it limited the competition. Thus, the colonies of North America were deliberately kept poor in order to grow the British economy. In addition to exploiting its own colonies, Britain used its power to also dominate other nation-states, forcing them to sign humiliating, unfair treaties. For example, by using its military might to defeat China in the Opium War (1839-1842), Britain forced the Chinese to acquiesce control of their customs duties. The British set the duties at cheap rates, allowing British goods to flood China, stifling domestic industry. We have now seen how Western nations grew rich and powerful through exploitation and protectionism. The next blinks show how those countries coach developing nations to grow through entirely differing methods. What do you think makes a country prosperous? Many will argue, democracy. It seems obvious: A huge proportion of the world’s most successful economies are democratic. Therefore, democracy must be a key factor, right? However, looking back into the past you can see that the link between democracy and economic development is unclear. For a start, when most NDCs (Now Developed Countries) such as the USA and the UK became economically powerful, they weren’t expressly democratic.   For example, in France between 1815 and 1830, only males over 30, who paid at least 300 francs in taxes, could vote. This limited the franchise to just 0.25 percent of the total population. Then, when voting rights were expanded in 1848, only males were given the vote. In most countries, this lack of women’s suffrage was common until relatively recently. It wasn’t until 1903 that Women could vote in Australia, 1928 in the UK and in Switzerland women were barred from voting until 1971. Yet, even when the right to vote was slowly expanded in the NDCs, the democratic process was hardly open or transparent. Take secret balloting. In order to make elections fair, who you vote for should be kept secret. Most of us take this for granted now, but in the past it wasn’t so. For example in Prussia until 1919, a lack of a secret ballot left voters at risk of bribery and intimidation. In France, it was only in 1913 that a voting envelope was used to protect one’s precious vote. So what does this tell us? That developing countries should be less democratic to get better economic results? No, of course not, but we must be aware that rich nations achieved success using methods we would frown upon. This way we can judge developing nation’s growth more fairly. The following blinks offer more examples of how western nations used undemocratic methods to build their wealth and power. How would you feel if, after spending your entire life building up a prosperous business, the government claimed it? It’s very unlikely that you would make the mistake of building a business again and society would lose its entrepreneurial spirit. In order to avoid this situation, Western politicians and economists argue for strong property rights. These rights legally protect someone’s property from seizure by the state. Property rights are meant to promote an entrepreneurial spirit: as entrepreneurs know that the rewards for their enterprise will never be stolen from them, they are incentivized to work hard.   However, if we look at how the NDCs developed their economies, we see that economic development doesn’t always require strong property rights. For example, take Britain in the eighteenth century. Over this century there was a huge advance in the sophistication and size of the British textiles industry. Behind this development was actually the government’s violation of property rights. Britain’s leaders took the common land, considered public domain, and gave it to private landowners, who then filled it with sheep.  It was this act of government “theft” that led to an increase in the supply of wool which fuelled the textile boom. And it is not only the violation of physical property rights that can fuel economic development; stealing peoples ideas, violating their intellectual property rights, can have the same effect. When the NDCs grew economically, the theft of ideas and inventions was liberal. For example, before 1852 the British government allowed its citizens to patent foreign ideas for their own use. This meant that if a German had a great invention, a British person could steal, manufacture and sell it in Britain, under the full protection of the law. So, although we might think property rights are crucial to economic development, the opposite has also been true. Certain working practices seem diabolically inhumane: forced 15-hour work days and child labor are two, for example. As a result, governments, charities and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) work to ensure a world free of such inhumane practices. However, although exploiting workers is condemned now, in the past it was not the case. In fact, the NDCs actually took advantage of such practices as they were developing. Take Britain, for example, the world’s first industrial power. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, British industry was reliant on the employment of children, both in the textile mills and factories, and in coal mines. Children working in the coal mines could be expected to work in horrific conditions for very long hours. In the 1820s, for example, it was common for children to work underground for 12 to 16 hours every day. The early history of the United States shows another example of how child labor was central to economic life. In 1820s half the labor in the cotton industry were children under 16; and there were still 1.7 million people working in the industry by the end of the nineteenth century.   Even well into the twentieth century, was child labor still prevalent in many Western societies. Denmark took until 1925 to establish stringent laws for worker rights. But, why are these historic examples relevant? If we want to see developing nations reach the heights of the NDCs, then we must realize that they are limited in their options compared to how the West built their economic wealth. They cannot lie, cheat and exploit their way to the top in such an unregulated fashion as the West did. So we should now realize that the currently developing nations have to approach economic development in different ways than the NDCs did. However, rather than something which we bemoan, we can view this challenge as a positive change. In fact, the majority of developing nations are currently far more “developed” than their Western counterparts were at the same stage in their development. Take the institutions vital for a fair and prosperous society: the institutions of bureaucracy, welfare or democracy. In currently developing nations they are much stronger than they were in the historical  NDCs. For example, the UK income per capita in 1820 may have been twice that of modern India (adjusted for inflation), but India is far more developed in its institutions: India has universal suffrage, a central bank and strong labor regulations, none of which existed in nineteenth century Britain. Why was institutional development so poor in the developing NDCs? Partly it was because those who had control of the government, were also those who benefitted from the unfair system. That’s precisely why, for example, it took well into the twentieth century for Britain to ban child labor. The House of Lords, which decided policy in the nineteenth century, was dominated by rich men who owned the mines and factories that the children worked in. To ban child labor would mean that they lost a ready supply of incredibly cheap and docile labor. Yet in developing countries, at least those with universal suffrage, such powerful forces have less control, therefore development is required for solutions – spurring greater development. Seeing that developing nations are growing within the bounds of modern regulations makes them far more advanced than the NDCs that developed at the hands of unjust practices. Many people in these countries have rights that were unavailable to the people of eighteenth century Britain or America. The key message in this book: When advising developing nations what to do, NDCs often conveniently forget to tell them how they got there. Yet, partially because developing nations cannot grow at the hands of unregulated exploitation, they have been building their economies in more advanced ways.

If you are a climber or an outdoorsy type, chances are you own at least some of its gear, whether it’s a windbreaker, a hat or a backpack. But beyond the products it makes, what else do you know about the company? As it happens, Patagonia is one of the most progressive companies in the world. It is at the forefront of environmental protection, has a superb company culture and is a global leader when it comes to honest marketing. These blinks will take you through Patagonia’s history while also explaining its groundbreaking company philosophy. You’ll also learn why Patagonia stopped selling its most popular product; how staff hours are subject to change according to surfing conditions; and how the company’s advice has helped millions of people stay warm. It’s possible that you’ve been shopping for outdoor gear at Patagonia for years without knowing who Yvon Chouinard is. However, if you want to understand how Patagonia became one of the world’s most successful companies of its kind, it all starts with Yvon Chouinard. His story begins in Maine, where he was born in 1938 to a French-Canadian family. When his French-speaking family moved across the continent to California, he began to feel like an outsider and took comfort in mountain climbing. His interest in climbing only intensified from there: after graduating from college, he taught himself how to work as a blacksmith so he could make his own climbing gear. Chouinard wasn’t happy with most of the gear available at the time, as the majority of it came from European companies that had a different approach to mountaineering than what he was after. They designed equipment based on the idea that climbing was a battle of humanity versus nature; to help you conquer a mountain, they built tools that often damaged the environment. Soon after learning how to make his own climbing gear, Chouinard was selling it to others and quickly expanding his business. Even though his tools were expensive, his radical redesign of climbing equipment was very appealing to his fellow outdoorsy types: he simplified standard equipment while at the same time making it lighter, stronger and more functional. There wasn’t much profit at first, but Chouinard was only really interested in earning enough to continue climbing, surfing and fishing. He was, however, eventually able to hire some friends as employees and bring in just enough money to continually improve the products they were putting out. It all paid off by 1970, when Chouinard Equipment became the biggest climbing hardware supplier in the United States. Even so, improvements still needed to be made. When Chouinard was climbing, he saw that pitons were being left dug into the sides of mountains everywhere. Keeping with his philosophy of putting nature first, Chouinard decided that his company would phase out pitons, despite their popularity, and only produce removable aluminum chocks. Getting rid of a top-selling item is a radical move that could spell the end of a company, but Chouinard was just getting started. Mountain climbing isn’t everyone’s greatest passion, which makes selling climbing tools a niche market. With this in mind, Chouinard knew he needed to expand. To complement the marginal profits of the gear business, Chouinard decided to start a new company to sell outdoor apparel, and it got its own name: Patagonia. But one thing remained the same: the principles. As with the climbing tools, Patagonia’s clothes were intended to be simple, strong, well designed and highly functional. Patagonia got off to a rocky start, though: one of its first articles of clothing was a rugby shirt that ended up arriving behind schedule and which was cheaply made. Since no one wanted these shirts, the company had to cut its losses and sell them off below cost, which put Patagonia into financial trouble right out of the gate. Looking for a way out, the company even considered a loan from a dubious source asking for 28 percent interest. Thankfully, Chouinard and his colleagues put together enough money that they didn’t have to resort to such drastic measures. This was all an eye-opening situation for Chouinard: he realized that for his business to succeed, he needed to become a legitimate businessman. Chouinard had always considered himself a climber or a surfer, and never a businessman – but that’s exactly what his growing enterprise needed: a leader to strategize and run the business. And that’s just what he did. Chouinard stepped up and stabilized Patagonia so that it would start earning a profit. But this didn’t mean that things at the company became stale and boring; rather, he did it in a way that remained true to who he was, which meant ensuring that his staff enjoyed their work. It also meant offering new and innovative products, like Patagonia’s groundbreaking functional apparel. The company was the first of its kind to promote wearing layers of different clothes as a barrier to the cold. And along with its high-quality clothing, offering this kind of advice led to the company being trusted by its customers and envied by the rest of the industry. Patagonia also revolutionized the outdoor apparel industry by combining vibrant colors and new materials with a type of clothing that had a long history of being drab and boring. Things were going well for Patagonia – but at the same time, there was something that needed to be addressed. Patagonia was built on a contradiction: it strove to be truly different, yet it wanted to grow like any other business. This was becoming apparent in the trouble being caused by its rapid growth. As a result of an initial focus on expansion, new staff were being brought on board without being properly trained, and before long things were falling apart. Not the least of Patagonia’s problems was the fact that it had to fire 20 percent of its staff, while the tool division, Chouinard Equipment, was forced to file for bankruptcy. All this had Patagonia reprioritizing, looking beyond growth and profits and seeing that it was time to come up with a business philosophy, as well as a core code of ethics. The company was now going to look for “organic” ways of growing while focusing on sustainable growth and a long-term vision instead of short-term profits. It was also time to refocus on Chouinard’s commitment to the environment. Chouinard was becoming even more concerned about the environment in the 1980s, and the company joined its first grassroots cause by backing a project to protect the Ventura River. While testing products, Chouinard had seen first-hand that the river was in danger of completely vanishing due to damming, leaving local species of fish without breeding grounds. From then on, Patagonia would continue to do its part to protect the environment. Beginning in 1986, and every year since, the company has donated either one percent of all sales or ten percent of profits, whichever is more, to environmental causes. This philosophy even extended to its catalog, which was one of the first anywhere to be printed entirely on recycled paper. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look how Patagonia’s philosophies have evolved over the years. Patagonia’s core values became an integral part of its philosophy, and even though these values are expressed in writing, they remain very flexible and simply put forth a set of clear guidelines. Patagonia’s guiding philosophy allows everyone, including employees and the public, to be on the same page when it comes to the company’s key ideas and a rough plan of where it wants to go. The central idea behind this philosophy is for products to be cared for with the same respect that you would give another human being. Patagonia doesn’t make disposable goods intended for blind consumption; rather, they serve a valuable function and aren’t the kinds of things to be bought and sold just for the sake of consumerism. This emphasis on value is reinforced in the marketing of the products, which reminds people that Patagonia’s goods serve a real purpose and are made and sold by passionate people. This message is conveyed in marketing that is heavily focused on photos of people putting the products to use, which highlights their functionality. Naturally, these images also highlight how people can use the products in harmony with the great outdoors. This philosophy forms an integral part of Patagonia’s “bible,” which is what the company calls its catalog. The catalog is not only used to showcase and sell its products, it is also an opportunity to put Patagonia’s values on display and share valuable information and tips for climbers and outdoor enthusiasts. In fact, the catalog is where the company started promoting the idea for people to wear layers for warmth in cold climates, and it carefully sought to assure customers that this wasn’t just a ploy to sell more clothes. Anyone in marketing knows that it is a challenge to sell things that don’t have any real value. That’s precisely why Patagonia aims to be at the forefront of innovation and to make unique products that are easy to market honestly and without embellishment. Patagonia’s philosophy also extends to its product design, which is naturally a central focus of the company. For everything Patagonia makes, the aim is to make it the best product of its kind. To this end, each product is tested and designed with close attention paid to the specific areas that will make it durable and – most importantly – authentic. There are many ways Patagonia achieves its authenticity, but there are two facets in particular that have come to define the company. The first is that all of Patagonia’s products are designed to be multifunctional, and there’s a very practical reason for this: climbers can’t carry a lot of extra weight, so it’s in their best interests to have tools that can perform more than one function. With this in mind, a backpack can be an instrument for carrying things, sleeping on or dragging water from a stream. The second hallmark of Patagonia’s product design is durability. The company doesn’t focus on making endless variations of different backpacks; it focuses instead on designing one kind of backpack that can last a lifetime. After all, it is less harmful to the planet when someone can keep using his equipment for a long time. Not causing any harm is another important part of Patagonia’s design philosophy, as is finding ways to add value. The ideal piece of clothing would be something that is ecologically friendly, durable and authentic, as well as something that you could identify as being from Patagonia without checking the label. But this isn’t always easy, especially the part about not harming the environment. Patagonia is always looking for ways to be more ecologically friendly: in the 1990s, the company found out that so-called “100 percent cotton” actually included 30 percent synthetic products. This discovery led Patagonia to be one of the first multinational companies to insist on using more organic cotton. At first, this was a struggle – organic cotton that met its high standards of durability was hard to come by. But through research and education, Patagonia worked with suppliers to find a solution. Aside from its durable and well-designed products, Patagonia has also become famous for how it manages and treats its employees. And this is yet another legacy rooted in its foundational principles. In its early days, Patagonia was mostly made up of Chouinard’s friends or fellow climbers and surfers. While this has of course changed over the years, the goal of Patagonia’s human resources department is still to have the majority of its employees also be customers. This is another winning philosophy: great products come from people who are passionate about them. It’s also easier to teach outdoor enthusiasts about business than it is to teach a businessperson to be passionate about the outdoors. Therefore, with each hire, Patagonia seeks out people who love camping, climbing or surfing. But hiring passionate people is only the start; for employees to feel free to put that passion to work, they also need to be treated with respect. That’s why Patagonia’s human resources department’s motto is, “let them go surfing.” This is a reference to the company’s flexible work schedule that allows employees to go surfing when the waves are right, not when some fixed schedule allows. This goes along with the health care benefits and on-site child care that allows for harmonious family dynamics and proper work-life balance. There are key values that apply to upper management as well. Patagonia doesn’t want its employees to be coerced by managers or to be afraid to speak out and question authority. Instead, the company seeks leaders who inspire their team members rather than those who simply tell staff what to do. Patagonia looks for leaders who are visionary and lead by example. These are managers that create long-term goals and stick to them while staying on the lookout for new developments. With this model, there is a bond of trust between the employees and managers, both of whom can rely on each other to do the right thing. Finally, as we’ll see in the last blink, Patagonia simply wouldn’t be Patagonia without its environmental philosophy. In the previous blinks, we’ve seen how tool and clothing design, as well as consistent donations, show that environmental concerns lie at the heart of Patagonia’s management and philosophy. Patagonia cares deeply about the impact its products leave on our planet. As with any company that creates physical goods, Patagonia relies heavily on natural resources – but it also strives to treat these resources with the utmost respect. As such, the company regularly examines and reexamines its business practices. Even if the company is doing something that is working out well, it’s never content and is always looking for ways to improve. Topping the list of Patagonia’s concerns is whether or not a current product or policy is good for the environment in the long term. This is exactly the type of reasoning that led Patagonia to phase out the pitons mentioned in the first blink. Even though they were originally created to be eco-friendly, customers were inadvertently leaving them embedded in mountainsides. Chouinard had to reconsider the company’s actions, which is what Patagonia continues to do today; when an environmentally damaging product or practice is detected, the company focuses on repairing it in any way possible. Patagonia also takes a holistic approach to these concerns by looking at both the symptoms and the causes of environmental damage. For example, Patagonia provides donations to Planned Parenthood, since one of the leading environmental threats in the world today is overpopulation. This genuine concern for the environment is apparent throughout the entire business, from its products and catalog to the reusable cups that are used in the company cafeterias. From day one, Patagonia has worked to find ways for people to enjoy the gifts that nature provides, while making sure that these same gifts will be available to future generations. The key message in this book: Business doesn’t have to be focused solely on growth and consumption. Patagonia has developed a business philosophy that has allowed it to create superior and incredibly popular products without damaging the environment or selling its soul to corporate greed. The company stands as a beacon for any entrepreneur who wants to do things differently and honorably – while still earning a profit. Got feedback?

In the 20 years since it was founded, it has completely redefined the way we interact online and with the world, even becoming a verb along the way. But is its tapestry of big data and free access really such a great thing? And will it be able to hold on to its position of power in the future? Because, as it turns out, though it holds data on almost everyone on the planet, it doesn’t actually keep it all under proper lock and key. But if Google’s heyday is coming to a close, then what will replace it? This is where cryptocurrencies, blockchain and bitcoin come in. These blinks detail the world that Google has built and why it’s no longer tenable, before explaining how and why the cryptocosm’s focus on security is changing, and will continue to change, the world. You’ll also learn what a “Siren Server” is; why you probably shouldn’t worry about Artificial Intelligence; and who Satoshi Nakamoto is – or isn’t. Of all the information giants on the market today, it is Google that has defined our current system of the world, the set of ideas that inform a society’s technology and institutions, and shape the lives of its citizens. Let’s start with Google’s vision of knowledge, which is built around big data. Google doesn’t use traditional methods for increasing knowledge, where step-by-step progress is made by working from previous ideas. Rather, its vision is to first gather all of the information in the world in one place – the cloud – before analyzing it using sophisticated algorithms and extract new information. To enable this, Google has built an enormous database of information, a digital rendition of the real world, starting with the internet before growing to include everything from books and languages to maps and even faces through facial recognition software, which you comb through when you use Google. And since Google wants access to all information, any sort of privacy runs contrary to its model. Next is Google’s vision of value. The company makes 95 percent of its revenue through advertising; instead of paying with money to use Google, you pay with your time and attention. Of course, most people don’t want to look at adverts – which explains why the use of ad blockers increased 102 percent between 2015 and 2016 alone. Google, however, is famously subtle, placing sponsored links at the top of searches where they blend in and don’t seem so obtrusive. To manage and facilitate the online architecture that all this data and advertising requires, Google has built their own enormous data center near the town of The Dalles, Oregon. It currently houses 75,000 computer servers and handles 3.5 billion searches per day – that’s 1.5 trillion every year! These servers have enabled Google to expand with web services like Gmail and Google Docs, while simultaneously creating a new yardstick for tech companies: the more storage and processing you can offer, the better you are. But is this really the case? Jaron Lanier, widely considered to be the inventor of virtual reality, refers to these huge centers as “Siren Servers,” invoking the Greek myth where sailors are drawn to their death on the rocks by the alluring song of the Siren bird-women. Is he right to call them so? Could these very same centers, which have given Google and others apparent market dominance, be pulling them toward an early grave? In January 2017, a “secret” gathering took place in Monterey Bay, California, attended by some of the pioneers of the information age, such as Google cofounder Larry Page. Their intention was to discuss and prepare to inform the world of the developing risks in the growing field of Artificial Intelligence, or AI. But most of the attendees were actually helping develop AI in Silicon Valley – why would they want to warn people of its dangers? These Silicon Valley pioneers believe that an AI-dominated future is inevitable. If they don’t develop it, someone else will. So the most good they can do is be involved and try to keep people informed of its dangers. But are these dangers real? To find out, we first need to look into the history of mathematics. In 1930, at a conference in his hometown of Königsberg, Germany (present-day Kaliningrad, Russia) mathematician David Hilbert presented the idea that all science could eventually be reduced to mathematics in a complete system – a system with a single unifying theory that covers everything, everywhere, with no uncertainty. However, the previous day at the same conference, the much younger mathematician Kurt Gödel had demonstrated that there can be no absolutely complete logical system. Any logical system, including any mathematical one, depends on premises that simply can’t be proved within it – you always need an outside authority. This is why humans can not only discover systems, they can create them too, and this is in fact how computer programming works: you create a system by defining rules for it from the outside. For AI to be dangerous in the way that Silicon Valley believes, AI would have to be a complete system. If it were to be complete, then once it had all the data in the world – a primary objective of Google, as we have seen – it could teach itself simply from the data it gathers, without the need for human input, quickly outpacing human intelligence and gaining dominance over us. But we needn’t fear this because, as Gödel demonstrated, all logical systems are incomplete. This means that if AI really is a threat, it must be programmed that way first. It couldn’t do it entirely on its own because it would need an outside authority – namely us humans, the ones who program it. All these fears of a tyrannical AI are really only the paranoid thoughts of scientists and engineers about the consequences of their own supposedly superior intelligence. In 2013, the Guatemalan Universidad Francisco Marroquín became the first university in the Americas to allow payments with the cryptocurrency bitcoin. This forward-facing move shows how some academic institutions are embracing progress more than others. Many American universities, on the other hand, would rather focus on reactionary measures that end up halting progress instead of enabling it. Harvard University, for example, has made several resolutions in recent years to combat climate change by distancing themselves from fossil fuels. But this is too focused on teaching students how to stop things instead of how to be innovative, look forward and come up with the solutions of the future. Other universities focus on nurturing their own reputation more than education. In the 20 years that Stephen Trachtenberg was president of George Washington State University, the price of tuition more than doubled from $27,000 to almost $60,000, with apparently no improvement of education standards and Trachtenberg claiming that a degree from the university serves instead as a “trophy.” Luckily, there are some institutions fighting against these trends. Named after founder and entrepreneur Peter Thiel, the Thiel Foundation awards the Thiel Fellowship, a $100,000 grant to encourage promising students in their early 20s or younger to quit college and pursue their own unique projects, with the aim of creating businesses and entrepreneurs rather than academics. It was led for its first five years by Danielle Strachman and Mike Gibson, who in 2015 together went on to found the 1517 Fund, a similar project that invests in Thiel Fellows and other young company founders. It’s named after the year that Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses on a church door in Wittenberg, Germany, which ignited the Reformation. In October 2017, the 1517 Fund posted their own “New 95.” These put forward the message that the education system wasn’t enabling scientific breakthroughs and progress, and should therefore be rebelled against. In 2013, the Thiel Fellowship was granted to Austin Russell for his company Luminar, which builds laser-radar chips vital for self-driving cars. In 2017, Toyota announced it would be purchasing chips from Luminar for its own cars. And in 2014, the fellowship was granted to Vitalik Buterin, a college dropout who attended the secret meeting in Monterey Bay mentioned in the previous blink, to help set up the blockchain platform Ethereum. This technology – blockchain – is set to change the world. But what exactly is it? In October 2008, a mysterious character known as Satoshi Nakamoto revealed the first cryptocurrency: the bitcoin, which has since come to steadily change the world we live in. To understand bitcoin, we need to dive into an emerging online world that the author calls the cryptocosm. In the cryptocosm, personal data is decentralized from any universal and easily targetable central hub, and is instead held by every individual. Each user has two keys specific to their online account, one public and one private. Whenever you send a message to a user, it is encrypted using the public key, but in such a way that it can only be deciphered with the user’s private key, so only they could ever read it. When they encrypt a response, they use their private key again, leaving a unique digital signature that proves their identity securely without revealing any personal information. These signatures are integral to bitcoin and its blockchain technology. Roughly every ten minutes, a block is created, which logs all the information about the most recent activity of bitcoins. This includes the digital signatures relevant to every transaction of bitcoin. It also includes a time-stamp, showing exactly when the block was made. The time-stamp is created through mining. A new block can only be created once a complicated and time-consuming algorithmic problem has been solved by using the processing power of many computers from across the network. This is mining. When it’s complete and the problem is solved, a proof of work is generated, which time-stamps the block that’s just been built. And, as compensation for the mining, new bitcoins are generated. Since the time-stamp can only be created once the mining has really been done, it can’t be forged. And since creating it involves many computers, it is verified by multiple users. This makes the information in the block trustworthy and unhackable. Bitcoins get around. Every transfer and creation of one is registered in the next block created. All of these blocks are connected in a chronological chain which is unsurprisingly called a blockchain, and which is public. Each block has a unique fingerprint and leaves traces in all subsequent blocks, meaning anyone can trace a bitcoin’s trajectory all the way back to when it was first created. The fingerprints also make it near impossible to edit the information inside any one block, since you’d have to edit all the previous blocks as well. Meaning that the bitcoin ledger – the record of all its transactions – is almost completely unhackable, and every transaction is thus very secure. No wonder so many businesses are pouncing on the technology! In 2016, Australian computer scientist and businessman Craig Steven Wright came out claiming that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Some believed him, but many remained skeptical. One of these skeptics argued that it would have been much easier for Wright to prove his identity by posting “Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto” with Satoshi’s private key than to try to convince people in person instead. For this reason, it was considered unlikely that Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto. Who was this young skeptic calling out the supposed creator of bitcoin? None other than the college dropout we learned about earlier: 24-year-old Vitalik Buterin, founder of another important blockchain company: Ethereum. Ethereum launched in 2015 and is a blockchain app platform designed to securely handle and verify objects other than just cryptocurrencies, most notably smart contracts. With smart contracts, the parties involved in a transaction send their assets – be it shares, currency or anything else of value – via the blockchain. As long as all parties comply, the assets are then released and transferred on accordingly; otherwise, they’re just refunded. Just two years after Ethereum’s launch, it had enabled a wave of entrepreneurial creativity via these secure investment capabilities, sidestepping cumbersome regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission that had slowed investment in recent years. It also has its own coin on the platform, ether, which in May 2018 had a market cap close to $60 billion – already almost half that of bitcoin! It’s too early to tell if Ethereum will outrun bitcoin, but the Greek-British blockchain scholar Andreas Antonopoulos says it might end up like a rivalry between a lion and a shark, where each dominates its own domain. But Ethereum isn’t the only other blockchain enterprise flourishing in the cryptocosm. The company Blockstack, led by computer scientist Muneeb Ali, is building an entirely new network for decentralized blockchain apps. Blockstack is both a browsable network and an open-source platform for app development using blockchain technology, allowing both developers and users an easy way into the secure world of blockchains. It’s built on just two key software structures – a monolith, a blockchain software underpinning everything, and a metaverse, a visible platform where users create, surf and share as they see fit. This is just one way that the blockchain is giving security and power back to individual users. But it’s not just software that’s standing up to Google’s dominance; there’s change brewing in the hardware sector as well. In computer science, Moore’s Law dictates that the cost-effectiveness of circuits doubles every two years, while its corollary, Bell’s Law, states that every ten years, a huge drop in the price of processing power causes the development of a brand new computer architecture. It happened when the PC replaced the huge mainframes of IBM in the 70s and 80s, then more recently with Google’s cloud. Are we due for another shift soon? In Silicon Valley, it seems to be arriving in a rebirth of hardware manufacturing. Though many Valley companies are no longer building the silicon chips that gave the area its name, some such as Nvidia and their chief scientist Bill Dally still are. However, they are moving in a different direction, away from fast but energy-demanding “hot” chips to cooler and more efficient ones, enabled by the cheaper circuitry now available. Dally has long championed the capabilities of graphics processors and their parallel processing systems, where multiple functions gently yet efficiently run at once, rather than having all data moving rapidly up and down a single information highway. He believes these types of processors could be crucial in emerging fields such as sensors for self-driving cars, where life and death depends on analyzing and interpreting many different objects and events simultaneously. Google and other information giants, meanwhile, are still stuck on the task of achieving cheaper and more powerful processing power to support their massive and growing centralized servers. In fact, it seems that they’re demanding more extra power than is actually feasible in the current technological landscape. But for technologies that do not use centralized clouds, there are exciting developments happening. One is the emergence of the company Golem, built on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Describing itself as an “Airbnb for computers,” Golem rents your computer processing power when you’re not using it and pools it all into one enormous virtual-supercomputer! This creates huge processing power, allowing users to perform normally expensive processes such as computer-graphics rendering for much cheaper, and without requiring the massive and expensive hubs of Siren Servers like Google’s. And individual storage and software is kept secure by use of blockchain technology. Such shifts in technology are improving security and capability. Is there anything that could really slow down the rise of the blockchain? In the eighteenth century, the British physicist Isaac Newton established the gold standard. For almost 200 years, governments worldwide guaranteed their currencies against the value of gold, in a bid to ensure economic stability. Why gold? Well, for starters, it is the most resistant to corrosion of the precious metals, so you can be fairly sure it won’t disappear. And its value is predictable too, since its supply, through mining and excavation worldwide, increases gradually enough so as to have barely any effect on its worth. And while mining technology may improve, it’s essentially canceled out by the fact that new gold deposits are harder and harder to access. So it made for a useful standard – an unchanging touchstone against which to stabilize the volatile international economic elements of exchange rates and interest rates. But governments have since abandoned it, instead preferring to let the markets decide the value of currencies. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Nakamoto promised to change this, hoping that bitcoin could become a new and improved gold standard. Along with the first bitcoin block, Nakamoto created a mining algorithm, which makes it harder and harder to solve the algorithmic problem required to create blocks and their corollary bitcoins. In this way, he hoped to offset the improvement of computer processing power, much like the increasing inaccessibility of gold deposits offsets technological advances. He also capped the total supply of bitcoins at 21 million, with the mineable amount being halved every year. With these caveats, Satoshi hoped to create a stable and predictable supply of bitcoins over time, thus allowing it to become a new gold standard. But, according to economics blogger Mike Kendall, bitcoin can’t become a standard because it’s already a token of exchange, and a volatile one at that. Because its supply is fixed, the only way it can react to changes in demand is by wild fluctuations in its value. And this has already happened: between 2017 and 2018, bitcoin’s value ranged from $1,183 to a peak of $19,401. With this in mind, how could bitcoin act as a predictable and stable standard? Satoshi may have made amazing technological advances in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but his understanding of real-world economics may be flawed. It’s up to other cryptocurrencies to fix the remaining mistakes and continue to build the cryptocosm, thus paving a way out of the cluttered and extensive systems of Google. The key message in these blinks: Google has built a world where individual security comes second to the data storage of a centralized hub. But its dominance now seems to be reaching a tipping point. By working outside of the dominant and traditional systems, the cryptocosm along with the blockchain has laid the foundation for a completely new way of protecting individual data and conducting online business. It can potentially pull apart the cluttered and exhaustive systems of Google while enabling progress and technological change in many fields. Got feedback?

Modern logistics gets products from point A to point B, and logistics clusters are the engines that keep this massive flow moving.  Determined by geography and supported by a nimble workforce and favorable governments, logistics clusters power our globalized economy.  These blinks show you just how these clusters have come to be and how they work, shedding light on the long reach of logistics into local investment, regulation and trade policy.  Yet even as established European clusters start to fade and new clusters in today’s Asian megacities rise up, the flow of trade continues, with a renewed focus on the environment and job creation.  In these blinks, you’ll also learn  how auto cluster “groupthink” killed Detroit;  why even Roman emperors knew that Rotterdam would become a top port; and which universities you need to attend to get a job in Silicon Valley. How exactly did your favorite pair of shoes get from the factory that produced them to the store you bought them in?  The set of operations needed to coordinate this complex chain of events is called a logistics cluster: a group of logistics-related business activities concentrated in a single geographic area.  Interestingly, different companies utilize clusters in different ways. Zara, a Spanish clothing retailer with over 1,500 stores across the globe, uses a logistics cluster located in Zaragoza, Spain. (Although Zara was not named after Zaragoza!) The company chose this small Spanish city as the site for a major distribution center and springboard for coordinating the company’s worldwide logistics.  Why Zaragoza? Why not a fashion capital such as Paris or Milan, or some city in China that specializes in low-cost clothing production? Zara’s distribution center is a part of Europe’s largest logistics park, called the PLAZA – or Plataforma Logística de Zaragoza – which means the logistics platform of Zaragoza.  This park boasts excellent highway, rail and air freight infrastructure, allowing Zara to deliver ready-to-sell products within 24 hours to all its European stores, and within just 48 hours, to all its stores worldwide.  Another company that benefits from PLAZA’s logistics prowess is Caladero, Spain’s largest processor and distributor of fresh fish. With its 80 fishing boats worldwide, Caladero’s distribution chain needs to be flawless: no easy task, as the company only has a few days to deliver fish to ensure freshness. So Caladero centralizes all its distributional operations at this one site, with its optimal location and transportation infrastructure.  But how does this benefit Caladero exactly? Conveniently, Zaragoza is equidistant from Spain’s four biggest cities: Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao. This enables the fish company to deliver the freshest fish possible to the most customers.  Silicon Valley. Hollywood. Detroit. There are countless examples of geographic areas becoming renowned hubs for a particular industry. But why do companies cluster by industry? Industry clusters provide a variety of advantages for all companies involved.  Clustering helps build trust between companies. Hollywood, Wall Street and Silicon Valley are regions known for making well-planned business decisions quickly, a major competitive advantage. The reason this happens is that all the important industry players are clustered in a single place, helping to make business connections quickly and effortlessly.  Another advantage of clustering is tacit knowledge exchange, including communicating with suppliers about specifications or discussing benchmarking statistics with competitors. Since communication isn’t always easy, clustering offers a huge advantage as it makes the process faster and more effective, especially with face-to-face or even chance meetings.  A third benefit of clustering is that it fosters a collaborative environment. As a high concentration of firms share a common industry, addressing similar needs is a natural impetus for joint activities. Companies can collaborate in a variety of ways, including lobbying the government for things like infrastructural improvements or tax breaks.  But clustering isn’t without its risks. Actually, most clusters don’t last forever – but tend to grow, mature and then decay. Why is this the case? One explanation for cluster failure is the very advantage that clustering provides. The information flow and increased knowledge that clusters enjoy can lead to groupthink, which in turn dulls the ability of companies to respond to change.  Just consider Detroit’s failed auto industry, a cluster composed of Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. These auto manufacturers were so engrossed in their own “conversation” they missed the public’s rising environmental awareness and failed to develop more fuel-efficient automobiles.  Additionally, they underestimated international competitors in Asia and Europe. And in the end, this groupthink led to GM declaring bankruptcy, and Chrysler being taken over by Italy’s FIAT. So we’ve learned the benefits of clustering in general, but what are the main advantages of logistics clusters?  One major benefit is that, as a result of increased freight traffic, carriers in logistics clusters can offer reduced transportation costs with improved service. How does this come about? Transportation services fall into two categories: direct operations (DO) and consolidated operations (CO). With direct operations, a carrier takes a shipment directly from pickup to delivery. With consolidated operations, a carrier takes multiple shipments from a local area and makes several deliveries in a destination region.  While DO services tend to be on demand, CO services are usually scheduled.  Logistics clusters offer a transportational advantage as they handle more freight originating from and destined for a single location, which leads to more CO transportation. So transport to and from logistics clusters is much faster, since time between shipments is reduced.  But DO carriers are also drawn to logistics clusters, as making a delivery into a cluster increases the likelihood of a new load to pick up and deliver somewhere else – thereby reducing empty trips.  Another advantage of logistics clusters is the sharing of resources. Most companies have peaks and lulls at different times – online retailers see a surge leading up to year-end holidays, while 1-800-Flowers.com does a lot of business around Mother’s Day, for example. As a result, warehouse operators in logistics clusters can shift overflow from one warehouse to another, if one space is temporarily at capacity while another has room to lease. Not just that, but companies can share heavy equipment such as forklifts when demanded by a sudden surge in activity. It’s easy to think of logistics as just the moving, storing and preparing of goods for transport. But modern logistics clusters offer many different services, from laptop repair to flower arranging – value-added services that go above and beyond the usual.  Logistics clusters offer an efficient location for companies to conduct last-minute product customization. Companies can store “base” products that can quickly be repackaged or have features added that usually don’t require a time-intensive process to do so.  But what makes a logistics cluster the ideal location for product customization? Conducting these value-added activities at a logistics cluster offers companies the chance to make changes right up until when a product is sold.  UPS Supply Chain Solutions, based at a logistics cluster in Louisville, Kentucky, handles the distribution of all of Nikon’s photographic equipment in the Americas. This means that UPS “kits” Nikon cameras before they’re shipped, adding accessories like batteries, chargers or promotional materials.  The possibility for last-minute adjustments isn’t the only benefit of a logistics cluster, as such centers also provide the perfect location for product repair and refurbishment.  Consider that consumers on average return 11 to 20 percent of purchased consumer electronics, things like cell phones, laptops and televisions.  When a return is made, the product is sent to a central location where it is prepared for resale by removing any customer data, resetting software and conducting tests, as well as undergoing any repairs.  Logistics clusters provide a natural location for doing this, as locations are often central and transportation infrastructure is excellent. And once a returned product is refurbished, it can immediately be sold and shipped directly.  So now you know why logistics clusters develop, but how exactly do they develop? Geography plays a major role in the development of high-performance logistics centers. Let’s take a look at four key clusters: in the Netherlands, Singapore, Panama and Memphis, Tennessee. In the Netherlands, river ports such as those along the Rhine River, as well as seaports such as those on Europe’s northern shores, have been natural loci for both ancient and modern supply chains.  Some 2,000 years ago, Julius Caesar marched legions down the banks of the Maas River and across the Rhine with the goal of expanding the Roman Empire. During this campaign, he noted just how suitable the waterways of Holland were for logistics; a fact that history would later corroborate, as Rotterdam became one of the largest, most influential seaports in the world.  In Singapore, both geography and climate inspired the establishment of a high-functioning logistics cluster. Singapore is an obvious center point for the East Asian economies of the Pacific Rim, South Asian markets and Western nations.  Not only this, but as Singapore sits on the equator, it experiences virtually no extreme weather. With its ideal location and calm seas, Singapore has evolved as a logistics cluster that today handles a fifth of the world’s maritime containers.  An ideal geographical location is also what helped push Panama to prominence as a logistics hub. The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This has made the canal a hub for international maritime trade, and has led to the establishment of a logistics cluster there.  Yet convenient sea lanes aren’t the only things a logistics cluster needs. Global courier FedEx based its logistics operations in Memphis for two main reasons.  Memphis’s location in the United States is just right: not too far east, but not too much in the “middle.” This means optimal flight distances and schedules to and from the coasts. Additionally, the city is located just south enough to avoid hurricanes, blizzards or prolonged periods of icy weather – making it an ideal flight logistics hub.  Logistics, in essence, is all about the flow of moving stuff from one place to another.  There are three distinct types of flows that logistics clusters manage. The first is the physical flow of products from suppliers to manufacturers to retailers. The second is the information flow, including specifications, orders and status messages. And the third is the cash flow.  How do logistic clusters manage these three types of flow? To handle physical flow, clusters need physical infrastructure. Rotterdam offers a great example.  Although the Rhine and Maas rivers comfortably handled early sailing vessels, they’re not deep enough for today’s gigantic container ships. The Dutch thus modified their natural waterways into a network of straight, deep channels, dry industrial parks and flood-preventing dikes.  These were then complemented with a series of roads, railways and pipelines that link the Rotterdam cluster to European economic centers.  So logistics clusters harness natural resources like rivers, bays and oceans to move physical goods. Importantly, to handle high volumes, such resources often need to be improved upon and developed, requiring proper investment.  Equally important, how do logistics clusters handle the flows of information and money? Information flow actually mimics the flow of physical goods: specifications, orders, delivery deadlines and various regulatory details move from retailers to distributors to manufacturers. To handle such a complex communication chain, logistics companies employ sophisticated information technology.  Cash flows have their own rhythm, too. Let’s say you’re an exporter who has just transferred your products to a carrier at a foreign port. The carrier notifies your bank that he has received the goods, and that bank tells your customer’s bank that the goods are in transit. At this point, the customer authorizes payment to you through his own bank.  As you can see, the transportation, delivery and sale of goods is a complex business which often involves multiple financial transactions. Financial firms serving logistics clusters must handle this complexity with ease.  The logistics centers of Rotterdam, Singapore and Panama are not only prime examples of how clusters benefit from geography but also show how logistics operations profit from government support.  There are several ways that a government can influence the development of logistics clusters.  First, logistics operations rely on transportation infrastructure such as roads, ports, airports and rail, all things that are often financed by local, state or federal governments.  For instance, FedEx changed its logistics hub from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, as the capital city wouldn’t increase its investment in local airport infrastructure.  Second, clusters usually require space, often a huge tract of cleared land. Therefore a cluster also needs government help in seeking land use permits, issuing building permits or enabling private investment.  Third, governments can help logistics clusters grow by offering companies incentives to set up shop, such as subsidized land, temporary tax abatements or loan guarantees. In both Singapore and Panama, the government offers tax cuts for companies who relocate headquarters to the country.  Fourth, governments can expedite the flow of goods through logistics clusters by designating special trade zones exempt from import duties and export paperwork.  For instance, most of the goods moving through Rotterdam and Singapore are bound for a foreign destination. If companies using these clusters had to pay import duties just to move goods through the door, they’d never be able to turn a profit.  Governments also help forge relationships between foreign logistics clusters, either promoting or often preventing free trade through diplomacy, trade agreements and regulations.  And good trade relations, especially free trade agreements, means a freer flow of goods. Because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico more than doubled in dollar value in just over 15 years. Working in a warehouse doesn’t require highly skilled labor, yet modern-day logistics is so much more than pushing boxes around. The increasing use of technology to track and manage the movement of goods translates to a strong need for highly trained, professional employees. An increasing number of logistics clusters partner with or manage their own educational institutions that are designed to train the workforce they need.  For instance, the AllianceTexas logistics park maintains about 30,000 employees working at over 290 companies. To ensure a steady supply of workers, the park enlisted the help of a local community college that now serves as a training center.  The center focuses on training workers to become foundation-level certified logistics associates (CLAs) and mid-level certified logistics technicians (CLTs). With such certifications, a hiring company knows that a potential employee has the skills necessary to do the job. The Zaragoza Logistics Center in Spain offers advanced degrees as well as a special degree called a “master de logística” (MdL), designed to improve the capacity of the local workforce.  Knowledge-intensive industry clusters in particular rely heavily on academic institutions. A key example is the relationship between Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley, both located near Silicon Valley. The computer science programs at these institutions feed companies a steady stream of well-educated engineers.  Since logistics management is a highly sophisticated and analytic field, universities located in logistics clusters often offer specialized degrees. Erasmus University Rotterdam offers a Master of Science in maritime economics and logistics, a degree with a focus on urban, port and transport economics. Not only do logistics clusters inspire infrastructure investments, but also these investments can produce positive economic returns for a surrounding area.  Logistics clusters are huge job creators, which helps to diversify a local economy and foster economic growth.  Logistics centers create jobs for both skilled and unskilled labor alike. The port of Rotterdam, for example, has 55,000 direct employees and 90,000 indirect ones. Memphis international Airport has created 220,000 jobs for the local economy, 95 percent of which are related to cargo operations.  The best part is, logistics clusters provide jobs for all types of workers. At the low-end, clusters need truck drivers, forklift operators and warehouse workers. Clusters that offer value-added services also  need electronic technicians and assembly workers.  In fact, many clusters successfully recruit entire companies to move their headquarters to the cluster’s location, bringing with them various corporate jobs such as marketing, strategy and management.  Clusters also inspire economic diversity and growth. In fact, diversification is the most major qualitative difference between logistics clusters and other industry-specific clusters.  The success of the city of Detroit rose and fell with changes in the American auto industry. In contrast, a logistics cluster supports economic activity across multiple industries, each of which is subject to its own business cycle.  For instance, the logistics cluster in Louisville, Kentucky, distributes spare aircraft parts, cell phones, office equipment, digital cameras, shoes, pharmaceuticals and many other items.  Rising employment and a constant flow of goods means that logistics clusters have a pronounced effect on a region’s gross domestic product, or GDP.  For example, about 10 percent of GDP in the Netherlands is a result of logistics activities. In fact, the port of Rotterdam alone contributes some $22 billion a year to the country’s economy. Logistics clusters reflect the dynamism of global economics and are always evolving. This will lead to the formation of new clusters in emerging economies while existing clusters gradually decline.  New clusters will find fertile ground in emerging markets. Some 2 billion people are enjoying rapidly rising living standards in the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as in the CIVETS countries of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa.  Rapid economic growth and large populations offer prime conditions for new, large-scale logistics clusters. In China, new clusters are developing in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in Shenzhen, where UPS maintains its North Asian center. As of 2012, Shenzhen announced plans to build one of the world’s largest logistics centers, investing some $46 billion to do so.  The world’s megacities – Chongqing, China, with 32 million people; Mumbai, India, with 21 million; and Mexico City with 21 million – will lead to clusters designed to serve the needs of these massive populations.  These new clusters however couldn’t grow without existing ones phasing out, a fact that means many existing clusters are transitioning to more sustainable methods of transport. For instance, an increased concern about fossil fuel use and overall environmental sustainability has affected supply chains as well as logistics clusters.  The huge carbon footprint of freight transport has made logistics clusters a prime target for government environmental regulations. But this shouldn’t be seen as limiting, as environmental controls can lead to technological development, making logistics clusters often early adopters of “green” technologies.  FedEx is actively testing and using some dozen different combinations of sustainable fuels and vehicles – everything from biodiesel to natural gas to electric vehicles.

But Kodak is not alone. The story of the BlackBerry and RIM, the company behind it, is similar to the Kodak story. In just a few years, the Blackberry, once ubiquitous among businessmen and -women all around the world, completely disappeared. How did something so successful go so wrong?  In these blinks, you’ll learn how BlackBerry got its name; how the iPhone changed everything; and why you should always keep your accounting in order. In the 1970s, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs created the Apple I, which essentially laid the foundation for personal computing. In the 1990s, another tech-savvy duo invented another landmark device: the BlackBerry. One half of the duo – Jim Balsillie – started out as an ambitious student and employee. He grew up in Canada, and was inspired by books such as The Canadian Establishment, by Peter Newman, which was about the Canadian business elite, and the classic The Art of War, by Sun Tzu. Balsillie’s first job was at Sutherland-Schultz, a small firm in Canada, where he was in charge of selling products and services, as well as negotiating business deals with partners. While at Sutherland-Schultz, he was introduced to Mike Lazaridis – the CEO of Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM). RIM was a Sutherland-Schultz supplier and one of the first companies to work on wireless data technology devices. After meeting Lazaridis and learning about his ambitions for RIM, Balsillie became interested in working with him. Mike Lazaridis had a keen, lifelong interest in technology. He was born in Istanbul and, in 1966, when he was five years old, his family moved to Canada, where he was raised. His passion for engineering was already obvious in high school. He would often ask his teachers if he could experiment with the equipment at the school; he and his friends were fascinated by science and elected to get after-school tutoring in applied physics so that they could build on this passion. Later, during his time at the University of Waterloo, Lazaridis and his friends created a device called Budgie, which could be wirelessly connected to a TV and display information. Lazaridis saw a great business opportunity in Budgie, and it was for this reason that he founded RIM in 1984. After Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie began working together, it became clear that they were an ideal pair: their different character traits resulted in a perfect symbiosis, with Lazaridis’s technological know-how complementing Balsillie’s aptitude for business management. Remember having to connect your PC to the internet using a cord? Seems like yesterday, right? So it might come as a surprise that wireless communication has been around for a while. Balsillie and Lazaridis began working on wireless communication in 1996. Before developing their own device, RIM worked on radio modems that could connect laptops and mobile data users to a network called Mobitex. Initially established to allow cars and service trucks to communicate with one another wirelessly, Mobitex was a wireless data network based on radio frequencies. But Balsillie wanted to diversify the customer portfolio of RIM. At the time, RIM’s only major customer was a US modem maker called U.S. Robotics. However, U.S Robotics turned out to be unreliable, at one point cancelling a deal that nearly brought RIM down. After the deal fell through, Balsillie realized that he had to acquire more customers if RIM was to survive in the long run. Lazaridis saw things slightly differently, though, and advocated for the diversification of RIM’s product portfolio. Eventually, he persuaded Balsillie to do exactly that.  In 1996, Motorola, Nokia and U.S. Robotics were all in the same race to see who could sell the perfect palm-sized, two-way communicator – that is, a portable device that could both send and receive emails. Lazaridis was eager to take part in that race and began working on RIM’s prototype: the Inter@ctive 900. Balsillie backed his idea and the two of them decided the Inter@ctive 900 would be the core of RIM’s business model. And thus began RIM’s new focus on wireless communication devices. In business, a good deal means a win-win agreement between two parties – and RIM was able to come to just such an agreement with BellSouth. BellSouth owned the Mobitex network and had been planning to shut it down. That is, until RIM approached them with their new wireless device. If not for RIM’s device, Mobitex would no longer have been profitable. Luckily, Balsillie and Lazaridis were able to convince the BellSouth executive team of their device’s potential and, as a result, BellSouth resolved to not only keep the Mobitex network alive but to expand it, making it capable of reaching approximately 90 percent of the US population. Because BellSouth and RIM were reliant on each other – and because BellSouth was a reliable partner – RIM was able to generate consistent revenue, which made the endeavor even more secure.  With a view to making better offers for their customers, and because Balsillie and Lazaridis also wanted more autonomy, RIM purchased unlimited two-year access to the Mobitex network for five million dollars. This enabled RIM to sell cheaper airtime to their customers, which made them particularly attractive to consumers. By this point, Balsillie and Lazaridis had realized the massive potential of their wireless two-way communication device. But it still needed a name. RIM had hired a marketing team that advised against names that might be associated with work. Better to choose a name from the natural world, they said.  Both Balsillie and Lazaridis had also noticed a trend among executives: the constant stream of e-mails was stressing them out. In an attempt to quell some of this stress, they named their device after a fruit that lowers the blood pressure of those who eat it. Furthermore, their device sort of resembled its organic namesake.  And so the BlackBerry was born. But how did it become such a hit? If you want to implement a new idea, you’ve got to convince others of its soundness. This was exactly the challenge faced by the people at RIM. To get the BlackBerry off the ground, RIM had to persuade executives of the concept. Balsillie and Lazaridis quickly saw the potential of the BlackBerry in the business world, but they also knew that selling it to executives would be a challenge. Decisions regarding the purchase of new technological devices are usually made by Chief Information Officers, a group of people notorious for being highly critical of new devices, especially when these devices are designed to send sensitive information via an external network.  Taking this into account, Lazaridis and Balsillie knew that the only way they could make the BlackBerry a hit was to convince the executives of its utility. If these executives directed other managers to adopt this new technology, the BlackBerry was sure to be a success. Fortunately, RIM was able to convince John McKinley, then Chief Technology Officer of Merrill Lynch, of the advantages of the BlackBerry and, in 1999, the company ordered the first available BlackBerrys. This was great news – and it also sparked a chain reaction that RIM couldn’t possibly have foreseen. All of a sudden, more and more people from Merrill Lynch needed a BlackBerry and other corporate giants followed suit. RIM’s customer base skyrocketed. In 1999, the number of people who owned a BlackBerry sat at 25,000. By 2000, this number had grown to 165,000, and in 2004, RIM’s user base boasted roughly two million people. Indeed, the greater the number of BlackBerry owners, the greater the demand for the device. RIM’s selling strategy had helped establish the BlackBerry on the market – but it wasn’t strategy alone that brought success. What’s the most fundamental market principle? If demand is higher than supply, other players will creep into the market to satisfy that demand. So, naturally, the burgeoning wireless communication market bred competition. Additionally, since the market for wireless communication devices seemed extremely lucrative, other companies were also pouring money into the technology.  One company that had Balsillie concerned was a Californian start-up called Good Technology. Good Technology developed e-mail software that could be downloaded on various mobile devices and was compatible with multiple carriers – not just the Mobitex network. Balsillie feared that strong competitors such as Nokia would pair up with suppliers like Good Technology and produce cheaper, more flexible devices that would dominate the market. This pressure led Balsillie to a decision: he’d make RIM’s software available to giant hardware players such as Nokia.  This project was named BlackBerry Connect; hardware manufacturers would create the devices and BlackBerry would be responsible for the software and the connection to the data network. But there was something Balsillie didn’t share with his prospective partners: he never intended BlackBerry Connect to be a success. For him, cooperating with Nokia was just a means of gaining insight into Nokia’s long-term development plans – insight that would allow RIM to adapt its strategy accordingly. More importantly, the competition didn’t develop their own e-mail service because they were using RIM’s. Had, say, Nokia developed its own software and data network, it could have gained both more autonomy and a majority of the market. Balsillie was essentially trying to gain time to establish the BlackBerry brand. And that’s exactly what he did. Unsurprisingly for Balsillie, and frustratingly for the competition, BlackBerry Connect didn’t run smoothly.  Balsillie’s strategy wasted the competition’s time and helped RIM secure a strong market position. But almost as quickly as it had soared to success, the BlackBerry began plummeting toward oblivion. Remember when the first iPhone came out in 2007? It was a total game changer in the world of mobile devices. The iPhone single-handedly revolutionized the wireless-communication device market. In January 2007, Steve Jobs announced that Apple’s new device would shift the existing paradigm, connecting internet communication with a mobile phone and a touch-based iPod. And that wasn’t the only trick Apple had up its sleeve: they’d made a deal with AT&T. Working with this giant US network carrier meant that the iPhone could transmit far more data than BlackBerry. Furthermore, Apple managed to modify consumer preference. It was no longer enough for a phone to be merely functional; it now had to be beautiful, too. The iPhone was aesthetically pleasing, but it was also powerful. The hardware inside it was so sophisticated that Lazaridis referred to it as a little Mac. It also had more to offer than the BlackBerry in terms of hardware. All in all, the iPhone made such an impression on the market that Lazaridis and Balsillie were forced to come up with an action plan: develop a competitive smartphone within nine months. The new BlackBerry was called Storm. But since Storm had to be released on the market so quickly, it was plagued by bugs. It would sometimes simply shut down and the touch screen was far inferior to that of the slick iPhone. In short, it was a huge flop. Unsurprisingly, Storm got terrible reviews. Thus RIM began losing its grip on the mobile-communication device market. Storm had disappointed its customers – and it wouldn’t be the only RIM device to do so. The iPhone changed the face of mobile technology. But Apple didn’t get complacent. Rather, they scored again with the iPad. In 2010, Apple released the iPad, which again revolutionized the market. Skeptics didn’t think it would be as successful as the iPhone, but, nonetheless, the iPad set the standard for the tablet market. All these changes and innovations had RIM on the ropes. RIM’s customer base was changing significantly. The company’s revenue no longer came from corporate customers; instead, their customer base now mainly comprised non-business consumers about whom RIM knew relatively little. This shift put pressure on RIM to bring out a tablet that would keep their customers happy – and it had to happen fast. RIM’s new tablet device was called the PlayBook, and it had several problems. Instead of installing BlackBerry e-mail onto it, Lazaridis chose to install a bridge, which meant users had to install software that would connect the PlayBook to a smartphone, from which they could then download e-mails. This clunky procedure made receiving messages on the PlayBook complicated, and it frustrated people who’d been fans of the BlackBerry. Efficient e-mail communication was what the BlackBerry was all about. In comparison, the PlayBook was sloppy and impractical. In addition to creating another shoddy device, RIM experienced some technological difficulties, which further compromised RIM’s market position. The industry standard for writing software at the time had shifted toward C++, which was more efficient than Java, the language that RIM used for its software. So Lazaridis decided to change the code of RIM’s software to C++. But this move ended up draining so much of the company’s time that Lazaridis had to compromise in other areas. This combination of product failures resulted in RIM’s demise. But is a couple missteps all it takes for a successful company to completely bite the dust? Have you ever tried to work on a project with someone you’ve had a falling out with? How did it influence the results? Well, Lazaridis and Balsillie eventually butted heads – and, adding insult to injury, there was a major accounting problem at RIM. In 2007, an accounting executive held a meeting with Balsillie and Lazaridis to make them aware of an accounting problem at the company. They were engaging in a practice known as backdating – that is, allowing shareholders to purchase stocks at prices that the shares had had at one point in the past. As long as every shareholder was informed of this practice, it was legal. But sharing this information with shareholders was Balsillie’s responsibility, and he’d neglected to fill everyone in. This was the first time Lazaridis witnessed Balsillie fail and it jeopardized their relationship. The mounting difficulties between Lazaridis and Balsillie wasn’t just bad news for the duo, it also created mistrust within RIM. Balsillie and Lazaridis continued working together, united by their shared passion for the BlackBerry, but their personality differences widened. While Balsillie was interested in sports events and hunting, Lazaridis was more interested in abstract intellectual pursuits, such as studying physics. The expansion of RIM meant that the CEOs were so busy with their tasks that they weren’t able to resolve their difference and this conflict soon spread to their employees. Lazaridis’s engineers blamed the problem of Storm and PlayBook on a failed marketing campaign; Balsillie’s marketing employees pointed the finger at Lazaridis’s engineers. A lack of trust and responsibility was apparent in the company and this, perhaps, was the main reason for RIM’s problems and eventual downfall. The key message in this book: There is a difference between establishing a company and running a company. Customers and competitors are ever-changing; if you can’t adapt, you’ll die out. Failing to realize this, coupled with mistrust within the company, was central to RIM’s demise. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Your first computer? What about your first Microsoft Word document, or whatever you used for word processing? Remember that tingly mix of excitement and curiosity? That, “I’m not sure what this is, but I like it?” sensation? Well get ready, because that sensation is about to return. It won’t come from computer gadgets, but from manufacturing. Just as printers allow self-publishing, and laptops perform complex calculations, soon we’ll all be manufacturing things at home. These blinks will show you just how close we are to another technological revolution. This time it’s one that allows almost anyone to sit at home, download a file and “print” – or manufacture – a toy, a product, a device or whatever your imagination can cook up. In these blinks, you’ll discover why this new technology could reverse decades of outsourcing; how one company reached its $100,000 targeted funding in two hours; and how the author could download his daughters some new toys. People have always made things. Today, however, Makers are designing things on computers and manufacturing them at home without physical resources, using digital tools. What’s more, they share their ideas in online communities. The DIY spirit of the punk and web era has arrived in the form of manufacturing, where instead of relying on large corporations for goods, people can create them themselves. For example, when the author’s daughters wanted new furniture for their dollhouse, they found the selection available from classic toymakers to be very limited. While they did find the Victorian sofas and chairs they wanted, they couldn’t find the right size. So, the author searched the web, and found a website offering online design files for dollhouse furniture. There, he found designs for Victorian furniture and modified the files so that they fit the size of his daughters’ dollhouse. But having the designs isn’t the same as having the furniture. So, he simply printed the files on his 3D printer – for free. The Makers are empowered by the web’s culture of sharing and collaborating. Open source software, for example, enables people to write and modify software to fit their own needs for free instead of getting mass-produced, one-size-fits-all programs that don’t always meet the needs of the user. Just like the chair and sofa designs that the author found online, people actively design things that were previously unavailable and make them available for others. Then anybody with the know-how can modify the files and improve them.   We see this exemplified by the micro-culture and community that has arisen around creating weapons for toy manufacturer LEGO. LEGO itself doesn’t make toys that resemble contemporary weapons, like assault rifles or grenade launchers. So, hobbyists design them online, where they can be shared and modified. These toys are then manufactured using 3D printers at home or by sending the files to online manufacturing services. Some people even turned this hobby into a legitimate business, such as the LEGO weapon manufacturer BrickArms. If you’re an inventor, then you know that we’re in a golden age. Whereas in the past inventors depended on large manufacturers to turn their dreams into reality, today they can produce prototypes from their own homes. According to Moore’s Law, there is a strong tendency for computer hardware to get both cheaper and more powerful over time. This is due to something called compound learning curves, whereby even incremental improvements lead to huge benefits. As a result, innovations follow extremely quickly, with breakthrough discoveries happening about every three years. We can see this in action when we look at the world’s first desktop laser printer, Apple’s LaserWriter, released in 1985. Though expensive, it marked the beginning of widespread desktop publishing. A mere 30 years later, anyone can have their own fast, high-quality laser printer for less than $100. Following this same trend, 3D printers and other digital manufacturing tools will only become cheaper with time, and more of us will have them at home. 3D printing today is at the same point as Apple’s LaserWriter in 1985. It’s still expensive, but it’s getting cheaper, and more people are using and adapting to it. The adoption of 3D printing is analogous to the first desktop publishing tools a few decades ago (think Microsoft Word). When desktop publishing first became available, people realized that they didn’t have a clue about things like fonts or formatting. The same thing is happening with online manufacturing. It’s still new, and people are struggling to understand the languages of industrial design, such as G-code (a programing language that tells computerized machine tools how to make objects) or rasters (programs that convert images to pixels or dots). Only a few people experiment with these cutting-edge tools now, but it is only a matter of time before they become mainstream. Every inventor or start-up founder knows that they’re going to have to raise money if they want to make their idea a reality. Normally, start-ups have to raise funds with the help of venture capitalists or loans to manufacture their product, but crowdfunding changes all that. Kickstarter, for example, turns sales into “presales” by letting people contribute money to a nascent project. In other words, people pay to be the first to get their hands on the product. Start-ups can use that cash the same way they would loans or venture capital in order to cover their initial costs. In addition, crowdfunding sites transform customers into supportive communities. When you support a Kickstarter project, you’re supporting a team of producers, whom you can communicate with in forums and who will update you on their progress. This constant communication fosters participation from supporters, who feel more involved. This involvement can translate into action, and supporters might even help a project go viral by sharing it or spreading the word to people they know. Take the extreme example of Pebble, a smartwatch start-up. Within a span of two hours it had reached its fundraising goal of $100,000. By the end of the day, it had reached $1 million, and within three weeks $10 million! All of this was only possible because of their excited and engaged online supporters. What’s more, crowdfunding sites provide free market research, making new ventures less risky. If you don’t reach your funding goals with your crowdfunding campaign, then you know that your project simply didn’t capture people’s interest or meet their needs and preferences. It’s much better to learn that lesson during the funding phase of your project than after you’ve put in an order to start manufacturing. Instead of having wasted money on manufacturing equipment and product development, you won’t have lost a dime! It also gives you an opportunity to fine-tune your project to better match the needs of potential customers and then try again later. If you’ve ever been to Detroit or Toledo, it becomes depressingly clear that manufacturing has been outsourced for decades. Today that’s all changing. Digital manufacturing techniques make it possible for developed countries to compete with the low-cost labor in other countries, like China. By automating activities that once required huge amounts of human labor, they’re able to make those activities cheaper. We see this concretely in the American toy company Wham-O, which, after taking steps to further automate its production, decided to move 50 percent of its manufacturing from China back to the US. Another American company, the ATM producer NCR, is likewise relocating its production from China to Georgia, thanks to automation. In both cases, automation allows the companies to achieve faster market delivery and lower shipping costs. What’s more, by producing closer to their customer base, they are able to be much more flexible, and can more easily react to customer complaints or suggestions. That means they can deliver new products and services faster than before. Another reason for the shift away from offshoring is that increasing skills and pressure from labor groups have increased salaries in developing countries along with the costs of labor. In China, for instance, the salaries for industry workers rose rapidly – by 17 percent annually in Guangdong and 50 percent in Shenzhen from 2007 to 2012. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the net costs of manufacturing in China will equal that of the US in 2015. Furthermore, global supply chains and offshoring are risky in today’s volatile world. Political uncertainties – like pirates in Somalia and strikes among factory workers in China – and environmental uncertainties, such as the eruption of an Icelandic volcano in 2010, can lead to huge delays in delivery and even lost shipments. Increases in oil prices and the fluctuation of currency also play a part. Imagine if the Yuan appreciates against the dollar: suddenly, labor costs and shipping from China would be more expensive – enough to cut into profits and force companies to totally reconsider manufacturing practices. So what will happen to the giant manufacturers? Will the Maker Movement kill them off? Not exactly. Just as AT&T didn’t vanish with the rise of the web, 3D printing probably won’t destroy large manufacturers such as General Mills. Those companies will, however, lose their monopoly as manufacturers, and will have to compete with small enterprises that make things for niche markets.   What has happened in the digital world is now happening in the real world: Manufacturing is becoming increasingly decentralized thanks to lower barriers to entry and new technology. In the digital world, publishing became democratized with the help of tools such as Wordpress and Tumblr. Using these services, anybody can publish their thoughts. Broadcasting too was pushed toward democratization. Just think of how many people today own a digital camera and can upload videos and distribute them on YouTube. They can even create their own channels! In the real world, everyone will be able to produce real goods in their home or with the help of specialized factories using 3D printers and other digital manufacturing techniques. This increasingly decentralized ownership of the means of production leads to greater access to production technology and less reliance on manufacturing giants. Now, small businesses and even private individuals have access too. Take Local Motors, for example, an American car manufacturer that produces a small number of cars, 2,000 in fact, using 3D printing and other digital manufacturing methods. Thanks to the digitalization and democratization of manufacturing, custom-made products become cheaper to produce and run in small batches. Instead of one-size-fits-all production, 3D printing manufacturers can offer one-size-fits-one solutions. As anyone can design and modify objects in digital files that can be shared, producers no longer need to manufacture items en masse to make a profit. No matter what you need, from tools to dollhouse furniture, Makers will be able to create custom designs based on your specifications, and you might never again have to rely on a major manufacturer. The key message in this book: Manufacturing is becoming democratized with the introduction of new design and production technologies. Increasingly, people have greater control over what goods are produced, and this will have major consequences both for the organization of industry as well as the products and services available to the consumer.  Suggested further reading: The Zero Marginal Cost Society by Jeremy Rifkin The Zero Marginal Cost Society (2014) lays out a strong case for the self-destructive nature of capitalism, demonstrating how it is sowing the seeds of its own destruction.

So devastating was the Great Depression of the 1930s that politicians were determined to act and prevent such an event from happening again. And yet the unthinkable recurred in 2008. How did we once more end up mired in a major financial crisis? Didn’t we learn our lessons from the past? Apparently not. These blinks reveal how the financial industry controls our economy. You will be taken through time from the 1920s until today, see how politics tried to tame the world of finance, why the industry’s behemoths knew how to resist and how a new crisis emerged. You’ll also learn who’s the culprit behind the credit card; why Goldman Sachs likes to move around aluminum; and how money-focused management at GM contributed to the death of 124 people.  Americans who experienced the Great Depression of the 1930s probably felt a little déjà vu about the crash of 2008. Debt, credit and economic bubbles were instrumental in both financial crises. Just as in 2008, the Great Depression followed on from mounting debt and consumer credit. Debt, like credit card use, is a financial product. The more debt is issued, the larger the financial sector grows. When the author was writing Makers and Takers, the financial sector was the same size it had been just prior to the Great Depression – a size it has not reached at any other point in history. Credit is rampant today in the United States, just as it was in 1920s America. Back then, Americans used credit to gain access to around 75 percent of major household items. Before the Great Depression and our own Great Recession, credit was used to mask the severe income inequality that resulted from declining workers’ wages and the skyrocketing profits made by stock market investors. Finally, the years leading up to the 1929 financial crash were characterized by a steadily growing economic bubble. After the fall, the bankers weren’t held accountable – sound familiar? The 1920s bubble emerged after copper prices fell, and banks such as the National City Bank of New York sold stocks in copper mines, telling their oblivious customers that they were a prudent investment. This created the bubble that eventually triggered the 1929 stock market crash. While National City chairman Charles Mitchell was subjected to public shaming in Senate hearings, he returned to Wall Street soon after. In fact, he never spent a day in prison. The same goes for the bankers responsible for our financial crisis. Richard Fuld, former head of Lehman Brothers, continues to work in the financial sector at Matrix Advisors and Legend Securities. The similarities between both financial crises might leave you wondering whether we’ve learned anything from history at all. In the next blink, we’ll investigate how the American economy managed to take us back to the 1930s in 2008. After the stock-market crash of Black Tuesday, 29 October 1929, the Glass–Steagall Act was enforced. The new legislation separated the commercial and investment activities of American banks to protect the public from their risky trading. Despite these regulations, the lines between commercial and investment banking remained blurred. It wasn’t long before bankers began to use this to their advantage again. In the late 1940s, Walter Wriston of the National City Bank of New York introduced a new product to further dissolve the boundary between investment and commercial banking – the negotiable certificate of deposit, or CD for short. CDs were a special kind of savings account with higher interest rates. They were intended to keep rich people’s money out of personal bank accounts, making it harder for tax authorities to keep tabs on them. Commercial banks have always managed bank accounts, but Wriston began selling the CDs for others to trade at a profit. Another blow to the Glass–Steagall Act (and a win for traders like Wriston) arrived in 1967 – credit cards. They were invented after consumers became disgruntled about high inflation eating away at their buying power. Credit cards helped loosen regulation surrounding the issuing of credit and rates. As commercial and investment banking continued to merge, it wasn’t just bankers who were running the show – politicians also had a role to play. After World War II, Americans came to expect more wealth. Rising inflation had stunted economic growth, and with growing demand for looser credit regulations, President Carter deregulated interest rates altogether in 1980. This allowed banks to offer whatever rates they liked to draw in funds as they created complex financial products that were nearly impossible to regulate, from variable-rate mortgages to derivatives. If someone pees in a pool, all the water becomes contaminated. The same goes for the economic system – what goes down in finance affects the waters of the entire economy. This is what happened when financial models for maximizing profit were introduced. In finance, the focus on increasing shareholder value has led businesses to prioritize short-term gains over long-term company value, cutting back costs and endangering the quality of their product in turn. General Motors, for instance, had to recall hundreds of thousands of vehicles in 2013 because of a switch failure. Engineers responsible for the switch had noticed the failure and introduced a redesign, but didn’t relabel the new part. Why? Because they feared telling those higher up the ladder about the glitch in their strict, cost-controlling organization. The public paid a high price for General Motors’ mistake: the switch has caused 124 casualties and many injuries. Shareholder interests also dictate how companies produce goods. This goes against one of the fundamental concepts of the free market, in which consumer demand dictates what products and services companies offer. Nowadays, companies across multiple sectors barely seem interested in fulfilling a customer need with a new product. They remain focused on boosting shareholder value in the short term. Consider how in 2010 a Morgan Stanley report called on the pharmaceutical industry to create value by paying shareholders and buying out companies instead of researching. This was a clear sign of the power Wall Street has over strategic decisions in the industries we depend on to help us live – and sometimes even to save our lives. Imagine asking a friend for a dollar. They agree, but only on the condition that you pay them back two dollars later. Bad deal, right? Well, this is essentially what the current relationship between shareholders and companies looks like. The benefits of profitable large companies primarily go to their shareholders. Back in the 1980s, shareholders who actively tried to influence corporate policy to increase their returns were branded corporate raiders. Today, they’re simply called shareholder activists and make millions. After buying shares of high-profile companies, shareholder activists attempt to boost their value by influencing the board. Consider the relationship between Apple and shareholder activist Carl Icahn. Between 2012 and 2015, the company returned $112 billion (yes, billion!) to the investor and business magnate and the other shareholders. That’s $112 billion that can no longer be put toward developing new and innovative tech to strengthen Apple’s long-term value. Apple isn’t the only company playing this game – 91 percent of all US stock is owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans. Shareholder pay-outs tend to make the rich even richer, while a minimal amount of pay-outs go to pension funds and regular citizens holding stock. Perhaps it’s only fair that companies repay their shareholders for the money they invest into the company so it can produce its products. However, shareholder activists rarely pay for R&D in the first place. Usually, governments pay for innovation. Much of the technology required for smartphones, including touchscreens, GPS, voice activation and even the internet itself were developed as part of government programs and institutions like the military, allowing big companies to turn them into profitable products later on. As wealthy individuals continue to profit from shareholder payouts for products they didn’t help develop, many are wondering how we got to this stage. Let’s investigate this in the next blink. In recent decades, big brands have become increasingly involved in lending and investing – activities that were traditionally the work of banks and financial companies. It’s getting harder and harder to tell what a company’s core business really is. Today, most large companies have a lending unit. Originally established to offer credit to customers who wanted to purchase one of their products, lending units became increasingly profitable over time. With each success, financial departments grew increasingly daring and began taking greater risks. For instance, before the 2008 crisis, General Electric (GE) was busy buying and selling businesses to increase its own stock prices. GE also had a large stake in mortgages, which is where things began to go wrong. After the real estate markets had crashed, the government was forced to bail out GE for a whopping $139 million. As companies begin to behave more like banks, banks are also giving companies a run for their money. In 2011, teams at Coca-Cola realized that there was something strange going on in the aluminum market. Demand wasn’t rising, but prices were. It was revealed that Goldman Sachs had bought aluminum storage plants to cleverly exploit a loophole. While it’s illegal, after a certain point, to store stock and raise the prices, it wasn’t illegal to rotate the same stock between plants, which bumped up prices just as much. As a bank, Goldman was betting on the price of aluminum in the commodities market, but as a business, it was actively involved in raising the prices. Imagine having your house taken from you by somebody who then demands you pay them outrageously high rent. This, in a nutshell, is what happened both before and after the 2008 financial crisis. As banks bought up houses and rented them out, the financial sector began to benefit from the housing crisis at the expense of the average citizen. Following the 2008 crisis, both home sales and rent prices skyrocketed in the United States. You could read this trend as a sign that people are getting back on their feet and are buying properties again. Unfortunately, this is far from the case. Instead, many low-cost homes have been purchased by investment groups to rent out to families who can’t afford to buy their own home. This is a lucrative business – the Blackstone Group investment company owns 46,000 homes that provide a $1.9 billion income for the company. The reason so many families can’t afford to buy their own home in the first place is because all the affordable ones have been bought up by the very same investment groups renting them out. So although sales have risen, the percentage of Americans who own a home has been in decline since 2004. It’s not just houses that American citizens can’t afford. Retirement has also been depleted by financial activities. On average, a retirement household has around $104,000 to subsist on for their whole retirement. For couples between 55 to 64 this just isn’t enough to live a decent life for the coming 20, 30 or 40 years. This is a result of the short-sighted management of retirement plans. Like companies, fund managers are also rewarded for short-term results. Rather than focusing their strategy on long-term, sustainable growth, fund managers take on riskier bets for the chance of bigger wins. However, these risks also lead to big losses and less profit overall. Just as we ask caretakers and educators to look after our kids while we’re at work, we also expect the government to watch over the financial system. After all, it’s their responsibility. So why is it so poorly controlled? After Lehman Brothers fell in 2008, politicians seemed determined to reform the financial sector. Eight years on, only a handful of reforms have been ratified. In 2014, a few lines of legislation were added to the federal spending bill. This bill was supposedly written with the intention of forcing banks to give up their riskiest products, like swaps or derivatives, which allowed them to bet on the performance of stock market outcomes. This goal was directly undermined by the lines added to the legislation. What’s more, the politicians who voted for this amended bill to pass received 2.6 times more funding from political action committees (PACs) than those who voted against it. These PACs are comprised of J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – banks that control 90 percent of the swaps market, and who couldn’t let the bill damage their business. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that governance and finance share such a close relationship. Government officials in charge of controlling finance typically take up jobs in finance when their term ends. The high salaries paid by banks are much more attractive than the modest public service wages paid to government officials. Since 1900, 13 out of 35 Treasury secretaries have previously worked at banks. Seventeen of them went into banking after leaving their Treasury post. So what can we do to reform the financial system? The next blink will explore the author’s key recommendations. Before regulations in the financial sector were loosened, the sole purpose of finance was to support business and economic growth. In an age when companies have become banks and vice versa, how can we get finance to once again boost regular business? The first step is reducing the complexity of banking and financial regulation, which will cut risk-taking. Every day, millions of financial transactions take place with a total worth of $81.7 trillion. The financial system has become so sprawling and convoluted that it’s impossible to oversee. Banks like Citigroup are themselves so complex that even their own boards struggle to supervise their activities. Regulation law, too, is far from transparent. Just like the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, the 2010 Dodd–Frank Act attempts to separate commercial from investment banking to reduce the risk of banks failing. But the new Act is 2,319 pages long (the 1933 Act was just 37 pages in total) with a whole host of new loopholes that can be exploited to blur the lines between commercial and investment banking once more. It’s also imperative that we limit debt in order to stabilize the economy by encouraging citizens to save and by requiring banks to fund their investments with at least 20–30 percent of their own capital. This takes political courage, as debt and credit allow governments to hide economic stagnation. Following the 2008 crisis, it’s become clear that a healthy economy can only handle so much debt. The key message in this book: Unregulated, risky financial activity was behind both the Great Depression of the 1930s and the 2008 crisis. As the borders between commercial and investment banking, between commercial and political interests, and between companies and banks themselves continue to be crossed, rich shareholders profit while average citizens struggle to finance their own homes.

Woods, Jr.","summary":"In the seventeenth century, a single tulip from Holland was worth more than ten times the annual salary of a skilled craftsman. Tulip mania gripped the world, inspiring rampant economic speculation which resulted in a massive financial crash, stripping ordinary people of their life savings. Sound familiar? Whether tulips or mortgages, global markets have enjoyed countless booms and suffered through numerous busts. The most recent crisis in 2008 reverberated all over the world, with millions of people losing their jobs, their homes and their sense of well-being. Although many economies have since recovered, economists warn that the prevailing question is not if there will be another crisis but when. There has to be a better way! These blinks will explain how we got into this mess and how we can free ourselves from this disastrous boom-and-bust cycle. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the US government is to blame for the 2008 economic crisis; how an Austrian economic theory can explain busts past and present; and why suffering a bankruptcy isn’t all that bad. It’s common to see stories in the media about how unrestrained capitalism caused the most recent economic crisis. These pundits say that government should become more involved in the economy to fix the broken system. But is it possible that government, the institution tasked with repairing the economy, actually caused its collapse in the first place? Let’s take a closer look. The crisis began with the government giving mortgages to people who wouldn’t otherwise have been able to afford them. It started in 1999, when government-sponsored enterprises, better known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, put into action a Clinton administration plan to assist low-income and minority families in purchasing homes. As part of the plan, the government forged new mortgage requirements that allowed brokers to offer loans with zero money down, enabling people with no savings to buy houses. Not just that, but these new, risky mortgages were classified as creditworthy by government-backed rating agencies. These agencies then, not wanting to call politically popular programs “risky,” kept reassuring the public that the mortgages were secure. But Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the rating agencies aren’t the only ones to blame for the crisis. In fact, the Federal Reserve played a major role as well. Here’s how: In the early 2000s, the Fed slashed interest rates by printing tons of money. This input of cheap money, paired with relaxed mortgage rules, prompted a major housing boom, causing home prices to shoot up at an insane rate. With hopes of getting rich overnight, careless investors piled into the market. As a result, in 2006 some 25 percent of all home purchases were made by speculators. But the good times didn’t last long. By the end of 2006, housing prices were sinking, and foreclosures had risen by 43 percent. Since no down payments were at risk, speculators just walked out on their underwater investments. The mortgage market fell apart, and the financial system that had stuffed billions of dollars into mortgage-backed securities soon followed. This disastrous outcome came about because reckless government policies enabled people to spend money they just didn’t have. The Nobel-prize winning economist Friedrich Hayek developed what was likely the most important economic theory of the modern world. It’s called the business cycle theory, and its explanation of the boom-and-bust phases of the market applies to both the most recent crisis and economic catastrophes of the past. Here’s how it works. The business cycle theory is based on the effects of government-suppressed interest rates. That’s because artificially decreasing interest rates by printing money produces the illusion that current production can increase more than is sustainable. This deception makes entrepreneurs invest in long-term projects that aren’t based on the realistic savings necessary to feed current production levels. For instance, a builder who thinks he has 30 percent more cement than he does will build a bigger house than he has the materials for. When he realizes he’s out of cement, he won’t be able to complete his build and will have wasted time and resources on something that’s of no use. This means that by artificially lowering interest rates, the government causes people to act like they have a lot more money saved than they do. Therefore spending often spikes before a big crash. We saw the business cycle theory in action during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, for example. Between 1995 and 2000, the stock prices of internet start-ups jumped dramatically. Why did this happen? All the classical signs of the business cycle were accounted for: low interest rates prompted by the Federal Reserve’s expansion of the money supply, causing record-high debt, coupled with quickly rising capital prices for things like programmers and real estate. These factors meant that by 2000, the resources necessary to complete long-term market investments no longer existed. So the dot-com bubble burst, and the value of the Nasdaq stock exchange fell by 40 percent. So it’s clear what caused the economic crisis we’re still mired in, but how can we best deal with it? We can learn from past crises, such as the Great Depression. That’s because the foundations of the Great Depression were set by the inflationary government policies of the 1920s. So just as business cycle theory predicted the 2008 recession, it could also have predicted the depression of the 1930s. For instance, basic economics says that when the production of goods goes up, the prices of those goods go down. But that’s not what happened in the 1920s. Instead, the government increased the money supply by 55 percent, to make it seem as if prices were stable. The government thought that if prices were stable, then the economy would be as well. People gladly swallowed the government’s story and kept spending, while the stock market grew at an increasingly unsustainable pace until 1929. And while most economists at the time thought of the American economy as invincible, Austrian economists foresaw the boom’s eventual collapse. And their predictions were validated when, in October 1929, the stock market crashed. We all know what happened next: President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the New Deal, a series of social programs to boost the economy and address unemployment. But this program didn’t pull the United States out of the Great Depression; instead, it just prolonged the crisis. That’s because, instead of listening to reasonable ideas, Roosevelt kept throwing money into the economy. He refused to accept the lessons of the 1929 crash and its root causes. Neither the huge public works programs nor increased spending as a result of World War II would help save the economy. In fact, by hiking taxes and funneling millions of dollars toward businesses that had no real demand, Roosevelt stood in the way of the economy’s natural efforts to restart itself, based on the real desires of consumers. So it wasn’t until the 1940s when New Deal policies were finally ended that the economy started to recover. So just like prolonged government spending didn’t do a thing to solve the Great Depression, using government bailouts to inject billions of dollars into the broken US financial sector is a losing strategy. In fact, bailouts just exacerbate the problem. Instead, we should let failed banks and other financial institutions go bankrupt. For instance, by handing out billions of dollars to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government sent a message that failure will be rewarded. What the government really should have done is let the enterprises go bankrupt. That’s because, in the short term, a small number of well-known institutions going bankrupt sends a signal that the government is using common sense and letting the free market do its thing. Beyond this, it’s necessary to end the Federal Reserve’s unjust, Soviet-style central monetary planning. After all, with big time players such as investor Jim Rogers questioning the role of the Fed, it could be that we’re on the verge of a shift in opinion about the role of government in regulating the economy. But where should this shift lead us? First of all, to end the Fed’s obstruction of the free market, it’s necessary to reassess the institution’s relationship with the banking sector. For instance, since the Fed is the primary reason big banks can take ever-greater risks, it needs to have its position as the “lender of last resort” reevaluated. Basically, if banks keep operating under the assumption that the Fed will bail them out when their risky practices fail, the boom-bust cycle will never end. Second, the Fed needs to leave interest rates alone, as manipulating them only prolongs recessions. Instead, interest rates should float freely to fill their natural purpose of recalibrating the market to actual conditions, not artificial figures. At this point it’s clear that a government’s ability to print as much money as it wants leads to economic crises and poor investments. We need an alternative. But what exactly would that be? Money that’s connected to a commodity standard is a great way to limit government interference in the economy. That’s because, unlike paper money which can be printed endlessly, a commodity standard is tied to a supply of material like gold, which can only increase as more is discovered. But don’t worry, this doesn’t mean you’ll have to walk around with a bag full of gold to buy your groceries! A paper substitute could be linked to the value of gold, and people could exchange paper money for gold at any time. The government is naturally against such an initiative because, without the ability to print more paper money, it would need to use borrowing or tax changes to affect the economy. And it would be a lot easier for the public to protest such actions than remain perpetually in the dark, considering the secretive inflationary policies currently used by the government. But that’s not the only reason such a system would be beneficial. Another reason is that while inflation is bad for the economy, deflation can be good for it. That’s because inflation is an increase in the money supply while deflation – the opposite – means lower consumer prices. Some critics of a gold-based commodity standard say that having such a system would cause deflation, since the supply of consumer goods would consistently outpace that of gold. These critics maintain that falling prices would cause an economic crisis. However, a 2004 study revealed that 90 percent of deflationary periods in the last 100 years (barring those that occurred during the Great Depression) did not in fact lead to economic depression. Deflation is, after all, a natural process in any growing capitalist economy. Consider the technology market. While the quality-adjusted price of computers fell by 90 percent from 1980 to 1999, manufacturers were shipping out nearly 100 times more units by the end of that same period. This single example offers proof that deflation can also be good for both consumers and producers. The key message in this book: While the mainstream media maintains that rampant capitalism caused the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government is actually to blame. That’s because by depressing interest rates and fostering economic bubbles, the government caused the near disintegration of the US economy.   Actionable advice: Lobby the government to stop its endless spending! When the government spends more money than it collects in taxes, where does the remainder come from? From debts that cause interest rates to rise. So when the government spends too much, it has to borrow money and then push down interest rates by pouring money into the economy, thereby devaluing the dollar and prompting an economic crisis. Thus cutting government spending is necessary – and as citizens, we need to tell the government to do so. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

You bet.  Living outside the law requires energy and ingenuity, not to mention serious organization and cooperation. Just think about the communitarian pirates of the eighteenth century who practically shut down transatlantic trade – their success was not random.  So what can we learn from such misfits? In today’s global economy, the creativity, willpower and innovative mind-sets of misfits are valuable tools, and can help you get ahead.  Because really, it’s not about being on the fringe and trying to break in, but about bringing the fringe into the center and revolutionizing society from the inside. In these blinks, you’ll learn how.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how a trio of German brothers built a business empire by copying;  how a grade school misfit founded his own college; and how a teenaged hacker started his own telecommunications company. Misfit. The word describes a person who doesn’t “fit” in, who chooses her own path contrary to others.  Can this actually be a good thing?  In today’s rapidly evolving economy, being unique is valuable. As traditional industries are being upended by changing social and environmental conditions, misfits are needed more than ever. Misfit David Berdish is a third-generation worker at Ford. He slowed down his career to campaign instead for ideas – unpopular at the time – that he nonetheless believed were vital for Ford’s future, such as car sharing and other alternative mobility solutions.  It was hard going at first. But eventually, Berdish garnered support for his ideas and, today, his efforts have helped the automobile industry as a whole to start addressing the future.  Misfits are capable of dreaming big and, in turn, changing the world. This is because such outsiders have an unusual way of thinking. And while “weird” thinkers in the past were stigmatized, today companies of all stripes are seeking them out.  For instance, German software giant SAP recently announced that it was planning to hire people diagnosed with autism disorders for positions in programming and debugging, hoping that this group’s special skills and attentiveness to small details would be useful. There’s another advantage to hiring misfits – they’re flexible. Modern corporations need to nimbly respond to external conditions. Employees must be creative and adaptable, and not specialized and methodical like many workers of the past.  As a result, career paths are becoming less linear and more diverse. And misfits are especially well-suited to thrive in this type of environment.  All in all, there are big advantages to being “different.” So what can we learn from misfits? A true misfit doesn’t care about rules or conventions. Some don’t even care about the law.  In fact, criminals are prototypical misfits. And believe it or not, we can learn a lot from them! Criminals have special talents that they use to survive, working in a tough environment characterized by brutal rivalry and boundless competition. The level of skill and energy required to succeed in the underworld, however, can also be channelled to legal business activity.  That’s the goal of Defy Ventures in New York, a program that provides ex-criminals with a business education, putting them on the path to legal entrepreneurship.  The project has been hugely successful. Since 2010, some 72 of 115 Defy Ventures graduates have launched their own companies, earning a total of $13 million. Some 87 percent of participants are employed; and only five percent have returned to crime.  This proves that law-abiding citizens can learn a lot from hard-working ex-cons! Importantly, criminals are whiplash-fast at adapting to new situations and changing economic conditions. Somalia’s “pirates” are proof positive of this principle. After the government collapsed in the early 1990s, the waters off the Somali coast became dangerous for shipping and fishing vessels (many, granted, which were fishing illegally). Desperate locals began to attack these boats, seeking valuable items or kidnapping sailors in exchange for ransom. This marked the beginning of modern piracy.  Quickly these pirate activities grew into a professionally organized, multimillion-dollar business. Pirates and their networks were nimble and fast to adapt, perpetually thwarting the efforts of shipping companies and countries trying to combat the practice.  Sure, piracy isn’t at its core a practice that should be condoned. Yet a group’s ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances can be a hugely profitable skill. Have you ever felt powerless when faced with a mountain of problems? Take heart, as we all sometimes encounter obstacles that often seem insurmountable.  But the thing is, this is precisely when we’ve got to hustle – and not give up.  Hustle is both an attitude and a strategy. A hustler has got passion and determination; and her strategy is all about improvisation.  So don’t worry if you lack an elaborate master plan or even basic resources. Just use whatever’s available to you and be prepared to respond to whatever comes your way.  When a DHL branch in Clinton County, Ohio, left 9,000 people unemployed, residents Mark Rembert and Taylor Stuckert started hustling.  They built up a grassroots movement to connect the community and raise awareness for alternative business strategies. They launched campaigns to encourage people to buy from small businesses and revived the local Chamber of Commerce.  Of course there will always be new obstacles, especially when you’re trying to create something from nothing. For instance, starting any new business means tons of paperwork, and so anyone without resources will have to find work-arounds. And that’s perfectly normal. In fact, a study in the United Kingdom showed that 20 percent of small business owners had engaged at some point in informal or semi-legal activity. That might entail bartering website design skills for someone’s marketing know-how. Or it might mean paying a supplier off the books.  The report showed that such behavior wasn’t about cheating the state, but was really about bypassing cumbersome regulations simply to get the business running. With the boom in internet technologies, the question of copyright has been a serious issue for years.  But there are other ways to look at the act of copying. It can actually be an incredibly effective business strategy, if of course you set moral and legal questions aside for a moment.  Germany’s Rocket Internet, founded by brothers Marc, Oliver and Alexander Samwer, has successfully launched “copycat” versions of several U.S.-based online services, like eBay and Airbnb.  The brothers realized that a service like eBay’s had a lot of potential for the German market. They initially proposed to build a German franchise as contractors, but when eBay didn’t respond, the brothers decided to independently launch a copy company, called Alando. Some six months later, eBay acquired Alando for over €38 million. Similarly, Rocket Internet’s short-term vacation rental site, Wimdu, has become a successful competitor to Airbnb.  Copying goods can be equally profitable. The market for counterfeit goods is estimated at $600 billion a year, or some seven percent of all global trade!  In China, there’s a whole business culture called shanzai that focuses on copying branded goods for lower-priced markets both in China and abroad.  So copying can make good business sense. But is it ethical? The answer is simple: yes.  Copying breaks up monopolies and in doing so, serves a greater good. For instance, India and Brazil recently passed laws allowing pharmaceutical companies to copy certain branded drugs without paying licensing fees to developers.  Since both countries are huge emerging markets, in effect these policies now cheaply provide vital and lower-priced medication to millions of people.  Facebook is the most successful social network around today, but it certainly wasn’t the first of its kind. (Remember Friendster?) And that’s the thing – copying can lead to innovation. You take something that already exists and improve upon it. In fact, that’s the story of some of history’s most groundbreaking inventions, like the steam engine and the personal computer.  Which goes to show you that copying doesn’t just help differentiate similar products in a market, it actually can lead to totally new products! Digital music downloading first surged in popularity with the advent of platforms like Napster. Since the service allowed users to stream and share songs for free, the music industry fell into a panic. Major labels tried to find ways to stem the practice aside from simply throwing lawsuits around.  Legal streaming services like Spotify emerged as one viable solution. And although it started slowly, Spotify has grown in popularity and since 2008 has paid $2 billion in royalties to participating artists.  In essence, we really should share ideas instead of only competing. Because when it comes to progress, collaboration tends to be more efficient than competition. After two decades of working for the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, scientist Chas Bountra chose a misfit path, developing pre-competitive pharmaceutical research.  But what exactly is that? Bountra helped competitors collaboratively develop new medications and after a certain testing stage, the companies that collaborated are offered the opportunity to buy the exclusive rights to sell and distribute the drugs. By allowing companies to build on each other’s work instead of starting from scratch each time, the practice makes for more effective research. And at the same time, it preserves economic competitiveness.  What’s more, patents often act as deterrents to innovation by favoring large companies (with the financial resources to pay patent fees) over more independent and creative inventors.  The numbers tell the story, as between 1999 and 2008, some 48 percent of US patents were issued to just 1.5 percent of all patenting firms! When you hear the word “hacker,” what do you think of? A shady character, guzzling Red Bull and stealing credit card numbers from poorly secured servers?  We tend to forget that real hacking isn’t just about online theft and compromised privacy.  Real hacking is different. Think of Edward Snowden, who exposed the questionable surveillance activities of the US National Security Agency. His action was at its core about freedom of information. Similarly, the hacktivist collective Anonymous is about challenging authority. Hacking is about taking things apart and putting them back together in a better way.  Consider Sam Roberts, who started fiddling with electronics when he was nine years old, taking them apart and rebuilding them differently. He once created a burglar alarm system out of a pair of walkie-talkies! And when someone gave him a 2G mobile base station, he spent six months learning how it worked. Eventually, his deep knowledge allowed him to start a telecommunications business with his brother. In addition to hacking computers, we can also hack organizations – or even society.  That’s what Gary Slutkin did when he took on the problem of urban violence. A leading disease prevention expert by trade, Slutkin spent five years analyzing the sources and causes of violence in neighborhoods.  When Slutkin noticed that violence in a community spread like disease in a body, he decided to apply strategies from his medical career to address the problem. In the end, he developed a program allowing citizens to call in violence interrupters if they thought a violent incident was imminent. Primarily made up of community residents, this special task force would then try to de-escalate the situation.  Slutkin’s approach has proved promising and is being tested across the United States. In a way, he managed to hack inefficient prevention policies for the good of all. The first person who dreamed up the idea of an airplane surely seemed mad. But this goes to the heart of innovation: new ideas provoke people by upending their view of the world.  Think about everything that makes up your life, such as family, work and school. Innovation happens when we stop taking these things for granted and start questioning them.  At the age of 12, Dale Stephens decided to leave school, as he was frustrated with the regimented, fixed curriculum. Instead, he chose mentors and teachers who helped him follow his interests outside of the classroom.  That experience eventually led him to found UnCollege, a program that helps students carve out alternatives to a traditional university career. And although he’s constantly forced to defend his decision to leave school, Stephens has shown society that there are self-reliant, creative paths outside the traditional educational system.  Challenging the mundane is one path to innovation. But radical ideas can also come out of art.  At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, scientists are often inspired by novels and science fiction. Mind-bending stories can lead to progress and outside-the-box discoveries in the “real” world.  To be sure, the process of innovation doesn’t begin with answers. If you want to create something new, you have to ask provocative questions to broaden people’s minds and create a new level of awareness.  The results can be radical. The French feminist activist group, La Barbe, wears fake beards and crashes meetings at male-dominated organizations to draw attention to issues of gender inequality.  Unsurprisingly, video footage from the group’s protests often goes viral. The activists refuse to position themselves as experts; they’re not interested in presenting solutions. Instead, they want to raise awareness of gender equality within society as a whole. Society encourages us to play it safe. But taking risks often pays off.  Just ask Gib Bulloch. He had a comfortable, financially secure career at consultancy Accenture, but something was not quite right. He knew he wanted to make a difference in the world.  So he took a sabbatical to work for a development project in Macedonia, where he noticed a lack of business expertise among other development workers.  And that gave him the idea to build a new, non-profit department within Accenture to provide economic consulting for development organizations. The program allows employees to contribute to development projects for a period of time, temporarily receiving a reduced salary in exchange for greater personal fulfillment.  Within Accenture, this pioneering project has been wildly successful. Today it manages more than 200 different development projects annually.  Bulloch’s initiative shows just how valuable it is to take risks. And sometimes the biggest, scariest risks – the ones that throw us into a new, unfamiliar environment – are the best kind.  Former Brown University soccer player Tyler Gage abandoned an athletic career to explore the world, spending two years with an ethnobotanist in Costa Rica and nine months with a native tribe in the Amazon.  He also traveled to Peru, which is where he came up with the idea of developing a sustainable business around guayusa, a local plant used for tea.  And in doing so, he became a social entrepreneur. By introducing guayusa-based beverages to the US market, Gage supports Peruvian local farmers and helps battle rainforest destruction. We typically think of misfits as loners. But that’s not a totally accurate view. Although misfits do value autonomy and self-reliance, they also seek out collaborative networks. These freethinkers are attracted to communities that lack hierarchies and are made up of independent individuals.  Seeing the success of such structures, companies like Valve (which developed the bestselling computer game Half-Life and gaming platform Steam) are trying to emulate misfit communities within a corporate context.  At Valve, there’s no official hierarchy. Workers are encouraged to build informal work groups, and salaries are based on a reputational currency system. That means employees rate each other’s teamwork, technical skills and overall contribution. In the end, this aggregated score influences each person’s salary.  Which gets at an important point: cooperation is one of the great strengths of misfit communities.  Just look at Linux. The computer operating system was first introduced by one programmer as an open-source project. But over time, an enormous community of independent programmers and hackers has grown around it. And within this community, decision making is collective. This means that the group decides whether to implement changes to the operating system. And that goes to show that misfits aren’t always outlaws. When they belong to a community, misfits follow rules that are consistent with their beliefs.  This principle even applies to pirates, the prototypical misfits. In the eighteenth century, pirates developed an informal market that evolved around growing transatlantic trade. And community was at the core of this system. On each boat, pirates shared rights, obligations and profits (or loot) equally among crew members.  This communitarian structure created coherence and strengthened the bonds between crew members. And when pirates went after hierarchically organized trading ships, they had a major advantage! The key message: “Misfit” is not a dirty word. On the contrary, breaking the bounds of establishment thinking can lead to innovation and progress. Misfits have always led the way, shaping the course of history with provocative ideas and blatant disregard for rules and conventions. Today, society needs misfits more than ever to meet the challenges of our fast-changing world.  Actionable advice: Bring your misfit personality to work. We tend to leave our personalities at home when we head to the office, but it wouldn’t hurt to open up more. It’s OK to talk about your yoga practice at the workplace, as some of your coworkers might share your passion. You could even organize a group yoga exercise every morning, to help coworkers relax before starting a busy day! Suggested further reading: When To Rob a Bank by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J.

Despite massive efforts to combat them, the cartels have grown to become enormous enterprises, no longer just selling drugs, but playing a vital role in human trafficking as well. So how do these cartels work? How have they been allowed to grow to become such a big problem? These questions are exactly what these blinks will aim to answer, taking a detailed look at the drug industry, both in terms of how its members operate and relate to the challenges of the market, as well as the challenges for governments trying to stop them. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the legalization of drugs could be advantageous to society; why cutting the amount of drugs can lead to higher profits for the cartels; and how some drug cartels recruit their members. It was in 1971 that then-US President Richard Nixon launched the “war on drugs.” Between then and now, drug incarceration rates have shot up exponentially in the United States. But the amount of drugs being produced and consumed globally has not decreased; in fact, there’s more money in the drug market right now than ever before. How is this possible? Presumably, the US government wanted to tackle the drug problem at its root. As such, drug policy has been designed to attack the drug industry in one area – supply. Take crop dusting in South America, for instance. South American countries are an important source of many of the drugs that enter the United States. So, the US government entered into agreements with these nations to crack down on the farming of coca leaves by “crop dusting” them – that is, spraying pesticides on crops from low-flying planes to destroy them. This seems like a logical fix, right? After all, it’ll be harder for the drug industry to flourish if it doesn’t have the supply to meet demands. Unfortunately, things aren’t so simple. This approach has led to what researchers call the balloon effect. The phenomenon gets its name from the way that when one part of a balloon is squeezed, the air inside moves, but the volume of the air itself doesn’t decrease. Like air inside a balloon, cartels can also move around, in this case from one area of South America to another. When one government cracks down on coca crops, cartels just pack up and move to another country. As a result, the problem keeps moving around, but never really disappears. That’s not the only issue with the US government’s approach. Their supply-side attack targets farmers, without ever directly confronting cartels or consumption – two aspects without which the drug industry wouldn’t exist. Cartels can be described as monopsonies, that is, single buyers. Cartels decide how much to pay farmers, who are essentially at their mercy. By targeting impoverished farmers and not the cartels, the US “war on drugs” hardly gets to the real root of the problem. What’s more, when supplies decrease, consumers become okay with paying more for the same amount. Therefore, yearly revenue generated from drugs will remain the same or grow, even if supply decreases. It’s estimated that the US marijuana industry makes a whopping $40 billion each year. A total of $7 billion comes from the legal marijuana market, which is a fairly significant proportion. How does an economic arrangement like this benefit a government fighting a war on drugs? Well, legalizing marijuana allows the government to weaken drug cartels and generate revenue while doing so, by becoming the cartels’ rival and through taxation, respectively. Legal marijuana crops can be grown in better conditions. With access to larger fields bearing nutrient-rich soil, the resulting product is of a much higher quality than what most cartels can offer. This forces the cartels to reduce their prices in response to this new legal rival on the market, cutting their profits in the process. And, as with any other legal commodity, the government is able to make money off marijuana through taxation. In Colorado, for instance, marijuana was legalized in 2014. Just one year later, marijuana sales by head shops – shops licensed to sell the drug – hit $996 million in the state, with $135 million going to the state’s tax coffers. Of course, legalized marijuana also has a twofold benefit for its consumers. By supervising and regulating the growing and selling of marijuana, the government is able to ensure that consumers don’t experience any of the health risks that come with ingesting a bad batch of cannabis, which can send an unlucky user to the hospital. Legalization also opens up the growing of cannabis to horticulturalists, who are free to experiment with different plants and techniques. This leads to the creation of diversified products and higher customer satisfaction. In Colorado, marijuana legalization has even seen the introduction of a “cannabis menu.” All head shops in the state have a menu that provides customers with information about the expected high, side effects, the likelihood of a hangover and any other health risks regarding the products sold in the shop. So, it seems that dealing with the drug problem on the customer-facing side, rather than the supply side, has benefits for both governments and consumers. But to really get to the bottom of why attacking the supply side of the drug industry doesn’t work, let’s take a look at the cocaine trade. We’ve learned about the relationships between governments and cartels, but how do cartels behave toward each other? Well, from an economic standpoint, there are two possible models: competition and collusion. In Mexico, rivalry reigns as drug cartels compete violently with each other. Take the city of Juárez for example; the Juárez Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel are now famous for their brutal and public acts of vengeance against one another, which include dumping decapitated bodies on roadsides or hanging corpses from signs along the highway. It has been estimated that at least 60,000 people died between 2006 and 2012 as a result of the violent cartel rivalry in Juárez. As well as individuals directly involved in the cartels, many civilians, law enforcement officials and investigative journalists lost their lives in the crossfire. In El Salvador, on the other hand, drug cartels collude, which has both positive and negative consequences. Collusion is when economic competitors join forces to earn more money for themselves at the expense of the consumer and the overall market. In El Salvador, cartels set high prices, dividing up neighborhoods into dedicated segments and splitting profits among themselves. Consumers, as we learned in the first blink, are always willing to pay more. So, in the case of collusion, neither drug consumption nor the number of those working in the trade decrease. There is, however, a surprising social benefit: rates of violence and murder in El Salvador have decreased significantly. Back in 2009 before cartels began colluding, 71 people were murdered out of every 100,000 people in El Salvador, largely due to violent gang rivalry. But after the 18th Street Gang and Mara Salvatrucha partnered and divided the country into sectors, where each had rights to all operations and profits, violence and murder decreased significantly. By 2012, figures stood at 33 murders per 100,000 people, a marked improvement. While neither competition nor collusion affect the rate at which narcotics are sold and consumed collusion is much more beneficial to the community, since much less violence and murder occur as a result. Finding the right person for the job can be a headache for any business. But if you’re a drug cartel operating in total secrecy, you can’t just pop an ad in the newspaper or on LinkedIn when you need staff. So where do drug cartels find their new recruits? Doing human resources for drug cartels means looking in alternative places, like prisons. Cartels target inmates knowing that it’ll be difficult for them to find normal jobs back on the outside. Joining a cartel is a way for inmates to make sure they have work once they’re released. The Mexican Mafia, a US-based cartel, has its members reach out to new inmates not only to offer them jobs once they’re out, but to provide them with work while they’re still inside. Tasks inside jail include extortion and threats of violence against other inmates. Once new recruits are released, they’re set to work on trading and smuggling drugs. While some businesses concern themselves with the challenge of keeping employee satisfaction up, cartels experience human resources problems on a whole different level. Cartels suffer from what economists refer to as the collective action problem. This is where there is a conflict between the interests of the group and the interests of the individual. In other words, cartels need to ensure that their employees won’t steal from them. But how? By distributing power. Take Nuestra Familia, a cartel in Mexico. This cartel is built around a hierarchy of generals, lieutenants and soldiers. The general is in command and is the most powerful. Ten captains are ranked just below the general, each of whom is in charge of a certain number of lieutenants who, in turn, each lead a group of soldiers. In this system, power is distributed to ensure that lieutenants and captains have a say. A general can fire captains but cannot hire replacements, while the replacements are voted in by their lieutenants. Furthermore, though in charge, the general can be booted out by a unanimous vote on the part of the captains. This structure allows lower-ranking members to hold their superiors accountable, and ensure that leaders don’t take advantage of employees. By dividing hiring and firing privileges among the ranks, members can ensure they receive fairer treatment, and are likely to stay loyal as a result. These days, we expect businesses to demonstrate social responsibility. Some invest in employee health care, while others lead campaigns to support charities. But in most cases, businesses don’t do these good things to be good; most of the time, it’s a strategic public relations ploy. They simply want to look good and boost their brands above competitors. Interestingly enough, the same applies to drug cartels. Despite their unsavory line of business, cartels are known for trying to market themselves in a better light than their rivals. A common strategy is to decry the drug-related violence in their communities. Remember the Sinaloa cartel in the city of Juárez? They decided to demonstrate social responsibility by highlighting the city’s rising murder rate. They had billboards put up to condemn the violence and proclaim that their cartel would never target women and children, nor did they allow the kidnapping and extortion. This put them in a more positive light as compared to their rivals. Drug cartels also present themselves as heroes filling the voids left by failing public services. Well aware that law enforcement and social security are absent in their communities, cartels take up roles as protectors and patrons. Drug alms, known as narcolimosnas, are a great example of this – cartels take measures to give back to the community by distributing money among the poor, or by funding the construction of churches and chapels. Cartels also offer a form of security for individuals. By paying a fee, individuals can hire cartels to protect them or threaten or attack anyone bothering them. This way, cartels seemingly fill the role of the police. Ever wondered why certain consumer objects can be sold so cheaply? Low prices are usually the result of offshoring, when a company moves its production overseas to save money and boost profits. Cartels do exactly the same. Corrupt governments in other countries offer a great opportunity for cartels to make some money. Loosely enforced laws and weak governmental institutions create an ideal environment for drug cartels. In Honduras, for example, police officers’ salaries are low. The police force has neither the resources nor the incentive to go after cartels, who know just how easy it is to buy (or kill) individual officers off. As a result, Honduras became the destination for around 75 percent of cocaine smuggling flights between 2009 and 2012. And how do other national governments fighting the war on drugs tackle offshoring? Well, one way is to have the international community publicly shame the country in question for letting cartels have their way. This makes the country less appealing to transnational companies looking for places in which to invest, which is a strong incentive for a country to make changes quickly. One organization, Transparency International, alerts the international community to countries making life easy for drug cartels by publishing yearly corruption indexes that rank countries around the world. These reports include information for transnational companies looking to invest overseas, including the prevalence of bribery, national attitudes toward politicians, the use of public funds and crime rates. Through these reports, countries like Costa Rica have proven themselves better places in which to invest and do business in than countries like Guatemala and Honduras. While the latter two nations struggle with high murder rates and endemic corruption, Costa Rica was able to lift its score because of the impartiality of its judges and the reliability of police forces. What can drug cartels learn from the McDonald’s business model? Quite a lot, actually. Let’s take a look at how cartels use franchise models to make financial and political gains. A franchise is a business model whereby companies allow other individuals to undertake specific commercial operations as agents of their brands and organizations. The benefits of franchising for cartels are twofold, allowing them to both expand their territory and secure a steady stream of revenue. Rather than sending drugs from A to B, a cartel with a franchise agent, or franchisee, in a region that includes point B, can gain access to greater profits. Los Zetas, a criminal syndicate in Mexico, adopted the franchise model for these reasons. Los Zetas identified the regional markets over which they wanted influence, and partnered with local leaders there. This meant that rather than getting into conflict with local groups, and lose their soldiers, drugs, weapons and profits in the process, Los Zetas shared the total profit between themselves and the local leaders turned franchisees. In return, the franchisees provided protection for Los Zetas’ local leader and arms for their staff. In this way, franchising allowed Los Zetas to secure a certain amount of money without the risk of the gang losing members or spending more money than the region is worth. While franchising has many benefits for cartels, it's also a double-edged sword. For one thing, franchising often leads to competition within a territory, which results in a loss of revenue. To illustrate this, let’s imagine that two McDonald’s restaurants have opened next to each other. The revenue that can be gained from a certain area will be split between the shops, increasing antagonism between them. Similarly, if multiple local leaders and staff join a single cartel, revenue will be split among them and franchisees will earn less, which, in turn, will lead to conflict and tension. In addition, the decentralization of power that goes hand-in-hand with franchising makes it harder to hold someone accountable for mistakes. Why? Because with every franchise, it gets harder and harder to make sure everyone in the cartel follows the rules. In one instance, a Los Zetas member murdered a US Immigration and Customs agent working in Mexico, breaking the unwritten rule of Mexican cartels to never kill an American – especially not those working in law enforcement. The result was an increase of American and Mexican law enforcement arrests, which slowed down cartel operations considerably. Ever heard of legal synthetic drugs? Yes, they exist, and they pose a major challenge to governments combating the drug industry. Drugs can be created in such a way that they can be sold legally until they’re made illicit. Once a synthetic drug is made illegal, makers simply create a chemically altered version that’s technically a different legal drug. In the early 2000s, Mark Bowden, a New Zealand drug dealer, began selling benzylpiperazine, or BZP. This drug had been designed in the 1940s as an antiparasitic agent for cattle. But when humans ingested it, BZP created a rush similar to that of amphetamines. The drug was safe enough on its own, but led to dangerous anti-social side effects when consumed with alcohol. By April 2008, BZP had been outlawed. But this didn’t stop drug dealers, who knew they could always stay ahead of the law by changing the chemical composition of other amphetamines with a high similar to that of BZP. This leads to a cycle that creates huge regulatory problems for governments. The cycle goes like this: Drug manufacturers alter the composition of a banned drug to create a new legal drug. The new drug's harmful effects come to light, and regulators ban the drug. Then drug manufacturers alter its composition to make a new legal drug. And so on. Despite this, some governments are attempting to crack down on legal synthetic drugs by increasing safety procedures. Some even create labs that prove the safety of drugs as soon as they start circulating. Other governments also changed legislation to hold drug manufacturers accountable. This was the case in New Zealand, where laws were changed in 2013 so that it was up to drug manufacturers to prove that their drugs were safe, and not the prosecutor’s responsibility to prove that they were dangerous. Did you know that back in 1977, Coca-Cola made its first forays in the wine industry? It might sound like a strange business move, but all they were doing was diversifying – that is, expanding from their primary product to take on operations in another field to increase profit. Cartels use the same strategy. Many cartels have expanded from their primary service, drug smuggling, to another field: people smuggling. Why? Simple. Cartels go where the money is. As such, many have diversified their business to include smuggling people across borders, and specifically the United States-Mexico border. People smuggling into the United States has become economically lucrative due to the increase in security screenings following 9/11, as people struggling to move across the border seek out other options. Furthermore, people smuggling offers more financial security for cartels. While drugs can be seized at a border and prevent cartels from receiving their payment, those hoping to cross the border illegally must pay up-front. So how much does it cost to have yourself smuggled over the border? Well, it’s certainly not cheap, as prices are on the rise. Foot crossing with a guide but without documents has gone up from $2,000 to $5,000. Crossing with fraudulent documents used to be $5,000, but today costs around $13,000. For drug cartels, people smuggling has become great business, and one that has only required applying the structures they already had in place. After all, the drug industry knows no national boundaries, and nor does people smuggling, which again makes smuggling a particularly tricky matter for governments today. Widely differing drug laws in different countries mean that international cooperation has remained limited on what is truly an international problem. The director of the White House Office of National Drug Policy in the United States, for instance, has been in the strange position of having to speak out and take action against marijuana growing and sales abroad, while some US States like Colorado, Oregon and Washington have already legalized marijuana. The key message in this book: Although much emphasis is placed on attacking the drug trade from the supply side, an economic perspective on the behavior of cartels highlights how they can be weakened in the same way that a company might frustrate their rivals in a competitive market. As we struggle to formulate effective drug policies, it’s worth remembering that drug cartels, after all, are businesses – ones that create HR strategies, practice social responsibility, build franchises and diversify.

Tercek and Jonathan S. Adams","summary":"Mankind has achieved so much in taming nature. We have built barriers to keep out the sea, sewers to channel waste, and dams to hold our drinking water. All our activities seem pretty impressive, right? Well, what if we have been wasting our time? What if we already had a defense against nature, provided by nature itself? The uncomfortable truth is that many of our most effective pieces of infrastructure are natural, from floodplains to wetlands. In building our great defense systems we might be doing more harm than good. These blinks explain how we can benefit from nature’s bounty and how we should all be making efforts to protect the environment. In these blinks you’ll discover just how powerful an oyster bed can be; why Coca-Cola is very keen to protect the developing world’s clean water supplies; and why levees can directly lead to flooding in other areas. When we are confronted by dirty water what do we do? We build a sewage plant. When we are faced with a persistently flooding river we contain it with levees. In short, when nature provides us with a problem, we build man-made infrastructure to combat it. What’s more, we tend to take all this modern infrastructure for granted. So let’s just take some time to look and consider why we build them in the first place. We primarily set up infrastructure in order to access various services. For instance, dams and levees provide the service of shielding us against droughts and floods, and sewage and filtration plants provide safe and clean water in our homes and workplaces. All the pieces of infrastructure mentioned above are examples of human or gray infrastructure, so-called because it is usually made of concrete. The Hoover Dam, for example, is the largest water reservoir in the United States and consists of 3.3 million cubic metres of concrete. Just for scale, this is the same quantity that would be needed to construct nearly 40 Wembley Stadiums. But nature already provides us with a kind of green infrastructure that does the same job – lakes and reservoirs are naturally created bodies of water that do the same as a huge man-made dam. Green infrastructure can provide services to filter water, break down contaminants and store excessive water for use in dryer times. Remarkably, our coral reefs can even provide protection against flooding, as they break down waves before they get a chance to hit the land. You can see, then, that we already have many of the kinds of infrastructures we need to thrive in place on our planet. When we think of powerful companies and their impact on the environment, large-scale catastrophes such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill spring to mind. So it may come as a surprise that large companies are actually increasingly investing in nature, especially as they start to realize how much we rely on it. Environmental protection has become a trend that is rapidly gaining momentum in the business world. Since 2013, 400 of the largest 500 American companies have issued sustainability reports and many of them have committed to mitigating their environmental impact. Some companies have gone even further and spotted business opportunities in environmental protection. In 1996, Dow Chemical, the world’s second largest chemical manufacturer, came under regulatory pressure to increase the water treatment capacity of their plant in Seadrift, Texas. But rather than investing in gray infrastructure, Dow created a nearby wetland to filter the water. The motivation behind this was economic: constructing a water treatment plant would have sapped around $40 million of their budget, whereas a wetland serving the same purpose cost them a mere $1.4 million. Many companies have also begun to invest in nature as a reaction to seeing their core business come under threat. Today, for example, Coca-Cola heavily invests in water preservation and is committed to becoming water neutral by 2020. That means that for every drop of water they use in their products, they promise to return the same amount of clean water back to nature. But it was actually a PR disaster that sparked these conscientious efforts. In 2004, farmers’ wells in Kerala, India, dried up. The cause of this turned out to be a nearby Coca-Cola bottling plant siphoning off the communities’ groundwater, and as Coke’s transgressions were pointed out, a boycott against the company began in the Western world. The company had to take a long hard look at how their operations sourced water. Coca-Cola FEMSA, the world’s largest independent Coke bottler, also spends millions on water funds that finance projects for the protection of Latin American forests. Why? The reasons, again, are economic. Specifically, to lock down Coke’s most important ingredient: water, which is threatened by the decline of the forests. If your son came home from school and told you he got a D minus on his report card, you’d be right to be concerned. But what if that was the grade your country was given for some of its critical infrastructure? You may not know that the US levee system and the US wastewater facilities situation is rather dire. In fact, in 2009, both were hit with a D minus from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The type of gray infrastructure seen in much of the United States is fairly complex and often requires a lot of maintenance, usually demanding extensive construction work and complicated chemical, biological and/or physical processes. Consider water filtration. In 1989, when New York faced stiff regulations regarding its surface water, the estimated cost of a new filtration plant totalled around $8 billion. As this infrastructure would deteriorate over time, it would also require costly maintenance in order to keep it running. Under budgetary constraints, the problem would snowball as maintenance was neglected in an attempt to save money. New Yorkers decided against constructing another expensive filtration plant and instead opted for a cheaper, alternative venture: they began an environmental protection project in the Catskills, which supplied most of their water. At that time, farming was among the main sources of water pollution and so the project created monetary incentives for farmers to manage their land in a way that preserved clean water. The project was a huge success and not only resulted in long-term clean water, it also stimulated an economic boost for the region. This is where the benefits of green infrastructure become clear. It’s true that just like gray infrastructure, green infrastructure also decays. However, unlike gray infrastructure, it can renew itself. Hence it doesn’t require artificial maintenance. We simply need to let it be – meaning it’s often far less expensive than gray infrastructure. Our recent history tells a tale of persistent attempts at bringing nature under our control. In doing this, we’ve accomplished some significant innovations. However, our engineering has also sometimes created systems that changed things for the worse. It’s probably no surprise that gray infrastructure can come with negative effects or even increase the very risks it was designed to reduce. We can see this in our artificial flood protection, which usually doesn’t work particularly well. This is because seawalls engineered to shield shores against floods often redirect the wave energy back into the water and in doing so, wreak havoc on natural habitats. Our levees, too, sometimes increase the risk of river floods as they speed up the flow of rising water and then exacerbate flooding in populated areas. On the contrary, green infrastructure usually delivers services that aren’t harmful. For example, natural protection of shores against floods doesn’t damage habitats – it actually preserves them. Many shores, for instance, have oyster reefs that act as incredibly efficient natural coastal buffers. They are able to both redirect the wave energy and absorb up to 75 percent of it. Nature also regulates itself with floodplains, which are a superior method of flood control. Floodplains are flat areas near rivers where excess water flows if the river can no longer contain it. Unlike concrete levees, floodplains are able to adapt to changing river patterns. This could be seen in 2009, when the rainfall in Arkansas and Louisiana was much higher than usual and Monroe city officials nervously witnessed the water level of the Ouachita River steadily climbing. All of a sudden, the level dropped and the situation died down. But what exactly happened? A levee had burst 20 miles upstream of Monroe and the excess water from the Ouachita spilled into a vast area of abandoned fields that reconnected it with its floodplain. Green infrastructure – such as the oyster reef – usually serves multiple purposes. Oyster reefs don’t just buffer the land from the sea, they are also an important source of water filtration. Astoundingly, a single adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day. Scientists estimate that before their eradication from Chesapeake Bay, the local oysters filtered through the bay’s 19 trillion gallons of water every three days. Filtered water is essential for a flourishing habitat for animals and humans alike. Crabs and young fish need sea grasses and these only take root if the water is clear enough for sunlight to penetrate through to the ocean or riverbed. If we invest in environmental protection, the advantages invariably spread to multiple areas. This is particularly true regarding habitat restoration, like the creation of marine protection areas. These reserves ban fishing, which means that the fish can grow bigger and produce more offspring. Typically, four years after the protected zone is established, it will have enough fish for them to spill over to neighboring areas. This can also be good for local economies. In Fiji, researchers found that within five years of setting up two community-managed no-fishing areas, the spillover of the reinvigorated fish population approximately doubled the local income from fishing. Another benefit of preserving nature is that it allows us to enjoy areas for recreational purposes. Recent experiments suggest that interacting with nature improves our stress responses. In one study, for instance, scientists measured the stress levels of people taking a challenging math test. Those from rural areas responded with lower levels of stress than those who lived in cities. And the most stressed people? Those who had been born and raised in cities. Even with the knowledge that investing in the natural world is hugely beneficial, we can’t expect companies to jump at every chance to do so. That’s because companies want to know how soon they’ll see their returns. It follows, then, that short-term returns are the most attractive to businesses. This was the case in the mid-2000s, when sugarcane farmers in Cauca Valley, Colombia, were facing dwindling revenues. Water scarcity was a real issue and farmers were forced to cut back their yearly irrigation cycles, resulting in a loss of $6 million per year. So they joined a water fund conserving the Cauca River’s watershed. Although it came with a $1 million to $3 million price tag for eight years, this was abated by the fact that the farmers were able to keep running their five irrigation cycles per year. Eight years is not too long term for most businesses, but what about long-term investments? Investing in oyster reefs, for example, offers a lot of rewards, but it would take a private investor seeking increased fish stocks around 20 years to break even. In these long-term cases, the government needs to step in. Another point to consider is that the success of an investment usually depends on the characteristics of the market. Take deforestation in Brazil. In 2006, Greenpeace showed the connection between soy farming and deforestation. They honed in on McDonald’s, which quickly pressured Cargill, their main soybean supplier, to take action against the deforestation. As a result, Cargill agreed to purchase soy only from land that had been deforested prior to 2007. This was doable, as the soy business mostly involved larger farms that could be controlled by Cargill using satellite imagery. But the campaign against cattle farmers who were clearing the rainforest was unsuccessful. Cattle from thousands of ranchers couldn’t be controlled easily and farmers could sell their products locally. In this case the government would have to intervene if any meaningful change was to take place. A city park is an oasis in a concrete jungle. Remember the last time you went to a park? How did you feel? But parks need not be the only places city-dwellers can enjoy nature. Investing in greener cities could change the way we live. Our increasing urban population poses an important challenge. With more than half the people on the planet living in cities, we have become an urban species coming up against a variety of problems. These problems include elevated stress levels, asthma from air pollution and excessive heat. But it doesn’t stop there. City sewer systems often pollute the environment. One common type of sewer system accumulates both sewage and surface water from rainfalls. In times of heavy rain, combined systems buckle under the large volume and dump raw sewage into the rivers in order to prevent a system failure. This approach to sewerage needs to change, especially as by 2050, the population of cities is expected to increase by nearly three billion people. So how can creating green cities benefit us? Well, landscape architects and engineers have been working with a variety of techniques to make cities more like forests. First, rain gardens can be constructed next to sidewalks to absorb water and keep it out of the drainage system. Above the sidewalks, rooftops of buildings can be covered with soil and vegetation that also suck up rainwater. These methods cool and clean the air and reduce runoff by up to 80 to 90 percent. Green rooftops also insulate the buildings and save energy on heating and cooling. A 2009 study of Philadelphia’s $1.67 billion investment in green infrastructure found that, over 40 years, the total value of the green infrastructure will rise to almost $3 billion. Can you imagine a stampede of companies racing to invest in rainforests? In a competitive market economy, the companies that survive are the ones who are most effective at reducing costs, which leads to an efficient use of scarce resources. Right now, emitting tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere doesn’t cost a company anything, so nobody bothers to reduce emissions. So what if we put a price on the capacity to generate carbon emissions – the more emissions you make, the more you must pay – and allowed firms to trade their allowances for making carbon emissions? This is called the cap-and-trade approach. Each company can then decide whether it makes more financial sense to reduce its emissions and sell credits to others, or to purchase credits from other companies that have reduced their own emissions. The competitive market becomes an efficient tool in reducing environmental damage. In the United States, the cap-and-trade approach worked wonders at reducing acid rain. The 1990 Clean Air Act enlisted cap and trade to cut back on sulfur emissions from power plants, the main culprit behind acid rain. Since the law was signed, sulfur emissions in the United States have halved – at a far lower cost than economists predicted. This is where the stampede to invest in rainforest conservation comes in. Today, a shocking 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from the loss of rainforest. This is equal to the amount that the world’s traffic contributes. It’s cheaper to save a ton of carbon in the rainforest than to build or upgrade expensive filters to remove the CO2 from your factory’s emissions. Hence companies might save their credits by preserving rainforests rather than by reducing their own carbon emissions. The key message in this book: Economic growth and nature preservation don’t have to fight against one another. In fact, protecting the environment is in businesses’ very own interest. Nature provides a host of vital services that human engineering either cannot provide at all or can only recreate at a much higher cost. Actionable advice: See what nature can do. Search for “Oyster filtration” on YouTube to see an amazing time-lapse video showing how quickly oysters clean up a dirty aquarium.

Even if this prediction is still a longshot, advances in medical technology and better living standards are making it easier for people all over the world to live longer. Needless to say, this growing demographic poses serious challenges to the world economy, such as how exactly countries and markets will be able to support a new generation of centenarians. This dilemma is just one of four major global trends – or disruptions – that are transforming the world today. What are the others? These blinks will show you. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why money is getting more and more expensive; why you might not find your favorite gum in China; and how Netflix is blurring the boundaries of the media business. The quarter-century before the crash of 2008 was a time of unparalleled economic development. Interest rates were low; natural resources cheap; jobs plentiful and workers adequately employed.  But that phase is now over. Today, we’re entering a new phase, marked by four globally disruptive trends. These trends are: a shifting focal point of economic activity and dynamism; an acceleration in technology’s scope, scale and economic impact; an aging global population; and a greater degree of connection through trade, capital information and people.  While these trends certainly present major challenges, they’ve also been the driving force behind pulling some one billion people worldwide out of poverty since 1990.  In short, increased connectivity and advances in technology have spurred economic growth. The shifting locus of economic activity as a result has meant more development in ever more remote regions, further ameliorating the burden of poverty in these areas.  This new world is thus going to be wealthier and more urban, with higher skill levels and better health than previous generations.  These four global trends interact in complicated ways, however, which makes predicting future conditions increasingly difficult. Not just that, but such forecasts are often based on past experiences and outmoded ways of thinking. To succeed in this new world, we need to reformulate our prior notions about how the economy works. For instance, supply and demand traditionally says that when demand for financing is high, capital becomes more expensive; and then, demand will abate. But now the opposite is true. Emerging markets the world over are rapidly building capital-intensive infrastructure and spurring demand, even though the cost of financing continues to rise.  But this is just one example of how old ways of thinking aren’t keeping up with changing conditions. Let’s take a closer look at today’s four disruptive forces. Have you ever heard of Hsinchu? Few people have, yet this northern Taiwanese city is home to many of the world’s largest and most advanced electronics companies.  In fact, about half of global growth leading up to 2025 will originate in some 440 medium-sized cities in emerging markets – many largely unknown. In the years between 1990 and 2010, the world’s economic center experienced a rapid shift, more extreme than in any other point in history, and this shift was directed east, toward Asia.  One reason for this shift was the crisis of 2008 and the subsequent global recession, which had a greater impact on Western countries. The shift also occurred astoundingly quickly.  While Britain, with a population of less than 10 million, took 154 years to double its economic output per capita, China took just 12 years to do the same, with a population of more than a billion. Urbanization is one reason for this stratospheric growth. In just over a decade from now, China will have three times the number of urban dwellers as does the United States today.  The bottom line is that cities are powerful economic engines. At its core, a city is a productivity center that facilitates the rapid spread of knowledge and trends. A dense population means more exchange, but also often better infrastructure and stronger educational systems. Today’s cities are also attracting droves of talented, well-educated young people.  These elements taken together make cities ready-made creative laboratories for innovative companies looking to test new technologies, products and business strategies.  In fact, three-quarters of the gross domestic product gap between the United States and Europe can be explained by the fact that Americans are more likely to live in major metropolitan areas.  Yet urban areas also have their share of troubles, such as congestion, public services shortages and supply problems that can mean high costs for local operations. It’s factors such as these that make the port city of Luanda in Angola the most expensive city in the world. Technology is evolving faster and faster. In the 1990s, it took a team of scientists 13 years and $3 billion to sequence the human genome; today, one machine and $1,000 can do the job in a few hours.  It’s a fact that digitization and mobile internet access is fueling today’s technological revolution. Digitization, or the conversion of information into 1s and 0s, has indeed made it easier to store, process and share data. Physical products such as books can now be converted into digital formats.  But digitization also reduces entry costs and in general lowers barriers to market participation, which allows more entrepreneurs and small companies to experiment and innovate.  The growth and ubiquity of the internet is changing the game, too. Just consider the fact that 20 years ago, less than three percent of people in the world had a cellphone, and less than 1 percent had reliable access to the internet. Today, some two-thirds of all people own a mobile phone, and one-third can access the internet!  The revolution in technology has also meant that consumers are adapting to market changes faster than ever. Once Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, for example, it took some 50 years before even half of American households owned a phone. Yet a mere five years after the first iPhone was introduced, half of all Americans owned a smartphone. In fact, technological revolutions are happening so quickly that companies which can’t keep up will struggle and potentially fail. One poignant example is the technology company BlackBerry, which failed to anticipate the smartphone revolution. So while a company’s first instinct when faced with rapid change might be to play it safe and let the dust settle, companies need to realize that they’re in a race against time – and the technology of today will be old news tomorrow! Would you want to live to be 100 years old? Given the rapid pace of technological development, you just might. Yet a world with a large elderly demographic will present many new challenges. In 2013, approximately 60 percent of the global population lived in countries with fertility rates that were below the replacement rate – the rate that maintains a stable population, about 2.1 births per woman in developed nations, and 2.5 births in developing countries.  This trend means that a smaller global workforce will be reliant on increased productivity to keep driving growth to support a growing elderly population.  But a world with fewer workers and caregivers also makes elder care a question of technology. In Japan, for instance, robots now help elderly citizens dress themselves and go grocery shopping. Over the next few decades, populations everywhere excepting certain African countries will reach peak population for the first time in the modern age.  Some nations may be able to support a declining workforce with an increase in immigration, like Germany is trying to do, but the elderly population will still grow as life-expectancy rates rise.  Even though this trend has been obvious for some time, governments, communities and even corporations have been slow to come up with ways to adapt.  Pension systems, as just one example, need to change to meet rising life expectancies, such as increasing the age of retirement – or many people will simply struggle to survive.  Employers for too long have focused on maintaining a younger workforce. Instead of seeing older workers as valuable experts, they’re viewed as a costly legacy. The elderly have been ignored as consumers, too. So while senior citizens spend less on entertainment and eating out, they do spend more on home furnishings, medication and household electronics. Some companies however have rethought their strategy in tapping this market, like Fujitsu, which is developing a walking cane with a built-in navigation system. You might have studied abroad, or perhaps have close friends who live in another country. At the very least, you certainly have purchased a product that was made abroad. All these things are solid proof that the world is growing more connected every day.  In fact, trade between countries and continents is rising. For instance, while China and Africa booked $9 billion in trade activity in 2000, by 2012 this number had risen to $211 billion. But it’s not just trade that’s become more global; people, finance and data, too, are crossing borders.   Yet this increasingly interconnected world also means increased vulnerability. Shocks in seemingly remote areas, which decades ago would have caused less than a ripple in the global market, now have global repercussions. Unrest in the Ukraine or financial strife in Greece are just two examples of events that affect everyone, not just local citizens. This is a result of trade and interconnectivity not simply growing but broadening and branching out to form a truly global web.  Money in particular is flowing across the globe; despite the 2008 financial crisis, global money transfers are still on an upward trend. Not just that, but people too are more connected globally. In fact, migration numbers in the 1990s doubled during the first decade of the twenty-first century, especially growing between developing regions.  And of course, the labor market is almost entirely globalized. But the most dramatic change of recent years is likely the speed at which information travels around the world.  For business, increased connectivity holds huge potential. That’s because global interconnectivity is opening up the market to greater competition.  One of the many examples of companies that have benefited from this new climate is German micro-multinational company Solar Brush, a Berlin-based start-up that designs lightweight robots to clean solar panels. Today the company has an office in Chile, and supports customers across America and the Middle East.  Without the connections and affordability of modern technology, such a nimble company could never have existed! It’s clear the world is changing. Thriving in the new global economy means living in reality, not the faded glory of the past. One thing that needs to be accounted for is the heterogeneity of the new global consumer class, which makes segmentation and localization more essential than ever.  In 1990, for instance, 43 percent of the developing world’s population lived in extreme poverty. Today 700 million fewer people live in poverty, and the consumer class has grown by 1.2 billion. These people are now online and purchasing items – yet don’t get distracted by the group’s sheer size.  While new markets are growing, they’re also fragmenting. That’s because there’s no quintessential global consumer – companies need to understand local markets. For example, the instant coffee Nestlé sells in China is sweeter than it is in the West; and while chewing gum company Wrigley holds a 40 percent market share in China, it didn’t earn it with its best-selling spearmint but with locally specific flavors.  An understanding of a local market is essential, but so is securing local channels of distribution. For instance, Coca-Cola makes sure to analyze and segment its range of retail outlets, from the biggest stores to bicycle-powered micro-distributors in Africa.  Companies also need to prepare for unexpected competition. In fact, with barriers to entry lowered due to technological advances, small companies everywhere have the chance to take on and beat world leaders. That’s exactly what happened to eBay when it fell second to Chinese-based Alibaba, which a mere decade ago was just a minor player in the Chinese online market.  Technology is also blurring business lines, fostering new competition. For instance, Netflix got its start using the internet to distribute content, acting like a video rental store. But as the company grew, it began to dabble in content production, an activity generally kept separate from distribution.  The result? Netflix today is a formidable content producer, competing with major studios for consumer attention. So you’ve seen how world markets are being shaken up, and that as a result, global businesses can run into trouble. But this shouldn’t scare you out of the game.  However, to stay on track and succeed it’s important to be clear about the risks and opportunities.  Many commodity prices are climbing as demand grows worldwide. At the same time, the global market for resources is growing more connected. Yet there are still other factors contributing to a steady rise in global prices. Environmental costs are becoming increasingly an issue, as extreme weather due to climate change causes market disruptions and a subsequent rise in prices. According to the Brookings Institute, if the health and environmental costs linked to coal were taken into account, the price of the commodity would increase 170 percent! So is there a way to manage these spiraling costs? By producing less waste, building better logistics networks and recycling used products, we can find new opportunities amid scarcity.  But governments will also have to remain vigilant and flexible in policy, as these issues too will affect labor markets, regulations and education. Only by being open and adaptive to change will governments find the right method to tackling the new world’s challenges.  In the future, governments should employ incentives to accelerate change, such as with the pressing need to address aging populations. Fair regulations should be crafted in direct response to these needs, to ensure that information flows easily and businesses are allowed to run smoothly.  Naturally, every country will need to find the right mix of strategies for its particular situation.  Estonia is a great example of a country that has harnessed information to increase productivity. The country’s 1.3 million citizens use electronic ID cards to vote, pay taxes and gain access to over 160 semi-private services, such as property registration.  Before 2008 when world markets were more stable, it was possible to make longer-term predictions. Unfortunately that’s no longer an option.  The demand for cash today is on the rise. By 2030, the world will need to spend some $57 trillion to $67 trillion on improving infrastructure such as roads, buildings, telecommunications networks, ports and water systems. However, it’s still unclear whether this money will even be available. How can that be? Before 2008, cash was cheaper to acquire, yet today things have changed. Capital now is more expensive, which makes investing a challenge; and market systems in general are more volatile. Yet since we can’t say whether we’re entering a period in which expansive monetary policies and the monetization of debt – tactics that have long been viewed as taboo – are going to become common practice, we have to prepare for both scenarios.  So thriving in this new environment means tapping new capital sources, including sovereign wealth funds such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority or the Korea Investment Authority, and dealing with market risks in a more flexible manner.  Another uncertainty is how jobs will develop. While many regions recovered from the recession, an increase in jobs didn’t follow. At the same time, higher-skilled workers are being replaced by technology.  As a result, our very definition of work is transforming, becoming more about what people do wherever they are and less about a fixed location.  But this changing definition brings with it a paradox: while we’re seeing a shortage of highly-skilled labor, we’re also witnessing at the same time a situation in which it’s harder for college graduates to find jobs.  Overcoming this will require companies to adapt creatively. That doesn’t just mean seeking out talent from overseas but also investing in education. The automotive industry in the United States, as one example, has taken the initiative to train its own workers. The Automotive Manufacturing Training and Education Collective partners with car companies and community colleges to create courses designed with employers’ needs in mind. The key message in this book: The world economy is in transition. Poverty is decreasing and consumption is on the rise. These changes are throwing into question long-held assumptions about world markets and how they work. To adapt productively, companies, governments and individuals need to be open-minded and flexible.  Actionable advice: Do your research before entering a new market.  Cities are rising centers of consumption, which means local research is more important than ever. So while consumption patterns in large metropolitan regions like New York or Mexico City are relatively similar, that doesn’t mean consumption in all American cities is comparable to all Mexican cities. Thus you need to do research as close as possible to the regional market you want to tap.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But if these endless sets of numbers play such a crucial role in our lives, why don’t we give them more consideration? These blinks aim to remedy the lack of attention paid to statistics, providing rich examples of how we can learn from statisticians to better our world. You’ll learn about the five principles that are central to statistical thinking, and how they can be used to make sound decisions.  In these blinks, you’ll also learn how long lines at Disney World can be avoided; how statistics can fight the spread of E. coli;  what dying in a plane crash has to do with winning the lottery. Have you ever been at an amusement park, waiting in line for a ride in the hot sun thinking, “if they just had one or two more roller coasters, all the lines would be shorter”? While it may seem that adding attractions would lead to quicker queues, it’s actually not the case. Why? According to statisticians, and using the example of Disney World, it’s the varying pattern of when guests arrive at the amusement park, and not the average number of guests arriving, that makes the lines so mind-numbingly long. Since lines form when demand exceeds capacity, it seems logical that if Disney World accurately predicted demand, they could build capacity to accommodate it. Unfortunately, it’s not so simple.  Statisticians are positive that even if Disney could accurately predict the number of park visitors hopping on the Dumbo ride on a peak day, a line would still form because guests come at irregular intervals throughout the day, and because the ride’s capacity remains fixed. So, planning for capacity can deal with average rises in demand, but not with fluctuating demand.  Disney has come to deal with this issue using a feature called FastPass, which entitles guests to come back to a ride at a designated time and jump into an express lane. FastPass works because it reduces the variability of guests arriving at any given time. So, while it doesn’t change the ride goers’ actual waiting times, it does give them the freedom to enjoy other activities in the meantime, thereby boosting customer satisfaction.  But theme parks aren’t the only place this logic plays out: statisticians can point to the same trend in traffic jams. Just like at Disney World, highway congestion is the result of suddenly high volumes of cars, which exceed the road’s average capacity.  To deal with this issue, the Minnesota Department of Transportation uses a technique called “ramp metering”, in which traffic lights on ramps regulate the pace at which cars enter the highway, thereby stabilizing the number of cars on the road.  To understand the basics of how statistical reasoning can be applied to real-life situations, it’s helpful to consider two examples: the first offers a peek at epidemiologists who try to explain the causes of diseases; and the second shows how credit modelers seek correlations that indicate a person’s financial responsibility – essential information for banks and insurers.  In the first example, epidemiologists use statistics to identify causal relationships that can pinpoint the outbreak of a disease and its origin. For instance, in September of 2007, several patients in the United States tested positive for E. coli, a bacteria that can lead to severe discomfort, kidney failure and even death. These few cases were enough to uncover the disease’s source and protect the health of others.  How? Five of the affected patients from Oregon were questioned intensively about what they eat. The food that four of them had in common was bagged spinach. From there, existing statistics were consulted, which showed that only one in five Oregonians would eat spinach in any given week. The data allowed the epidemiologists to pin the outbreak on spinach, since the ratio of consumption evidenced in the patients was much higher than that of a typical Oregonian.  But statistics can be used for more than revealing contaminated vegetables. By identifying patterns, credit modelers can determine a person’s creditworthiness.  For example, in America today, many people take out mortgages quickly without undergoing invasive interviews. Creditors don’t need to ask people loads of questions before lending them money because a computer essentially already has, tracking a person’s innumerable past loan decisions and identifying patterns, or correlations.  A mortgage lender may have discovered a correlation among borrowers in a particular line of work, and an inability to repay loans. Using this information, they can then instantly determine the creditworthiness of an application. As the idea of correlation demonstrated, differences between groups of people are essential to statistical reasoning. Whether they show disparities between an older generation and a younger one, or people who hold a college degree and those who don’t, group differences are fundamental to statistics.  For one, statistics take group differences into consideration to design fair exams. Statisticians can make sure standardized tests like the SAT are fair by omitting questions that give preference to one social demographic over another. For example, a question could be unfair if its phrasing is clearer for white test-takers than for the African-American community. To determine which questions are fair, statisticians compare the performance of black and white students on any given question. However, a difference in performance doesn’t necessarily imply an unfair question – statisticians must also take any group differences into account.  In this example, group differences would be present if one group of students constituted a majority of low-performing students and the other constituted a majority of high performers. To take this difference into consideration, statisticians don’t compare all African-American students to all white students, instead comparing both high-performing and low-performing students of each demographic.  Group differences are also key to fair insurance, a system that works by collecting premiums from a majority of policyholders to subsidize the damages incurred by a few. This model seems fair, since anybody could be on the giving or receiving end of an accident. However, our insurance system is unfair when group differences between insured people aren’t considered.  For instance, if property insurance treated houses along a coastline the same way as inland houses, all homeowners would pay the same premium based on their average exposure to risk. However, statistics show that houses located inland are much less likely to be affected by natural disasters like hurricanes than their counterparts with an ocean view. Armed with this information, insurers can adjust the premiums according to the relative risk.  It may seem that, in modern times, it’s difficult to keep the truth from surfacing. After all, people have developed all manner of methods to uncover facts, like drug testing to expose steroid use among athletes, or polygraphs to unearth what people won’t admit. However, these modes of testing are not entirely error proof. In fact, if testing for drug use, two types of errors can cause problems: the false positive, when an athlete who did not take drugs is falsely accused of doing so, and the false negative, when an athlete who did cheat is exonerated.  As a result, the people administering drug tests face a trade-off: if they try to minimize false positives, an error that serves to diminish their authority, their actions will bear the unintended side effect of letting more cheaters walk free. Assume that ten percent of all athletes use performance-enhancing drugs. As testers are trying to avoid false positives, they use testing methods that only return positive results when the evidence definitively points to cheating.  As a result, statistics show that only about one percent of athletes test positive. However, since we know that about ten percent of all athletes use drugs to cheat, we also know that nine percent of them test negative despite using drugs. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that nine out of ten athletes who use drugs get away with it.  Lie detector tests are prone to the same unavoidable trade-off. Polygraphs work by monitoring the test subject’s medical statistics – like their breathing or blood pressure – while they are asked a series of questions. The collected data can point to false information by showing a correlation with changes in the person’s physiological state.  Naturally, the detectives administering the tests want to avoid false negatives, that is, criminals who go free. However, the problem is the same as with the athletes: avoiding false negatives means accruing false positives and accusing many innocent people. While most people wouldn’t associate the field of statistics with fighting crime or erasing irrational fears, statistical logic can do exactly these things.  Statistics teach us to question patterns that appear obvious. For instance, on October 31st, 1999, an EgyptAir jetliner plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, leaving no survivors. But between 1996 and 1999, before this tragedy occurred, three other jets had crashed into the ocean right around the same location.  As a result of the EgyptAir crash, some people stopped flying in the area. Their logic was that four crashes in four years was too many to be a coincidence, and that it must indicate some kind of disaster-prone pattern in the region. However, statisticians looked at the bigger picture, and while they saw the four crashes in four years, they also saw millions of planes safely traversing the same airspace during the same period. As a result, they questioned what appeared to be an obvious pattern. In fact, statisticians approximate that the odds of dying in a plane crash are one in ten million – about the same chances of winning the lottery.  On the topic of the lottery, it provides a good example of how statistical thinking also teaches us to question patterns that appear unusual. For instance, between 1999 and 2005, the Ontario Provincial Lottery issued tickets resulting in 5,713 “major” winners, meaning people who raked in prizes of 50,000 Canadian dollars or more. But what’s more shocking is that 200 of the winning tickets were cashed in by the very store owners who sold them.  Assuming fair conditions, store owners shouldn’t be any more likely to win than anybody else. A statistical analysis of the lottery winners exposed that store owners should have accounted for only 57 wins instead of 200.  The statisticians’ findings led them to suspect fraud, a hypothesis that was proven correct when it was revealed that most of the winning store owners had cheated by claiming they held the winning tickets of others who had just earned a free play.  The key message in this book: Statistics are based on five key principles. Statisticians search for variations from the average, uncover causation and reveal correlation, account for group differences, are realistic about the unavoidable trade-offs they face and question patterns whether they appear obvious or odd.  Actionable advice: Use statistical thinking to overcome your fear of flying. If you’re one of the many people who fear flying, a bit of statistical logic might help. A key principle of statistics is to question patterns, so if your fear is a result of a recent spell of plane crashes, you might be able to overcome it by considering what the pattern really indicates. Remember that for every plane that crashes, thousands of others land safely at their respective destinations; the odds of dying in a plane crash are about 1:10,000,000!

In this seminal text on tyranny and personal liberty, Mill discusses the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. He lays the foundation of liberal political thought and our contemporary understanding of freedom of religion and speech – topics that continue to raise heated controversy. His insights are valuable, not only to those who wish to create fair and just governments, but also to those who want to rationally evaluate their own behavior and their own assumptions about the world around them. In these blinks, you will learn when society has the right to punish you for a night of heavy drinking, why democracy alone can’t ensure your personal liberty and why you have the right to save someone from an accidental death. Throughout the course of history, democratic self-government was developed in order to end tyrannical rule. From ancient Greece to England, nearly every society has struggled with its share of tyrants. In fact, in the somewhat distant past, tyrannical and strong leaders were even viewed as an important tool for ensuring societal security and order. Gradually however, it became obvious that these leaders, who had either inherited or conquered their lands, often acted against the interests of their subjects. More and more people began realizing that the power of political authorities should have limits. The democratic process is designed to achieve this check on political powers, with the key component being the people electing their officials. Yet, democracy didn’t solve everything. Democratically elected officials can threaten personal liberty, just as tyrants do. Those who fought for democracy thought that, once the interests of political rulers and the people are identical, there would be no danger of tyranny. Not so! Even when the government is elected democratically and acts responsibly, there is still a need to limit the power of society and government; democracy doesn’t equate to self-governance, but governance over every individual by the majority. This majority can easily become tyrannical and therefore threaten personal liberty via social tyranny, i.e., the imposition of beliefs and ideals onto those who hold different views. Imagine, for example, that the majority adhered to a single religion. By using the democratic rule, the majority could use the force of the government to impose this belief on religious minorities. Clearly, democracy alone cannot guarantee personal liberty. But there are some steps we can take to avoid the dangers of social tyranny. If democratic societies want to protect liberty, then they will have to examine various aspects of their culture that cannot be understood without thinking about historical processes and human behavior. The question of personal liberty must be addressed from a rational point of view. Yet, the rules and laws of a society as well as public opinion are influenced mainly by the likes and dislikes of a given society. In other words, they are entirely irrational. What’s more, all people in that society almost automatically assume that their customs are right and good. Consider, for example, how people follow the beliefs and customs of a particular religion without ever asking themselves why they do so. If a Muslim, for instance, who does not eat pork, were raised in a Christian society, she would probably have no qualms at all about eating pork, and would instead forgo all types of meat during Lent. As a result, modern civilizations have made little progress regarding the question to what extent social control is justified, since the issue of personal liberty has never been considered from a rational perspective. The sole exception to this lack of progress is, strangely enough, the existence of religious tolerance in modern societies. After centuries of conflict, religious groups on the European continent have simply had to accept that religious tolerance is necessary for stability, and that the individual should determine which religion he wants to follow. But religious tolerance was born out of necessity, not rational principle. As long as there are no clear principles that define when governments may legitimately exercise power over individuals, and we instead rely on our irrational feelings and the convictions of our social environment, there is no guarantee that our personal liberty will be protected. Therefore, we must identify a rational, more objective principle. But what does such a principle look like? What if someone you know is unconvinced that the powers of society and the government should have limits? How could you respond? What reasons could you provide to convince him otherwise? Some philosophers such as John Locke have argued that ethical standards follow from natural or inborn rights. But, as we’ve seen in the previous blinks, what we define as “natural” is very much subjective, based on the cultural whims of the societies in which we participate. In order to discuss the question rationally, we have to approach the concept of an ideal society based on the concept of utility: how beneficial is the law or other aspect of governmental rule to the well-being of humankind? In fact, only a society that respects personal liberties based on utility will flourish. Without the freedom to make their own decisions as individuals, people will be unable to develop their own mental and moral capabilities, which will hurt their character and well-being. However, personal liberty isn’t just important for the individual; it’s also important for society as a whole. Only in a liberal society are people free to develop their own skills and ideas and realize their individuality. The diversity of individuality empowered by personal liberty has the potential to result in an environment in which people learn from each other and combine their strengths, thus helping all of humanity to further progress. Indeed, history has shown that societies that value diversity over conformity have a greater shot at flourishing in this world. But should there be any limits on personal freedom? Should we really be free to do whatever we want? The following blinks will explore these questions in more depth. No one else is responsible for an individual’s well-being other than the individual herself. As human beings, we have the capacity to come to our own judgments through careful reflection; people must decide on their own what to think and do, and no one should be allowed to exert their will on someone else’s liberty. One exception, however, is children. While adults have the mental capacity to make sound decisions, children, on the other hand, lack the maturity to do so. As a result, it’s acceptable for adults to interfere with children’s liberty, in their own best interest. The same is true for societies that are still less developed, and are therefore not ready for personal liberty. In this case, political authorities may exercise authoritarian rule in the interests of their people. However, in advanced societies, individuals can be trusted to know best what they desire and what is good for them. Here, neither society nor the government may interfere. Furthermore, society must not impose its beliefs and way of life onto all individuals.  Unfortunately, members of a given society sometimes hold the view that it would be better for an individual’s health or morality if they followed the particular religious ideas and moral norms of that society. These people often even feel offended by the way others live and act, and might even want to prevent them from living this way. For example, because Islam prohibits eating pork, some Muslims believe that nobody should be allowed to eat pork. Or consider the seventeenth century English Puritans, who wanted to forbid both public and private entertainment. However, holding these views does not give you the right to impose them on others. Individuals are well within their rights to attempt to convince others to adopt their beliefs, but society may not impose these beliefs with the force of law. So, in principle, members of modern societies have the liberty to do what they want. This liberty, however, has some limits. There are some strong cases for limiting an individual’s freedom in order to prevent harm. For example, society has the right to stop those who get drunk and then act violently. Drunkenness alone is no reason to revoke someone’s liberties. But we may certainly revoke the liberties of those who have already acted violently under the influence of alcohol and get drunk again, for example, by imposing fines or jailing them. Because they are prone to become violent when they are intoxicated, getting drunk in their case is a crime against others.   However, sometimes not doing things can harm the people around us, too. Consequently, society is justified to force individuals to do things that they might not want to do, such as make their fair contribution to finance infrastructure projects, like hospitals or roads. In addition, interference in personal liberty can be justified to save others from accidents. Although no one has the right to interfere with the liberty of individuals if no one is harmed, sometimes people are genuinely ignorant of the harm their actions might cause to others or themselves. Suppose, for example, that someone is about to cross a bridge without knowing that this bridge is structurally unsound. Suppose too that a police officer is around, but there isn’t enough time to warn the person of the dangers he faces. In this case, the officer may pull the person back, thereby restricting his freedom of movement in order to save him, because we can safely assume that it was probably not the person’s intention to injure himself.  You might feel hurt when someone takes a parking spot you wanted, but is this the kind of harm we’re talking about? Would it justify interference from society or the government? Probably not. So when does harm justify interference with someone’s liberty? Not everything that might have negative consequences for others actually justifies interference. In fact, interference is only justified when somebody harms others by violating an obligation he has towards someone else or society in general. For example, although people are generally allowed to get drunk, it is clearly forbidden for on-duty police officers as they are responsible for the security of society. Similarly, people have obligations towards their families. Although it is not society’s job to stop people from drinking or gambling, when it leads to a situation in which people no longer care for their families, these vices can be considered punishable offenses. Clearly, preventing harm is a complex issue. Some might suggest, for example, that, because certain things will necessarily cause damage to individuals and societies, we have an obligation to prevent that harm. For example, some shops sell poisons that could cause harm or death under the wrong circumstances. However, because this is only potential harm, interference in our liberties isn’t justified. Not only are arguments in favor of preventing potential harm easily misused, but allowing these liberties can lead to social benefits. For instance, shop owners who sell poisons can employ more people as long as they can sell those products, and those employees in turn use that money to stimulate commerce. If society is truly afraid of potential harm, such as poison abuse, then it can take other measures to prevent accidents, like educating people on poisons or requiring purchasers of poison to submit personal data. As you can see, what qualifies as harm and what measures should be taken against it aren’t as simple as they might first appear. So far, we’ve focused mostly on the freedom to carry out actions. The following blinks focus on the importance of our more abstract freedoms: the freedom of ideas. Nowadays, there seems to be no question that freedom of thought and speech are protected and respected. However, many people have probably never thought deeply about why these liberties are so important to begin with. As we’ve seen, when it comes to their beliefs and convictions, people too easily follow the opinions of their social groups and accept the words of institutions, such as the church or political parties, as absolute truth. However, neither we, nor the authorities to whom we defer our judgments, are infallible. In order to uncover truth, everybody must have the freedom to think freely and to express her opinion. Suppressing others’ freedom of thought and speech will inevitably suspend the discovery of truth, and therefore harms humankind.    History offers many good examples of the suppression of ideas because they did not conform to popular societal beliefs. Even Socrates, one of the most important philosophers of all time, to whom humankind owes so many insights, was killed because people believed his ideas were dangerous. But it’s not only “true” opinions that need protection. Even if they aren’t 100 percent accurate, contrary opinions might contain enough truth to still be valuable to society. Sometimes, opinions can add to the public discourse precisely because they are only partially true, and discussing them further helps us get to the truth underneath. For example, we now know that Newton’s theories were not completely correct. However, if society had barred him from expressing his thoughts because his theories contradicted common knowledge, we would have lost many important insights that led to major scientific progress!  But what if someone’s opinion is clearly wrong? Should he be granted the same liberties? Most of us probably think that some opinions are just flat out wrong, and that people who hold those opinions would be better to just keep their mouths shut. This is especially true for hot-button issues, such as abortion or gender equality. But would this actually be good for society? In short: no. Incorrect opinions are valuable in that they force society to think about common, entrenched beliefs and reflect on why their opinions are correct. If a society wishes to commit itself to the pursuit of truth, then it is necessary that people be confronted with contrary opinions, otherwise they just blindly follow the beliefs of an authority or of the majority. To come back to the example of gender equality: it isn’t enough to accept gender equality simply because laws say so. We must also understand why equal rights are justified and why they are important. In this sense, whenever we are confronted by people who reject the notion of equal rights across the gender spectrum, we are forced to reflect on why our beliefs are justified and why great moments in women’s rights are such achievements. Furthermore, if our common convictions are not continuously questioned, they will eventually be formally accepted and become ineffective. If we want to ensure that our most treasured convictions don’t lose their power to affect our character, then it is necessary for us to be continuously confronted with contrary opinions. Otherwise our various ethical and moral convictions become reduced to mere custom and we forget the underlying reasons. Freedom of thought and speech are fundamental liberties that must be respected and protected, no matter how questionable the thought or speech may seem sometimes. The key message in this book: The whims of culture and society aren’t objective enough to make democratic governance a strong protector of our personal liberties. Instead, societies must use rational principles in deciding which kinds of behaviors should be tolerated, in order for the individual and society to flourish.

What makes this kingdom so special, though, is its unique history. After World War I, the Ottoman Empire was no longer around to keep the peace in the Arabian Peninsula and, in 1932, after a lengthy military conflict between local tribal leaders, a new Saudi Arabian state was founded. It’s leader was King Ibn Saud. The kingdom fared better than some of its neighbors. In 1938, large quantities of oil – which is still the bedrock of the economy – were discovered. Much of the population, however, lived in utter poverty – and still does. As non-religious tourism is still extremely limited, the following blinks will give you a unique look at the region that gave birth to Islam. In these blinks, you’ll learn how women fit into the male-dominated Saudi society; what role social media is beginning to play in youth activism; and why immense oil wealth isn’t solving Saudi economic problems. If asked to think of royalty in a Western nation, you’d probably think of Britain. The British royal family has fascinated people for many generations – but no one has ever considered letting them run the nation’s government. Yet this is exactly how it works in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s king has practically unlimited power: He nominates the top religious leaders, appoints all the judges and chooses who makes up the 150 members of the country’s powerless parliament. Furthermore, throughout the nation, the various regions are ruled by princes with blood ties to the king. To ensure a pristine public image, the king has put his relatives in charge of Saudi Arabia’s media outlets. And he also pays close attention to social and civic organizations to make sure they are discouraging people from organizing any political protests that might threaten the monarchy. This power is backed by the royal family’s vast wealth, which derives from the primary driver of the nation’s economy: petrol oil. However, the king’s power over his people has more to do with religious influence than economic coercion. It wasn’t until the nineteenth century that Saudi Arabia settled down to having one absolute ruler. Before then, rival factions of nomadic Bedouin tribes ruled the land – recognizing no single absolute leader. However, following a thirty-year military campaign, King Ibn Saud defeated the rival Arabian houses in 1932, conquering what would eventually become known as Saudi Arabia. At the top of the new king’s to-do list was making sure that the Bedouin tribes remained loyal to his leadership. For this to happen, he needed to change the country’s social structure. He used Wahhabism, a puritanical form of Islam, to convince the nomadic tribes to form settlements and communities known as umma, where people share one belief and obey the Qur’an without question. Since the royal family, and Ibn Saud, were considered to be Allah’s representatives on earth, this arrangement would guarantee that the newly formed monarchy would be followed with unquestioning loyalty. Whether you grew up in a secular or slightly religious culture, you’re probably familiar with a prayer or two for a certain holiday. Maybe you say grace with your family before eating dinner. In the West, it’s common for religious commitment to be casual. This casualness becomes especially pronounced when compared with the centrality of religion in Saudi life. In Saudi Arabia, everyone is well acquainted with salat, the Muslim prayers that people are obligated to perform five times a day. These are quite different from the prayers of Western religions, which are often focused on giving thanks and praise. Muslim prayers are a very formal ritual that ends with prostrations toward Mecca – a submissive gesture to Allah’s will. And there is only one proper way to perform a salat, which begins with the worshiper purifying himself by washing his hands, forearms, face, nose, mouth, ears, head and feet. Moreover, there is no excuse not to pray. Wherever they might be (mid-conversation, shopping, walking on the street), people in Saudi Arabia will stop, take out their prayer mat and begin the ritual. However, due to ongoing conflict between the nation’s religious leaders, the religious establishment is often in disagreement with itself. At the center of this conflict are differing opinions about how men and women should, or shouldn’t, interact in society. In 2009, a senior Saudi Arabian religious scholar, Sheikh Shatri, criticized how men and women were mixing at the kingdom’s new universities. Other religious scholars disagreed, and, in their defense, they pointed to Prophet Mohammed, who was known to have socialized with women he wasn’t related to, some of whom even washed his hair. This led the head of the vice police to order his officers to stop interfering with men and women who wished to meet in public spaces. (The grand mufti – the highest religious authority aside from the king – expressed his displeasure in this.) All of these disputes could be read in the public newspapers, and, as a result, people began to feel that Wahhabi Islam’s rules perhaps weren’t so absolute and unwavering. It’s easy to feel isolated and alone, even if you live in a crowded city. But there are many reasons for a Saudi Arabian to feel this way. For generations, Saudi Arabian society has been one of isolation and cultural suppression.    Spending millennia in the harsh desert conditions of an arid peninsula have had some side effects on Saudi society. No emphasis is placed on the kind of cultural or festive events that bring people together. Instead, people tend to stay isolated within their own tribes and families; what matters most is the survival of their own small clique. This mentality is encouraged by the monarchy. Social barriers are enforced: women are kept hidden behind veils, and garments generally are uniform. The monarchy also imposes severe religious doctrine, which discourages people from gathering together to share laughter or emotion and encourages only prayer. All of this has kept the isolated people of Saudi Arabia from organizing any serious challenge to the ruling power. But this is changing. The presence of satellite television, mobile phones, the internet and social media has helped Saudi Arabians unite and become more critical of the regime. The Saudi Arabian government is beginning to find it harder to keep their people isolated from outside influences as well as one another. On Facebook, most Saudi Arabians keep conversations friendly. But, in the face of tragedy or social injustice, emotions can run high. In 2009 and 2011, sudden floods struck the country. Both times, the government was ill prepared and the nation’s poor sewage and drainage systems wreaked havoc on public health. The citizens were furious. How could this happen in a prosperous and wealthy country? Compounding the outrage, the government lied about the number of people who were affected by the flood. So the people took to social media to criticize their government’s neglect and mismanagement. It’s a common mistake to think that the traditional Islamic world relegated all women to household duties. After all, the Qur’an describes the prophet’s first wife as an accomplished businesswoman, and a subsequent wife as being a leader of an army. Yet, despite these empowered forebears, Islamic women today are still fighting to be recognized as having a place outside the home, while modern society in Saudi Arabia is unsure about what women should be allowed to do.   As it is now, Saudi society is structured to keep a woman in her home, under the control of her husband or male relative. It is also the last remaining society to forbid women from driving, which can only be seen as a symbolic restriction meant to prevent women from traveling freely without male supervision. This travel ban finally faced significant opposition after the Arab Spring in 2011: Many Saudi women took part in organized “drive-ins” and got behind the wheel of a car in defiant protest. Women still can’t legally drive, but the struggle is slowly gaining positive results thanks, in part, to King Abdullah, who reigned from 2005 to 2015 and was relatively supportive of women’s rights. In 2011, he announced that women would finally be allowed to take part in the parliament elections of 2015. And since 2013, women have been eligible for appointment by the king to the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia, the governmental body that proposes new laws. Though these reforms have positioned the king as a champion of the women’s movement, there’s little doubt that his gestures are largely symbolic. Keep in mind, though, that the political bodies of Saudi Arabia have no real power. Western teenagers are practically expected to rebel against their parents and other authority figures, but this concept is a new one to other places in the world.   In Saudi Arabia, previous generations were mostly complaisant. They recognized, or even revered, the power of the authoritarian religious state. This makes the recent waves of youthful rebellion especially momentous. But it’s no big surprise. The nation’s population is actually one of the youngest on the planet, and there’s no shortage of rules and restrictions for them to rebel against. The movement has presented a particular challenge for parents and the religious establishments. In March of 2011, the Arab Youth Survey revealed that 31 percent of Saudi youths claimed to no longer believe in traditional values, which was the highest percentage of the ten Arab countries that were surveyed. The new rebellious spirit is expressed in many ways. Some choose religious extremism, vandalism or violence; others have started wearing Western clothes – a defiant statement of modernism. Some of these acts have put especial pressure on the government to embrace reform. One rebellious Saudi by the name of Feras Bugnah made a powerful short film called We Are Screwed. It captured powerful images of the squalid living conditions in the poor neighborhoods of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital. It again raised the question: How can one of the wealthiest countries in the world sit idly by while families live without electricity and struggle to survive on discarded furniture and less than 2500 riyals – about $650 – per month? After being posted on the internet, Feras Bugnah’s nine-minute film went viral and received nearly a million views in Saudi Arabia alone. It also resulted in Bugnah’s arrest. After 15 days of intense public pressure and outcry against the government on social media, he was finally released. In the West, royalty is generally something that only a few lucky people are born or married into. But there’s a different royal landscape in Saudi Arabia, where passing generations have left the nation filled with princes who have a lot of spare time on their hands.   Responsible for all these princes is the founding king of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Saud. He had 30 wives and sired 44 sons and numerous daughters. So, three generations later, there are thousands of princes and princesses with direct lineage to the throne. A prince is supposed to oversee his own little part of the country or have some high-ranking governmental job, but there just aren’t enough positions available for all of them. So the majority of them are given a healthy minimum allowance – about $19,000 a month – and told to search for something to do. Now, you might think these princes would take advantage of the opportunity to waste their time and money, but many try their best to be of service.   Prince Abdullah is a fine example. As a grandson of the founding king, he was actually receiving only a small allowance from his father. But he had ambitions, so, with the help of a bank loan, he opened a successful paper-recycling business in 1991. Ten years later, Prince Abdullah continued his humanitarian efforts – this time finding inspiration in sports and US football. He noticed that the American players tended to regard defeat as something they’d brought upon themselves, something they could have worked harder to avoid. Saudi athletes, on the other hand, liked to chalk up defeat to external causes. This observation led prince Abdullah to write a book comparing US sports culture to that of Saudi Arabia, an endeavor he hoped would spur Saudis proactivity and greater responsibility. It’s no secret that some people in Western cultures can take things for granted. Take education, for example. Many kids moan and groan about having to go to school every day, when this is actually a great privilege.   In Saudi Arabia, the public education system is in poor shape.   Some of the problems in schooling can be traced back to the fact that, before the 1960s, there wasn’t any public education system at all. Back then, only two percent of girls and 22 percent of boys attended school. Saudi Arabia has tried to turn things around over the past few decades by investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the education system. At this point, the country spends more money on education than the United States. Yet the education rate remains extremely low. Many factors are at play here, including a lack of good teachers. Not only are women not allowed to teach male students; well-educated men would rather make money in the lucrative oil business. Sadly, when the American National Center for Education Statistics conducted worldwide comparative studies in 2011, results showed that Saudi Arabian students were among the least competent in multiple subjects – including math. This naturally plays a big role in Saudi Arabia’s alarmingly high unemployment rate, which, for people between the ages of 20 and 24, is at 45.5 percent for women and 30 percent for men. The fact that unemployed youth were more likely to become troublesome rebels or get recruited by Islamic extremist put education high on King Abdullah’s list of priorities. He tripled education spending, investing $137 billion in 2010. In 2009, he appointed a new minister of education, his Stanford-educated son-in-law. And he appointed Norah al-Faiz as deputy minister, the first woman to receive such a high-ranking position. But it will continue to be an uphill battle for anyone hoping to improve education in Saudi Arabia, since most religious leaders want schools to teach only Islamic theology and history. Having a huge supply of oil in your backyard might not sound like such a bad thing, but when you have too much of a good thing, it can lead to problems. Saudi Arabia has come to know the downside of being oil-rich. Over the years, Saudi Arabia’s economy has become dangerously dependent on oil and foreign labor.   And now they’re faced with the fact that oil won’t be able to sustain their economy forever. The reserves are being steadily depleted, and there’s no sign of any previously undiscovered sources being revealed. The prognosis of Jadwa Investment, a Saudi financial institution, is grim: When you consider the depleted oil reserves alongside the increased spending necessary to maintain political stability, the country will be drowning in debt by the year 2030. Saudi Arabia is also overly reliant on imported labor. The economy is heavily dependent on the labor and expertise of foreign workers who are either better educated or simply willing to accept low pay. Naturally, this adds to the high unemployment rate and the troubling statistic that 40 percent of Saudis live on less than $850 a month, with many of them in poverty. This is a problem that the country has been struggling, and so far failing, to solve for years. They’ve spent billions trying to strengthen the economy and help the poor and unemployed by putting money into welfare benefits and investing in the military, schools and religious establishments. Part of King Abdullah’s solution was to focus on the public sector. He created a minimum wage for government jobs and gave these workers a bonus of two month’s wages. He also managed to create 126,000 new jobs in the fields of education, health care and security. This might look good on paper, but it actually reinforces the problem at hand. It gives the Saudi middle class even less incentive to compete in the private sector. And until they take that step, they’ll never find new revenue streams, and they’ll continue being dependent on oil and foreign workers. The key message in this book: The monarchy in Saudi Arabia has been able to keep control of their country thanks to religious influence and incredible affluence through oil money. But as the petrol reserves diminish, the country is faced with the challenge of becoming a modern state.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Most of us will remember the significant damage done by the world’s last major economic collapse, the 2008 financial crisis – but far fewer of us will understand why exactly it happened. Was it the fault of banks, businesses or governments? The problem is, it all seems very complicated. What were the root causes of the financial crisis? How does the world of finance operate, anyway? These blinks set out to explain why the financial sector is so important, and also dangerous. In these blinks, you’ll learn why finance is so necessary; what went wrong with the financial system; and how the world of finance can reflect societal values again. These days, the global financial system has earned a reputation as one of the root causes of many of the world’s problems. But it didn’t start out this way. Finance was originally intended to improve our quality of life by making it easier to conduct business. The financial system allows us to buy the things we need to live comfortably and connects people who need money with those who can lend money. It also makes the insurance business possible, giving us the chance to protect ourselves from major disasters or emergencies, and allows us to organize our personal assets so that we can pass them along to subsequent generations. Mortgages are another mutually beneficial part of finance. They make it possible for people to own property by taking out a loan, and subsequently making monthly payments with interest to the lender as a reward for supplying the loan. On a larger scale, a healthy financial system can benefit society as a whole, which becomes clear when we look back at the progress we’ve made over several centuries. It was a strong financial sector that allowed Britain and the Netherlands to become world powers in the early days of industrialization. As investments continue to pour into developing countries, it’s strong finances that allow this money to spread and improve the standard of living. We can also see how the undynamic financial systems of communist countries lead to failure time and time again. In these centrally controlled systems, the money is unable to flow to businesses in need, which leads to fewer jobs and poor economic growth. However, even though capitalist freedom has led to the kind of prosperous industrialization that became a cornerstone of modern society, not all of its financial innovations have been good. In fact, some of them haven’t been beneficial to us at all. As it turns out, the financial industry has lost sight of what’s good and bad for the global population as a whole. We’ll get to the bottom of why this has happened in the blinks that follow. In its early days, finance centered around helping people get the money they needed to realize their ideas. Think of a bank providing a baker with enough capital to open up his own bakery. But due to rampant financialization, those good old days are gone, and we’re drowning in needless transactions that aren’t doing us any good. The rampant trading activity and massive growth in the finance sector is called financialization. The problem is, financialization helps banks and stock markets, but hasn’t had any positive impact on household income, small business growth or the economy at large. Financialization started in the 1970s, when large institutions started trading more and more securities, which are financial assets such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. But what really pushed financialization over the edge was the emergence of a new market based on derivative securities. Derivatives are like contracts that base their value on how well other assets perform. Based on the contract created, one party can end up benefiting from an asset’s price going up or down, depending on the kind of derivative it is. One kind of derivative is known as a credit default swap (CDS), which allows a bank to protect itself against a borrower defaulting, or failing to make payments, on their loan or mortgage. In a way, it functions like insurance: the institution investing in the CDS is promising to pay the bank in the event of a default, while the bank is promising to eventually reimburse them, with interest. This is how we ended up in the recent financial crisis of 2008: too many banks were giving out loans to people who were in no position to honor them. Then, too many people defaulted on their loans, and suddenly all the institutions needed money from each other. The system collapsed upon itself. This crisis was further impacted by technology that made it easier than ever for people to trade securities and derivatives, leading to massive artificial inflation of the financial sector. These practices are tantamount to gambling with other people’s money, which, as the recent crisis has shown, isn’t helping anyone. In the years before financialization, the economy was relatively stable due to a financial sector that promoted a culture of caution and planning. By contrast, today the finance sector acts as though it has little to lose, so we end up with a far more volatile economy. And though it may sound strange, banking executives aren’t exactly encouraged to act in their banks’ best interests. Prior to financialization, executives were expected to invest their own money into their banks, which gave them a great incentive not to fail – and to avoid taking too many risks. So, when it came to providing mortgage loans, it was in their best interests to grant these to reliable people who were likely to hold up their end of the bargain and make regular payments. Back then, being a bank manager was also a lifelong job, so they would be around long enough to face the long-term consequences of their actions. But now, these executives make decisions based on an “I’ll be gone, you’ll be gone” approach, which involves making as much money as possible in the short term, and then moving on before it all falls apart. In the years leading up to 2008, countless mortgages were being granted to people who were clearly unlikely to be able to pay them off, which was a major contributing factor to the crisis that followed. Another conflict of interest can be found in the new breed of broker-dealers. Brokers were traditionally agents who helped bring two like-minded dealers, or traders, together. But during the time of financialization, brokers began making their own deals. They were no longer just making money on commissions from their clients, they were also making profits from their own deals. Naturally, this meant it was no longer in their best interests to steer clients toward the best deals. A broker-dealer is now more likely to steer clients toward a less lucrative trade and save the best deals for themselves. Many people involved in the global financial crisis of 2008 like to claim that it was impossible to see it coming – but this isn’t true at all. In reality, what happened was the logical culmination of decades of dangerous and selfish decision making. It’s hard to see what else would happen when everyone in the finance sector was driven by an insatiable desire to make as much money as possible. This mentality can be directly connected to the transition banks made from being largely private or family-owned businesses to being run by corporations. Once banks became owned by shareholders and banking executives were in control of shareholders’ money rather than their own money, they were now free to take much greater risks. And with no personal attachment to the money, they were in no position to be held accountable for any losses that might occur. With so little at stake, they were free to be driven by greed and make deals that would either pay off with huge rewards or cause damage that would have no effect on them personally or professionally. Meanwhile, the introduction of credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) only added to the lack of accountability and further destabilized the financial sector. As the name implies, for a mortgage-backed security to reap rewards, the mortgage and its associated payments must go smoothly. So, the whole mess began when greedy bank managers offered mortgages to people who were clearly unable to make the necessary payments. Naturally, this caused the MBSs that Bank A was trading with Bank B to be very insecure. To offer added security, Bank A would also trade some CDSs to Bank B, thus supposedly protecting themselves from possible defaults. But because Bank B was buying CDSs with nonexistent security from MBSs, both banks were destined to end up in deep trouble when the mortgages defaulted. In the end, both banks needed money but had none, which is why national governments then had to bail them out. The titans of finance often have friends in high places, including senators and other politicians. Some financial institutions even employ former government officials as consultants, guaranteeing them access to political networks and giving banks an inordinate influence in legislatures and legal systems. Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that the finance sector spends more on political lobbying than any other sector. In the United States, between 2012 and 2014, the finance sector spent $800 million on lobbying, which doesn’t include an additional $400 million that was donated to various candidates’ electoral campaigns. Naturally, this amount of money doesn’t come without expectations, and those who win the elections are likely to feel a responsibility to somehow return a bank’s generosity. This leads us to the immense government bailouts that followed the 2008 crisis, a clear sign of how much influence the financial sector has on the US government. Beyond that, it also set a dangerous precedent: it sent the message that it’s acceptable for banks to be reckless, since taxpayers will clean up their messes. Any lessons that could have been learned from what became a global disaster were quickly pushed aside. The banks should have known they were playing with fire by financing subprime mortgages, that is, mortgages for people with lower credit scores and who were deemed to be a higher default risk. But the big corporate banks were also well aware that they were considered too big to fail by the government, so they knew they had a permanent safety net. The finance sector has yet another important advantage working in their favor: since most people don’t understand their complex deals and confusing terminology, it’s easy for them to get away with greedy and irresponsible decisions. Unless you work in finance, it’s doubtful that you know what words like “subprime” or “derivative” really mean, and unscrupulous dealers can use this to their advantage when coming up with excuses for why they lost all your money. Before 2008, many people assumed that the well-paid professionals in the finance industry made rational decisions. But the crisis revealed the truly irrational and risky behavior that’s been going on for years. The sad part is, they didn’t pay for these actions – we did. Another word you’ll hear a lot when people talk about the financial crisis is “regulations.” And contrary to what some might say, there were a lot of regulations in place when everything came crashing down – some of which date back to the infamous crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that came immediately after. But this is another important lesson that we should take from the 2008 crisis: sometimes regulations do more harm than good. When we pile on one regulation after another, it becomes more difficult to implement effective policy oversight. More often than not, these excessive rules will merely encourage people to find new and creative ways of working around them, eventually making matters worse. This is what happened with Regulation Q, which set a maximum interest rate on bank deposits, such as those in a savings account. Regulation Q worked until the mid-1980s, when US banks began bypassing the regulation by depositing their money into European banks that weren’t beholden to the regulation, and then transferring the money back to the United States. So, rather than discouraging bad business practices, as the regulatory agency had hoped, it just created more work for the authorities. One potential solution would be to create a set of international regulations, which is the primary topic of discussion at G8 and G20 summit meetings – but these meetings have yet to be very productive. Another troubling reality of regulations is that they make finance extremely complicated, which generally benefits the institutions more than their customers. Added regulations can make it harder for the average customer to understand even basic transactions. And when we become dependent on supposed experts or specialists in a field, we become far more vulnerable to being taken advantage of. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in charge of enforcing financial regulations in the United States, and their aim is to make the system as transparent as possible. However, the average person will never know what’s really going on with their money if the information available to them is so full of jargon that it might as well be in a different language. And as long as outsiders are kept in the dark, it will to continue to be business as usual for the financial sector. Today’s politics are divisive, but there is one thing most people should be able to agree on: we need to stop the financial sector from making profits through shady deals that end up costing hardworking people their life savings and require governments to bail out major banks with taxpayer money. If we want to be sure that we’re not walking into another crisis, we need to restore trust. This means restructuring the financial sector in a way that removes the temptation for professionals to act in their own self-interest over their clients’. One step in this direction would be to better separate the jobs in the financial system and make sure that positions like broker-dealer are no longer possible. This way, brokers would only be rewarded for negotiating successful deals between two parties, and would be prohibited from acting as dealers and arranging self-serving financial transactions. Another step would be to protect people’s savings deposits and keep them off-limits from banks and other financial trading institutions. This would keep people’s life savings safe in the event of another major collapse, and would prevent banks from using their clients’ money as just another set of assets to include in their payments and trades. Also, it would give a bank’s greedy traders far less of other people’s money to play with, thereby reducing the likelihood they’d take on high-risk transactions. But perhaps most important of all is to have proper ethical conduct be promoted from within the financial system. Having the SEC threaten, and occasionally enforce, billion-dollar fines is clearly an ineffective way of promoting good behavior. Ethical business practices must be instilled from within the institutions themselves, by executives and leaders who set a good example and reward those who adhere to similarly ethical practices. Obviously, this is easier said than done. But every transformation has to start somewhere. The key message in this book: As the recent banking crisis proved, the financial sector has become a dangerous, self-serving beast that offers little in the way of benefits to the average person. However, history shows that our financial system can work when regulations are streamlined and ethical business practices become the norm rather than the exception. With some considerable restructuring, the financial sector could once again be a valuable and useful system that makes our economy stronger and improves our overall quality of life. Got feedback?

Without glancing at credit card bills, student loan statements or mortgage commitments, you wouldn’t be alone if you said you had a good amount of outstanding debt. But what happens when you don’t pay back your debt, as agreed? Yep, bad things happen. You’re fined, or slapped with a bad credit rating – or if things really go bad, you develop a criminal record. Yet just like you and your friends, companies and even countries in recent years have compiled tons and tons of debt. Yet as you’ll discover in the following blinks, these entities didn’t sweat the details of paying those debts back. The result? One of the biggest financial crises in history. You’ll learn exactly how we got to this point and why such irresponsible borrowing behavior was allowed to happen in the first place. In these blinks, you’ll discover how many zeros there are in a trillion; why it’s easier to buy a sheep with cash than with a loaf of bread; and why you may be buried in debt, but your grandparents are not. If money is just ink on paper, why is it that we worship it so? The answer rests in how we use it. Money’s primary function is as a medium of exchange. Before we used money, deals were settled through bartering. If you were a baker, for example, and you wanted a pair of pants or a leg of lamb, you could find a shepherd and trade. If you gave him 100 loaves of bread, he’d give you a lamb. But what if the shepherd had no need for bread? You’d then have to find something he did want, perhaps a new knife. You’d then have to find a blacksmith (who needs bread) to make the knife, which you could trade for the lamb. Trying to find the right thing to trade could lead to some intricate, time-consuming bartering. Money cuts through this confusion: if you want something, you simply exchange it for money, which the seller can then use to buy something else. The transaction is simple, and direct. Money also functions as a unit of account, or a means of measuring a product’s value. To trade an item, we need to understand its worth. Bartering makes this difficult. Could you say accurately how many lambs one knife is worth? Or does it depend on the needs and resources of the shepherd and the blacksmith? Money makes valuation easy, as beforehand its value is agreed upon. Finally, money can be used to store value, for example, by maintaining the value of a specific product. Most of the world’s countries keep the value of their money more or less stable to foster investment and prevent inflation, in which prices rise but the value of money decreases. Understanding money’s many functions is essential to understanding the way it can influence the economy and society. With an understanding of how money functions, we can now look at one of its major roles in modern society: the concept of debt. People often lend and borrow money to and from one another based on trust. In fact, the word “credit,” another way to describe debt, stems from the Latin word credere, meaning “to believe.” No matter whether you’re a creditor or a borrower, mutual trust and confidence in the transaction serves as the foundation of debt. The borrower needs to be confident in her own ability to pay back the loan; the creditor likewise needs to have to trust in the borrower to do so. What’s more, both borrower and creditor need to be confident that they will profit in some way from the arrangement. Student loans provide a good example. A student applying for a loan trusts that he will get a good education and a well-paying job after college, while the bank (lender) trusts that the student will finish his education and will be able to pay back the loan, with interest. There has been plenty of trust between borrowers and lenders in recent decades. The result of this is that most Western countries carry debt that is at least three or four times higher than reported annual income. How could this state of affairs have ever happened? In the last 40 years, Western countries’ economies have grown steadily, while living standards and productivity have likewise increased. As societies became more confident in their ability to earn and thus easily pay back loans, they borrowed even more from banks and other countries, which trusted the borrowers to pay the loans back and on time. Slowly but surely, the debt that was amassed surpassed levels ever seen in the global financial system! If you go to Times Square in New York City, you might notice a particular clock. This clock doesn’t tell the hour but instead records the accumulation of debt by the U.S. government in real time. When the clock was built back in 1989, it was equipped with enough digit places to display an amount in the trillions, or a one followed by 12 zeros. By 2008, the clock needed to be updated. By then, the amount of debt the United States had accumulated had hit a total of $10 trillion, which required more digits than the clock could handle. So how did the United States, as well as other countries, fall so deeply into the red? Over time, countries racked up more and more debt, without stopping to think how the debt would be paid back. If you ask a mountain climber how she manages to climb so high without fear, she might say, “Keep looking up, never look down.” Countries essentially did the same thing. As a nation grew comfortable in its general ability to pay back debt, it would start to borrow beyond its means. Yet as the mountains of debt kept growing, countries simply stopped looking down. A nation would concern itself only with borrowing more to maintain operations, not with how to pay the debt back. Eventually, everyone looked down, and confidence in the debt-burdened system collapsed. Why shouldn’t a climber look down? If you do, you quickly realize how far you can fall, and your confidence will crumble. This is exactly what happened with the financial system. Sitting on mountains of debt, countries suddenly looked down and were shocked at the unbelievable amount of money they owed each other. Faced with this realization, confidence disappeared. Countries stopped borrowing, and, more crucially, stopped lending. And as a result, the financial system ground to halt and credit dried up. The sudden realization of the degree of indebtedness caused countries and banks across the world to panic and halt lending. But how did this actually result in a global financial crisis? The golden years of borrowing had created a bubble in the financial system. As countries, companies and banks borrowed more and more, they created an artificial boom in the global economy. In contrast to previous boom periods, which resulted from events such as high worker productivity or improved business practices, the boom preceding the global financial crisis was fueled by cheap credit. As long as people continued to lend to one another, the trend would only continue. Investment banks like Lehman Brothers, for example, borrowed huge amounts from other banks. They used this debt to buy and trade other forms of debt, such as mortgage bonds, from which they profited greatly. And as their profits increased, they saw no reason to slow their borrowing to keep things going up. As soon as the confidence in borrowing waned and the flow of credit dried up, however, the bubble burst and the financial system collapsed. Once everyone saw just how much debt Lehman Brothers had accumulated, no one wanted to lend to the firm anymore. Then when the U.S. government refused to keep the company solvent with a bailout, Lehman was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. This bankruptcy created a domino effect worldwide. Banks and insurance companies that had lent money to Lehman suffered massive losses, and as a result, they too stopped lending. And it wasn’t just the financial industry that suffered. Countries, such as Greece and Spain, had funded years of growth with massive borrowing. Once the crisis hit, these countries too had no way to pay back their debts. The financial crisis was both massive and devastating. But how much did the crisis’ effects change our practices of borrowing and finance in general? The next blink will look at what the future holds for borrowers and lenders. After the 2008 financial crisis, many people believed the end of the world was nigh. But really, those that predicted the end times had no grasp of economic history. The truth is, large financial crises happen all the time, whether in ancient periods or modern times. Before King Louis XIV died in 1715, France experienced a serious financial crisis as the king had accrued debts worth nearly a billion livres, the currency of the time. France tried to lessen the crisis by printing paper money while attempting to rekindle confidence in its new banking system. The idea was to trick investors into thinking that banks were more credible than they actually were. And just like in 2008, the French bubble quickly burst, and many people lost everything, their homes and their livelihoods, and were forced to live on the streets. One of the most common ways to fight a debt crisis is through inflation, in which the local currency drops in value. If your currency becomes half as valuable, then you effectively wipe away half of your debt burden that is denominated in that currency. Many economies in the past, including ancient Greek despots, took this approach. So why didn’t every country hit by the financial crisis do this in 2008? One reason is that countries like Greece, which uses the euro, can’t devalue its currency independently to bolster its economy, as many other European countries use it as well. Post-crisis, it’s easy to understand how people could be pessimistic. Is there any silver lining to look for in the global financial system for the future? There is, but we have to deal with the consequences of changing global demographics. Researchers estimate that the world’s population will grow by 50 percent within the first half of the twenty-first century. This growth will occur mostly in the developing world, while birth rates in developed countries will fall. This unbalanced growth will inevitably lead to problems. For one, developing countries’ economies will struggle under the weight of a massive population. At the same time, the low birth rates of developed countries will lead to a decline in productivity, due to a shrinking population. To ensure the future economic health of the globe, we need to work on these and other problems. Economically struggling countries, like Greece for example, not only need support but also must change social assumptions. The country requires fundamental reforms to fix the root of economic woes, rather than relying on further borrowing to fund growth. By working to foster real growth – by improving infrastructure, fighting corruption and increasing productivity – Greeks could actually develop a strong economy for the long term. Growth would be based on a stable foundation, and thus unlikely to collapse. The world is in dire need of a change in direction if we are to manage the problems caused by our debt-ridden way of life! Most young people today carry some sort of debt, in the form of an overdrawn checking account, a housing loan or even a weighty student loan. The ease with which we accumulate debt is a relatively new development. Our great-grandparents, survivors of the Great Depression in the United States, avoided banks and would have rather been seen eating garbage than borrowing money. Even Baby Boomers still fear debt as bad or unusual. Indeed, the way that societies and cultures have dealt with financial matters has changed. If you owed money, it was usually seen as the mark of having lived an extravagant or wasteful life, of living beyond your means. Most people simply didn’t need credit, as they could rent a home and work at the same company their entire life for a steady income. But the advent of lowered interest rates, entrepreneurial activity and a decline in traditional working practices made people more willing to take on debt and build a business, finance an education or own a home outright. Whereas older generations feared debt, the younger generations see it as an accepted way of life, not something to be ashamed about. Yet this accumulation of debt, above and beyond normal levels, not only can cause problems between generations but also lead to problems for us all in the future. The key message in this book: Wanton borrowing and overconfidence in financial systems led to a massive, worldwide financial crisis. Even in the face of this crisis, there is still no shortage of debt, for individuals and for governments.  Suggested further reading: House of Debt by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi When we bailed out the banks during the Great Recession, we didn’t actually address the real factors that caused the economic downturn. The actual problem lay with excessive mortgage lending to those who couldn’t afford it, which led to heavy debts and, eventually, huge collapses in consumer spending. To avoid the consequences of this boom-and-bust cycle in the future, the authors propose new ways of restructuring debt and stimulating the economy.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Even if you haven’t, you’ve probably heard of them. These companies – platforms for peers who want to trade services with each other – have taken the world by storm, and engendered no small amount of controversy. These platforms belong to what is sometimes called the collaborative economy, where horizontal networks bypass traditional top-down supply-and-demand economics. After years of simply buying the things we want, we have reached an impasse where many of us own more than we need and the planet’s ecology is crumbling under the pressure of consumption and the production needed for that consumption. Here we will take a look at the many different platforms for peers and how they can be used to combat these global challenges. In these blinks, you’ll find out how excess capacity is the foundation for a collaborative economy; why the people you open your platform to make all the difference; and how strict governmental regulations can encourage the emergence of peer platforms. You’re probably familiar with the expression “sharing is caring,” right? Well, it’s not just a lesson for preschool kids anymore; today, it’s valid for the modern business economy too. The concepts of sharing and collaborating are the backbone of a successful new business model that relies on excess capacity. Excess capacity refers to anything owned that isn’t being used all the time, or to its full capacity. This might be a car, a second apartment or even tools and appliances that are just sitting in storage. When looked at critically, owning is an inefficient concept. It comes with costs and hassles, and the phenomenon of everyone owning one of everything is pushing the planet’s resources to the limit. Clearly, it’s time to find a better way. The benefits of a sharing economy can perhaps best be seen by looking at car ownership. You have to pay for parking, insurance and maintenance. Plus, every car adds to the traffic jams and toxic emissions that already plague most major cities. So why own a car when you can share it? This is the question that the author, Robin Chase, asked in 1999. Chase had realized that people didn’t use their cars to their full capacity and launched  Zipcar to help them share this resource. But having an excess capacity of something is only the root of a good collaborative model. There also needs to be a platform to make sharing easy and efficient. After all, people borrowed cars from friends long before Zipcar was around. But coordinating that exchange wasn’t always easy. Zipcar’s platform offers a simple way to find out when every nearby car is available. In conclusion, a successful sharing platform will do two things: identify the excess capacity and provide the necessary hardware and software to make it easy to share that resource. In this way, the business becomes a valuable service that does something that would take individuals a lot of time and money to do themselves. You may have heard about the 16-year-old girl who accidentally invited every Facebook user to her birthday party with over 1,000 showing up. You don’t want to make this kind of mistake by inviting everyone to participate on your platform on day one when you’re not prepared to deal with the masses. Platforms need to be organized, standardized and simple to use, and finding the perfect balance often happens through trial and error. To make this process as painless as possible, while still maintaining a certain level of quality, you need to slowly expand the number of users over time. This is how companies find out what changes need to be made to offer the best possible experience. For instance, it took some time before eBay realized the benefit of using ratings and reviews. Without these incentives, most sellers didn’t think it necessary to offer quality products, provide prompt delivery or respond to customer complaints. Another development that you’ll be able to spot is how certain users will try to exploit your service. After some time, you’ll likely identify “power players” – people who will understand how your platform works and use it to their advantage against your average users. Airbnb provides a perfect example. After launching their service, designed for the average user to rent out a spare room, they saw a rise in real-estate professionals using the platform to rent entire apartments or houses. Having professionals use your service isn’t always a problem, but when they change your established rules to fit their own agenda, it can be a threat to the goal of your service. This is why Airbnb chose to remove these listings from their site. So give yourself time to identify harmful trends that might emerge and be sure to establish new rules to prevent power players from taking over. If you’ve ever left your wallet at home, you know that borrowing a couple dollars for a cup of coffee can be painfully embarrassing. Borrowing on a large scale can be even more daunting, and launching a Kickstarter campaign to ask millions of strangers to fund your peer platform can seem like a downright scary proposition. Be that as it may, crowdfunding is one of the three major ways to get your project off the ground, with the other options being private-sector and public funding. So which one is right for you? Well, private funding requires you to aim for maximizing shareholder value, which can sometimes be at odds with the goal of your platform. Private funding is also risky, since it can leave you without a controlling majority of the company, robbing you of the decision-making power to develop your platform as you see fit. For example, the software-development platform Github managed to avoid private funding for their first four years. This way, shareholder concerns weren’t a priority when making difficult decisions. If, on the other hand, your platform deals with basic utilities, you should look to the public sector for funding. Services like GPS, WiFi and the internet were all financed and developed through taxpayer dollars and then made available to the public for free. If you think about it, the electricity net is also a shared platform, as anyone can install solar panels on their roof and start selling the excess capacity. So if your platform can be seen in a similar light, it makes sense to seek public funding. Last but not least, crowdfunding can also be a great way to retain your control of your platform, because you don’t need to give out equity to the people funding it. Just consider the example of Caroline Woolard, who used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to launch Trade School, a service that allows people to start and attend free classes throughout New York City on topics ranging from modern art to professional communication. Kickstarter allowed Woolard to raise enough money to cover most of her costs. As we saw in the previous blink, public funding can help you develop your platform. But in what other ways has the US government helped create peer platforms? Let’s look at the history of the Global Positioning System, or GPS. This technology was originally developed by the United States during the Cold War era to help deter nuclear attacks. Then, in 1983, the Soviet Union shot down a Korean Airlines plane that had accidentally flown into their airspace. It was clear that this tragedy could be avoided if the pilots had been able to navigate using GPS. And so the US government decided to allow anyone to use their GPS, effectively making it a peer platform. From there, it has evolved into an invaluable tool today, used by countless services. On the other hand, sometimes strict governmental regulation can also lead to new platforms. Take Uber and the taxi industry, for instance. In the United Kingdom, cabbies are required to pass a rigorous test to prove their knowledge of London’s tricky roadways, without the help of GPS. As a result, it can take almost three years of preparation for them to pass this test. This kind of strict governmental oversight happens in many other parts of the world too and is partly what led Uber to create a viable and attractive alternative to taxis. In the next blink, we’ll look at how big companies can influence the sharing economy as well. You’ve probably heard the saying “adapt or die” applied to the business world? Well, large companies too are trying to adapt to the sharing economy trend. The UK supermarket behemoth Sainsbury's embarked on a bold collaboration experiment when it opened its doors to 155 external corporate sustainability experts, asking them to review its sustainability strategy. The group even included one of their direct competitors. Thanks to this independent peer review, Sainsbury's was able to objectively pinpoint both the areas it excelled in as well as those that needed improvement. In France, the home-improvement store Castorama decided to incorporate an online platform where employees, customers and local craftspeople could share useful skills and tips. Within a few months, more than 2,400 people signed up and began to shape an active community. It’s hard to know exactly how much revenue a community platform like this can bring in, but both of these examples illustrate how more and more big businesses are moving toward collaboration. And it seems to be working for them. In 2014, the management consultancy Deloitte examined the 500 most valuable companies in the United States to determine what the most successful business model was. Sure enough, they found that companies using the collaborative model were valued two to four times higher than those using other business models. Deloitte calls these companies “Network Orchestrators” and believes their success is due to the strong peer networks they build, which allows them to interact and boost each other’s value. These kinds of results will surely attract more and more businesses to try the collaborative model, and it’s only a matter of time until those refusing to join it will find themselves struggling to stay afloat. In the previous blinks, we’ve seen how sharing platforms can address a wide variety of needs. But only when we consider the current global situation can we see just how useful this model really is.   Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the planet today. If we’re going to avoid the catastrophic effects of rising temperatures, emissions need to be lowered immediately so that they might reach net zero by 2050 – meaning that the amount of emissions released roughly equals the amount of renewable energy created. Governments have been either slow or unwilling to address climate change, though they could help by adding a carbon tax to products and services based on how much pollution they create. But this alone is insufficient, and peer models can help. Climate change presents so many problems and has so many causes that a collaborative approach is needed to reverse it. It’s going to take intelligent people from all over the world to formulate a workable solution. And with effective peer models, we could change sectors like agriculture, food distribution and public transportation, all of which are vital to reducing emissions. One example of something already in action is India’s G-Auto, founded by Nirmal Kumar. Like Uber for automotive rickshaws, G-Auto reduces the need for drivers to cruise around looking for customers, thereby reducing CO2 emissions and traffic jams. There is still a great amount of excess capacity in many realms around the world to take advantage of. And the more efficiently and effectively we use our resources, the better we’ll be at combating climate change. The key message in this book: When we switch from a buying and owning mentality to a sharing mentality, everyone wins. Those who have an excess capacity of a resource make money; those who use that excess capacity save money. And the planet is exposed to fewer emissions. But there are still more resources with excess capacity out there, just waiting to be used.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Banerjee and Esther Duflo","summary":"The battle against global poverty has been fought by grandees from many fields – from politicians and economists to famous musicians and Hollywood actors. Yet, as we all know, the problem remains. And Poor Economics attempts to provide several answers to why. As the authors argue, we are currently looking at the problem in the wrong way. We spend most of our time on general theories about poverty, neglecting the perspective of the poor themselves. Instead, we should be examining the complexity of their lives to get a clearer idea of which kinds of aid are effective and which are not. To that end, we should first seek to understand how and why poor people make the often self-destructive decisions they do, and how we can get them to make better ones in the future. By looking at the problem of poverty from this angle, Poor Economics shows how we might begin to answer such perplexing questions as: Why do poor people refuse to take medicine that will make them healthier? Why do women in poorer regions bear more children than those in richer ones? And, why do people in poverty spend what little money they have on inferior, non-nutritious food? It’s a sad fact: poverty causes millions of deaths every year. Equally sad is the fact that we have yet to find an effective solution to this devastating problem. One of the reasons might be that economists dealing with the problem tend to look at it in the wrong way, focusing too much on “big” economic questions like, “Do developing countries need more or less help from outside in order to grow?” Such general questions tend to generate ineffective debate. One camp argues for more development aid to get these countries on track, as they’re not able to do so on their own. Economist Jeffrey Sachs claims that if rich countries would spend $195 billion per year on development aid, in 20 years (i.e., by 2025), poverty would be eradicated. Then there’s the other camp, which emphasizes the negative consequences and ineffectiveness of outside interventions, claiming that it’s more helpful to leave developing countries alone. Clearly, it’s difficult to come up with a conclusive answer to such a general question. Moreover, debating it does nothing to solve the problem of poverty. Of course, some countries appear to prove the effectiveness of development aid. For example, following the Rwandan Genocide, Rwanda received a lot of money and their economy subsequently boomed. However, the situation’s complexity renders it impossible to know for certain whether Rwanda’s success was due to the aid or to other factors. Furthermore, a single case isn’t enough to prove a theory’s accuracy: data from over 100 countries suggests that those that had received aid didn’t grow anymore than those that didn’t. Both of these arguments are manifestations of an economic reasoning that looks at the problem of poverty in the wrong way. And, in the end, such arguments will not help to solve it. Rather than spending time and energy on considering these big questions, it’s more useful to look more closely at specific measures and to evaluate why they do or do not work. Until now, the economic complexity of poor people’s lives hasn’t received much scientific attention. Perhaps since most poor people live on less than $1 a day (13 percent of the world’s population in 2005), economists seem to believe that the poor have no complex economic decisions to make. But that’s not true. Poor people are forced to be very rational when it comes to economic matters. Due to their lack of financial resources and awful living conditions, they have to reflect far more on economic questions than people living in developed countries. Any economic decision or investment that poor people make could have devastating consequences – consequences that might threaten their very existence – so naturally they have to consider each decision very carefully. But if scientists would take the economic decisions of poor people more seriously, it would help us to understand what measures are actually required in the fight against poverty. For instance, in many cases, poor people reject or neglect to use the help offered by NGOs and governments, and don’t think long term. Consider, e.g., the fact that poor people don’t exploit the availability of the free vaccinations that could greatly improve their lives. And they often spend their money on rather useless things, like coffee, instead of saving it for something more important. These decisions, however, are not irrational or random, but influenced by an array of different factors, like economic considerations, social beliefs and psychological effects. Therefore, it is only by gaining a deeper appreciation and understanding of the conditions under which poor people make their decisions that we will begin to learn precisely what kind of help is needed, and how to get them to make better decisions for themselves. Most of us would associate poverty with hunger without thinking twice. Yet the link between the two is not as obvious as it seems. One popular view held by economists and politicians is that hunger is one of the main reasons for poverty’s persistence. Indeed, this seems reasonable since nobody can be productive if they’re hungry. But that view is wrong. Although many people suffer from hunger today, being hungry can’t be seen as a general cause for contemporary poverty. In fact, data from more than 18 countries shows that most poor people don’t have to spend all their money on getting enough calories – which means they could spend more on food if they needed to. And even with the money they do spend on food, they often choose to buy more expensive, tastier foodstuffs, rather than to maximize their calorie intake. Furthermore, the problem isn’t in the quantity of food available: if poor people had better-quality food, they’d be more capable of improving their health and productivity. Most poor people, particularly children, don’t get enough high-quality food, which means they lack many micronutrients, like iron or iodine. This nutritional lack in poor people’s diets has consequences for children’s development and adults’ economic life. In fact, one study in Indonesia showed that men and women who took iron supplements for a couple of months were able to work harder and earn more money. Since poor people are often unaware of the importance of nutritious food, it would help if governments and NGOs provided nutritious food or food supplements, and created food rich in essential nutrients. In India, e.g., they’ve introduced iron-fortified salt. It’s crucial that we leave behind the common belief that poor people just need cheaper food. Instead, we should focus our efforts on providing them with high-quality food they’ll enjoy. Staying healthy is extremely important for poor people. Just one sick family member can have a disastrous effect on the whole family, as it can cause a drop in income and generate additional costs. The following three things are required to help raise health levels in poor countries: First, better provision of medical help is needed. Although most developing countries have a public health system, poor people rarely use them. The reason is simple: the system doesn’t work. Indeed, many medical stations are often closed, and most medical center staff are unmotivated. One World Bank study showed that the average absence rate of medical center staff in different developing countries was 35 percent. Therefore, governments must make public health systems more reliable so that poor people have access to effective healthcare. Second, people have to be educated about health issues. Even if a more reliable health system were in place, people might not end up making use of it because of cultural beliefs and a possible lack of information. For example, research in Udaipur, India, shows that poor people do not believe that the cheap drink solution they can get from medical stations actually helps treat diarrhea; they believe that, in general, medicine works only when injected into the bloodstream. Third, and finally, sometimes people need the right incentives to care for their health, as medical facts don’t always motivate people enough. For example, while people know the importance of vaccinations, they often don’t complete the treatment. Like most people, they simply don’t care about things that don’t offer them an immediate benefit. And so, the right incentives need to be found and employed. One project conducted in India showed that the rate of completed vaccinations increased dramatically from 6 to 38 percent once a set of plates was promised for every vaccination. The better we understand what prevents people from using medical support, the more we’ll know about how to change that behavior.  Another very important factor for overcoming poverty is education. In recent years, many developing countries have addressed this by providing educational facilities for their children. However, developing countries must ensure that children do not just attend school but are actually educated. Although it’s a positive development that governments have provided all children with at least an elementary education, the fact that public school staff often don’t care about the success of their teaching is a problem. Consider, again, the above-mentioned study by the World Bank, which shows that teachers in public schools are often absent. That research revealed that 50 percent of Indian teachers were not actually in their classrooms when they should’ve been. The sad result of such carelessness is that children in India are barely educated. In addition to that, elitist thinking in developing countries must be questioned in order to educate more children. Since, e.g., Indian society values elitist thinking, its education system neglects to teach its children the most basic skills. Instead, the system is very demanding academically, and is thus directed towards only the most academically minded students. The result is that a huge number of children without an academic disposition are ignored. Finally, parents must take care to not let their incorrect economic assumptions prevent the majority of their children from receiving a basic education. Polls in developing countries show that parents believe it’s more rational to spend their entire education budget on the most promising child than it is to support all of their children’s education needs. Their calculation is wrong: parents themselves need to learn that it makes more sense give a greater number of their children a basic education than it does to have only one highly educated child. Ensuring that more children are educated is a complex but crucial challenge for developing societies to undertake if they are to fight poverty effectively. Because of the strong connection between population growth and poverty, many countries have attempted to regulate that growth. As you might imagine, however, fighting population growth is a complex issue. For one, as long as there’s no social security system or strong incentives to save money, having many children is a rational choice for poor people. This is because old people depend on their family to take care of them. So, the more children people have, the more likely they are to have support when they’re old or sick. Indeed, most people in developing countries receive financial support from their children or even live with them – as is the case in China, where over 50 percent of old people live with their children. Therefore, one of the solutions to population growth is to improve the social protection of the poor. Another way to gain control over a country’s growth problem is to empower its women. Most women consciously decide to have children. That’s because, compared to staying at home and serving their family, the prospect of getting married and starting a family is the more attractive option. It’s highly unlikely, therefore, that the population problem can be solved by measures like more education or providing information about how to use contraceptives. Yet, empowering women, and strengthening their role in marriage and society, would lead to fewer children. Interviews with both men and women reveal that women usually want less children than men do, suggesting that an empowered women would choose to have fewer. A good example of the link between women’s empowerment and population control can be found in Peru, where the government gave land to former peasants. In the documents where the woman of a couple was also mentioned, that couple had fewer children because naming them implied their power. Measures against population growth must be considered carefully. We will only be able to fight it if we understand where it really comes from. One popular, though controversial, instrument for helping the poor is microcredits. Microcredits are useful in supporting poor people and their businesses in developing countries. Without them, poor people would have to approach banks, which have little interest in giving affordable credits to poor people (because of the small amounts involved and the risk of not being paid back), or loan sharks, to whom they’d have to pay very high interests. The introduction of microcredits in developing countries provides a viable alternative for poor people. Special financial institutions lend small amounts of money to poor people so that they can make an investment to get a business started (e.g., rent a shop) or to buy equipment (e.g., a wheelbarrow) which can help them be more productive. The result is that microcredits actually work: studies show that families who got microcredits were more likely to invest in their own businesses and to take care of their economic future. However, the impact of microcredits is limited to the short term.In fact, most of the small businesses funded by microcredits don’t survive for very long at all. There are two main reasons for this. First, while microcredits are a good way to start a business, promising businesses must grow and make additional, larger investments. However, there are no institutions from which the poor can loan a larger amount of money at a reasonable interest rate. Therefore, other financial instruments are needed for businesses to be economically viable and grow. Second, many small businesses get started only because there’s no other alternative for poor people to make money. And, as there’s not really a demand for those businesses, most don’t survive for long. For example, there’s no need for five small shops to sell the same groceries on the same street. Therefore, it’s crucial to point out that, in the end, good and secure jobs are still the best way to fight poverty. The right financial instruments can support poor people and developing economies to grow, but these instruments can’t be used to hide the fact that the problems are more complex. In contrast to most poor people around the world, those in rich countries are lucky, as they’re insured against many risks (e.g., losing their job or sickness). So if there were more affordable opportunities to get insurance in developing countries, many poor people’s fears could be reduced. For instance, poor people have to deal with a lot of insecurity in their lives. They’re often peasants and greatly depend on the weather and price fluctuations; or they have several jobs and will be hit hard if they lose just one of them. To combat this, in many villages and neighborhoods in developing countries, poor people have created networks to help those in need. However, compared with full-fledged insurance systems, this kind of assistance is limited. For instance, only smaller financial problems are covered by this rudimentary security, so they don’t help improve any real hardship. In the cases where getting properly insured is a possibility for poor people, governments should intervene by providing both poor people and private insurers with incentives. Although it isn’t possible to insure all the risks poor people face, there are some risks that can be insured, e.g., a meager crop yield or other weather-related risks. But the poor barely even consider taking out insurance policies offered by private companies and the reasons for that are numerous: it’s expensive, poor people are skeptical of it or they simply don’t think long term, like most people. Therefore, the poor clearly need incentives to get themselves proper coverage, so the governments have to step in to get the market going. For example, when weather insurance was subsidized in Ghana, almost all poor people signed up. Once the poor see that the insurance system works for them, subsidies could be reduced and a free market could exist. By now it should be clear that there is no easy solution to the question of how to end poverty. And yet, many experts recognize that we must begin by focusing on major institutional changes. One popular view held by economists and political scientists is that we will not be able to fight poverty effectively as long as there are unstable political regimes. For those experts, corruption is a huge problem as it means, e.g., that corrupt officials often steal money allocated to projects dedicated to fighting poverty. Therefore, these experts concentrate on the question of how we can best achieve big institutional changes in these countries – e.g., by implementing a new, more democratic political regime – believing that this is essential to fighting poverty effectively. However, while the question of large-scale, fundamental institutional changes is central to the battle against poverty, we shouldn’t forget that there’s room for local improvements. That’s because small and local actions can be extremely effective in countering the political shortcomings of governments (e.g., corruption).    For example, one 1996 study in Uganda showed that only very few of the subsidies the government said it gave to schools were actually received by them. The Ugandan people were outraged and demanded reforms. Ultimately, the treasury reacted and, when the study was repeated in 2001, on average 80% of the money intended for the schools actually reached them. In this case, all that was required to fight corruption was information from economists and public protest. Therefore, we must not think that we have to wait until big institutional changes occur, as there are many simple, local measures that can lead to the political improvements necessary to combat poverty effectively. The key message in this book: The fight against poverty is very complex and there is no easy solution. But we must not give up: a better understanding of the lives of poor people, and a close examination of the measures we take against poverty, will help us to see what’s essential to winning the fight against poverty. Actionable advice: Be skeptical about “big” solutions to poverty. Keep in mind that measures against poverty will be only effective if we understand the circumstances of poor people’s decisions. One common, and general, misunderstanding is that the poor are incapable of thinking rationally about money. This isn’t true at all: they are just as rational as the rest of us. Remember that the next time you want to help alleviate someone’s poverty. Never forget how important education is. In the developed world, we often take our education for granted. We shouldn’t: it’s the most vital tool against poverty. Being educated – about economics, science (e.g., contraception), numeracy and literacy – can help poor people make better decisions and lead better lives. If you’re looking for organizations that try to combat poverty in the ways the book suggests, the authors provide a list of organizations on their website (pooreconomics.com).","headers":["What’s in it for me?

For far too long, a woman was expected to quit her job when she was pregnant. If she was lucky, her employer might hire her back afterward. Thankfully, much has changed over the past few decades, and there’s one job market in particular that has been moving away from the traditional rules of the workplace: the New Economy. The New Economy is fueled by innovative tech companies like Facebook and Airbnb. And since they’re breaking many of the traditional rules of employment, it makes them a great place for women to work. This brings us to the author’s power UP movement, which is about empowering women to use the New Economy as a means to realizing their power and breaking down barriers that stand in the way of their goals. These blinks are full of tips on how to power UP. In these blinks, you’ll find how to use intrapreneurship to your advantage; how to overcome “mommy guilt”; and why a ten-year break from work is sometimes the perfect thing. The New Economy is a fast-moving field, since advancements and new innovations are being made all the time in the technology industry. If you hope to stay on track during all of the twists and turns that lay ahead, you need to keep a few core principles in mind. To begin with, it’s important not to get discouraged when mistakes are made, and instead use them as an opportunity to power UP. The author, Magdalena Yesil, made a mistake back in the early days of Apple. She rejected a job offer from Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak! Unfortunately, she had heeded the advice of her college advisor, who told her she shouldn’t take a job from a tech company that named itself after a fruit. Rather than just beating herself up, Yesil recognized the real cause of her mistake: she didn’t do the proper research before making the decision. Instead, she decided to power UP. From then on, she’d do her homework and make well-informed career decisions. Another core principle of powering UP is to stay humble, as this is key to being receptive to valuable feedback. During her first engineering job, Yesil designed a semiconductor chip. After her presentation on the chip’s logic functions in her first review meeting, her work was harshly criticized by her bosses. But, once again, Yesil saw an opportunity: this was a great chance to learn and understand each and every design flaw that needed fixing. During the meeting, she remained attentive and receptive to each piece of criticism. And because she was open, her colleagues were always honest with her about any ways in which she could improve. This brings us to the third principle: remain confident about each career decision. Making a career change can be a scary and emotional time. Changes often come with financial risks, but these are the burdens you must bear if you are to reach your long-term goals. Marc Benioff was an early collaborator of the author’s when she was working at Salesforce. But before they became colleagues, Benioff worked at Oracle, where he had a close friendship with his mentor and a secure and lucrative position. When Benioff joined Salesforce, he had an eight-thousand-square foot office space with just ten other employees. But he presented each of these employees, as well as Salesforce investors, with an attitude of confidence about his career decision. As it turned out, that decision wasn’t bad: Salesforce’s offices are now the tallest building west of the Mississippi. If you have an idea for a product or service that has potential to be the next big thing, you might be tempted to launch your own start-up right away. But there are a number of reasons why you might want to first work at an established company. First of all, you can benefit from the normal hours and steady paycheck. Start-ups are notoriously demanding of their few employees, often expecting 24-hour devotion while providing little in the way of resources. Additionally, if you’re looking for money to explore your innovative idea, you’ll likely have a much easier time getting it from your boss at a stable corporation than you would from a group of start-up investors. This concept of exploring new initiatives from within the confines of an existing business even has its own name: intrapreneurship. Debra Rossi is an experienced intrapreneur, despite working as the executive vice president of Wells Fargo, which is a 165-year-old bank and part of a tightly-controlled industry. Rossi is also the president of the Electronic Transactions Association, and she flexes her intrapreneurial muscles at Wells Fargo by deciding which innovative start-ups are allowed to use the bank’s credit-card processing. One day, a curious start-up landed on her desk. The company’s business plan involved auctioning off things like stuffed animals. It was called eBay. Rossi took a risk on eBay’s unusual business model and it paid off. The partnership ended up being a game changer in how electronic payments are handled on the internet. Working for an established company is also a great way to develop useful skills that will increase your chances of successfully launching your own company one day. Julie Wainwright worked as a brand manager for the cleaning-supply corporation Clorox before starting her web-based luxury consignment business, The RealReal. After three years at Clorox, Wainwright understood how to navigate between profit and loss, as well as the ins and outs of brand strategy and marketing management. But she didn’t stop there. After Clorox, she worked at Software Publishing Corporation, where she set up international distribution systems throughout Europe and learned more about writing business plans and delivering profitable results. Wainwright believes that by working for these two companies, she got the hands-on business skills she needed to launch her own successful company. So even if you’re itching to start your own company, there’s a good chance you still have a lot to learn. If you consistently deliver stellar work, you could easily sit back and think that it’s just a matter of time before your boss will offer you a promotion or a raise. However, with a passive approach like this, you might be waiting a long time. Unfortunately, excellent work doesn’t always speak for itself, so unless your boss is a micromanager, there’s a good chance you’ll need to make a case for yourself and point out all the great results you’ve been getting. While it may not come easily to you, if you want to rise in the ranks, you must take ownership of your work. The author interviewed a female executive at a tech company who was shocked when she found out she was being passed up for the new head-of-product position. She took pride in her ability to build highly productive teams by firing those who didn’t meet expectations and seamlessly introducing new talent. However, there were no concrete metrics in place to measure management skills like hers, so she had to personally show her bosses how her firing and hiring directly related to the company’s productivity gains and savings. By making sure her work was recognized, she was ultimately awarded the new position, which earned her a rightful spot among senior management. So, if you want that raise, it’s up to you to make sure your performance is measured by metrics your boss will notice. This means compiling evidence that clearly shows how you’re contributing unique value to the organization. A great way to do this is to ask your colleagues to email you after each presentation or meeting, offering feedback on your effectiveness. By having written testimonials, documented in the form of emails, you’ll have a clear record of your performance, how it’s progressed over time and how your achievements add value to the company. These testimonials should allow you to have an increased sense of confidence the next time you’re negotiating for a raise. If your boss says, “I don’t know, your presentations haven’t been so good lately,” you can point to your emails and say, “As a matter of fact, Bob said that my time management of the staff meeting in December was better than ever.” Now that you know how to get the credit you deserve, in the next blink we’ll look at how to navigate career bumps. Are you tired of those awkward and unpleasant comments from Joe in accounting? Then a boost in gravitas can help you out. Having gravitas is all about acting in a serious and dignified manner. And it’s the best way to handle an undesirable situation, such as inappropriate sexual comments in the workplace. Gravitas starts with body language – with having a strong, upright and confident posture, and making eye contact with the person you’re talking to. Clothing also plays a big role in providing gravitas, so be sure to wear the items that provide you with a sense of power and control. For Steve Jobs, it was a black turtleneck shirt; for you, it might be a perfectly tailored blazer. When you have gravitas, it can help you deal with verbal sexual harassment. Generally speaking, you can confidently confront the harasser in one of three ways: You can question them by asking, “What do you mean by that comment?” Or, you could set clear boundaries and say, “I’m uncomfortable with your comment and I hope you’ll respect that.” Otherwise, you can use humor and say, “It sounds like someone is asking for a meeting with the head of HR.” In these situations, you should recognize that It’s better to be the “bitch” than the martyr. The sad fact is that when women put their best foot forward to get ahead in their career, they’re often seen as “bitchy.” According to Stanford University’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research, women are more likely to be penalized when they exhibit the same direct and assertive traits for which men are rewarded or even promoted. In the late nineties, Lara Druyan faced this double standard when she was the only woman speaking to a group of colleagues and managers at her company, Silicon Graphics. It was obvious from the moment she stepped up to speak; the audience stopped paying attention. This forced her to make a difficult decision. She knew that by being assertive and complaining about the disrespect, she ran the risk of being labeled a “bitch.” But she also knew that standing up for herself was the right choice, so she asked that the crowd give her the same respect that the other speakers received. Gravitas will come in useful throughout your professional career, since it works to ensure that others hear you loud and clear. We all know Facebook’s prime position as an international social network, but these days it can be used for far more than seeing what your old high school crush is up to. In fact, it’s also a tool that can help you generate a strong personal network that taps into the power of other women. Such a network can provide both professional and emotional support, and it can help you navigate the unique, gender-specific challenges that women face, like working through pregnancy and motherhood. Heidi Zak is the founder of the online bra company, ThirdLove. She first met her close friend and mentor, Lisa, at an investment bank she worked for when she was just out of college. Since then, Lisa has been her go-to source for advice on every major career decision – from leaving Google to starting ThirdLove to having her first child just as the new business got started. Years later, Zak repaid the kindness by writing Lisa a recommendation letter when she was applying to be a finance professor. She was also in a good position to give Lisa negotiation tips when she was offered a job with a start-up. But that doesn’t mean men should be excluded from your network! It’s a great idea to cultivate an honest friendship with a male peer. As an ally, he can lessen the feeling of being an outsider in a male-dominated workplace. One programmer, who was the only female on her team, told the author how she would always leave the office before her teammates began their after-hours drinking sessions. It was one of the reasons why she never felt as though she truly belonged. But if she’d had at least one male ally in the group, she probably would’ve felt more comfortable sticking around and having a beer. According to Catalyst, a research and advisory organization, 35 percent of professional women seek out a female mentor, while only 9 percent reach out to a male mentor – even though there are more men in senior positions. Due to our patriarchal society, the men often have the money and leverage needed to open doors, so it’s wise to keep them in your network. Either way, having close friends at the office, regardless of their gender, is a proven way to keep you passionate and engaged in your work. Do you, or someone you know, suffer from a case of “mommy guilt?” If you’re not sure, the symptoms include an inadequate work–life balance, with a lack of quality family time and too much time spent at work. If this sounds all too familiar, fear not. There is a remedy. One of the best ways to rid yourself of mommy guilt is to feel empowered in your career. When this happens, you’ll feel the positive effects at home, including a better sense that you’re a good role model. The author recalls that, throughout her childhood, her mother Selma would complain bitterly about how she had to sacrifice a promising career in medicine in order to raise her children. At the age of 63, Selma was transformed when she got her first job working as a barista in a Whole Foods Market. Thanks to the paycheck, and a feeling that she excelled in her position, she finally got that boost in self-esteem that comes from hard work. Even her grandchildren were inspired by Selma’s efforts and began looking up to her as a role model. However, contrary to what Selma once believed, having a family doesn’t mean your career has to take a hit. These days, thanks to parental leave, you can remain empowered at work even if you’re taking time off. And there are some tips to keep in mind to ensure this happens. Before you leave, work out all the details concerning which of your colleagues will be covering each of your responsibilities. Share this plan with your boss, along with your expected return date. You can also plan on remaining an active part of the team even if you’re not in the office. In fact, if you decide to work during your maternity leave, you could set yourself a few measurable performance goals during this period so that you can still feel good about being productive at work. Your self-esteem could also benefit from demonstrating how committed you are, even if you’re at home. So go ahead and show your boss that you can turn around assignments and answer emails quicker than ever if that fits with what you want to do. It’s also a good idea to keep in touch with at least one colleague so that you remain in the loop on any office politics or gossip that you may have missed out on. Is your mommy guilt reducing? Good. Rest assured that with some preplanning and a little flexibility you can remain at the top of your career and still enjoy parenthood. If you’ve been fired, or if you decide to quit your job, the first piece of advice is to remain calm. Take some deep breaths and remind yourself that this isn’t the end of the world – or even the end of your career! If you do decide to quit your job, this decision should be made in an effort to better your career and provide yourself with the opportunity to power UP in the future. It should never be a purely emotional reaction. If you’re trying to determine whether or not quitting is the right move, ask some close friends and colleagues for their opinion to get some alternative perspectives. No matter what, you should always strive to make big career decisions with a mind that is unclouded by raw emotions. If you’re experiencing a sexist work environment or dealing with an unexpected medical issue, you may be dealing with levels of anger or fear that are preventing you from seeing an actionable way of correcting the situation that doesn’t involve quitting. Ideally, when you quit, it should allow you to pivot to another great opportunity – like leaving an unsatisfying job to pursue your true passion. It shouldn’t be used as a way to escape a toxic environment, since your employer should be able to resolve such issues. Whether you quit or you lose your job, you should use this break from work as an opportunity to recharge. Remember Julie Wainwright from the consignment business The RealReal? Back in 2000, she found herself unemployed and in desperate need of recharging. Her company Pets.com had gone bust and become the laughing-stock of the industry. As if that wasn’t enough, she was also going through a painful divorce and several broken friendships. Wainwright didn’t try to quickly rebound from these psychological and professional disasters; instead, she took ten years to recharge. This involved returning to old hobbies like painting and drawing, which helped her regain some much needed self-confidence. The break also allowed her to find the inspiration for The RealReal. While out shopping with a friend, it dawned on her: she could build an online consignment shop that verified the designer goods from every vendor. It was perfect! Recharging is also an opportunity to get up to speed with the latest developments in the industry or to strengthen your network by meeting up with your most important connections. Most of all, it’s time to give yourself the clarity and space to connect with yourself and figure out your next move. Creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace is often easier said than done, but it’s always worth the effort, since it benefits the entire company. In fact, according to the Journal of Economic & Management Strategy, gender-diverse workforces earn 41 percent more revenue than gender-homogeneous ones. If you’re looking for a job, keep in mind that the interview process is the perfect time for you to find out how well you’ll fit in with a company’s culture, as well as how high your chances for advancement will be. Ask questions like, “How many women are in senior management positions?,” “What are your policies on parental leave?,” “How does the company assess performance?,” And how do you ensure people’s ideas are heard?” If you’re still unsure, you could also reach out to some women in the company to gauge their personal experiences. When GoDaddy’s chief product officer, Steven Aldrich, partnered with Stanford University’s Clayman Institute to study the employee-evaluation process, they found that the specific criteria for these evaluations makes a big difference. When businesses used criteria that didn’t explicitly reward the positive behaviors found in a gender-neutral environment, women were generally chastised more often for being “aggressive” in their communication. But after eighteen months of using criteria that was explicit, businesses routinely saw a narrowing of the pay gap between women and men. If you’re in a leadership position, here are some tips for how to create the diverse workforce you want to see. First of all, broaden your search. A good way to do this is to use recruitment networks that also reach women and minorities, like Power to Fly or Jopwell. If you’re looking at a series of candidates, don’t hire anyone until you’ve interviewed at least one qualified woman. Another tip is to train less qualified but more diverse candidates to become the talent you need. Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods, wanted to hire more female engineers, but they were unable to find any that had the experience they needed. But instead of giving up, they established a three-month training course called the Hacker School. After two sessions, Etsy was able to increase the number of female engineers by 18 percent. Nevertheless, you should always hire qualified talent. If you pass over great hires just to fill a quota, you’ll only be causing the employees you hire to wonder whether they really earned their job. It’s also important to remember that the standards you implement should give everyone the chance to excel. Whether you’re an employee, executive or an equal rights activist, every voice contributes to changing how the industry operates. The power UP movement is much bigger than any one person. The key message in these blinks: Breaking glass ceilings in the tech industry, or the New Economy at large, comes with its own set of challenges for women. But you should never look at these challenges as roadblocks that limit your potential. Powering UP is about staying confident during adversity, making sure your voice is heard and creating space for yourself where none is given. Since the New Economy doesn’t play by traditional rules, it’s filled with opportunities for you to embrace your individuality and find your own success. Got feedback?

How about cerium or praseodymium? If you’re like most people, then you probably feel a bit baffled at this point. So what are these things? Well, they’re rare earth metals, a group of minerals that, when taken together, encompass 17 chemical elements. Each has an extremely odd name, and although none of them is well known, each plays a crucial role in technology, both current and prospective. With unique properties that make them all but indispensable today, rare earth metals are present in smartphones, nuclear plants and advanced war technology. These blinks explore the history of these metals, as well as their many uses and the possible impact they’ll have on our geopolitical future. In these blinks, you’ll learn why thallium sulfate is called “inheritance powder”; what importance beryllium holds for the US Air Force; and how China’s access to rare earth metals will prove pivotal in the future. What is rare is always a matter of context and perspective. For example, in nineteenth-century China, it was rare to see someone riding a bicycle; today, however, there are about 430 million bicycles in China, and cyclists are a daily sight. Similarly, the actual rarity of rare earth metals is a matter of perspective. The name “rare earth metals” is shorthand for a category of 17 different chemical elements, all of which have odd names that are difficult to pronounce, like cerium, praseodymium, scandium and yttrium. When these elements were first discovered, people believed they were as scarce as diamonds or gold – hence the name. But in truth some of these metals can be found just about anywhere along the earth’s crust. In fact, if you were to examine a random sample of soil, you’d probably find as much europium, neodymium, holmium and ytterbium as copper, cobalt or nickel. So it’s not that rare earth metals are hard to find; it’s that they’re only found in very tiny quantities and it is extremely difficult and costly to separate them from their surroundings. This is why these elements continue to be considered rare, despite the fact that they’re all around us. These metals exist in such negligible quantities that you could go through tons and tons of soil and come away with only a gram or even just a milligram of one type. Therefore, in order to acquire enough of these elements to be useful, massive amounts of rocks have to be demolished, separated and sifted in a complicated and ultimately wasteful procedure. To remove the unwanted parts of the rocks, chemicals are used that actually destroy a portion of the elements that are being extracted. This means that, at the end of the day, you actually get even less of the rare earth metal. You could say that pinpointing a rare earth metal in a handful of soil is like searching for a needle in a haystack, so it stands to reason that their discovery was the result of chance rather than intention. That first discovery happened in Sweden, in the late eighteenth century. This wasn’t the work of a scientist or a geologist but of an army officer named Carl Axel Arrhenius who came across a strange black rock in a quarry near Ytterby, Sweden. Arrhenius named the rock ytterbite, after the location, and, three months later, after failing to determine its composition, he decided to hand it over to chemist Johan Gadolin. Gadolin found that a third of the black rock was composed of a completely unknown chemical compound, which he in turn named yttria. Gadolin spent the next few years analyzing the rock, and during this time he found that yttria was actually a compound of several different elements. Among these was a new element, bound up with oxygen atoms, that he named yttrium. In chemical terms, the presence of the oxygen atoms meant that yttrium was an oxide, but it also meant that it would be incredibly difficult to separate the element from these oxygen atoms. Because of this difficulty, centuries passed before rare earth metals were put to use. Other elements, like gold, can be extracted from oxide manually, but this isn’t the case with elements like yttrium, so new methods had to be developed. By the twentieth century, however, scientist had developed a method of bathing the rocks in concentrated acids and bases. The different liquid solutions allowed different elements to be extracted from the rock, a process that eventually rendered pure yttrium. Once isolated, this particular element was used, among other things, to make various screens – for radar and televisions and computers – where it helps create the color red. You’ve probably heard of dangerously radioactive elements such as uranium, and you probably have an idea of how they’ve been put to use. But did you know that rare earth metals are the real heroes of nuclear power plants? Unlike radioactive elements, rare earth metals are used to keep the nuclear power plants safe. Their ability to absorb neutrons makes them an ideal ingredient for the fuel rods that power the nuclear reaction. They help keep the reaction gradual and manageable instead of sudden and devastating. This process even has a bonus side effect. As the fuel rods partially disintegrate from the radioactive heat, a significant amount of the rare earth metals, rhodium, ruthenium and palladium, are created and extracted.   But of course this system isn’t without its dangers. All fuel rods eventually diminish to the point where they’re no longer useful – and the question of what to do with this nuclear waste is as tricky as it is controversial. The primary method is to store the waste in facilities that are located far from any human settlements and reinforced with lead to keep the radioactivity contained. However, this method has been the subject of much scrutiny and criticism, with many wondering how safe and secure these facilities really are. Recently, a method of recycling the materials has also been used, where the radioactive compounds are separated and neutralized, and then put to use elsewhere. But reprocessing nuclear waste isn’t as easy or as safe as it might sound. Plutonium, for instance, once it’s been neutralized and separated from the nuclear waste, is a potentially major security hazard. If anyone managed to get their hands on enough plutonium powder, they could conceivably build their own nuclear bomb. If you like to read a good murder mystery, you might be familiar with the 1961 Agatha Christie novel The Pale Horse. The plot hinges on a number of mysterious deaths that are revealed (spoiler alert!) to be poisonings caused by the metal thallium. Unfortunately, rare-earth-metal poisoning is not just a thing of fiction.   Christie even received a fair amount of criticism for providing would-be murderers with an untraceable way to administer death. As it turned out, thallium became such a popular poison that it was dubbed “inheritance powder” due to the number of heirs and heiresses that benefited from a relative’s early (and suspect) demise. In its natural state, thallium doesn’t dissolve in water. But in the compound thallium sulfate, it becomes a white crystallized salt, and the metal is given an electromagnetic charge that allows it to bond with water molecules.   All that is needed to kill an adult is one gram dissolved in a drink. And since it was the main ingredient in commercial rat poison until 1972, thallium sulfate wasn’t so hard to come by. But this isn’t the kind of poison that has someone gasping and clutching their throat after one sip of tainted coffee. What makes thallium sulfate the true poison of choice is how discreet it is. After a victim ingests it, the compound breaks apart, allowing the thallium metal to enter the bloodstream. The atoms of thallium, which closely resemble those of potassium, are allowed entry to the cellular channels, and this leads to a slow deterioration of health that, within a few weeks, results in death. This slow sickness has symptoms that can easily be confused with many other deadly illnesses, making it an ideal murder weapon that still gets used today. In 2011, after further inspection of what appeared to be the suicide of a man in Boston, it was revealed that he’d actually been poisoned with thallium by his ex-wife, Tianle Li, a pharmaceutical chemist. Many of the political and economic discussions these days include remarks about the growing power of China. But what often goes unmentioned is China’s key resource: rare earth metals. Remarkably, the vast majority of all the planet’s rare earth metals are in China.   The country is so rich in these precious elements that geologists compare it to the wealth represented by Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves. In other words, the rest of the world has to beg for scraps and is utterly dependent on China to manufacture the numerous products that require these metals. Naturally, unstable political relations only make access to these raw materials all the more difficult. Between 2012 and 2015, China tried to restrict the exportation of rare earth metals, but their attempts were overruled by the World Trade Organization in 2015.   Much of China’s rare earth metals are concentrated in one area: the Bayan Obo Mining District in the region of Inner Mongolia. Originally developed to extract iron, these mines date back to the 1930s. But after chemists discovered the importance of rare earth metals, the focus shifted to the extraction of much more valuable resources, such as tantalum and niobium. Okay, but how did this area end up with such a high concentration of these elements? For an answer we have to go back over 400 million years ago, long before humans walked the earth, to the mid-Proterozoic period. At this time, the earth was much more like Venus, with searing heat, swamps and an atmosphere that contained very little oxygen. Though we can pin down the arrival time of the rare earth metals, no one is certain exactly how or why they appeared. There is a theory, however, that this large deposit in China is the result of a tectonic shift that brought up volcanic magma and precious metals from the earth’s core. Afghanistan is also home to a significant amount of rare earth metals – a fact that may help the country liberate itself from its violent history. Positioned in the geopolitical hotbed between the Middle East, Russia, China and India, Afghanistan has long been an arena where foreign forces wage their wars. Much of today’s turmoil dates back to the 1980s, when the United States supported Afghan rebel factions who were fighting against the Soviet Union. The US involvement was part of a multi-million dollar CIA operation called Cyclone, which provided weapons – including portable anti-aircraft missiles – and training to tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers between 1979 and 1989. The CIA wanted to make sure the Soviet Union couldn’t rule over Afghanistan, and so a war between the United States and the Soviet Union was waged on Afghan turf. Ironically, the United States would return to Afghanistan a decade later, at the turn of the twenty-first century, this time to fight the militant Islamists they had helped arm and bring to power. Afghanistan may yet find a path to prosperity, however. The best hope for Afghanistan to move past its history as a war zone and become a nation with a stable economy may well be its supply of rare earth metals. The 2010 US Geological Survey reported a large amount of rare earth metals, as well as iron and gold, residing just beneath the surface of the Afghan soil. The value of these resources has been estimated at somewhere between one and three trillion dollars. Such wealth, stemming from natural geologic resources, could potentially rebuild the economy and the education system, as well as bring communities out of poverty. Rare earth metals could be Afghanistan’s way to finally escape being the battlefield on which other powerful nations play their war games. Could you list the elements present in your smartphone or video game system? More and more, these technologies rely on rare earth metals (which is probably why most people couldn’t tell you what’s going on behind the screens). But rare earth metals are mainly coveted for less pedestrian reasons.   Indeed, they’re primarily used in new military technologies.   The US Department of Defense has said that the rare earth metal beryllium plays a central role in their plans for US security, while also acknowledging that supplies are scarce. Currently, a beryllium-aluminum alloy is used to make the frames of five families of fighter jets, including the popular F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which many countries rely on for military security. Beryllium’s lightness makes the alloy a superior material, perfect for optimizing aerodynamic dexterity. Within many aircrafts and drones, you’ll find beryllium being used to build the electrical circuits. It can also be found in radar technology and the devices used to detect bombs and other explosives. The military also takes advantage of beryllium’s ability to make glass resistant to the vibrational pressures common to most combat zones; it’s used, for instance, in the mirrors that tank drivers use to navigate. And of course there are many non-military uses for rare earth metals as well – particularly in the area of new energy technologies. Electric cars are heavily reliant on the rare earth metal lanthanum. In fact, every Toyota Prius requires nearly twenty pounds of lanthanum, most of which is used to increase the storage capacity of the car’s battery. Naturally, without such a powerful battery, the Prius wouldn’t be such a success. More controversially, there’s thorium – a radioactive rare earth element that is being developed as an alternative to traditional uranium for use in new nuclear power plants. Though research is ongoing, future nuclear facilities could potentially be powered by a thorium-fluoride salt that is predicted to be more stable and much safer. Like other natural resources, there is a finite amount of rare earth metals, so the central question is: What will we do when our supplies run dry? While some experts are searching for renewable resources as a replacement, others are looking to the stars. No one knows for sure just how large the supply on other planets may be, but there’s a good chance that it’s quite big indeed. After all, rare earth metals were first formed when stars were dying in outer space. When a star is born, its core contains only basic elements like hydrogen, helium and lithium. But as the star gradually heats up, atoms like iron begin forming. And as the iron continues to build up, the star loses energy and starts to cool down, which is when the death spiral begins. It’s during this time that neutrons collide with atomic nuclei in a way that produces rare earth metals and other complex chemical elements. But the final frontier of outer space poses many questions, such as who is going to lay claim to these precious metals.   The United States may have been the first to plant a flag on the moon, but it remains to be seen whether this entitles them to all the moon’s resources. The United Nations tried to resolve potential disputes in the 1966 Outer Space Treaty. It states that outer space should be treated like deep oceanic waters and not be considered the property of any one nation; rather, it should belong to all nations. Notably, none of the primary outer space explorers – Russia, China, the United States – has signed this treaty. Each of them is obviously waiting to see if they can claim sole ownership of certain celestial territories – and certain valuable metals. The key message in this book: Rare earth metals are a group of complex chemical compounds that are going to play a large role in the military and civilian technologies of the future. The race for resources is on, and China has a crucial advantage.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Rather than visiting travel agents or waiting to hail a taxi, we only need a few clicks or taps and can be on our way. Many of the companies that are thriving today – such as Airbnb or Uber – are part of the “sharing economy.” Companies in the sharing economy don’t really do very much; instead, they prefer to connect buyers directly with sellers. For example, Airbnb helps those looking for a room get in touch with those who have one to spare. It sounds like an ideal and egalitarian system – but it isn’t. There is a dangerous side effect to the sharing economy, one that, if left unchallenged, could bring down the entire US economy. These blinks explain why the economy is facing oblivion and how we can hope to fix it before it’s too late. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why Uber doesn’t “employ” its drivers; why manual laborers shouldn’t fear robots; and why cheap window cleaners could contribute to economic collapse in the United States. You may not realize it, but every time you use Airbnb or Uber, you’re taking part in a new economy, known as the peer-to-peer or sharing economy. While it might sound like an exciting new development, many are raising important questions about how good this new business model really is for the economy and society as a whole. Those in favor of the sharing economy call it revolutionary, and believe it could create a kinder, gentler strain of capitalism. And since it removes the middleman and cuts through the red tape of government regulations, supporters see it as a path to greater freedom in the marketplace. Let’s take a closer look at Airbnb. While it has by now grown into an enormous multinational corporation, it was first seen as an exciting new business venture that could disrupt the market by offering an alternative to overpriced hotels. It even received praise from across the political spectrum, with liberals seeing it as an example of self-sufficiency and sustainable practices, while conservatives supported its decentralized business model. But as we can see now, neither is true. The benefits of a sharing economy are mixed at best, and what we’re left with is raw capitalism and impersonal, faceless transactions. Airbnb might have begun with the idea of letting people make some extra money by sharing a spare room, but the company’s greed has since destroyed that concept. Airbnb is now flooded with professional renters, and landlords are evicting regular tenants in order to make more money through temporary rentals. Even though Airbnb is aware of this, they obscure this fact by putting forward a wholesome image of sharing. They also disregard laws that try to protect tenants. Many cities prohibit rentals for less than 30 days so that tenants have some security. But Airbnb dodges these regulations by positioning itself merely as a booking agent that can’t be held responsible for how anyone might use their services illegally. Airbnb has also avoided the responsibility of paying hotel taxes in a similar fashion. But as we’ll see in the blinks ahead, there are many more serious problems with the sharing economy. Airbnb isn’t alone in abusing the sharing economy and bending laws to maximize profits. Uber is another great example of a company that is ruthless in its search for loopholes in laws designed to protect clients and employees. This is why, in an effort to avoid paying social security contributions, Uber calls its drivers “contractors” instead of employees. Uber also has very lax security protocols, which has allowed known criminals to register and become drivers – sadly there have been a number of shocking rapes and assaults committed by Uber drivers. But much like Airbnb, Uber avoids responsibility by claiming it isn’t a taxi company at all; rather, it positions itself as a tech firm that simply connects customers with drivers. Therefore, it can’t be held responsible for whatever the drivers might do or any danger their customers might find themselves in. This also allows Uber to avoid the taxes and license fees that traditional taxi companies must pay. All of this means Uber can undercut the costs of other companies while costing states and cities huge amounts of revenue. And while there are ways to force companies like Uber to fall in line with existing laws, there needs to be support from politicians and the public. But to make matters more complicated, Uber’s drivers often try to improve their wages by only working in areas and at times where rates and demands are at their highest. This is known as “surge driving,” and while it results in Uber paying their drivers more, it also leaves a lot of areas with little or no access to the service. Since the public doesn’t understand why the drivers are resorting to surge driving, they blame them for Uber’s problems and not the company itself. And since politicians have yet to see Uber’s abuse of existing legal loopholes as a priority, regulations continue to be weak and ineffective. As a result, we’re left with crooked companies and exploited workers. If you’re a permanent employee at a company or organization, you can count your lucky stars that you have a stable job with steady income and perhaps even benefits. After all, today’s job market is becoming increasingly reliant on independent contractors, which is not a good thing. There’s a name for this growing trend in the United States: the 1099-economy, since these contractors fill out a 1099-MISC form at tax time, rather than the standard W-2 form. But more importantly, this growing community are all paid by the hour and receive no health benefits, retirement plan or social security. As a result, businesses can save money by outsourcing their work to these freelancers. Some companies have even fired their employees in order to rehire them as contractors with a wage reduction and no benefits, which is what happened at the LGBT magazine Out. Other companies unevenly split their workforce between a few well-paid employees with benefits and a majority of freelancers. Google does this, and the practice even extends to its bus drivers, who are contracted to commute employees to and from their offices. While this is a popular way of doing business around the world, it’s at its worst in the United States. Other countries have put laws in place to protect contractors and temp workers. In Germany, for instance, they are protected by the same wage laws as regular workers, while in Brazil, companies are required to hire a temp as a regular employee after three months of work. None of these laws apply in the United States, which is why you can easily find “perma-temps” who have worked for years at the same company, but always with the status of a temp and always earning less than other employees. These workers can often feel trapped in this situation; they have a desk and an e-mail address just like a regular employee, but they have neither the insurance and security of their coworkers, nor the freedom of other freelancers. This arrangement isn’t good for anyone, since it undermines the middle class, who need secure and well-paid jobs to continue being the consumers that create a strong economy. When secure jobs disappear, so does a secure economy. Have you heard about TaskRabbit? It’s another great example of the dangers inherent in the sharing economy: if you need someone to mow your lawn, you can post the job on TaskRabbit and give it to the person who makes the cheapest offer. Some might say this is a good way to provide work to the unemployed, but a more truthful evaluation is that it’s exploiting those in need. This new economy often gets sugarcoated with language like “sharing” or “peer-to-peer employment,” but a more accurate description would be a “share-the-crumbs-economy.” Services like TaskRabbit wouldn’t work without a depressed labor market in which a lot of people are willing to do just about anything for a little bit of money. It’s only under poor economic conditions that people would offer and accept cheap labor on an auction site. Ultimately, when you auction off your labor and compete with people around the world for meager jobs, you’re going to end up getting underpaid. Even when a local job like cleaning windows is up for grabs, workers will underbid each other to win a chance to get whatever crumbs they can. On the off chance you find a decent-paying job, it still doesn’t factor in expenses, and when you consider the time and money spent commuting and searching, the job will always be worth much less than advertised. The nature of these jobs adds to what is known as the “informal economy,” which is untaxed, uncontrolled by government and often illegal. Whether it’s a nanny that is getting paid under the table or black-market and criminal activities, they all contribute to this underground economy. These jobs are not only untaxed and precarious – if the employee gets ripped off, there’s no recourse for them to seek justice, leading to a greater chance of exploitation. In 2012, underground economic activity in the United States totaled roughly $2 trillion. This is double what it was in 2009 and equal to 13 percent of the country’s overall gross domestic product. It’s often believed that machines and robots are putting blue-collar jobs at risk. But these aren’t the jobs that are in real danger – it’s those with high-skilled jobs that should be most concerned. Automation is expensive, so it makes sense to have it perform the tasks that cost companies the most, which are middle- to high-skilled jobs. This is why there are robotic algorithms now scanning law documents to find important concepts, as well as sorting medications and even composing music. In the end, this may actually start to bring jobs back to the United States that were previously being outsourced – only now, they will be done by machines. For instance, the interpretation of MRI results was a common job to outsource to India, but it may soon be cheaper for local automated services to perform. A more dangerous threat to blue-collar workers is the deterioration of labor regulations. It’s no secret that labor unions have gradually been losing their power, but the new unions that are springing up are threatening, rather than strengthening, labor rights. One such organization is the Freelancers Union, which is mainly active in New York. While this union does work to open health clinics for freelancers, its overall vision is to go back to pre-1930s conditions. As stated by founder Sara Horowitz, they hope to get rid of the government and state regulations protecting employee rights that were set by the New Deal, and instead let the private sector set the rules. However, this goes against the interests of freelancers and all employees in general. History has clearly shown that without government regulations, there are no secure labor rights, and salaries and benefits are guaranteed to plummet. And with freelancers already underemployed and underpaid, this would only harm them further. With all these developments, the traditional model of the US economy is taking one crushing blow after another. What people fail to understand is that the US economy performs best when its workers are happy. When employees get paid a decent wage, it allows them to buy the products that others in their society produce. And it’s this demand for products that keeps the economy going. Henry Ford understood this system back in the early 1900s, which is why he made sure his employees made enough money to buy the cars they were manufacturing. He knew that a prosperous American worker was crucial to a strong economy. It was this well-functioning consumer society that made the United States the dominant economic power throughout the twentieth century. And when the economy took a downturn in the 1930s, the government did what it could to help: it increased government benefits for employees and created jobs for the unemployed so that American goods continued to be bought and sold. This is why, by lowering the workers’ wages, the sharing economy is endangering the very fabric of the consumer system. Though the United States continues to produce goods and services that are worth $16.8 trillion, lower pay and job insecurity means that fewer and fewer people can actually afford to buy them. This creates an imbalance, with a surplus of production on one hand and a serious lack of demand on the other; if this gets bad enough, the economy could soon implode. The author has a name for this eventuality: the economic singularity. To understand the effects of this, you can look at the economic depression that Japan has been going through for over a decade now. But it is avoidable. If the United States were to take steps similar to those Germany has taken and create policies that protect employees and freelancers, it could maintain consumer demand and keep the economy healthy. In the final blink, we’ll take a closer look at the choices the United States can make to prevent an economic singularity from taking place. The United States now stands at a crossroads: in one direction there’s the new New Deal, which values the employee and protects their prosperity, and in the other direction there’s the Raw Deal, which follows the sharing economy and its inevitable decline. If we want to prevent another economic depression, we need to agree on some fundamental issues. First, we have to put an end to working with quasi-independent contractors, a system that blurs the line between freelancers and employees. There is really no reason employers shouldn’t be willing to pay social security for contractors. It would cost less than $2.00 per hour for each worker if the employer took advantage of the subsidies currently offered by Obamacare. Now, some employers might think this is still too much – but compared to the long-term consequences for the economy, it’s well worth it. Companies like Wal-Mart get away with grossly underpaying their staff because their employees receive extra help from the government. But this adds up to an annual bill of $6.2 billion that US taxpayers have to cover, and if we continue going in this direction, the amount will only increase. Although things are looking dire, it’s not too late. The US economy can be saved, and there are places around the world that can be a source of inspiration. European countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden have implemented policies that help both employers and employees. Instead of cutting jobs, when a business is facing tough times, all of its employees scale back their hours and wages to reduce costs until things turn around. This is the kind of practice US business should consider before resorting to layoffs and making a select few work harder. If people need to feel secure enough to spend money and keep the economy afloat, they can’t worry that they’ll be out of a job the moment things get tough. If businesses can once again recognize the importance of job security and offer a reasonable living wage, there is still hope that we can put the economy back on the right track – and everyone will win as a result. The key message in this book: The sharing economy has been hyped as the new path to prosperity. But this is a false promise that advances a dangerous business model that not only endangers the livelihoods of workers and customers but the entire existing socioeconomic structure as well. This is why it’s time for some important regulatory changes. Actionable Advice Forget about the sharing economy and go for the solidarity economy. If you’re interested in what’s good for society in the long run, look to the solidarity economy.

They also have shops where you can borrow physical items instead of buying them yourself. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Such is the story of Bill Browder, one of the biggest foreign investors in post-Soviet Russia. Browder rebelled from his intellectual, communist-leaning family to pursue a life of high finance, tackling with MBA in hand the wild-west investment landscape of the former Eastern bloc. He determinedly and quickly rose to a position of enormous financial power – and met head on local oligarchs who didn’t take kindly to a foreigner encroaching on their plans for economic domination. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a fight for business transparency got Browder labeled a threat to Russia’s national security. What’s more, you’ll realize that in the Russian “free market,” there are plenty of people willing to kill to hold on to what they have – whether gained legitimately or not. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how Browder’s savvy thinking during Russia’s privatization earned him $125 million; why Browder had to spend some 15 hours in limbo in a Russian airport; how one lawyer who discovered the truth died for confronting corrupt officials. As Bill Browder boarded a plane on November 13, 2005, he didn’t think that day would be different from any other. He often flew from his home in London to Moscow, where he worked. But this time was different. When Browder landed in Moscow, the Russian customs officers wouldn’t let him through. Instead, they detained him for 15 hours, without food or water, and sent him back to London without explanation. This event baffled Browder. As the founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital, an investment company worth $4.5 billion, Browder was essentially the largest foreign investor in Russia. What happened? To find out, let’s start at the beginning. Bill Browder was born in 1964 to an intellectual family with communist sympathies. Browder’s father, Felix, was an accomplished mathematician; his grandfather Earl Browder was a labor union organizer from Kansas. Earl became the leader of the Communist Party of the United States and was invited to Moscow for an official visit in 1926. Browder, however, found it difficult to embrace the left-wing beliefs of his family, so he rebelled – and chose to become a capitalist, instead. Even after receiving an MBA from Stanford, Browder was still fascinated with his grandfather’s legacy, an interest that inspired him to look for business opportunities in the former Soviet sphere. In 1989, Browder joined the Boston Consulting Group and moved to London, as the focus of the company’s London office was Eastern Europe. Later, in 1991, he joined Maxwell Communications Corporation, one of the only Western firms investing in Eastern Europe at the time. His experience with Maxwell allowed him to explore nearly every country of the former Soviet bloc, and in doing so, he was a key player in many regional investments. Before too long Maxwell was revealed to have been involved in financial fraud. Browder quickly left, and in 1992 took up an associate position with the Eastern European investment banking team at Salomon Brothers in London. As Browder started his job at Salomon Brothers, he was given one simple rule: Generate five times your yearly salary in 12 months, or be fired. As Browder pondered how to meet such expectations, he noticed that nobody was investing in Russia. So he decided to plant the seed that Salomon Brothers invest in Russian businesses. This turned out to be an incredible opportunity, for both the investment firm and Browder. As Russia made its transition from state-controlled communism to free-market capitalism, the government was giving away much of the state’s property to private individuals. This was done through a process called voucher privatization. Russian citizens thus received certificates that represented potential shares in state-owned companies. Browder knew that these vouchers were highly undervalued and could be easily purchased. On his recommendation, Salomon Brothers bought $25 million worth of vouchers, which it used to reinvest in Russian companies. This idea proved successful. By 1994, Browder’s investment portfolio was worth $125 million – ensuring that Browder had not only made five times his salary, but five hundred times! Browder was suddenly a financial superstar. But once again, he felt it was time to move on. For him, the culture at Salomon Brothers was one of envy and greed – and he didn’t want to be part of it. Based on his already stellar reputation, Browder founded an investment company in Russia called Hermitage Capital. He attracted big investors, including Edmond Safra and Beny Steinmetz, to help start a fund for investing in Russian companies. By 1996, Browder had raised $25 million. He moved to Moscow, where his winning streak continued. As just one example, Hermitage invested $11 million in Sidanco, a large oil company in western Siberia. With its huge oil reserves comparable to other Western oil giants yet low production costs, Sidanco was a profitable investment. But things were about to change. Browder was on a crash course with one of the most important business leaders in Russia. By the summer of 1996, Browder was riding high. Hermitage Capital was a success, having grown some 65 percent since its founding. But things were about to come crashing down. Sidanco, the Siberian oil company in which Browder had invested heavily, was controlled by Russian billionaire and business oligarch Vladimir Potanin. In early 1997, the company announced that it would triple the total number of company shares and sell them at a price 95 percent lower than the going market rate. What did this mean? All of Browder’s shares in Sidanco would dramatically decrease in value, and his Hermitage fund would lose $87 million. Sidanco’s move was illegal, and Browder soon discovered that Potanin was deliberately trying to squeeze him out of the business. Potanin essentially didn’t want a foreigner to get rich through his company. Browder decided to fight back. He brought the story to the media, reaching out to newspapers and launching a legal investigation backed by the Russian Federal Securities and Exchange Commission. A move this bold was unprecedented, as few Russians would dare to confront publicly someone as powerful as Potanin. People who crossed oligarchs often met with unsavory ends. Potanin eventually reversed his decision to issue Sidanco shares. Thus, Browder won his battle, and he continued to do well with his investments in the oil giant. In 1998, however, Browder’s victory was overshadowed when the Russian stock market crashed on the heels of an economic crisis in Asia. Browder had hoped that Russia could avoid contamination, but he was wrong. In the crash, his Hermitage fund lost $900 million, or 90 percent of its value. Browder wasn’t about to give up. He was determined to make up his losses, and in doing so, he set himself up for another run-in with Russia’s richest and most powerful men. Despite his losses, Browder stayed on in Moscow. He was determined to recover his investments for his clients, no matter what. This set him running headlong into another confrontation with Russia’s powerful oligarchs. Browder soon discovered that many of these men were stealing from companies in which he was investing. Browder had invested in Gazprom, a large Russian natural gas company. This firm managed an enormous gas field called Tarko Saley. Yet it turned out that Gazprom’s executives had essentially stolen ownership of Tarko Saley, which contained some four hundred billion cubic meters of gas, worth billions of dollars. Again, Browder made the details of his discovery public. He also brought to light the rampant corruption he uncovered in other companies that were part of his investment portfolio. As he shared his findings with international media outlets, he also pointed fingers at other corrupt Russian oligarchs. His insistence that corruption be stopped helped Browder recover his investment losses. The revelation at Gazprom pushed the company shares to new lows, trading at more than 90 percent under their original value. The issue was that the public had believed corrupt officials had stolen some 90 percent of the energy company’s assets. Yet Browder’s investigations showed that the stolen assets amounted to only 10 percent. Once this was clarified, Gazprom shares jumped and Browder started recouping his losses. By the end of 2003, Browder had bounced back from his 1998 losses, and his fund’s value had risen more than 1,200 percent! But again, his victory didn’t last long. Browder’s fight put him on a collision course with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the oligarchs essentially formed Putin’s power base. This was the wall Browder ran into on November 13, 2005. The 15-hour detention, the inexplicable return to London? The Russian Foreign Ministry had decided Browder was a threat to national security. After discovering he was listed as a national security threat, Browder knew he had to act quickly. His first move was to get his core staff and his clients’ money out of Russia as soon as possible. Yet this move caused his clients to panic and bail out of the Hermitage fund completely. The fund eventually folded. Matters only got worse. On June 4, 2007, Russian police raided Browder’s Moscow offices, kept open on the small chance that Browder’s visa would be reinstated. Some 25 plainclothes officers, under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Artem Kuznetsov, showed up and grabbed everything they could, including computers, corporate stamps and seals. The raid was justified in that officials claimed Browder owed the state a large amount of tax. Browder's tax lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, began an investigation into the state’s claims. He found that not only did Browder's companies not owe any money but also that Browder had actually overpaid by $140,000. More importantly, Magnitsky discovered that after the raid, ownership in three of Browder’s companies had been transferred, without Browder knowing, to a man named Viktor Markelov. It turned out that Markelov was a convicted murderer and known accomplice of Artem Kuznetsov – the officer in charge of the raids on Browder’s offices! How was this possible? Well, all that was needed to make the ownership transfer legit was Browder’s official corporate stamps and seals, taken during the police raid. But what was the reason for such subterfuge? It turns out that corruption in Russia ran deeper – and was even more brutal – than even Browder could imagine. Luckily Browder had moved most of his cash out of Russia before his companies were stolen from underneath him. But this begged the question – since the companies essentially had no assets, what exactly were the thieves up to? Their plan, it turns out, involved using Browder’s companies to defraud the Russian state of $230 million. Artem Kuznetsov, the officer who led the raid on Browder’s offices, was the ringleader, and he was in partnership with Pavel Karpov, the lead investigator for Browder’s case. Here’s how it worked. First, they used Browder’s seized official stamps and seals to forge agreements, making it appear that his companies owed $1 billion in liabilities to other companies. Then in a court hearing (about which Browder wasn’t even aware), bribed lawyers confirmed that Browder’s companies did indeed owe the sums indicated. Interestingly, the amount of money that was being asked for exactly matched the earnings of the three companies, putting their combined profits at zero. This allowed the fraudulent new owners to request a tax refund of $230 million from the state, the amount that Browder’s companies had legitimately paid in taxes. In a final move, the two criminals bribed tax officials to ensure that the refund was approved. But Sergei Magnitsky, Browder’s lawyer, was keenly aware of what was going on. In an attempt to expose the fraud, Magnitsky testified against Kuznetsov and Karpov. Browder worried that Magnitsky’s actions might have serious repercussions and urged him to leave Russia. He refused. In retaliation, Kuznetsov and Karpov had Magnitsky arrested. He went to prison a healthy man, but 12 months later, he died on November 16, 2009, after being denied medical care and tortured. Shortly after Magnitsky's death, the Russian General Prosecutor’s Office stated that the incident involved no violations of the law. But the sad truth surrounding the death of Sergei Magnitsky paints a different picture. Magnitsky was kept in an unheated cell, with no windowpanes to keep out the cold winter air. The toilet was open to the sleeping area, and raw sewage often bubbled up, covering the floor. Magnitsky was also refused any contact with his family, a further act of psychological torture. As Magnitsky’s physical health weakened, he and his lawyer wrote more than 20 requests to every branch of Russia’s penal, law enforcement and judicial system, asking that Magnitsky receive medical attention. Some requests were simply ignored while others were officially denied. The Interior Ministry eventually posted an official statement saying that Magnitsky had never filed any complaints. On the eve of November 16, 2009, Magnitsky was taken to an isolated cell, handcuffed to a bed rail and beaten to death by eight guards in full riot gear. Seeking justice for Magnitsky’s death, Browder appealed to politicians and human rights organizations. Eventually, he received some support from the US government. On December 14, 2012, the Magnitsky Act was signed into law by President Barack Obama. It imposes financial and visa sanctions on Russian officials known to have been involved in Sergei Magnitsky’s murder. Browder still feels grief and guilt over Magnitsky’s death. But the passing of the Magnitsky Act provides a sense of justice, a glimmer of hope at the end of a tragedy. The key message in this book: Bill Browder was the largest foreign investor in Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union. While embroiled in a fight with Russian oligarchs, he also became a target of corrupt Russian state officials. Browder was forced to leave the country while his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was murdered in prison. These events led Browder to push for legislation in the United States to penalize those responsible for Magnitsky’s untimely death. Got feedback?

Have you ever wondered where the meat in your supermarket comes from? And why are mega packs of meat so cheap? You probably know it’s the result of mass production, but how exactly does that work? Mass production is a worldwide phenomenon. In the last few decades, there’s been a global shift away from small pastoral farms to large factory-style plants that allow us to produce more meat than ever before.  The food industry has become globalized. People in China now eat chicken breast produced in the United States and American farmers feed their cows on food grown in Brazil.  However, this newly globalized mass production causes a number of problems for both humans and animals.  Workers in these mega plants have to come face to face with some of the cruelest conditions for animals on the planet. They have to learn to mentally shut themselves off just to continue their work. In fact, many of the employees at factory farms become vegetarians.  Factory-farm employees also face physical dangers at work. They’re exposed to high levels of ammonia from the animals’ urine and feces, which often results in a chronic or even incurable cough. If you have asthma, you can die if you’re exposed to these fumes unprotected for just one hour.  Of course, these plants are also awful for the animals, who don’t have the option to leave like the human workers do. They live out the entirety of their short lives in constant misery. Many people break out in tears when they enter an egg factory for the first time. Why is that? Well, the chickens in these factories are kept in tiny battery cages that are lightless and dirty. When Sonia Faruqi, the author, was researching egg factories, she found that four to eight chickens were sometimes stuffed into cages the size of a microwave. The cages are stacked on top of each other and rarely or never cleaned, with up to 300,000 animals in one factory.  The chickens also live in a constant state of filth. They’re often surrounded by dead birds because workers are too lazy to remove corpses, and their cages are kept dark because it makes the birds slightly calmer. Most birds in egg factories never experience the sun.  And what happens to the mental state of these birds?  The birds go mad from the conditions they’re forced to live in. They try to peck each other to death, so many farmers cut their highly sensitive beaks off with hot knives. But the animals still peck each other raw even after their beaks are mutilated. They sometimes even start eating each other alive.  Chickens are also genetically modified to produce more eggs and meat, with horrible consequences. They’re bred to lay as many eggs as possible or have massive breasts. Hens die because their insides get pushed out of their bodies from the pressure of laying over 300 eggs per year, and some birds can’t walk because their chests are so large their bodies can’t carry their weight.  And though poultry conditions are terrible, pigs have it even worse.  The pig is one of the world’s most intelligent and social animals. They love to interact with others and can build strong, emotional relationships. So how are they treated in the factory-farm system? The meat industry views pigs purely as tools of production, not as living beings, and it shows. Pigs are bred to give more meat and have bigger litters than usual; today, they’re fatter than ever and have piglets in more rapid cycles.  Larger pigs are kept in tiny crates where they’re unable to move, and are often internally probed and medicated by humans. A sow can be up to six feet long and weigh over 500 pounds, but these intelligent animals, who love to move around, are kept in filthy crates so small that they have to stand because there isn’t enough room to lie down.  When sows are due to farrow, some farmers stick their entire arm into the womb to speed up the birthing process. This rarely helps and only leaves the sow in more pain.  Sows are also often heavily medicated to kill bacteria and increase their appetites. In fact, 70 percent of the antibiotics used in the United States are used on animals that don’t need them, which has increased antibiotic resistance. Their babies often go unmedicated, however, even when they do need it.  Like chickens, piglets are often mutilated to prevent fighting. Many factories cut their piglets’ tails off at a young age so they can’t be bitten by their littermates. Some farmers even castrate young piglets without anesthetic. A European declaration of goals aims to have this practice discontinued continent-wide by 2018 because of the intense pain it causes the animals.  We’ve looked at the conditions for live animals, but how do their tragic lives end? Unfortunately, the kill process is also very difficult for them. Slaughter is often done incorrectly and goes unchecked by inspectors.  To be properly slaughtered, animals are supposed to be stunned first, then killed within the following 15 seconds. This rarely happens, however.  Most workers aren’t properly trained to kill animals painlessly. They also tend to care little about stunning them, so they kill them when they’re still conscious.  Some workers even inflict this suffering just to save themselves a few minutes and get home earlier. They may do that by not stunning them properly or by cutting into them while they’re still alive.  Inspectors are supposed to check the slaughter process every few hours and report or penalize any violation of protective laws, but they are often employees of the very slaughterhouses they’re inspecting, and are therefore incentivized not to report anything.  Animal slaughter also has a big impact on the butchers. Workers in factory farms are constantly surrounded by blood, cruelty and death. Many don’t have job prospects other than killing for a living, and their workplace environment can leave a lasting impression on their psyches.  It’s common for employees to quit after only a month in the slaughter business. Those that manage to get through the first year often suffer from severe mental problems and have to protect themselves against the dangers of their work.  Nader, a man the author spoke to, has worked most of his life in slaughter. His body is covered in scars from work accidents, he has a number of psychological problems and he can’t stand straight without a back brace because a large metal hook once fell on him, leaving him permanently debilitated. When you go into the supermarket, you’ll find eggs with different labels. Some are organic and others are free-range, but what does “free-range” actually mean? In the United States and Canada, “free-range” simply means that the animals have some kind of access to the outdoors. Outdoor access isn’t clearly defined, however, as the law lacks rules about what that access is supposed to look like.  Factory farms also have very loose rules, which sometimes aren’t even adhered to. Lots of plants have small, dark backyards that the animals are rarely allowed to roam, or don’t want to enter because of the state of them.  Yet this kind of vague outdoor access is still considered enough for the factories to be termed “free-range.” When the author visited one turkey farm, she discovered that the animals were deprived of outdoor access for months because of a broken fence. None of them had ever seen the sun, and yet these were still “free-range” turkeys.  Laws regulating organic production aren’t sufficient either. Animals on organic farms in the United States and Canada need to be allowed outside at least 120 days a year, but this is still much worse than many European farms, where organic farmers are required to let their animals out every other day.  Standards for organic farms in Canada are flimsy too. Cows there can still be tethered by the neck and kept in small cubicles, restricting their movement and forcing them to stand on their own feces for most of their lives. That practice has been banned even in the United States, but Canada still lags behind. We’ve seen that the United States and Canada have weak regulations when it comes to free-range farms, but sadly the laws for organic farms are still far from rigorous.  Organic dairy cows are treated better than cows in factories, but their treatment is still sub-par. You might assume that organic farmers want their animals to live happily because they allow the cattle to go outside for 120 days; the reality, however, is quite different. Most cows are only allowed outside for exactly 120 days, so the farmers can meet the minimum requirement. This is an improvement on the conditions of animals kept in small pens for their whole lives, but it’s still not enough to keep them happy.  And when the animals are kept inside, they’re still subjected to terrible living conditions. Dairy cows spend most of their lives in tiny stalls where they can’t turn around. If they try to move, they’re shocked with electric sticks. They’re also often tied by their necks for days and separated from each other. Their excrement collects in gutters in their stalls, which aren’t cleaned for days or weeks.  The animals aren’t able to communicate or have any physical contact with each other either. This is particularly hard for calves, who are as social as puppies.  In Europe, calves are kept separate from each other for their first eight weeks, but they can’t be separated from other calves after that. In the United States, calves can be kept in isolation for up to six months.  Artificial insemination is also a common practice for ensuring that the cows keep producing milk. Cows are artificially inseminated more often than other animals and there’s a big market for bull semen, as a single bull can father thousands of calves. That dramatically decreases the species’ genetic diversity – a further danger for future generations. In recent years, a new movement of small farms that want to care for their animals properly has emerged. Such farmers are against the horrible conditions animals are subjected to in factory farms. Animals on these new farms are allowed to live the way they want. Roger Harley’s farm in Canada, for example, seems like heaven on earth compared to a factory farm. He’s an organic pasture farmer and his animals have enough space to roam for acres.  Harley’s animals are much happier and healthier because of this. They can withstand disease and cold much better than animals kept in large factories. His farm also operates without artificial insemination, genetically enhanced breeding, force-feeding or cruelty. So why aren’t there more farms like this? Well, publicly fighting for animal welfare means that organic farms are constantly under threat from larger companies. In fact, Harley has been approached and asked to discontinue his efforts several times. He was even offered $250,000 per year just to keep quiet.  The goliaths of the agricultural industry are constantly waging a war against smaller pastoral farmers like Harley.  The process of giving out “organic” farm licenses is also completely dysfunctional. “Organic” licenses are so vague that they’re often little more than a sham. Wealthy farmers hire lawyers to find out the minimum they have to do in order to be certified as organic. Inspectors that give out certifications are also often employed by the farms themselves, since the state delegates that responsibility to private organizations rather than a government agency. You’ve probably heard of avian flu or swine flu, which are both side effects of meat production.  The terrible conditions the animals are kept in are breeding grounds for disease. Animals are caged, mistreated, genetically modified and constantly under stress – a paradise for viruses! The diseases that circulate in factory farms have also grown resistant to antibiotics because of the unnecessary medical treatment doled out to animals. The genetically modified animals are essentially a laboratory for viruses to develop themselves, and the viruses sometimes become deadly enough to kill millions of animals – and potentially humans too.  Animals on factory farms are also more susceptible to disease because of their unnatural genetic make up.  This is why biosecurity is a top priority on factory farms. When someone enters a plant, they have to go through some kind of procedure to get rid of the germs they may be carrying. In some Western farms, that could just mean taking a shower, but in Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia or Singapore, the process can be much more complex.  In some places, farmworkers have to be quarantined and monitored for a month before they’re allowed to enter the farm. They’re essentially caged in the same way as the animals! There’s a good reason for this high level of concern: there have been several epidemics in the past. Just a few years ago there was an outbreak of H1N1, or swine flu, which killed humans and animals alike.  There have also been several outbreaks in chicken, pig and cow farms that have resulted in millions of animal deaths. In Indonesia, people even burned sick chickens alive to prevent their diseases from spreading. Meat was a rare commodity a hundred years ago, but today most Americans eat it on a daily basis. This has profound implications for our future.  Meat consumption is increasing in many parts of the world. The wealthier people get, the more meat they eat. In Singapore, for example, the average meat consumption is 160 pounds per person per year – and it’s still on the rise.  In China, the average person eats about 115 pounds of meat per year. Actually, Chinese meat consumption is over half the total meat consumption of all developed countries! In the United States, the average person eats about 175 pounds of meat per year, though the American population is only a quarter of the Chinese population. This rise in meat consumption is causing a number of problems. The mass production of meat is very bad for the environment: greenhouse gases produced on factory farms are one of the biggest causes of global warming.  Caged animals also produce poisonous manure, which many farms carelessly dump into rivers or oceans. In fact, a single factory farm can create as much harmful waste as an entire city.  Humans who eat meat every day also face more personal consequences, especially because high meat consumption is one of the causes of obesity. Several countries in the world currently face problems with obesity. In the United States, one-third of adults are obese; in Malaysia, one-seventh.  We could reduce this by living healthier lifestyles and shifting to more plant-based diets, but unfortunately, the opposite is happening. We’ve seen several examples of bad farms, but what’s the answer to all this? What style of farming should we switch to? There is a way to make use of farm animals without causing them any suffering. The author found one viable answer when she visited The Lemon Dairy and Egg farm in Belize. The Lemon and Dairy Egg farm is a small, family-run establishment that allows cows and chickens to pasture freely alongside each other. The farmers love and respect their animals: they name them, build relationships with them and care for every aspect of their lives. They truly respect their animals and don’t have any motivation to mistreat them.  The farm is small, but it could easily expand. It’s still possible to manage thousands of chickens without keeping them in tiny cages and torturing them.  There should also be more women involved in farming and the agricultural industry in general. That might sound discriminatory or sexist, but it’s been proven that women tend to be more sensitive and compassionate than men. They also consume more organic products and eat less meat.  In the agriculture business, a bit of compassion for animals would go a long way, and improve things for humans and the environment too. Unfortunately, most factory farmworkers are men.  Cal-Maine, the largest egg producer in the United States, for example, only has one woman on its 20-member leadership team. Despite the lack of female representation in the agricultural business, most food is actually purchased by women. If women are the ones purchasing most of the industry’s goods, shouldn’t they have more influence in the way their food is produced? We need to change a number of things about the food industry to ensure a healthier and more sustainable tomorrow.  First, we need a serious shift in our behavior as consumers. These days, most people base their purchasing decisions entirely on price. They don’t think too much about the lives of the animals that end up in their shopping carts.  That means a lot of people inadvertently support the factory-farm business, often without knowing how destructive it is. Consumers need to educate themselves and be more mindful about the origin of the products they buy. You can also cut down your meat consumption. Try having meatless Mondays, where you abstain from meat on the first day of the week. Replace meat with healthy vegetables whenever you can.  We also need a return to smaller-scale pastoral farming. It might seem like pastoral farms are too small to feed the world, but there was a time when humans only used pastoral farming! Our modern technology and knowledge can be used to expand pastoral farming rather than factory farming.  An increase in pastoral farming would ensure that farm animals live happier and healthier lives. It would also be better for the environment and prevent the spread of disease.  Agricultural laws and regulations need to be stricter too. There are currently big loopholes in laws that allow factory-farm workers to get away with multiple atrocities. We shouldn’t torture animals just to save a few cents.  Food labels also need to be regulated more tightly so that they’re more meaningful. Vague terms like “free-range” are doing us little good.  All in all, we have a lot of work to do if we want to make the world a better place for ourselves and our animals, but we have no other choice if we want a better future. The key message in this book: Modern factory farming is unsustainable and harmful to livestock, human consumers and Earth itself. We need to drastically reform our agricultural industry by returning to smaller pastoral farms. By doing so we would improve our physical health, reduce the risk of infectious diseases, provide better lives for the animals we depend on and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.  Actionable advice: Find out how your food was produced.  The first step is checking food labels more closely. Learn more about the specifics of “organic” labels in your country. If the label doesn’t provide any information, reconsider. Think about what kind of company your money is supporting.

It’s probably been a while. India charged into the twenty-first century as one of the emerging BRIC economies (together with Brazil, Russia and China), but, today, the Indian economy is stagnant. How did this happen? Well, that is exactly what these blinks explore. Where did India go wrong? How can the country regain the vibrant, dynamic and promising economy it once had? Is there even a way to restart the economy of India? In these blinks, you'll find out why 60 percent of an Indian truck driver’s day is wasted; what changes need to be made to Indian agriculture; and how the Record of Lime Washing and Painting effects India's economy. You might think the stories about Indian traffic jams that run over a mile long are just exaggerated rumors. When you step out of the Delhi airport and see it for yourself, however, you’ll feel differently. These terrible traffic jams exist in spite of the newly built Rao Tula Ram Road flyover, a single lane bridge intended to absorb some of the traffic on the main road in Delhi. But it’s simply not big enough to accommodate the city’s traffic load. And the crazy thing is that, even before it was built, city planners knew it wouldn’t be big enough! So why did they go forward with the construction? Well, in Indian culture, anything more complex or bigger than the bare minimum is considered a waste of money and resources. Indians are accustomed to living with shortages and delays, and people generally look down on anything they feel is excessive or superfluous. This viewpoint is largely rooted in the socialist mindset promoted by Gandhi, who always rode in third-class train carriages. But it’s had serious repercussions for the country. India’s insufficient infrastructure, for instance, makes it difficult for manufacturers to send out customer orders on time. Indian trucks only spend about 40 percent of their time on the road actually driving; the other 60 percent is spent waiting in the long queues for the various tax checkpoints. Time is money, and this waste of time costs a lot for manufacturers. In fact, the cheapest way to send something from Bangalore, India, to Hyderabad, India, is to first send it to Europe, and, from there, back to Hyderabad! The traffic jams don’t just create stress and waste time for people going to work – they hurt the country’s economy, too. People in wealthier countries often assume that inefficient economies just need a larger labor force, but in India, where there’s an infinite number of potential workers, the unemployment rate is on the rise. Why is this? One reason stems from problems with farms in the countryside. Farms are shrinking in size and their production output is relatively low, so farm wages are low. It’s just not an industry people want to get into anymore. The total farmland available in India today is only half of what it was in 1970. 80 percent of Indian farms are smaller than two hectares and most are only about the size of half a football field! About half the employed people in India are still employed by farms, but, in 2011, farm production accounted for less than 15 percent of India’s GDP. Overall, farms don’t produce much, so farmers working on them don’t earn much. When people in farming villages want to get out, they often look for jobs in factories – but those are also difficult to come by. Most Indian companies deliberately maintain their size and avoid any expansion or growth.  Why? First off, employees in India are protected by certain rules and regulations; employers, on the other hand, are not. What would you do if you found one of your employees sleeping on the job? You’d fire them, right? Well, in India, it’s very difficult to fire anyone, so employers can’t replace unproductive employees with better ones.  Secondly, Indian companies with more than 99 employees get targeted by crooked government inspectors who demand bribes if they find any violations. Do you know the story of Joseph in the Old Testament? He interpreted the Pharaoh’s dream about seven fat cows that were almost starving, explaining that it meant there would be seven years of plenty, followed by seven years of famine. The story of India isn’t all that different. In the late-1980s, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi thought India’s golden days would never end. India was doing well, but Rajiv Gandhi started overspending, thinking the country’s economy would only continue to grow and prosper. During his time in office, he increased military spending alone by 50 percent. Unfortunately, the country couldn’t produce enough to keep up with all the new costs. From 1985 to 1989, the external debt nearly tripled, growing from 258 billion rupees to 700 billion rupees. By 1991, India faced a loan crisis and almost had to default on its payments. Seeking to save the country’s dignity, the government implemented a reform process that endangered the people’s dignity even more.  Dignity and national honor are very important to Indians, which made the debt crisis even worse. So Dr. Singh, India’s Finance Minister at the time, suggested devaluing the rupee in order to rebuild India’s dollar reserves. This was supposed to increase local production by making it too expensive to buy from foreign markets. Instead, the reforms caused a number of problems, such as a sharp decline in manufacturing. When the rupee’s value decreased, many manufacturers could no longer afford the raw materials that had previously been imported. At the same time, cheap foreign goods were already ubiquitous in India, and local manufacturers couldn’t compete. Imagine you’re suffering from an illness. One approach is to treat the symptoms: you can take pills for the headaches or the nausea – whatever the symptoms may be. But, of course, curing the illness itself is more effective than fighting the symptoms. Unfortunately, this isn’t how India tackled its economic crisis. Instead of addressed the root of the crisis, the Indian government implemented a number of reforms that were only half measures. When they devalued the currency, for instance, it didn’t speed up domestic production as they had hoped. However, if they had devalued it even more, it would have enabled manufacturers to competitively export, rather than stunting the industry. Manufacturers were caught in the middle when the currency was devalued. They couldn’t export because their prices weren’t low enough to compete in foreign markets and they couldn’t sell locally because they couldn’t compete with foreign imports. The government also removed restrictions on the movement of goods across international boundaries, which allowed foreign companies to exploit India even more. Because of the traffic jams and poor infrastructure, it became cheaper to transport things out of the country and then back in, as mentioned earlier. The few industries that didn’t require expensive reform were doing fine after the crisis, however. Amid the chaos of the reforms, finance, telecommunication and information technology were the only industries that were able to grow. Why? Well, the IT industry didn’t need land to produce their goods, and so was unhindered by the laws and regulations that stifled manufacturing. This new industry was able to grow while traditional industries floundered.  India’s lack of infrastructure was a serious problem, but the government, mired in debt, couldn’t afford to remedy the issue. So, in search of assistance, they turned to the private sector.  Private companies were asked to make infrastructural improvements – fixing roads, for instance – in exchange for money. The private sector would provide the capital and some expertise; the public sector would green-light and oversee projects. The system worked well in the early 2000s, under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but, eventually, it slowed down. Why? Well, the private sector, fearing economic loss, stopped investing in national projects. In 2005, investment in national projects accounted for between ten and 14 percent of the country’s GDP; by 2013, that figure had dropped to one percent. This happened because companies in the private sector didn’t want all their money to get stuck in projects that usually took too long to complete, and sometimes didn’t get completed at all. Many projects were held back by rules and regulations, so companies turned away from them, thinking they might not be profitable. And remember, companies don’t want to grow – because larger companies attract government inspectors who look for any violations of the labyrinthine regulations, and demand bribes if they find one. These regulations are extensive and sometimes bizarre. Rule 15, for example, requires companies to keep a record of lime washing and painting, which must be kept free of white spots. Rule 11 requires employers to register attendance cards for all their employees, but Rule 130 requires them to maintain a “muster roll” of their employees, even though it contains all the same information as the attendance cards. So employers have to fill out two different forms under two different regulations, even though the information provided is exactly the same. Private companies also saw the opportunity to exploit government resources. They’d raise their demands after starting the project and threaten to leave if those demands weren’t met. Even though it worked for a while, this system was doomed from the beginning. What happens when you have the same company overseeing the construction operations of a new building and also doing the construction itself? In India, it’s led to companies taking some shortcuts that save them money. That’s why infrastructure projects should always be split between two companies: one that runs the operations and another that does the actual building. When two companies are in charge of a construction project, they keep each other in check.  There are three possible ways the current construction problem could be solved: First, one infrastructure company could be in charge of operations and another could be in charge of construction. The construction company would be under the supervision of the other, an arrangement that would cut down on delays and safety hazards. Second, the government could hire and train regulators and inspectors to monitor the project as it goes along. Third, the government could do the project alone, but it’d still need some kind of internal monitoring and inspection system. It would be best if Indian citizens could pay for construction projects through the government, but leave the actual construction to the private sector.  As discussed, the government turned to the private sector when it needed help funding national projects. But the private sector got greedy, seeking higher returns on their investments, which made the situation even worse. There’s a different way to tackle this problem, however. Ordinary citizens, as well as finance from China, Japan or the West, could cover 35 percent of the cost, leaving the rest to the private sector instead of expecting it to provide everything. What else does the government have to consider when they work with the private sector? First, they need to recognize that allowing private companies to control natural resources – such as coal and land – poses a threat to the Indian people. It’s dangerous when private companies control important resources, because such companies are only interested in their own gain. The government learned this lesson when two large power plant companies, Tata and Adani, both close to the city of Mundra, in the western state of Gujarat, won bids to supply electricity to India's western states. Tata and Adani were supposed to sell electricity at prices lower than their competitors’, but, today, electricity costs more than ever. Why? Well, once Tata and Adani won the bid, they both increased their prices and started demanding that people in the western states pay even more.  The Supreme Court wanted to force Tata and Adani to abide by their contracts, but the companies instead shut down part of their plants, causing blackouts in the north and west of the country. An open market would be the best way to prevent problems like this and keep the private sector honest. It’s not good when the private sector gets things from the public for free. Private companies should buy from the free market rather than participating in auctions, which are often rigged. An open market would also hold private companies more accountable for their actions. When companies pay the appropriate prices for resources, they’re more careful not to damage the environment, because that would result in more costs down the road. The prices of natural resources also need to reflect both the cost of extraction and any environmental costs. It’s extremely detrimental, for example, to extract coal from forests, and the company who purchases the coal should pay for all damages. Indian farms produce more rice and wheat than the country needs, and yet most farms insist on growing only these two crops. Why? The current system and the government’s intervention keep the farm industry stuck in place. India doesn’t need greater overall food production, but it does need farms to be more productive. Hunger isn’t a serious problem for the country anymore. In fact, there aren’t enough granaries to store all the grain that’s produced. The government needs to stop and think. Instead of producing more rice and wheat, the farms need to become more efficient and start producing other crops. The current farming problems largely stem from the fact that the government doesn’t want to give out money; it does want people to eat, however, so it gives farmers cheap resources instead. That allows them to sell their products at low prices to the poor, which, if you think about it, is just a roundabout way of giving out money. But these freebies make farmers less efficient. To be truly productive, farms need greater autonomy and proper infrastructure. They also need adequate protection from monsoons, which cause major problems with irrigation and harm vegetable farms. Farmlands need more canals, wells, tanks and small, localized dams.  Farms also need more assistance so they can produce a wider variety of crops. Right now, they produce wheat and rice because that’s what the government buys from them. Few grow vegetables because they’re difficult to transport to the city. They usually rot on the way. Farms could grow more if they had refrigerated trucks, cold storage facilities and the country had better roads. Clearly, reforming the farm industry won’t happen in one day, but it’s not impossible, either. The key message in this book: Though India was prosperous in the 1980s, overspending and a series of counterproductive reforms set the country back. Today, the Indian economy is held back by restrictive overregulation and a lack of sufficient infrastructure, as well as cultural values that slow progress. The country can move forward, however, if infrastructure improves, the farm industry is reformed and the government develops the right relationship with the private sector. Got feedback?

Now imagine a second cube next to it, with sides measuring 20 cm, or twice that of the first cube. What’s the volume of the second cube? Easy, it’s twice that of the first cube, right? Wrong. It’s actually eight times greater! As you’ll see in these blinks, when it comes to size and scaling, our intuition often leads us astray. Luckily, we can make up for this by studying what are known as scaling laws, the laws that govern relationships between various phenomena as they scale. Let’s have a closer look at these laws and see what they can tell us about the world. In these blinks, you’ll find out why Godzilla can’t exist; why steamships were considered unprofitable in the early 1800s; and what scaling laws can tell us about our future on Earth. Earth is home to over 8 million different species, from microscopic bacteria to enormous blue whales, as well as an incredible diversity of social life, cultures, cities and traditions. It can be quite overwhelming to think about. But the truth is that there are some surprising systematic patterns behind the complexity of biological and socioeconomic life. For instance, if you plot a graph of the metabolic rate of animals – that is, the amount of energy they spend per unit of time – against the body mass of those animals, you’ll see a perfectly straight line. That’s right; the metabolic rate of any animal from a mouse to an elephant is perfectly fixed relative to its body mass. Not only that, but if in the same equation you substitute the metabolic rate for the total number of heartbeats in an animal’s life, you’ll get another straight line! There is, however, one trick at play. To get this result, the scales need to be logarithmic, meaning the units on each axis need to increase by factors of ten, so from one to ten to 100, and so on. Take an example from the world of economics: if you plot out the number of patents registered in a city against that city’s population, you’ll find that the number of patents will increase 15 percent faster than the population, also producing a straight line. Are these incredible correlations mere coincidences? Hardly. What you’re actually observing are called scaling relationships. The examples above are just a peek into the ways organisms and cities scale with size, and understanding this phenomenon can illuminate much about the world. For instance, new drugs are often tested on mice to model the way they’ll impact the human body. However, mice are of course much smaller than people – so how can scientists draw conclusions about humans from tests on rodents? Well, scaling can explain the answer. In the following blinks, you’ll learn about other incredible ways scaling can explain organisms, cities and even companies. Crowds go wild for mega monsters in movies like Godzilla. But could such beasts actually exist in real life? Most people would tell you such an idea is pure science fiction and, in the seventeenth century, the Italian physicist and mathematician Galileo Galelei already knew they were right. After all, scaling laws rarely work in a linear fashion. Just consider one square foot. If you scale up the length of each side to three feet, the enclosed area will become nine square feet. In other words, the sides will increase by three times, but the area will increase by nine. In a similar way, a three-foot cube has a volume of 27 cubic feet, which means that if the sides of a cube are increased from one foot to three feet, they would increase by three times while the volume would increase 27 times! In other words, area and volume do not scale linearly with length, but with the square and cube of the lengths. But what does this have to do with Godzilla? Well, Godzilla is around 60 times bigger than a human. His volume and therefore mass would be 60³, or 216,000 times, the average weight of a human. However, the length and strength of his bones would only increase by the factor 60², or 3,600 times. As a result, he would be 60 times heavier than his bones are strong, and his bones would break in an instant. So, nonlinearity can explain why Godzilla isn’t real, but it also has important, practical implications. For example, at the outset of the 1800s, trans-Atlantic steamships generally weren’t considered economically viable because of the tremendous amount of space needed to house fuel. That is, until the English engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel showed that, unlike the volume of cargo a ship can carry, which scales by the cube of its dimensions, the drag forces acting upon a ship only rise proportionally to the size of the vessel’s hull, which scales by the square of the ship’s dimensions. To put it simply, this means that the bigger the ship is, the less fuel it needs to carry each ton of cargo. By now, we know how the relationship between the metabolic rate and body mass of nearly all animals abides by a simple scaling law. However, we can be even more precise. We can also say that an increase of body mass by the factor 10⁴, or by four orders of magnitude, will result in an increase of the metabolic rate by a factor of 10³, or three orders of magnitude. What we haven’t yet explained is how such relationships can be virtually identical for all life forms. The author has a theory about this. He believes that a network-based theory can explain the origins of biological scaling laws. Here’s what that means: All biological systems function by way of networks, which transport energy, matter or information. Common examples are the circulatory, respiratory and neural systems. Such networks share three generic properties, which might even explain the hidden regularities of biological diversity. First, networks are space filling, which means that the tentacles of the network need to reach every piece of the system they serve. Second, terminal units are invariant, which means that the endpoints, or nodes of delivery, such as the capillaries of the circulatory system, are about the same size and have similar characteristics, regardless of the size of the organism. For instance, the capillaries in a blue whale are actually about the same size as those in a human. To understand why, just think about your house and the Empire State Building. If the electrical outlets in this skyscraper were scaled up relative to its height, they would be 50 times larger than those in your home. And third, over the course of the long process that is evolution, the performance of biological networks becomes optimized. For example, because of the various design constraints it faces, the human heart has evolved to expend the least energy possible when pumping blood through the circulatory system. By taking these three general systemic properties and translating them into mathematical language, the author found neat explanations for the surprising regularities that can be perceived in the world. If you look closely at the mathematical details behind scaling laws, there’s yet another surprise to be discovered: in most cases, biological scaling factors involve the numbers ¼ or ¾. For instance, the number of leaves taken as a function of a plant’s mass increases by a factor of 2 to the power of ¾. So, what explains the mysterious prevalence of the number four? The answer is buried deep in the properties of biological networks. These systems resemble fractals, which means that their geometry demonstrates a high degree of self-similarity. In other words, if you zoom in at random on one point of the network, the local picture will look like the zoomed out image. Just think of a cauliflower; if you cut out a single floret, it would look like a miniature version of the whole thing. That being said, the more curled a shape is, the more it “extends” toward a higher dimension of space. This is the fourth dimension – and it’s actually not all that difficult to understand. Just consider a one-dimensional line on a two-dimensional piece of paper. The more curled the paper is, the more it fills the entire space of the page and the more two-dimensional it appears. In a similar way, biological networks are, as you already learned, space filling, which means that they appear to extend toward a dimension beyond their own. It’s this “fourth dimension” that explains the common role that the number four plays in scaling laws. This important number even accounts for why humans stop growing in adulthood. Imagine you doubled the size of an organism. In so doing, you would be doubling the number of cells it contains and the amount of energy necessary for their maintenance. However, scaling laws dictate that the metabolic rate of an organism only rises by the factor 2 to the power of ¾, which is less than 2. Because of this, the demand for energy increases faster than energy can be produced, halting the growth in its tracks. The biological world is full of such interesting instances of the laws of scaling, but the social and economic spheres also offer compelling examples. You’ll learn more about these concepts in the next blinks. Consider the cities of New York, Paris and São Paulo. They might not appear to have much in common; after all, they’re in disparate corners of the world and are homes to highly divergent cultures. Even so, there are a number of hidden similarities in these metropolises, and scaling relationships can make them plain to see. For instance, the number of gas stations in a city and the total length of pipes, roads or electrical wires all consistently follow a simple scaling law that depends on population. Here’s how it works: If you double the size of a city’s population, thus increasing it by 100 percent, the number of gas stations, as well as the length of pipes, roads and wires, will only increase by 85 percent. Then, there’s the 15-percent rule, which holds that the larger a city is, the higher the wages, per capita GDP, crime rates, cases of AIDS or flu infections, number of restaurants and patent applications. That all seems intuitive enough – but what’s shocking is that all these indices rise by a factor of 1.15. That means a city with 10,000 residents and 100 restaurants would have 1,150 restaurants if its population were to increase to 100,000. That being said, since affluence varies by nation, such scaling laws only apply to cities within the same country. However, the similarities between organisms and cities don’t end there. Just like with biological organisms, cities can be thought of as networked systems. After all, they metabolize energy and resources, produce waste as well as information, and grow, adapt and evolve. Even the three generic properties of biological networks find equivalent features in cities. For example, biological networks are space filling, as are urban transport networks like roads, pipes and electricity lines. If they weren’t, they would never serve all the residences in the city. Modern life has become so tied to the city that the author feels a new human era is upon us. In his opinion, it began with the Industrial Revolution of the late-eighteenth century and can be called the Urbanocene. So, what can scaling laws tell us about this new period in human history? Well, in biology, the pace of life slows down as size increases. For instance, an elephant metabolizes energy much more slowly than a mouse and also lives for a much longer time. In cities, however, life appears to accelerate with size. Just take walking speed, which often increases with city size. In fact, in a small town of a few thousand inhabitants, the average walking speed is just half that in a city of over a million people, where the average speed clocks in at around four miles per hour. But it’s not just the pace of life that scales with city size; social interaction and economic activity do too. For instance, the author analyzed cell phone data to find that both the time people spend on the phone and the number of calls they make increase at a regular rate relative to the size of the city they live in. Consider Lisbon, Portugal, a city of 560,000. There, people spend about twice as much time on the phone and call twice as many people as their counterparts in Lixa, a rural Portuguese town of 4,200. Or consider another example. While it goes without saying that the larger a city is, the more businesses it contains, the diversity of businesses – that is, the number of different types of establishments – increases only very slowly with size. As a result, doubling the population of a city will result in an increase in business diversity of just five percent, while the number of total businesses will double on average. You just learned how the number and diversity of businesses scales relative to city size. But what about the scaling that occurs within a business itself? How do sales, expenses and profits scale with size? Actually, there are surprisingly common scaling patterns for all of these metrics. For instance, net income, gross profit, total assets and sales all scale up with incredible regularity relative to company size as measured by the number of employees. That means, if you plotted a graph with these metrics on one axis and the number of employees on the other, you’d get a perfectly straight line. In other words, if a firm with 100 employees produces sales of $10 million, the same company would make $100 million worth of sales if it employed 1,000 people. The implication here is that, regardless of industry, location or age, there are clear patterns that depend solely on the size of a business. Age is actually an interesting factor here and has its own corresponding scaling laws. Just like living organisms, companies are born, grow and, in most cases, eventually die. Not only that, but also like organisms, companies grow quickly in their youth before settling into a steady, but slow, rate of growth. As a result, regardless of sector, location and size, a company’s survival can be calculated with incredible accuracy based solely on its age. For instance, just around half of all publicly traded business make it past the ten-year mark. The probability of a company existing longer than 100 years is just 45 in 1 million, and a microscopic minority of one in 1 billion companies make it to 200 years. To put this into context, this law means that the seemingly invincible firms of our time, like Google, Facebook and Apple, will all eventually meet their demise. You’ve learned a number of rules of scale and how they correspond to all manner of circumstances. But what do these laws mean for human life in general? Well, they can tell us a great deal about the human population. For instance, since the Industrial Revolution, the world’s population has been growing at an incredible rate. This boom has marked an unforeseen shift since, for 2 million years, the human population had been growing at a steady, albeit much slower, rate. Because of this growth, the human population first hit 1 billion around 1805. But the next billion came just 120 years later and the third a mere 35 years after that! As a result, the world population now stands at over 7 billion and, in 2017 alone, it grew by 80 million, the equivalent of adding an entire new Germany to the world. In short, we’re experiencing exponential growth. For every unit of time, the quantity measured will double. Put differently, if on the first day there was one human, on the second there will be two, on the third there will be four and so on. However, as we’ve already learned, there are natural barriers to the size and growth of any biological organism and scientists are in heated debate about whether this rapid population growth can be sustained. After all, the resources on our planet are limited and every new human needs to be fed, clothed and educated. The first person to identify this issue was Thomas Robert Malthus, whose 1798 book An Essay on the Principle of Population predicted that the food supply would grow more slowly than the population, eventually leading to the collapse of civilizations. From there, an organization called the Club of Rome published a highly disputed study in 1972. Called The Limits to Growth, it demonstrated the potentially catastrophic results of sustained population growth. While some of the predictions these researchers made have been proven incorrect, the fundamental issue remains; can human populations and economies continue to grow forever? You’ll find out in the next blink. So, the human population exploded with the Industrial Revolution and has been increasing exponentially ever since. People have been warning about the impacts this sustained growth will have and it’s becoming increasingly clear that such growth is straining the relationship between human society and nature. This begs the question: Can we sustain a global population of over 10 billion and continue increasing levels of consumption without destroying the biosphere? Well, given the finite nature of the earth’s resources, the short answer is definitely not. This is a serious issue since today, both the world’s population and its economies are growing at exponential rates. Traditional economic theories maintain that such an ever-expanding economic sphere is possible; however, exponential growth would also require ever-increasing supplies of both energy and natural resources, things that the earth simply cannot provide. As a result, such open-ended growth will have serious adverse impacts on the environment – but it’s also bound to fail. To counter this argument, critics of such a notion like to say that innovation will play a critical role in solving this conundrum. But, at this point, even innovation would be a long shot to save the world from a major population crash. After all, for innovation to keep up with the problems caused by growth, breakthrough discoveries would also need to occur at an exponential pace. To the credit of the people behind such innovation theories, this kind of exponential innovation has been the norm in recent history. Indeed, thousands of years elapsed between the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages, while less than 30 years transpired between the recent Computer Age and the Information and Digital Age that followed. But other problems loom. For instance, with the level of stress endemic to most modern lifestyles, it’s hard to imagine how an ever-increasing pace of life could be sustained without a resulting collective heart attack. The earth is in dire straits and serious action needs to be taken. What’s called for is a Manhattan-style project that brings the top thinkers together to address these urgent questions of sustainability. The key message in this book: The characteristics and dynamics of diverse biological organisms, cities and even companies are bound by surprisingly similar laws. These rules reveal astounding, and often hidden, regularities that describe the structure and systems of life, as well as its limits.  Got feedback?

How did you feel? Were these moments where you got your best work done, made your best purchasing decisions or did your best budgeting? Even though these stressful, pinched periods require us to be at our sharpest, the reality is that the perception of scarcity makes us even worse at dealing with these pressing problems. In fact, the coping mechanisms we draw upon during times of scarcity actually worsen our situation, further entrenching us in our predicament. Therefore, it’s vital to understand how and why we respond to scarcity in the way that we do, in order to develop proactive strategies to deal with it. After reading these blinks, you’ll discover why becoming distracted at your daughter’s softball game doesn’t make you a bad parent; why the wealthy are only sometimes interested in saving $50; and why firemen should wear seat belts. What do the tragedy of global poverty and the difficulties of sticking to yet another fad diet have in common? At first there doesn’t seem to be any link; in fact, they seem to be contradictory in every way. Yet upon closer inspection we discover that they are both consequences of the same malaise: scarcity. In fact, scarcity, defined as “having less than you feel you need,” is the link that connects many of the seemingly unrelated problems we face every day. This isn’t physical scarcity, as in the literal unavailability of objects, but rather the feeling of not having enough, whether it’s time, money, food or even something more abstract like education. Imagine a world-class chef who, having spent her entire life perfecting her craft, must create her best dish in less than two hours for a TV show, under intense time pressure. Here, time is scarce, and she doesn’t feel she has enough minutes for what she needs to do. The chef’s feeling of scarcity is essentially the same as that of the dieter who’s struggling to eat less than he’s accustomed to. To him, scarcity is the amount of calories he feels he’s missing from his meals. However, to a certain degree we can control our experience of scarcity by using something called a critical safety valve. For example, if you’ve overcommitted to work projects, your safety valve might mean missing a few deadlines. Or if you’re on a diet, you can take a break and have a slice of pizza. In this way, you are choosing how much scarcity you have to face. But not everything has a critical safety valve. If you’re poor, you can’t just decide to be rich for a day to alleviate the pressure. This lack of freedom to manipulate your situation means that poverty represents a particularly extreme form of scarcity. Regardless, the actual experience of scarcity is the same. When you’re hungry, food is all you can think about. This is because food – at that moment, even only for a few minutes – is scarce and the need to satiate your appetite is almost overwhelming. Even if we aren’t aware of it, when we experience scarcity of any kind, not just the kind regarding our biological needs, we become absorbed by it, obsessing over what we feel we lack. Toward the end of World War II, as the Allies advanced further into German-occupied territories, they faced the problem of bringing back concentration camp inmates from the edge of starvation. To solve this problem, the University of Minnesota conducted an experiment with 36 male subjects in which the subjects were first starved and then underwent various feeding regimens. The findings helped the camp survivors, and also revealed some fundamental insights. Not only did the subjects’ bodies physically weaken and their appetites sharpen, but their minds changed as well – they became obsessed with food. They compared food prices, obsessed over cookbooks, fantasized about switching careers and starting restaurants and were unable to follow film narratives, focusing instead only on the scenes with food in them. But scarcity does more than change the focus of our attention; it also changes how we interpret information. Consider, for instance, that when people undergo traumatic yet lightning-fast events, like robberies or car accidents, they often feel that the events lasted longer than they actually did, due to the huge amount of information that the brain had to process. Researchers call this phenomenon the subjective expansion of time. Scarcity is similar in that it can alter how we experience the world. Lonely people, for instance, are much better at judging others’ moods and emotions. This is because their lives center around observing others, trying to see in them what they themselves miss. Now that you know how scarcity works, the following blinks will examine how its effects play out in your daily life. As you look through your wallet, you stumble across a coupon with no expiration date for a free meal at a restaurant. This time, like every other time you see your coupon, you think: “Eh, I can use this any time. Not today, but maybe next week.” Consequently, it never gets used. This is actually quite common: coupons with no expiration date are less likely to be used than those that have one. But why? Essentially, we become more attentive and efficient at managing pressing needs, a process known as tunneling. When time is limited, you tend to get the most out of it, be it work or pleasure. This is what the authors call the focus dividend – the positive outcomes produced when scarcity captures the mind. Deadlines, for instance, aren’t just good for planning purposes, but also because they create scarcity (of time) and focus the mind. Take a study in which students were given essays to proofread with differing deadlines. Those who were assigned one essay per week over three weeks were more productive (in terms of meeting deadlines and finding typos) than those who were given three weeks to proofread the same three essays. Yet this intense focus on one thing comes at the expense of others, a phenomenon described by the authors as the tunnelling tax. You’ve surely experienced this, for example, when you’re so engrossed in a TV program that you can no longer hear your friend talking to you. But the consequences of the tunnelling tax aren’t always as trivial as hurting your friends’ feelings. In fact, they can be deadly. Take firefighters, who are so focused on reaching a fire – due to scarcity of time – that they neglect other considerations, like wearing seat belts. This is exactly what happened in the case of Brian Hunton, who died after he was flung out of the door of a fire engine racing to a fire. The deadline for your presentation is tomorrow. But your daughter has her city championship softball match tonight. Like a good parent, you go to her match, but you just can’t focus on the game, can’t enjoy yourself – your mind keeps wandering back to that presentation. Why can’t you just enjoy the moment? This is because scarcity taxes our bandwidth and, as a result, inhibits our most fundamental capacities, such as concentrating on that softball game. Bandwidth measures our computational capacity – namely, our ability to pay attention, make good decisions, stick to our plans, resist temptation, and so on. Scarcity uses up our bandwidth, which has a negative impact on many aspects of our behavior, such as our patience, tolerance, attention and dedication. A father who is preoccupied during his daughter’s softball match may seem a bad parent, and a student who can’t concentrate on his exam due to the stress of paying his tuition might seem incompetent or lazy, but these kinds of judgements are too shallow. Their lack of concentration isn’t a personal flaw, but merely a sign that their bandwidths are taxed by scarcity (of time or money in these cases). But why does scarcity tax our bandwidth in the first place? Basically, top-down attention, where the mind is directed by conscious effort to focus our attention, cannot prevent bottom-up intrusions, where our attention becomes captured by external stimuli. Scarcity is a bottom-up intrusion, and is therefore involuntary and powerful. For example, in a study of attention, dieters were asked to push a button when they saw a red dot appear on a screen. Interestingly, they were less likely to see the red dot if they had just seen a picture of food. Psychologists call this attentional blinking, because the picture of food (which created the feeling of scarcity) made them mentally “blink” as the dot appeared. How many times have you felt like you’re playing catch-up with your debts, only to find yourself in exactly the same hole as you were before? Scarcity is partly the result of an aspect of human behavior known as the scarcity trap. When we fall into the scarcity trap, two things happen: we constantly juggle, moving from one pressing task to the next, and yet are continually one step behind. Surely you’ve experienced this at school or work, when you have many things to do, pressing deadlines and the feeling that there’s too little time to get it all done. Instead of finishing your projects one at a time, you instead frantically jump from one to the other. As your deadline approaches, time becomes scarce for all the projects, causing you to juggle more and more. Being one step behind can also increase scarcity, as missed deadlines or delayed projects cause your new work to get a late start, and this can quickly spiral out of control. Although the scarcity trap is easy to succumb to, there is one way out: giving ourselves slack. Think of slack as the space in your vacation suitcase. If you pack your suitcase to the brim, then there will be no space to cram in the phone charger you forgot to include. The only way to get it in is to leave something else behind. However, if you intentionally leave a little space in the suitcase, then you’ll have the resources to deal with the unexpected. Slack might be something like free space in your schedule – a 15 minute window between meetings – which can save you the hassle of scarcity of time if your meeting overruns. Of course, not all situations allow for the creation of slack. Low-income earners, for example, simply don’t have the resources available to save money and create financial slack. Have you ever poured from an unusually shaped bottle, only to find there was far more liquid inside than you thought was possible? This is because your perception was wrong – if you were to do it again, however, you’d probably measure it more accurately. Indeed, expertise – learning from our experiences – can alter our perception. For instance, if a layperson were to pour you a shot of whiskey from each of four differently shaped bottles, you’d likely end up with four different-sized shots. However, an experienced bartender is far less likely to be influenced by the bottles’ shapes, thus making all four whiskey shots uniform. Likewise, the more we experience scarcity, the more we understand the value of each inch of space in our suitcases and each dollar in our bank accounts. If you’re an experienced traveller, then you know to stuff your socks and phone charger inside your shoes, uncoil your belt and slide it along the inside edge of the case, leave your umbrella at home, make trade-offs and leave frivolous things behind when you’re packing for your next big trip. In the same way, the pressing needs of the poor help them recognize the value of each dollar. We can see this in a study at a New Jersey train station in a wealthy town, where researchers surveyed commuters about how far they would go to get a deal. 54 percent would recommend traveling 45 minutes to save $50 on a $100 purchase, but interestingly, only 17 percent would do so for $50 savings on a $1,000 purchase. This is because the savings in the first case were proportionally much larger, and therefore more appealing to them. Conversely, 87 percent of visitors at a soup kitchen in Trenton, New Jersey, would pursue the discount on a $1,000 purchase and 76 percent for a $100 purchase. For them, experience had made them value every dollar, so it didn’t matter how much they were saving as long as they were saving something. How many times have you considered taking out a loan when your cash has run out? While you’re certainly not the only one to toy with the idea, it’s actually the most short-sighted thing you can do. Unfortunately, scarcity causes us to make rash decisions with little regard for their long-term consequences. When we’re intensely focused on putting food on the table, for instance, we’re less effective at planning for the future. Of course, planning in general is difficult for many, but scarcity makes the problem worse. For instance, when we’re busy, we easily ignore the future health costs of eating takeout in favor of satiating our hunger and overcoming the scarcity of time. Similarly, we’re less interested in the difficulties caused by debt in the future when we are tight on cash now. This shortsightedness, which the authors call the myopia of the poor, leads to suboptimal decisions, such as borrowing. We borrow for two reasons: an intense focus on the problem at hand as well as the fact that we cannot experience the future, only the present. Consider the case of Sandra, a former student at the Head Start child development program for low-income families. When times were tough she would use one loan to pay off another, causing her to pay $495 to $600 per month in fees, and be stuck in a position of perpetual debt. Her checks bounced, her car was repossessed and she ended up owing thousand of dollars in back taxes. But borrowing isn’t just about money. For instance, you can borrow time by putting off one project to make room for another. But this often results in “fees.” Putting off work increases the time it takes to do it, makes it harder to juggle your projects and can even lead to missed deadlines. Unfortunately, we often try to manage scarcity in ways that only exacerbate our problems. As you’ve seen, scarcity can be a real nuisance and can lead to terrible decisions and awful consequences. In our final blink, you’ll learn some ways to combat scarcity. Whether it’s improving the lives of the poor, managing scarcity in organizations or dealing with scarcity in everyday life, the strategy is always the same: change the programs, add in slack and reduce bandwidth. Whatever the area, you can always improve your program in a way that mitigates the effects of scarcity on everyone. Take university students, for example, who often have to manage the scarcity of time. They often miss classes because of deadlines they have for projects for other classes, but this could be solved with a simple restructuring of the classes themselves. Rather than having just one class, the university could schedule multiple modules starting at different times but running parallel to each other. Then, if someone misses one class, they can easily catch up in another. The availability of slack is equally important. Take Saint John's Regional Health Center in Missouri, which used to struggle with meeting deadlines for planned operations and consultations. Unexpected medical emergencies would require all the available rooms at the hospital, meaning they would have to push back their planned procedures. When an advisor examined this problem, he suggested a novel solution: always keep one room free. At first, the doctors thought this was crazy: “We already don’t have enough space, and now you want us to have less?!” In the end, however, it created slack, thus providing space for the emergencies and unplanned events, meaning that planned surgeries could now go ahead without fear of disruption. Finally, manage your bandwidth instead of the things that cause scarcity (time, money, etc.). When the authors first started working on this very book, they blocked out a period every morning to write, so that nothing would get in their way. But their time ended up being unproductive. Before their writing period, the authors would do other things, like look through and answer their emails. This small act stole their available bandwidth, meaning that their work period suffered. Time management is useless unless you protect your bandwidth! The key message in this book: Scarcity causes us to behave in all sorts of strange and self-defeating ways. We become so focused on solving our immediate problems that we lose sight of the future, not out of some kind of personal failure, but because scarcity actually alters the way we perceive the world itself. Actionable advice: Develop a system that requires you to confirm decisions before you commit to them.  If you want to buy a car because, for whatever reasons, you no longer have one, then you’ll want some way to prevent yourself from making rash, short-sighted decisions that could have far-reaching consequences (in this case, for your wallet or mobility). This system could be something as simple as not making the decision to buy your car when you’re on the lot. Suggested further reading: Nudge by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R.

But what does capitalism actually entail? These blinks aim to provide an answer by exposing the workings of capital and its 17 inherent contradictions. They will take you on a journey through the economic engine of capitalism, revealing its vast implications for the global economy. You will learn how some of the contradictions of capital become apparent only in the face of a crisis, and how others emerge over time due to political and technological change. Finally, and most alarmingly, discover how some contradictions of capital are actually dangerous, and can even push societies and economies to the point of collapse. You will also learn how a contradiction of capital made 4 million people lose their homes; why theft and swindling lie at the heart of capitalism; and why 70 percent of full-time workers hate going to work. When you go to the supermarket, you exchange some of your money for some food. This is because food is useful to you in ways that money isn’t: you can’t eat money, but you can eat food. In fact, everything we buy, just like food, has both a use and an exchange value. Take housing, for example. Its use value is the shelter it provides; it’s a place where you can build a life, and it can also function as a symbol of status or architectural significance. But if you were to exchange your house for something else, how would you measure its worth? One way would be to calculate the cost of the raw materials, the workers’ wages and payments for any services required to build it. In other words, the cost would be fixed based on what was paid to produce the house. In much of the capitalist world, however, exchange value also depends on speculation. All sorts of things can influence a house’s value to a prospective buyer, like location, prestige, past owners and so on – each of these factors can affect its exchange value. Buyers and producers, both trying to profit in some way from any exchange, are mostly interested in exchange values, that is, the actual costs of producing something plus the profit that can be made from selling it.   The discrepancy between use value and exchange value can give rise to full-blown crises in the market. Take the US housing market crisis from 2007 to 2009. Before the crisis, housing speculation soared. More and more people hoped to profit from these rising exchange values, and thus borrowed more in order to buy into “safe” housing. Eventually, the pursuit of exchange value destroyed access to housing as a use value. All of the speculation drove property values higher than large segments of the society could afford to pay. This contradiction between properties’ use and exchange value caused about 4 million people lose their homes due to foreclosure, as decreasing access to housing caused exchange values to crash. In order to exchange commodities such as food and houses, we need a measure of their worth relative to one another. This measure is money – it represents what we value. But the gap between money and the value it represents constitutes a contradiction. Money is a means by which we can capture the immateriality of socially or personally valuable things, like labor. Gold, silver and paper money were originally used to give immaterial labor a physical value. For instance, five hours of roofing might have been worth five pieces of silver. Today, however, these representations of value aren’t even physical, they’re merely numbers in digitized bank accounts. We’re left with a weird situation, whereby our account balances are representations of representations of social labor: the balance represents the paper money, which represents the labor. Moreover, when money becomes a mere numerical abstraction, its potential quantity is limitless. Labor, in contrast, has limits: population, natural resources, production capability and so on. The true contradiction, however, is that money is itself a commodity. Money, which is a measure of social value, can also be bought and sold. The same can’t be said for other types of measurements, like kilos or inches. Money is a means through which we affirm our right to own a commodity. But sometimes there are other actors at play than just the market – sometimes you have to deal with the state. Thus, another contradiction lies between individual private property rights and state power. In capitalist societies, the state is supposed to protect people’s private property rights. However, in the name of public interest, the capitalist state can deploy its power to curb private property rights through regulations, taxation and sometimes even dispossession. Consider, for instance, a landowner being forced to sell her land so that a new road can be build for the public benefit. There are basically two ways of accumulating wealth: there’s the legal way of exchange within markets, or there’s the illegal way of robbery, theft, swindling extortion and graft. The latter doesn’t involve exchange, but rather dispossession, the nonconsensual seizure of a person’s property. Though we think of it as morally abhorrent, dispossession seems a foundational aspect of the creation of private capital. Consider, for example, the “enclosure movement” in Britain during the 18th century. During this period, common lands that belonged to local communities were transformed into private properties in order to enable private investments for “greater productivity.” This privatization of previously common lands was nothing less than the dispossession of the local population from their property. Or think of the present-day “land grabs” throughout Africa, Latin America and much of Asia, through which powerful political or economic agents, such as foreign governments and transnational corporations, illegally acquire huge swaths of land. This form of dispossession has been around for generations, and never really went away. Another type of dispossession can be found in the contradictory relationship between labor and capital. Capital, in terms of monetary profit, is created only when workers produce more in commodity values than they are paid in wages. In a very real sense, laborers are thus dispossessed from the real value of their labor. This contradiction becomes readily apparent when examining the continuous conflict between these two forces: Workers are constantly fighting for higher wages and better working conditions. The more they succeed, the higher their standard of living. Capitalists, in contrast, fight to cut wages while increasing productivity and the intensity of work. The more they succeed in the struggle against labor, the greater their profits. The capitalist starts each day with a certain amount of capital, which she uses to hire workers and purchase the means of production. The workers, in turn, collectively produce a new commodity that can be sold for a profit – capital thus returns to its monetary form at the end of the day. Yet, there is an inherent contradiction within this circulation of capital. To generate profits, capital needs to flow. However, the transition from money to commodities runs into potential barriers. Imagine you have money and you want to make steel. To start producing it, you’ll need all the ingredients necessary for its production. But the iron ore is buried deep in the ground, and it takes a long time to dig it out. In the meantime, no value is actually produced. Furthermore, the transition from commodity value into monetary value likewise has potential problems. For example, if you own a container port terminal, you can realize its monetary value by charging fees for its use. But if no container ships arrive, the terminal’s commodity value can’t be transformed into money. So the circulation of capital is contradictory, in that the creation of profits is hindered by natural barriers and delays. Assuming capitalists can overcome these barriers, their goods still have to be purchased on the market by real people. This leads to our next contradiction. In the production process, value is created through labor. But as with the flow of capital, the transformation of this value into money is complicated. The value of work remains latent until it is realized through a sale in the market, and laborers themselves play a key role as buyers in the market. Capitalists are thus perpetually caught in a conundrum: they can either minimize labor costs and thereby threaten workers’ buying power, or they can augment workers’ buying power at the cost of potential profits through efficient production. Up to this point, all the contradictions of capital we’ve examined have been foundational contradictions. They are inherent features of capital, unaltered by changes in politics or technology. We will now investigate the moving contradictions of capital, the ones that are unstable and change over time. The relationship between technological change and the future of work constitutes one such contradiction. We’ve seen that social labor is a source of value, which allows capital to generate profits. But today, labor is becoming increasingly displaced due to automation and robotization. Machines increase productivity and are able to create greater outputs, and thus faster profits, than humans could ever achieve. Thus, human labor becomes less necessary for production. The effects of this displacement matter. As larger and larger segments of the world’s population become “redundant” from the standpoint of capital, we will have a harder time thriving, both materially and psychologically. The increase in output due to machines and automation leads to a decrease in demand, as jobs, and thus incomes, disappear. And while automation makes human labor redundant, division of labor itself makes the worker feel redundant. The division of labor refers to the separation of complex productive activities into specific but simple tasks. The different stations on a factory floor or even the division of departments at your job are examples of the division of labor in action. Capital relies on both the division of labor and a motivated workforce to produce effectively. However, increasing complexity in the division of labor leaves little possibility for personal development on the part of the laborer. Any semblance of ownership a worker may have over their part in the production cycle evaporates, as does their motivation to work for capital. Herein lies the contradiction: while division of labor helps make the organization of production processes more efficient, it makes the workers themselves less motivated, and thus less efficient. Capitalism stresses the importance of competition, and committed capitalists claim that the monopoly power of companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon wouldn’t occur if a perfectly competitive market could be created. But while monopoly undermines competition, it is also at the heart of capitalism. Consider, for example, that higher transportation costs for non-local competitors have long served as a form of protection for local enterprises to maintain local monopolies. But with the advent of global, fast and cheap transportation, many local industries have lost their foothold in their respective local markets, as they have been forced into global competition. You’d think that capitalists would welcome such competition; yet, if given the choice, most capitalists would prefer to be monopolists, and thus find other ways to construct and preserve monopolies. For instance, they can aggregate capital into mega-corporations or set up strategic alliances within the industry to dominate the markets. Furthermore, to gain a competitive advantage, companies choose to disperse certain aspects of their business in a way that minimizes their costs of production. This, in turn, causes certain geographic regions to appreciate or depreciate accordingly. In order to position their operations most effectively, companies often cluster together regionally. For example, car parts and tire manufacturers will locate themselves close to car plants in order to minimize the cost of transportation. This clustering increases the region’s value, thus attracting even more capital and labor. At the same time, this appreciation leads to increases in local costs due to the region’s higher perceived value. Capitalists, always looking to save a buck, thus start looking for other, cheaper spaces to ply their trade. The ensuing relocations generate crises of devaluation, in which regions become caught in a downward spiral of depression and decay. Thus, the value that the influx of capital creates in a given region is effectively destroyed once the cheap production opportunities for capitalists disappear. During the Industrial Age, Karl Marx recognized that limits had to be placed upon the crushing length of the working day and enormous exploitation of the working class – not only to protect the lives of the laborers, but also to protect the reproduction of capital. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to say that, during the Industrial Age, capital didn’t care about the needs of workers. Capitalists provided workers with pitifully meager wages that were supposed to provide for them both materially and psychologically. But it became clear that if workers couldn’t cover their living expenses, were overworked to a premature death and, therefore, couldn’t reproduce, capital’s access to an efficient labor force would diminish. No workforce means no profits from labor, which means that capital can’t reproduce itself. Capital’s unwillingness to ensure the social reproduction of labor, while at the same time being dependent upon it, is once again contradictory. Today, laborers in many parts of the world are paid the wages needed to maintain a decent standard of living, meaning both they and their posterity can be exploited for their labor in order to generate profits for capitalists. Still, capital is seldom willing to bear the costs of social reproduction. In social democracies, capital has to contribute to at least some of the costs of social reproduction through, for example, pension plans, insurance and healthcare in the form of wage provisions or taxation that supports the state’s social welfare. Nevertheless, capital has always wanted to cut costs, either in the form of production efficiency or by shirking its responsibility to the general population. Yet, over time, capital has become more interested in an educated workforce, as profitability has depended on increasingly skilled labor. But the actual costs of acquiring skills, particularly through education, have been successfully passed on to households, kindergartens and public schools. Karl Marx said that the true realm of freedom begins when the necessity of work is left behind. In a capitalist society, this freedom is thought of as financial freedom, something only achieved by a small minority. In fact, capital itself creates the disparity between those who can achieve financial freedom and those who can’t. Let’s look at New York City for a moment, a city with an extremely high cost of living. There, the average income of the top one percent of earners in 2012 was $3.47 million. Half of the population, in contrast, are scraping by on $30,000 per year or less. Income disparities are nowhere as dramatic on the national scale, but they have been increasing markedly since the 1970s. In fact, by 2005, 84 percent of wealth in the United States was held by the top 20 percent. Such disparities constitute a contradiction of capital, as historical evidence suggests that gross inequalities might be a harbinger of a looming economic crisis. This is because the contradiction between production and realization –  that is, that low wages undermine workers’ buying power – becomes much harder to keep in balance. The last time the United States experienced these levels of inequality was in the 1920s, triggering the Great Depression of the 1930s. What’s more, the resulting disparity of wealth leads to friction between freedom of capital and freedom of others. In the face of great financial disparity, true freedom becomes available only for those with substantial incomes. The poor, lacking an income that frees them from want, are locked out of the realm of true freedom, and will be ruled by capital as long as they are struggling to earn a living. The freedom of capital thus rests on the lack of freedom of others. We’ve seen the foundational contradictions along with the moving contradictions of capital, but there are worse contradictions still. These are the dangerous contradictions of capital, the ones that threaten economic, environmental and social equilibrium. We’ll start with the concept of compound growth, which is when money grows faster with each passing year. Compounding is simple. Imagine that you’ve used $100 to open a savings account that pays five percent annual interest. At the end of the year, you have $105. After two years you have $110.25. The difference in growth between the first and second years isn’t that great. In fact, the difference is only 0.25 percent, five percent of five percent of 100, or 25 cents. But after a hundred years your $100 will have increased to $13,150! In total, your savings account will have grown by a whopping 12,550 percent! This is what is meant by compound growth, and this is what capitalists, through their investments of capital, are trying to achieve. But is perpetual compounding growth really possible? In short, no. In fact, it represents a dangerous contradiction. You learned earlier that money represents social value. Increasing quantities of money must therefore represent increasing social value, such as in the form of new roads or bridges. Capital also tries to find new values and markets by coming up with “human capital,” such as human talent, skills and experience, or “nature capital” such as rivers or forests.   However, as money accumulates faster with every passing year, finding corresponding social value will eventually become impossible. If no corresponding value can be found, monetary value becomes illusory, which can lead to economic disaster. In this way, capital’s desire for compounding growth, in combination with the actual social value that money represents, makes for a dangerous contradiction. We’ve seen many contradictions of capital up to this point, all varying in their severity. The final two pose a threat to our very existence. First, capital has a damaging impact on the environment. Goods require resources for production, such as oil or wood, which capital regards as nothing more than a vast store of potential use values that can be monetized and exchanged as commodities. But capital’s hunger for profits undermines nature’s ability to regenerate the resources used for production. Under the pressure of continued compound growth, the dangerous degradation of ecosystems will accelerate, likely resulting in environmental disaster. At the same time, capital destroys the basis for creating profits from natural resources by destroying those very resources. In its pursuit of profit, capital threatens the lifeblood of the natural world. Second, capital evokes the revolt of human nature. We’ve already seen how capital can alienate the worker from the social meaning of their work. Indeed, many people are not happy with what they do for a living. In fact, a recent Gallup survey in the United States showed that about 70 percent of full-time workers either hated going to work or had mentally checked out and become, in effect, saboteurs – spreading discontent and thereby costing their employer dearly in the form of lost efficiency. This alienation from work will eventually evoke a revolt of human nature against its domination by capital. Human beings simply can’t suffer through a world devoid of meaning. Consider as a recent example the Occupy movement in the United States, which protested against social and economic inequality. Add to that the countless anticapitalist uprisings that occurred throughout the 20th century. This revolt of human nature contradicts capital’s demand for a loyal and thus efficient workforce – a dangerous contradiction that threatens our social cohesion. We’re left wondering: can capital survive these contradictions? In any case, it’s clear that something needs to be done to change the way we live and produce. The key message in this book: The workings of capital are inherently contradictory. Some of these contradictions are latent, and become apparent only in the face of a crisis, while others change with the times. The most serious contradictions are outright dangerous and threaten the foundations of society and economy, as well as the natural world.

F. Schumacher","summary":"In economic terms, is bigger really always better? Not according to the world-renowned economic thinker, E.F. Schumacher. On the contrary, he posited that “small is beautiful” and that economists should value life on earth over income and profit. In these blinks, you’ll be presented with his critique of our modern Western economic system, which, according to him, depletes our resources and sucks the meaning out of our lives. Arguing that our economic system legitimizes greed and values money above all else, Schumacher’s essays are as relevant today as they ever were. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why universal prosperity wouldn’t lead to peace; how growth can be destructive; and that nuclear energy can spell ruination instead of salvation. Modern economic systems have brought great prosperity to the Western world; however, that prosperity came with a big price tag. Our lives are now so removed from nature that we constantly destroy it without compunction. For instance, thanks to the global industrial system, we squander a great deal of our precious natural resources – such as fossil fuels. The modern economy treats fossil fuels as income, a constant stream of goods, rather than capital, a finite supply of goods. To thus regard them is a way of justifying waste. If we viewed fossil fuels as capital rather than income we'd be much more concerned with their conservation. However, we use them as if they'll never run out – which, of course, they will. It's not possible for humans to manufacture or recycle fossil fuels, so once they're gone, they're gone. And running out of them too quickly would threaten the very foundation of our modern economy, which requires a steady energy supply. The modern economic system itself also threatens two types of natural capital: the tolerance margins of nature and the human substance. Since World War II, the world has seen a dramatic increase in industrial production, which threatens the tolerance margins of nature. Our actions are harming the environment at a rate much greater than its natural rate of regeneration. The economic system also devalues humans, who are reduced to little more than cogs in the economic machine. For instance, most people in the world don't find their work fulfilling and many spend their lives doing back-breaking labor. Such problems threaten the foundation of the modern economy, too, because they threaten society as a whole. The economic machine can't sustain itself if the people who run it can't live. An examination of the history of economics and political stability reveals an interesting pattern: the rich tend to be more peaceful than the poor. So it would follow that economic equality and prosperity could provide the foundations for a peaceful world, right? Let's consider this idea by examining three points: When we break down the idea of peace through universal prosperity into these three points, it becomes clear that the theory doesn't hold up. At the moment, we can only achieve universal prosperity (the first point) by consuming more fossil fuels, which would lead to greater environmental damage. We have to question the idea of unlimited economic growth for two reasons: fossil fuels are in short supply and the environment can only withstand so much damage. If we keep consuming at our current rates, we'll face even greater pollution problems. The second point is problematic when we consider that self-gain is driven primarily by greed and envy. If these human vices get built into our economic system, GDPs may rise for a time but people will feel burdened by increasingly acute feelings of frustration, alienation and insecurity. The global GDP will eventually stop rising because populations will be paralyzed by meaninglessness. Finally, the third point: universal prosperity simply can't sustain peace. Universal prosperity, in the modern sense of endless economic growth, can only be attained through greed and envy. Those emotions destroy happiness and meaning, which is itself a threat to peace. Furthermore, we can't attain universal prosperity without continuing to damage the environment. There are a lot of common misconceptions about economic growth. Most people assume that it's always good if the GDP rises – but there is such a thing as unhealthy growth. Those who think that economic growth is always good would have it that anything uneconomic is negative. Something is uneconomic if it doesn't generate a profit – and unprofitability is generally regarded as bad. On the other hand, anything profitable is held to be good. This kind of thinking is flawed, however, because when we only value economic activities in terms of the profits they yield, we don't factor in the human cost or their damage to the environment. And, in turn, uneconomic actions that do help people in need or protect the environment might be disregarded. It would be uneconomic for a seller to reduce their prices for poorer customers, for example. It would also be uneconomic for a person to buy goods produced locally if imported goods are cheaper. In other words, the prevailing economic thinking prizes money above all else. An economically thinking buyer is always on the hunt for a bargain. He doesn't care about the conditions under which his goods were produced – or their harm to the environment. His sole concern is getting the biggest bang for his buck. If a buyer turns down a bargain because the practices behind it are exploitative or destructive to the planet, she risks being criticized for being uneconomical. So we're collectively suppressing vital actions that we need to encourage in order to help both ourselves and our earth. Economic thinking puts a price tag on things priceless, like our humanity and our home. History tells us that education is a key factor in economic development, that it's much more important than having access to natural resources. Furthermore, the belief in the power of education is deeply embedded in modern societies. Today, a lot of people assume that societal progress relies on education. That's partly true, depending on what we teach. Education shouldn't just be about preparing young people to enter the job market – we have to instill in them the right values, too. Modern societies are complex environments to survive in, and we often assume that superior higher education is always better for any given person. We also expect education to lead us toward scientific and technological progress. Most people feel like they should understand basic scientific concepts like electrons, and know how to operate the latest technology. Scientific knowledge isn't inherently useful, however. What's important is learning how to harness our scientific knowledge to build a better society for ourselves. And that's where education comes in. Education ought to teach children values they can use to lead a meaningful life. The natural sciences don't provide them with any moral guidance; even the greatest scientific breakthroughs usually only have specific applications – they certainly don't tell us how to live our lives. We know how to do a lot of things, thanks to scientific progress, but we don't know what to do. Sometimes we think studying the humanities helps, but humanistic education can't save us if it doesn't teach metaphysics or ethics, for it is these disciplines that address the most powerful ideas and transcend the realm of mere facts. Fossil fuels are a limited resource, so we're soon going to need an alternative energy source. Many people felt that nuclear energy was the answer when it was first developed, especially because it seemed to have arrived just in time. Few understood, however, what nuclear energy could really do. Nuclear radiation has become the greatest threat to life on earth, and the effects of nuclear radiation are well known. Radiation particles are like tiny bullets that tear into an organism; the damage they do depends on their nuclear dosage and the types of cells they hit. The atom bomb raised general awareness of dangers of nuclear radiation. However, “peaceful” uses of atomic energy may prove to be an even greater danger to humanity. We know how to produce radioactive elements but there's nothing we can do to reduce radioactivity once it has been created. Only the passage of time can reduce its intensity – chemical reactions and physical interferences are useless. So far, we haven't found any place on earth where radioactive waste products can be stored safely, without having an impact on the surrounding life. Even small accidents can cause major catastrophes. Despite all the downsides, we continue to use nuclear energy, simply because it's economic for us to do so. This is one of the clearest examples of how money determines everything we do. The decision of whether to build nuclear power stations or traditional power stations run on fossil fuels is purely an economic one – made without regard to the social consequences. If nuclear energy doesn't end up saving us, it could easily destroy us. We tend to assume that further technological advances will always make our lives better. But modern technology has caused a number of societal crises, forcing us to call the value of technological progress into question. In many ways, technology has deprived humans of the joys of work. After all, the purpose of technology is to make our lives easier. We've developed tools to help us survive, ostensibly so we can focus on other, more enjoyable tasks, but a lot of our technology has taken away the work we enjoy the most, such as crafting. Modern technology has nearly eliminated the need for creative handiwork, like weaving, pottery and metalworking. These art forms have become increasingly rare in technologically advanced societies and it's nearly impossible to make a living off them now. Instead, modern technology has created the demand for new kinds of jobs that almost no one enjoys, such as assembly-line work in large factories. Another important feature of technology to be kept in mind is that it doesn't solve our most pressing problems. There are a number of serious crises facing the modern world. We've looked at how our consumption of fossil fuels creates pollution, and the supposed answer to that problem – nuclear energy – may turn out to be even more harmful. Moreover, there's no reason to believe that technology will eliminate poverty or unemployment. As we've seen, it often robs us of the work we enjoy the most. That's the problem Karl Marx was referring to when he said, “The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people.” Throughout the world, the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer. That's part of the reason that wealthier countries send developmental aid to poor countries. True economic development, however, is a major challenge. Why? Because you can't help a society grow just by infusing it with more money or material goods. In fact, material problems, such as a lack of infrastructure or natural resources, are the secondary causes of poverty. The primary causes of poverty are immaterial. An insufficient education system, governmental structure or legal system are much more detrimental to a society. These factors are crucial for economic prosperity, as evidenced by the fact that many wealthy countries, such as Israel, don't have any natural resources. History also shows us that countries with a high level of education and societal organization tend to recover very quickly after war, as the foundations for economic growth remain in place. But there’s another central problem of development: it can't be done quickly. Change has to evolve over time – it's not possible to rush it. Aid and development should also be focused on rural and small-town areas. Most developing countries have a dual economy, meaning there's a big divide between people in rural and urban areas. A typical developing country might have 15 percent of its population in its one or two big cities, while the other 85 percent live in small towns. Most development aid goes to the cities, however. So 85 percent of the population might not benefit at all. Developmental aid would also be more effective if it was sent primarily to people outside the modern sector of the country. This would help counter the problem of mass migration to the cities, too. In 1999, Exxon and Mobil merged to create the world's largest company, Exxon Mobil. Since then, the business world has seen a trend toward more huge companies of this scale. The deeper these mega-corporations penetrate into our society, the more individual people are devalued and reduced to pawns. All organizations need some degree of structure, whether they're big or small, but they also need to be unstructured enough to allow room for creative freedom. If an organization falls into disorder, it won't accomplish any of its goals; if the rules are too strict, however, it will also suffer. Freedom in the workplace is vital because without it the team members lose their motivation for creative thinking. They'll become so frustrated by their work that they won't have the energy to develop new ideas. When talented people are given room for creativity, though, the possibilities are endless. Creativity leads to innovation, something our society depends on. That's why large organizations should be made up of several smaller, semi-autonomous groups. Each needs the freedom to grow and innovate on its own. Large-scale organizations also need to foster loyalty and motivation among their employees. Loyalty is a key element in any effective organization, and the best way to earn it is to trust the people working at lower levels. Those in higher positions shouldn't take over low-level responsibilities; being higher up in an organization doesn't automatically make you wiser or more effective at the job. Motivation is also a central part of healthy, large-scale organizations. The upper management rarely struggles with motivation, but motivation tends to decrease as you move down the organization's hierarchy. Upper management teams tend to assume that people work only for the money. Up to a point, this is true, but if employees aren't challenged, they won't find any meaning or satisfaction in their work. The key message in this book: The modern Western economic system is harmful to humans and our planet. It's unsustainable because it relies on natural resources that are rapidly running out, and it values money over people. We can start solving this problem by reforming our education system, helping poorer areas develop and restructuring our organizations. Our current economic thinking simply has to go. Actionable advice: Think outside the economic box. Stop valuing every action in terms of how “economic” it is. After all, life is about much more than money. Suggested further reading: How Much is Enough? by Robert Skidelsky and Edward Skidelsky How Much is Enough sets out to critically inform the reader about the moral, historical and economical backgrounds of modern day capitalism, its obsession with accumulating more and more, and its consequences. It also vigorously outlines an ethical alternative to this lifestyle, in which our obsession with “more” is replaced with “the good life.” Got feedback?

But recent events – the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the Great Recession and Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, to name a few – have ushered the word back into public discourse. This resurgence raises an important question: What, exactly, do we mean when we say socialism? The truth is that socialism was developed, not as a means of oppression but of emancipation. Back in the nineteenth century, the world was changed forever. The industrial revolution forced millions of people into dirty, overcrowded cities. This impoverished urban population had little power or control over their work, and, especially when compared to those at the top, they received a pittance for their toil. In this new, alienating world, philosophers and thinkers began dreaming of a better way to organize society. They imagined a system based on equality and fairness, not oppressive moneygrubbing and productivity at any cost. Their socialist ideas didn’t always lead to where they thought they would. The twentieth-century socialism of Stalin and the USSR is a clear example of this. But socialism exists in many forms – just consider the liberal social democracies of Sweden and Western Europe. Socialism remains a difficult concept to pin down, but these blinks give you an idea of what it means, and why it remains as relevant as ever in the twenty-first century. In the following blinks, you’ll learn what surplus value is; what Sweden and Cuba have in common; and why socialism remains more important than ever. What do you think when you hear the word socialism? For many, the term “socialism” is often reduced to its most infamous incarnation – the long-lived USSR and its brutal dictator, Joseph Stalin. However, the USSR’s Stalinism is far from the only form that socialism can take. Indeed, socialism has taken many forms since it first arose in the nineteenth century. Consider the huge difference between Cuba and Sweden. The former is a communist single-party state; the latter, a parliamentary social democracy. Although the two nations are a world apart politically, each has a system of government that stems from socialist ideals and is rooted in a number of common socialist characteristics. The most overarching principle guiding all forms of socialism is the goal to create an egalitarian society. And although various forms disagree on how to achieve this, they all agree that society’s inequalities in income and power stem from the economic system that dominates the world today: capitalism. To varying degrees, socialists of all stripes have sought to remove the structural barriers put in place by capitalism – specifically, the ownership of capital by a small elite – so that all members of society can prosper equally. Beyond this overarching characteristic, socialists of all shapes and sizes believe in the possibility of creating an egalitarian society founded upon human solidarity. This optimistic belief is rooted in a fundamental assumption: that human beings are by nature cooperative, not competitive. But how would such an egalitarian system be brought about? Well, all socialists concur that such a system must come about via conscious human agency. It won’t happen naturally; human action is required. In other words, if people want change, they must be the agents of that change. Now that we have an idea of what binds socialists together, let’s delve into how the ideology developed. It’s time to head back to the nineteenth century, a time of industry and progress. In the early 1800s, huge leaps in technology led to the industrial revolution. Across the West, new factories and industries sprang into being. As a result, masses of people who’d previously lived in cooperative, rural communities were crowded into poorly planned cities. The conditions were dreadful, cramped and filthy. To survive, residents were forced to compete with each other for factory jobs that paid measly wages. Many welcomed these changes, hailing them as signs of progress. Others, angry at the extreme poverty and inequity inherent to this new industrial system, were less pleased. These disillusioned thinkers and activists gradually banded together under the banner of “socialism.” But it wasn’t until two socialists, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, came together in 1843 that socialism began to grow exponentially. Marx’s philosophy of class struggle played an especially large role in the development of socialist ideology. He believed that capitalism had divided people into two classes: the bourgeoisie and proletariat. The bourgeoisie were the owners of capital, such as factories and industrial machines, and to run these factories and machines, they relied on labor. That labor was provided by the proletariat. Marx argued that it was only by exploiting proletarian labor that the bourgeoisie were able to make profit. For example, say a worker is paid a wage of 100 dollars a day – enough to pay his rent and feed his family. In the first four hours of work, the worker will probably produce goods equaling 100 dollars in value. And during the second half of the day, as he continues to work, he will produce another 100 dollars. This additional amount is what Marx called surplus value. The foundation of the “class struggle” between the proletariat and bourgeoisie was over the question of the rate of surplus value. The bourgeoisie wanted to increase surplus value – the majority of which ended up in their pockets – whereas the proletariat sought to decrease it by petitioning for higher wages. As a consequence, the bourgeoisie and proletariat are locked in a constant, ever-worsening struggle. Marx believed this class struggle would eventually bring down capitalism entirely and usher in a more equal society. When Marx died, in 1883, socialist parties espousing Marx’s theory of class struggle were quickly spreading throughout Europe. However, not everyone approached his theory in the same way. By the end of the century, many of these parties had splintered and taken on new forms. By the end of the nineteenth century, all mass socialist organizations essentially agreed on the importance of reducing – or abolishing – economic inequality and of promoting human cooperation and solidarity. But a gap in Marx’s philosophy led to growing disagreement among socialists about exactly how to implement socialism. Marx himself hardly touched upon the topic. He knew that societies at different levels of development would require different approaches to implementing socialism. So he left the question open. By the dawn of the twentieth century, two main answers had emerged. The first of those answers was provided by the reformists. They espoused the belief that socialism could be brought about by reforming capitalism via democratic means within the existing capitalist system. Reformists claimed that their ideology had a crucial advantage: once socialist parties had won control in elections, they could immediately use the power of the state to implement reforms advantageous to the proletariat. After the Second World War, proponents of this form of socialism were known as social democrats. The second answer came from those who thought that socialism could only be achieved by means other than the ballot box – in other words, by revolution alone. This was most famously championed by the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. He critiqued reformism as being unrealistic; he thought that the bourgeoisie system would prevent the proletariat from developing the right consciousness to rule. A vanguard party led by well-trained intellectual elites was therefore necessary; it would inspire a revolutionary consciousness in the proletariat, who, eventually, would rise up and violently overthrow the bourgeoisie. This form of socialism became known as communism. While the two sides initially coexisted in an uneasy truce, the 1917 communist Revolution in Russia opened a massive schism between social democrats and communists. On the one hand, social democrats viewed Lenin’s increasingly authoritarian rule as antithetical to the socialistic goals of an egalitarian, democratic society. Conversely, Lenin began demanding that other European socialist parties obediently adopt his communist philosophy. Unsurprisingly, many social democrats refused to follow his lead. The scene was set for two distinct socialist ideologies that would compete with each other for decades to come. To get an idea of how each form of socialism fared over the last century or so, let’s look at two case studies: communist Cuba and social-democratic Sweden. By the 1920s, socialism was struggling. Social democratic parties in democracies such as Germany were being frozen out of government, despite winning elections, and totalitarianism – in the form of Stalinism and fascism – was growing increasingly powerful. It seemed that socialism was in retreat. But one nation bucked the trend: Sweden. In 1932, the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) entered government. Aside from a few years out of government in the 1970s and 1991s, the SAP maintained power for the rest of the century. Throughout this long period, the SAP pursued the doctrine of folkhemmet, or “people’s home,” which attempted to protect all citizens against economic exploitation and ensure social equality. The SAP was broadly successful in achieving its aims. By the 1990s, Sweden had spent the most per capita on health care, education and social welfare in the Western world. They also convinced Swedish voters that an egalitarian society was beneficial for all, allowing them to raise tax levels; in 1983, top earners were paying income tax rates of up to 80 percent! In order to reach these high levels of redistribution and equality, the SAP followed what became known as a socially controlled market economy. Rather than focusing on nationalizing business – a policy that most socialist parties would have implemented – the SAP created strong labor laws, giving workers the power to bargain with private business owners. Such laws allowed the SAP to pass equal pay for equal work legislation, increase wages for the bottom tier of earners and restrict the wages of the highest earners. Of course, the SAP didn’t have it all its own way. Since the mid-1980s, external pressures, such as economic globalization based on principles of deregulated free trade, have negatively affected the Swedish economy. As a result, governments have had to cut public expenditure and accept higher levels of unemployment. Then, in 1995, Sweden joined the EU and had to adopt EU economic regulations, the majority of which were much less progressive than its own. Such conditions meant the slow undoing of decades of SAP progress, with public expenditure dropping from 70 percent to 56.3 percent of gross national product between 1993 and 2002. Despite this regression, Sweden still boasts some of the most positive social indicators in the world. Just compare Sweden’s child poverty rate from 2005 – 2.6 percent – with that of the United States in the same year – 22.4 percent. With statistics like this, it’s clear that Scandinavian social democracy must still be doing something right. On the other side of the Atlantic, the Caribbean island nation of Cuba experienced a very different form of socialism than Sweden. Unlike Sweden’s democratic route to a socialist society, Cuba’s journey began in 1959 with a revolution overthrowing US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. One of the revolution’s leaders, Fidel Castro, quickly began implementing a distinct Cuban form of socialism that he branded humanism. This ideology centered on policies such as agrarian reform, anti-imperialism and rent reduction. Directly after the revolution, about 15 percent of the nation’s wealth was transferred from landowners to laborers and peasants. Castro’s policies angered the US government, which eventually placed an embargo on the island. Faced with this pressure from the United States, Castro aligned himself with the USSR. In 1961, a trade deal was signed, and then, in 1965, Castro founded the Cuban Communist Party, cementing single-party socialist rule over the nation. Even with the US embargo in place, Cuba advanced the cause of socialism in many areas. Take women’s equality, for example. In 1974, female participation in the economy increased from the prerevolution 18 percent to 37 percent – the highest in Latin America. Cuban communism could also boast the only universally free health-care system in Latin America. And, by 1992, life expectancy had risen from 59 years (the prerevolutionary number) to 76. What’s more, in 1990, infant mortality rates in Washington, DC, were twice as high as those in Havana. Education at all levels was also made universally free, producing a literacy rate of 96.4 percent, one of the highest in the developing world. This progress toward an egalitarian society wasn’t without its setbacks, however. The dissolution of the USSR and the decline of the global communist trade network caused Cuba to lose 70 percent of its purchasing power. At the same time, the United States tightened sanctions, squeezing the Cuban economy even further. All of this led to an economic crisis in Cuba incomparable to any other experienced by a twentieth-century nation in peacetime. Castro’s government eventually increased political repression, resulting in the imprisonment of anyone seen as cooperating with the United States. Despite this, Cuba’s communism survives to the present day, although how long it will soldier on isn’t clear. Looking at the parallel development of Cuban communism and Swedish social democracy, it becomes clear that they share many similarities. Both promoted the cause of equality and solidarity, and pursued a more egalitarian society. Socialism wasn’t – and isn’t – universally embraced in either country, and, in both cases, social progress tends to be closely tied to sustainable economic progress. In the post-war era, social movements like feminism and environmentalism presented socialism with fresh problems. Today, it seems obvious that an egalitarian society must promote equality for women. However, this wasn’t always self-evident. For example, even though communist states in Eastern Europe were far ahead of the West in terms of equality for women, this was mostly restricted to levels of education and professional advancement. In communist East Germany, for instance, 95.1 percent of three- to six-year-olds attended kindergarten in 1989, compared to 67.5 percent in capitalist West Germany. However, the communist government still maintained that women should remain in charge of domestic affairs. This wasn’t that surprising. The majority of socialist organizations at the time – both communist and social democratic – were dominated by men, with little space for women or their concerns. It was only after the first wave of feminism and women’s liberation in the 1960s that socialism began to face these uncomfortable facts. Because women had been frozen out of official socialist organizations, change largely came from grassroots activists. Socialist orthodoxy was similarly challenged by the green movement. Decades of economic growth via industrialism and resource extraction had taken a huge toll on the environment. For social democrats, the green movement proved a problem. After all, economic growth – and the tax revenue it generated – was vital in maintaining the welfare state. Should economic growth and socialist progress really be slowed down to protect the environment? Because of this, green socialists remained on the fringes of socialist thinking for decades. Their actions were mostly restricted to campaigns against specific issues, such as anti-nuclear politics. Indeed, it wasn’t until the news of the US’s refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol hit headlines in 2001, that public discourse changed and mainstream socialist thinking began to accept sustainability of the economy for future generations as important as growing the economy today. Generally, socialism has benefited greatly from the inclusion of green and feminist politics. But there have also been disruptions. For one, the anti-hierarchical, activist models used by the green and feminist movements have caused the socialist movement to fragment. Where socialists once had a few clear aims and objectives, they now have many, some of them contradictory. For example, it's tricky for socialist parties to simultaneously be against the industrial damage caused to the environment and pro-trade union. Capitalism is the most powerful system today. In the last 30 or so years, neoliberalism – a form of capitalism that advocates the deregulation of markets, privatization and austerity – has been on the march. To understand why neoliberalism is so influential today, we need to look back to its first few years of domination. In the first decades after the Second World War, social democracy, fueled and funded by strong economic growth across the West, boomed. By the 1970s, however, this growth had begun to slow. Once-flourishing economies stagnated, and the tide began to turn against social democracy. Neoliberalism flooded into the ideological space vacated by social democracy. Promoted by politicians such as Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States, neoliberalist policies became the mainstream. With the ideological change came an attitudinal switch. People no longer believed that welfare systems and public spending should be at the heart of a functioning society. Rather, individuals should be freed of excessive taxation and regulation. They should be allowed to take care of themselves. The repercussions of this have been severe for socialist ideals. From the 1970s to the 1990s, inequality in Western nations has grown rapidly. Internationally, UN reports show that, in the 1990s, the average income of 54 countries declined. And by 2005, it was estimated that 1 percent of human beings possess as much wealth as the world’s 57 percent poorest. So how can socialists fight back? Perhaps the most important thing socialists can do is reflect on the mistakes made during socialist experiments over the last century. One clear lesson is that any future socialist society must be democratic at all levels of its existence. This must involve elements of both participatory democracy in society, and a representative multiparty system. The single-party, authoritarian rule of former communist states cannot be repeated. Secondly, socialists must seek to develop feasible, sustainable economic strategies. Both centrally planned and growth-based models have proven unsustainable; alternative economic forms such as cooperativism or decentralized public ownership should, therefore, be explored. Finally, the scope of how socialism should function, whether centralized or local, still needs to be addressed. The increasingly globalized world suggests that socialism should be an internationalist movement. The difficulty of achieving this, however, is hard to surmount. While these lessons leave many questions unanswered, we can be fairly certain that capitalism will not itself solve the multitude of issues it causes. And as long as this is the case, socialism will retain its importance. The key message in these blinks: While attempts at socialism over the last century have had varying degrees of success, each has sought to establish an egalitarian society to replace the structural inequalities inherent to capitalism. Future attempts at socialism must address the mistakes of previous iterations if they are to replace capitalism with an egalitarian society free of inequality and economic hardship. Got feedback?

Originating in the high colonial period of the nineteenth century, sociology has always been based on the perspective of European and American academics and observers. Usually, they’re training their lens on those in poorer countries, with results that aren’t as straightforward as they seem at first glance.  So, let’s explore the history of sociology and how it became a “Northern” theory of the rich and privileged, and see what the alternative – a “Southern theory” – can tell us about the world today. In these blinks, you’ll find out the part imperialism played in the creation of sociology; how a Nigerian poem sparked a theory about the pillars of society; and what reading Donald Duck can tell us about the North’s view of the South. Any sociology major will tell you that sociology as a discipline began with three thinkers: Max Weber, Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim. But this isn’t the whole story. What often goes unmentioned is that the social sciences emerged during a very specific period in history. In the decades leading up to World War One, the empires of European countries and the US grew dramatically. The German, British and French empires expanded into Africa and Asia while the United States conquered parts of the American west and overseas territories such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. At this time, colonizers justified their actions by claiming they were modernizing and civilizing so-called “primitive” peoples. Asserting their position of white superiority, colonizers took it upon themselves to spread progress, as they believed other societies were inferior and unable to develop independently. It was in this period that sociology was created in order for the empires to study the people they had colonized. Not only were colonizers claiming “new” land by violently obliterating resistance, but they also began observing the culture of the people there. For example, between 1898 and 1913 in the sociological journal L’Année Sociologique, over two-thirds of the reviews were about colonized territories. Durkheim, who founded the journal, was therefore only able to write about Algeria’s Kabyle people because the French had conquered the country not long before. Later in the early twentieth century, sociology was reinvented in American universities and became established as an academic discipline. It was only then that the works of Weber, Marx and Durkheim were prescribed for all sociologists. The new discipline required a curriculum, so the first sociology professors narrowed it down to these three academics. Consequently, any wider sociological perspectives were ignored and the violent and exploitative origin of sociology was covered up. Although the old empires have since dissolved and colonialism has mostly come to an end, the world remains split into those who have power and those who don’t. And this imbalance is still evident in sociology today. Actually, sociology is conducted in largely the same way as it was in colonial times. That is, theories are formulated and published in the metropole – the central cities of the empires – and these theories are then applied to formerly colonized territories. For example, some scholars still study “primitive” cultures from the perspective of a “civilized” observer. In other cases, academics sidestep indigenous and colonized cultures while still claiming universality – the idea that concepts can be applied to every part of the world. US sociologist James S. Coleman is one example of this approach to modern sociology. Known for his Coleman Report on education, in 1990 Coleman published Foundations of Social Theory, in which he distinguishes the constructed or modern societies from the peripheral or “natural” and “primitive” societies. Coleman also uses universality to compare, for example, nomadic sub-Saharan tribes sharing a camel to “Eskimos” handing out the parts of a slain bear, even though these cultures are completely distinct from one another. In addition, Coleman fails to broach the subject of colonization and the effects of slavery on society. Although he claims his theories are universal, he ignores the colonization that affected the majority of the world and the implications it has for a universal theory. Unfortunately, this type of modern sociology dictates that only theories from metropoles are considered legitimate. This means that a scholar in London or Chicago has no problem publishing work based on concepts created by European scholars in Europe and applying the data to Manila or Brasilia. However, a scholar doing the reverse has a slim chance of being published. So how exactly did empire and colony become the global North and South?  The world is becoming increasingly connected through modern technology, international corporations and trade agreements. All these things make geographical distances almost irrelevant, but unfortunately, our interconnectedness doesn’t mean that we’re all equal. Around 1990, sociologists in the United Kingdom and the United States began using the term globalization after it became accepted in business and economics publications. These sociologists claimed to explore the world as a new, global society. However, globalization theories still view the world from the standpoint of those in power. Most of these theories aren’t so different to the logic followed by colonizers. For instance, modernization is seen as sprawling out from the European and North American post-industrial countries into the developing nations, who embrace the progress.  But this isn’t an accurate representation of what is going on. By assuming that all societies want the same thing and advance in the same way, theorists disregard those who experience “progress” as something negative. Take the deforestation of the Amazon and the impact it has on the indigenous societies living there – is that progress? By overlooking the damage the developed North is inflicting upon the developing South, some sociologists fail to recognize how colonial history is repeating itself under the guise of a “universalized global culture.” Furthermore, splitting the world into North and South exposes global inequality. Much like the terms First, Second and Third Worlds, The West, or developing and underdeveloped countries, it doesn’t point to a geographical place, but to an unequal relationship that began with European imperialism. Seeing the world as being unequally divided into North and South doesn’t ignore the perspective of the powerless. This is Southern theory: knowledge created in places regarded as less legitimate by the powerful Northern countries. So has anyone taken this approach to sociology? Yes! The South has developed some important sociological theories in the last few decades, and, in the following blinks, we’ll look at three of them. The political tensions within and between the many nations of Africa are well known today. But before these conflicts, cultural struggles were widespread as African nations fought against European conquest. These movements are known as the African Renaissance, a term which can refer to two historical instances. Some use the term African Renaissance to describe the time in the 1990s when African politicians focused on African identity, democracy and development. For example, South African president Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela’s successor, used the term to refer to the economic and cultural development he envisioned, which included the emancipation of African women. Others use the term to refer to earlier Africanist movements like négritude and pan-Africanism. This interpretation considers the African Renaissance as a twentieth-century movement to reaffirm indigenous African culture and knowledge.  So how was the African Renaissance treated in sociological theory? Scholars like Akinsola Akiwowo fought for theories based on indigenous African societies. Instead of using European and North American concepts to analyze African societies, Akiwowo proposed applying indigenous African culture concepts to the rest of the world. He translated a ritual poem about a creation story written in a Yoruba language and commented on the work’s terms and meaning. Central to Akiwowo’s interpretation was the concept of asuwada, which he defined as “the purposive clumping of diverse iwa” – which loosely translates to “beings” – as a basis for how parts of Nigerian society are created. Basing social theories on local culture was a reversal of the North/South relationship which sociology had used since its inception. Akiwowo’s work was one effort in the African Renaissance that sought to describe the experience and culture of colonized peoples from their perspective rather than from the standpoint of the colonizers. Few can deny the economic and political power the United States has maintained for over a century. But less well-known is the way the Northern superpower’s culture has asserted its dominance over the global South. One sociological study that explored this relationship was How to Read Donald Duck by Chile-based sociologists Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart. Originally published in Spanish and later translated into English, the study analyzed 100 issues of Disney comic books. Dorfman and Mattelart argued that Disney comics revealed the way the United States saw Latin America and the Third World. Take, for instance, the class hierarchy depicted in the cartoons: it never changes. Scrooge McDuck is always rich and the lower class Beagle Boys are always thieves. In the cartoons, uncolonized societies are portrayed as exotic, primitive and unable to fend off villains, with half of the stories centering around the main characters visiting places like “Aztecland” and “Unsteadystan.” The rich ducks always swoop in to save the “noble savages” from the bad guys, by, for example, building a resort that the locals can run in order to save their village. According to Dorfman and Mattelart, the comics culturally perpetuated the social structure and global dominance of the North as, at the end of each adventure, the ducks always restored their world’s status quo, keeping the rich wealthy and the poor unlawful. In a way, these comics blinded people in Latin America to exploitation, and undermined the subcontinent’s chances of freeing itself from its dependence on the North. How to Read Donald Duck was considered so radical that Disney tried to have translated copies of it seized in the United States. Once dubbed “the jewel in the crown,” India was an invaluable colony of the British Empire. So when it gained independence in 1947, the subcontinent became an inspiration to the colonized world.  But its colonial past continued to leave a cultural imprint long after independence, especially on Indian historiography. In the 1980s, the radical Indian historians of the Subaltern Studies Group wanted to initiate a discussion of Indian history from the perspective of the poor and oppressed. The group therefore focused on the political experience of Indian subalterns, like the working class and peasant movements. Highlighting this alternative perspective, Gautam Bhadra’s work Four Rebels of Eighteen-Fifty-Seven is based on the records of the peasant uprisings in that year. Bhadra uncovered the stories of villagers like Devi Singh, who, along with the leaders of the peasant uprising in Raya, launched an attack on moneylenders and the British authorities. The uprising was quashed, the leaders hanged and their story kept quiet until Bhadra’s study. The Subaltern Studies Group managed to gather momentum and eventually became well-known in North American universities, where it was acclaimed by postcolonialism scholars such as Edward Said. The biggest challenge, however, was that most subaltern groups didn’t leave written records of their movements. So, the Indian scholars researched subaltern history by examining the records of the colonial elite. For example, in Conditions for Knowledge of Working-Class Conditions, historian Dipesh Chakrabarty argued that the lack of officially required documentation for the jute workforce in early twentieth century Calcutta exposed the shady methods of the elite. They didn’t want to leave a paper trail. Therefore no records remained. In this way, the Subaltern Studies Group could reveal the histories of the powerless despite the fact that they had been silenced or disregarded by the elite. These are just some recent examples of social theory from the global South. And although there have been more, there’s still a long way for Southern Theory to go. We’ve seen that what we think is legitimate or true is largely determined by the place and people involved in the production of knowledge. So how can sociologists keep a balanced perspective on this? First, the social sciences must recognize the relationship between the periphery and the metropole. The pattern of global inequality needs to be explicitly named in order to undo the supposition that theories written by the privileged are universal. Sociologists must acknowledge the inequalities in power, wealth and culture that originated in colonialism and that the social sciences don’t reflect the experience of the great majority who suffered during colonization. Second, sociologists must acknowledge the existence and diversity of the periphery. Not only must claims of universal validity be withdrawn, but particular situations in the periphery must also be addressed. Take the Australian aboriginal people, who are the most marginalized group in Australia. According to a 1997 study by Michael Dodson, the life expectancy of Australian aborigines is 18 to 20 years shorter than that of other Australians. They’re also three times more likely to be unemployed. What’s more, 38 percent of aboriginal communities have a water supply that fails to meet WHO standards. This isn’t a matter of having the right resources; it’s the inability of the privileged elite to recognize an urgent problem. Lastly, social sciences must document the histories of the oppressed. It’s vital that these narratives are more than just description, as in European scholars’ accounts. The goal should be to educate people about one another from an equal footing. The oppressed must have their experiences and politics voiced instead of having them erased from the history books. Eugene Genovese’s 1976 book Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World that Slaves Made is one example in which the situation of the oppressed – in this case, slaves in the American South – is told. Before an equal exchange of knowledge can take place, scholars must recognize the history of colonialism and its flawed universal claims. The key message in this book: Sociology emerged during, and because of, European colonialism. Since this time, sociological knowledge and theory have been valid only when produced by the metropoles of the North, particularly Europe and North America. In order for an equal exchange to occur between the global North and South, sociology must both acknowledge and rectify this inequality of power. Got feedback?

Smith and Rahul Telang","summary":"In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy after dominating the film and photographic industry for most of the twentieth century. The former corporate behemoth had failed to adapt to the new digital photography trend. Although Kodak had been aware of the seismic shift and even developed their own digital photography technology, they were afraid of cannibalizing their successful analog film business. As a result, they never gained a footing in the new market and quickly dwindled. There were no more Kodak moments. The moral of this story is that failing to adapt to new technology can be dangerous. During the last decade, many major players in the entertainment industry have failed to heed this warning. And many have seen themselves outrun by tech-savvy startups. So, how have these new companies managed to wrestle power away from the big players? These blinks explain. In these blinks, you’ll learn what six major music executives called “shit” in 1997; why over half a million people binge-watched the first season of House of Cards; and what piracy did to the Indian movie industry. A while ago, CDs were widely used to play music. Nowadays, you rarely see them, save for a small minority who collect them for nostalgic purposes. What led to their demise? Big players in the music industry ignored the potential of digital music, which allowed companies such as Apple, Pandora and Spotify to emerge and kill off the CD. In 2003, AT&T was the first company to attempt to introduce digital downloads with its division A2B Music. Its cofounders pitched the concept to top music executives but they were met with ridicule, as growing CD sales were creating so much revenue. A2B Music quickly dissolved, but in the early 2000s, companies like Apple began to flourish using the same technology. Soon, digital music became popular, and CDs became irrelevant. Encyclopedia Britannica suffered a similar fate. In 1985, Microsoft requested non-exclusive rights to the company so they could digitize the contents of its encyclopedias. Personal computers were growing in popularity at this time, but the print-based business wasn’t convinced. The repercussions of this decision would be felt in 1993; that year, Microsoft created a multimedia encyclopedia called Encarta, and sales of print encyclopedias plummeted by $110 million as a result. A modern-day company which harnesses the power of technology, is Netflix. It uses data analytics to truly customize the user experience. Formerly, production companies created pilot episodes of new shows and aired them to network executives. If the pilot received a positive response, the network requested more episodes – if not, the show was rejected. When the creators of House of Cards pitched their show to Netflix, the company ordered two seasons for $100 million without seeing the pilot. The Netflix team had thoroughly analyzed their user data and knew House of Cards would be a hit with their audience. The show’s creators were further incentivized to exclusively release both seasons on Netflix because, as a digital platform, it didn’t have the same airtime limitations as TV networks. In the past, only a few companies had the money to create content and facilitate new artists. If you were a creative, your vision was determined by the entity in control of the budget. However, newbies like Netflix have given artists and directors free rein. The first episode of House of Cards illustrates this. The show begins with an injured dog being strangled to death. Before, the scene wouldn’t have made it past network executives fearful that risky content could result in the loss of advertising money. Netflix doesn’t feature ads at all, so the show’s creators had greater liberty. Showrunner Beau Willimon didn’t have to split the series into 30- or 60-minute slots with cliffhangers in each episode either. Instead, he was able to write the show as if it were a 13-hour film. Viewers also benefit from the way Netflix operates as they can binge-watch at any time of the day. The company doesn’t restrict its consumers to watching episodes at specific times – 670,000 people binge-watched the entire second season of House of Cards! This is similar to how YouTube works – you can watch videos about any topic, and you can access them whenever you like. Artists also benefit because expensive equipment is no longer necessary. The Academy Award-winning documentary The Lady in Number 6 was shot using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, which cost only a few thousand dollars – a lot less than a traditional movie camera. Companies like YouTube directly try to help artists save money on production. The platform offers  YouTube Spaces to those of its users with over 5,000 subscribers. These facilities provide access to editing, makeup, lights, design, videography and equipment. The entertainment business is constantly changing, so the real challenge for industry leaders is to perceive these shifts at the right time, understand their scale and respond effectively. The story of Thomas Edison and his musical invention is a prime example of a businessman failing to comprehend an evolving market. In 1877, he created the phonograph – a machine that could record sound onto a tinfoil-covered cylinder. He patented his invention and moved on to developing the electric light bulb. However, others continued to modify his idea until the graphophone came into existence; this was a far superior device which used wax cylinders to record sound. A rich businessman bought the rights to both the graphophone and the phonograph, but his company eventually went bankrupt. Edison bought back the rights to his machine and planned to develop it for jukeboxes in amusement parks. Later, in 1887, Emile Berliner patented sound recording on discs called records. They were easy to mass produce and store, so his business quickly proved to be extremely lucrative. Unfortunately for Edison, he chose to stick with his cylinders, while Berliner’s records dominated the music industry. In contrast to Edison, small indie labels of the 1950s judged their market correctly and benefitted from the emergence of rock ‘n’ roll. The big music companies saw rock and roll as a fad, or a niche interest for teenagers who didn’t have much purchasing power. Influencers of the period like Time magazine and Frank Sinatra also openly ridiculed the genre.   However, Alan Freed, a prominent disc jockey of the era, championed rock and roll and predicted its widespread popularity. As independent labels had nothing to lose, they collectively embraced the genre. A decade later, 42 labels had rock ‘n’ roll records in the charts. Today, the entertainment industry is more diverse – small companies exist alongside bigger businesses and still have a broad reach. However, this wasn’t always the case. Throughout the twentieth century, a handful of companies used their economic power and size to dominate the industry. During the 1950s, radio was essential to the music scene. In exchange for airtime for their artists, big labels would promise radio stations perks like backstage access, free concert tickets and various freebies. Smaller labels didn’t have the ability to do this. Similarly, the movie industry was presided over by six businesses: Disney, Fox, NBC, Paramount, Sony and Warner Brothers. Together, they controlled 80 percent of the market because they operated on such a large scale. In the publishing field, the book trade was controlled in much the same way by Penguin, Random House, Macmillan, Harpercollins, Hachette and Simon and Schuster. Money facilitated this domination. Major players like Universal Music had the capital to take a risk on a range of artists, as one lucrative musician could make up for multiple failures. Financial strength also attracted top talent. A gifted artist was easily tempted away from working with an independent label when offered a sizable contract. In turn, labels associated with successful artists naturally enticed fresh talent. Before the internet, leading labels were also able to control the distribution of music because they could ensure maximum visibility for their artists by paying physical stores. In the 1990s, most outlets only carried around 3,000 to 5,000 albums – even the largest superstores held a maximum of 15,000. To promote their talent, these labels offered in-store interviews and advance album copies. Altogether, these advantages led big labels to perceive themselves as invincible. To their detriment, they failed to consider that technological advances could diminish their hold over the industry. There’s a limited edition vinyl that was pressed in the 1980s that you’re desperate to add to your collection. In the age prior to the internet, you’d have to put in considerable hours to source such rare or less popular titles. Now, of course, it’s much easier to both access and download records, books and other works online. In fact, it seems that the more obscure, the better. Unconventional artists tend to attract large, loyal audiences, and people are willing to pay small fortunes for rare titles. One of the authors of Streaming, Sharing, Stealing was prepared to do this while on the hunt for a 30-year-old pharmaceutical book. He was struggling to locate the book in a physical store, but by doing a quick search on Alibris – an online store for new, old and out-of-print titles – he was able to track down a copy. The book was his for $20, though he’d have been willing to pay more. When it arrived, $0.75 was written inside the front cover; the book had been sitting in a bookshop for years without attracting a single customer. So online stores provide an easier method of searching and more variety than offline establishments. To test this theory, the brains behind Streaming, Sharing, Stealing teamed up with researchers Alejandro Zentner and Cuneyd Kaya to study data from both the physical and online stores of a large video rental chain. They discovered that rentals of the 100 most popular DVDs made up 85 percent of transactions in-store but only 35 percent of online transactions. But did the online customers tend to go for obscure titles because they were shopping online rather than in a physical store? To ascertain this, the group looked at how an individual’s consumption pattern shifted when one of the chain’s local stores closed. The consumer was forced to switch from the limited in-store selection to the extensive online array. They found that this person was then more likely to rent unconventional titles over blockbusters. For a while, companies relied on good old intuition to determine which content would appeal to certain audiences. However, it’s since been discovered that companies which utilize their customer data make better creative decisions. By making use of big data, a company can bolster its marketing efforts. The app-based company Shazam is a prime example of this. The business works by allowing users to identify any track they hear. As it performs millions of searches each day, it’s built a competitive advantage by documenting all of this information. Due to the predictive power of Shazam’s data, it’s proven highly popular with many music agents. In February 2014, the company announced that it would be using its data to produce music for a new Warner Music Group imprint. User data also proved to be exceptionally useful when it came to promoting House of Cards. In order to target different customers, separate trailers were produced which utilized information collected about the show’s viewers. Visuals were created which focused on Kevin Spacey, aiming to appeal to those who had watched the actor’s other work. Similarly, trailers featuring David Fincher’s directing style were made to cater to those familiar with his aesthetic. The decision to use data-driven processes to create content has resulted in more recognition for online platforms, as well as numerous award wins. As a company, Amazon relies on data-driven processes to inform its creative decisions. At the 2015 Golden Globe Awards, it was up against networks such as HBO and The CW but still won the Best Comedy award for its show Transparent.  Netflix is also winning awards for its creative, data-driven content. In 2016, the company received eight Golden Globe nominations – more than any other television network that year. Netflix had succeeded in ending HBO’s 14-year winning streak, proving that the importance of user data shouldn’t be underestimated. It’s no secret that the advent of the internet brought several benefits. However, one downside of this technological feat is the proliferation of piracy – but there are ways to curtail it. Piracy is so detrimental because it allows consumers to receive content without paying. In 2015, the authors of Streaming, Sharing, Stealing presented a paper about the issue to the World Intellectual Property Organization. To compile this document, they surveyed all the peer-reviewed journal articles they could find that discussed the effect of piracy on sales. Of the 25 articles they unearthed, 22 reported instances in which piracy had significantly harmed sales. The Indian film industry in particular has suffered huge financial loss because of piracy. Back in 2014, the authors worked with the economist Joel Waldfogel to compare data on the industry gathered before 1985 and between the years 1985-2000. They discovered that the revenue generated declined rapidly as VCR-based piracy emerged. They also found that there was a significant decrease in the amount of movies produced in India post-1985 and that their quality also depreciated. In order to prevent piracy, consumers have to understand the risk of committing the crime. In 2012, the authors studied the effect of an anti-piracy law passed in France in 2009, which meant that notices about copyright infringement were sent to pirates. The fact that the law solely affected French consumers permitted the authors to examine its effect on iTunes sales patterns in the country. They ascertained that when it was legally dicier to commit piracy, many consumers switched to legitimate consumption. The data also showed that the law caused a 20 to 25 percent increase in sales.   Therefore, as damaging as piracy can be, entertaining content can still be protected and shared fairly. It’s vitally important to do so, as piracy can cause artists and producers to lose their incentive to create new, high-quality work, causing consumers to ultimately lose out in the long run. The key message in this book: Since the twentieth century, the entertainment industry has changed significantly. The advent of the internet has meant that it’s easier to source and share content, and big companies no longer have a monopoly across the board. To succeed nowadays, businesses need to make use of user data and ensure the prevention of piracy.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Frank","summary":"Steve Jobs was an incredibly talented person. He excelled in the business world and achieved things beyond most people’s wildest dreams. But does he really deserve sole credit for his success? Did luck not also play a part? It’s important to remind ourselves that Jobs had the good fortune of, for example, being born in a rich country with access to computers and other gadgets. These blinks examine the role that luck plays in all of our lives. You’ll discover that luck doesn’t just appear out of nowhere and that it also seems to accrue. It favors the same people again and again until they become financial magnates or top sportspeople – but whom it favors is no coincidence. In the end, no person is entirely self-made. In these blinks, you’ll learn     how hindsight bias means we don’t appreciate the role of luck; how luck can make us successful; and how public services create the preconditions for lucky countries and individuals. If you've ever had the misfortune of being doored while pedalling along on your bike, you'll know that no amount of foresight or anticipation can compensate for the fact that the world is unpredictable. Even so, hindsight can play tricks on you. If you replay the bike accident in your mind, it will seem all so preventable. This phenomenon is called hindsight bias, the predisposition to assume after the fact that an event was predictable, even when it wasn't. This way of thinking also means that we may unwittingly accept inferences or hypotheses as foreseeable facts. The American sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld investigated this tendency toward hindsight bias in an experiment in the 1940s. He told participants that, according to a previous study, people from rural areas were much more adept at handling the challenges and strains of military service than city dwellers were. All the people Lazarsfeld spoke to found this to be an obvious conclusion. However, the findings of the previous study had actually led to the exact opposite conclusion – Lazarsfeld had deliberately falsely reported the results to demonstrate hindsight bias. Participants considered his findings easy to accept because of their predisposition to see any given outcome as logical or predictable. What's more, hindsight bias is widely applicable, especially when we consider fame and success. You might not believe it, but the Mona Lisa was not always as celebrated as it is today. That's hindsight bias playing tricks on you. In fact, it wasn't until 1911 that the Mona Lisa began achieving the fame it enjoys today. In that year, an Italian, Vincenzo Peruggia, stole it from the Louvre in Paris. When he, and the painting, emerged two years later in Florence, its reputation had soared. Peruggia was lionized for bringing the painting “back” to Italy, and the fame of the painting was assured. Meanwhile, Peruggia had only been trying to get the thing off his hands! The point is, as humans we tend to explain away history and trends as predictable, especially when hindsight is applied. This is as true for our understanding of fame as it is for our interpretation of any reports and information we come across. You've no doubt seen what happens when big retail chains come to town: smaller shops simply can't compete and they soon go out of business. This is precisely how the globalized market works today, and this trend is summed up by the cliché, “winner takes all.” The economics of distribution and sales means that smaller enterprises like your local shoe retailer or bookstore are less viable nowadays. In the past, it was cheaper to buy locally than to ship in from elsewhere. But now that transport networks have made our markets global, local businesses must compete globally. Of course, the internet has only exacerbated this. Customers can find anything online and have it shipped to them. As a result, those businesses that are already big prosper, while smaller local businesses find the odds stacked against them. It's the same story when it comes to the arts. There seems to be no limit to the amount of money that famous artists can rake in – just think of Adele or Taylor Swift. But when you think about it, is there really such a big difference between the very successful and their nearest rivals who earn much less? It hardly seems like fair competition. Soloists in classical music or principal dancers at the ballet have always been better paid than the rest of the orchestra or the corps de ballet. But this wage gap is getting wider and wider. Indoctrinated by modern economic thinking, we might assume that the markets are justly rewarding the best entertainers and the most efficient businesses. But, as we'll explore in the next blink, plain good luck likely contributes far more to their success than we might like to think. The chances of stumbling across a $100 bill are tiny. The odds are, in fact, so small, that we tend to attribute such events to luck. But “luck” is really just another way for us to conceptualize how the improbable occurs. For example, the odds of tossing a coin 20 times and having it land on heads every time are miniscule. But do it enough times with enough people and it will happen eventually. Although we're aware that such a thing could theoretically happen, we're so unaccustomed to improbable phenomena that we often prefer to think that some external or supernatural force has played a part. In fact, we should be much more willing to accept that luck is simply part of our daily lives. Nor should we stop there. In truth, luck can be the deciding factor in close contests. This effect can be seen especially clearly at the Olympic Games, where the very small number of competitors are all extremely talented and exceptionally well trained. When the differences are so slight, luck becomes a key factor. To push this example further, consider the impact of wind direction in eight world records in track and field. Seven of the eight world record holders, taking into account men and women, in the 100m, the triple jump, the long jump and the 110m hurdles were lucky enough to have had a tail wind behind them when they set these records. We can't escape it – luck has its part to play when it comes to success and unlikely events. Even when it seems insignificant, it can mean the difference between winning and losing. Despite this, myths still swirl around the concept of luck. We often have trouble grasping what it's all about and what effect it has, particularly when it comes to getting rich. Why is that? We'll find out in the next blink. “There is nothing so certain as death and taxes,” goes the old saying. It certainly makes paying taxes sound like a real burden; after all, when you've worked hard for your success, writing a check for the tax collector is the last thing you want to do. The good news? It's not worth worrying about. The mistake many people, especially the rich, make when thinking about taxes, is overestimating the impact higher taxes will have on their buying power. But economics doesn't work like that. If you are taxed more, so are other people like you, which means your relative buying power stays the same. What’s more, your social standing stays the same as well, at least in terms of what you can afford. Say you and your neighbors are all considering buying boats. If before a tax hike you can afford to buy the second-nicest boat in the neighborhood, this won’t change with the tax. This is because everyone in the neighborhood will need to buy a cheaper boat to compensate for the added expense, so you’re relative position stays the same. Everyone is in the same, well, boat. What’s more, taxes aren’t just money that disappears into the ether; tax revenue creates favorable conditions in a country. Rich people should be especially grateful for this and should be prepared to share their luck with others. Why? Because well-spent tax revenues create the preconditions to cultivate luck. If you're born in a wealthy country, you're going to benefit from infrastructure built with tax money. Roads, good schools and robust legal systems are made and maintained with that cash. Therefore, it's nonsensical for the rich to oppose the higher taxes that helped them succeed in the first place. This is where luck comes in. If we acknowledge its importance in success, we also need to face the fact that we need to pay enough taxes. This, in turn, will nurture the preconditions to keep us lucky. Humans are pretty suggestible beings, easily influenced by the actions of others. But when it comes to spending, this social awareness can backfire. Enthusiastic or extravagant spending isn’t always constructive; let's illustrate this by considering what we spend on weddings. In 1980, the average American wedding cost $11,000 (inflation accounted for). By 2014, that sum had risen to $30,000. We're happy to spend such crazy amounts because we see other people doing it. Remarkably, the Social Science Research Network showed in 2014 that spending more on your wedding day actually decreases the chances of you and your partner staying together. On top of that, you'll be affected by the consequences of reckless spending even if you try to avoid it. Imagine you decide to live in a less expensive neighborhood. This could have many more repercussions than just putting up with a smaller front lawn. It will impact your children because, like it or not, better schools are concentrated in more expensive neighborhoods, and schools tend to recruit students from their immediate vicinity. So, if you want your children to get better schooling, you might want to consider moving to that fancy neighborhood. In the end, your hand has been forced by the reckless spending of others. And there's another side to this coin. If people aren’t thrifty but instead decide to blow their cash on luxury items, there will be less money in their pockets at the end of the day. As a consequence, they'll do what they can to pay less taxes. When there’s less tax money in public coffers, public services are adversely affected, and they can deteriorate very quickly. People will then start turning to privatized amenities such as private schools or security services, which further increases inequality. But that's no reason to despair. You might think that so many push factors will only make you spend more and more – but what if there were special incentives to save? We’ll explore this possibility in the next blink. Whether you're spending or earning, you're faced with paying tax every day. Your paycheck? Income tax. That sandwich? Sales tax. You might not have thought about it but the tax system can be geared to make your life better. If properly implemented, it can reshape spending patterns. It can also ensure that taxes will be spent on infrastructure and education. In short, all the things that keep society lucky and successful. The answer lies in something called the progressive consumption tax. In tax speak, that means making savings deductible from taxation. Under this system, a family earning $100,000 a year that saves $20,000 and has deductions of $30,000 would only pay tax on the remaining $50,000. This remainder is called consumption. We should give up the current progressive income tax model in favor of a much more steeply progressive consumption tax. This means rates would start low but increase quickly if you earn more and spend more. While traditional tax systems tend to discourage savings and investment, this new system stimulates them. You will be taxed less for saving more. There is a second benefit to this new tax system. Because it’s a progressive tax plan, rich people will pay more, and this extra money can be used for public services. This is particularly important now, at a time when acquired spending patterns as well as the financial crisis have made it hard for the government to tax middle-income families. The progressive consumption tax system would have a series of knock-on effects. It would alter people’s spending patterns and money would quickly be invested in infrastructure and education. In short, by reorganizing the tax system, we would keep ourselves lucky. The richer and more successful would also be helping middle-income families who are under increasing pressure to make ends meet. They, in turn, will prosper. If we acknowledge the role of luck in success, we can nurture it and incorporate into our social system, making everyone lucky. The key message in this book: Without luck, success as we know it would not exist. Few of the great success stories in the arts, sports or business world would have progressed to such great heights entirely on their own. Luck plays a huge part, especially when the stakes are high. If we cut funding for public services, we will only undermine ourselves and our societies; it’s these institutions that keep us lucky and ensure that we succeed as a society. Got feedback?

Today, no project is complete without the backing of expertly interpreted large data sets. In big organizations, medicine and social work – even in small businesses and sports agencies – number crunching is used to discover hidden connections between seemingly unrelated things. In these blinks, you’ll discover how number crunching is the ultimate skill for facilitating decision making, and you’ll be introduced to its many different uses. You’ll also learn how to to invest in good wines; how number crunching can detect auction fraud; and how data sets shape policies. Super crunching might sound like something from a video game, but it refers to the statistical analysis of large data sets – and its applications are nearly endless. Let’s start with some surprising examples. Super crunching can be used to predict the future quality of vintage wine – indispensable knowledge for wine dealers. A high-quality red wine is an investment because it gets better as time goes on. This means wine dealers need to be able to predict a wine’s future value.  Orley Ashenfelter, an economist and wine enthusiast, has found a way to accurately predict the quality of Bordeaux wines by analyzing historical relationships between weather and the price of wine. Ashenfelter has found that each centimeter of winter rain raises the expected price of a wine by 0.00117 dollars. His analysis is so accurate that wine dealers now use it to determine whether or not they should buy a wine, and at what price. Super crunching can also be applied to baseball. Bill James, a baseball writer, has done for baseball what Ashenfelter did for wine.  James challenged the assumption that baseball experts could assess talent simply by watching the players. He postulated that data-based analysis of players’ previous form in the game would be superior – and he was right! Traditional talent scouts had little faith in Jeremy Brown, an aspiring player who was overweight, but James’s calculations said otherwise. The Oakland A’s decided to sign Brown based on James’s analysis of his past runs and the decision turned out to be a wise one: Jeremy Brown had his major league debut in September 2006. Most people feel that statistics are rather dry, but what if statistics could help you find true love or detect fraud? Regression, a powerful super crunching technique, can do both of these things. Regression is about assessing historical data to determine how different factors influence a certain variable of interest. It worked in the wine and baseball examples. Let’s look in more detail at two further ways it can be applied.  Regression can be used to predict future events, such as compatibility in a potential relationship. The dating site eHarmony uses regression to determine which of its users are likely to form long-lasting partnerships. For eHarmony, the variable is romantic compatibility, and that variable is influenced by a number of emotional, social and cognitive factors within each person. eHarmony uses regression to produce an equation that determines how these factors fit together most effectively. They assess which combinations of personality traits have fit best together in the past, and use that data to predict compatibility in the future.  This is how eHarmony can produce a very accurate statistical analysis of which of their users you’re likely to find romantically compatible. Regression can also be used to analyze events or patterns in the past, which is crucial for detecting something like fraud. In the 1990s, con artists began using a new strategy in auctions for public construction projects in New York. Bidders were supposed to place secret bids for the lowest price they were willing to complete a project for, and then the lowest bid would be revealed at a public bid disclosure before being granted the building contract. But fraudsters started using bribery to find out what the lowest bid was, then placing their own bid just below it. In the end, the author was able to expose the fraud by using regression on the auction data. Super crunching isn’t just about analyzing the future and past – it’s also changing the medical and business worlds. Randomized testing, a powerful super crunching technique, is already reshaping medical and business research. Randomized trials are crucial for determining whether or not a medical treatment is effective. Let’s say you wanted to find out whether chemotherapy is more effective than radiation in treating cancer. You’d probably have to control for a number of factors, like the patient’s diet, age or lifestyle habits. Otherwise those small variables could impact the outcome of your research, like if, for example, more people in the chemotherapy treatment group smoked than their counterparts in the radiation group. To solve this problem, you’d most likely use a large, randomized study because there, patients are randomly assigned to the two different treatment groups. Regarding the patient’s smoking habits, for instance, you could trust that roughly the same proportion of smokers would show up in both the group treated with chemotherapy and the group treated with radiation, as long as those groups were big enough. So in this case randomization makes the two groups “identical” in terms of smoking, allowing you to more confidently gauge the effect of the treatment. That’s why randomized testing has become such a fundamental tool in medical research. Businesses can even use randomized testing to determine their marketing strategies.  How do you know if one webpage design attracts more customers than another? The company Offermatica uses randomized testing software to answer that by randomly displaying one design or another when users visit your page. Offermatica’s software can tell you in real time which page design is getting more click-throughs and which is generating more purchases. That kind of randomization can enhance your site’s performance and help you determine which marketing strategies work best.  Want to influence society? Run a randomized experiment! Randomized testing is changing more than our medicine and businesses – it’s changing our public policy too. Politicians can use data generated through randomized trials to decide what policies to enact. In fact, policy experiments are already underway in a number of countries. The Move to Opportunity experiment, which is currently being conducted in five American cities, is one such example. It’s designed to help policymakers determine if poor families benefit from receiving housing vouchers – rental assistance that allows them to relocate to middle class neighborhoods. Researchers will follow the families for ten years from the point when they started receiving the vouchers, measuring the impact vouchers have on areas of their lives, like employment, education, health and crime. The results still aren’t in, but the data generated from the experiment will provide policymakers with valuable and concrete information about the benefits of moving a family from one neighborhood to another. Randomized trials can also be used in global economic development projects. The Poverty Action Lab at MIT, for example, uses randomized tests in developing countries to try to fight poverty. The lab has run dozens of randomized tests on issues highly important to the developing world, like public health measures and micro-lending. The NGO can use small, randomized pilot studies to see if it’s worthwhile to implement the same strategies on a bigger scale or apply them to an entire country. Randomized testing is reshaping the way politics operates in the world today. We’ve seen some examples of how super crunching is already reshaping our world, but what role do humans play in all this? Can mathematical equations really tell us more than traditional experts, with their years of experience and human intuition? The answer is yes. Super crunching outperforms traditional expertise in almost every case. A psychologist named Paul Meehl started investigating this as early as 1954, with the publication of his book Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction. Meehl researched around 20 empirical studies, and compared the predictions of “clinical” experts with relatively simple statistical models. He researched a wide range of predictions, including how well schizophrenics would respond to electroshock therapy and how prisoners would benefit from parole. Meehl found that none of the predictions by human experts were better than their statistical counterparts. He completed a similar analysis before his death in 2003, surveying 136 different man-versus-machine studies. Out of the 136 cases, there were only eight where experts were considerably more accurate than statistical models. So experts are losing out to super crunching in nearly every field. Why? Well, super crunching is superior to human analysis because all humans are affected by personal bias. That’s why we pay more attention and give more weight to statistically unusual events. People systematically overestimate the probability of extreme deaths, such as murder, for example, because of the way murder is sensationalized in the media. Most people would assume that keeping a gun in your house puts your children at risk, but a swimming pool is almost 100 times more likely to kill a child than a gun is.  This doesn’t mean that traditional experts have become irrelevant, however. It just means that their roles have changed.  Lots of experts who base their decisions on personal experience and intuition feel threatened by the rise of super crunching. After all, it seems to undermine their work. Super crunching actually threatens a whole range of professionals. Loan officers, for example, are completely irrelevant now. Being a loan officer at a bank used to be a fairly high status position. Loan officers were paid well and had the power to decide who did or didn’t qualify for loans. Today, those decisions are made at central offices and based on statistical algorithms. Looking a customer in the eye and building a trusting relationship with them aren’t very accurate ways of determining whether or not they’ll pay back a loan. Statistical equations are much better for that. In this case, human input just isn’t necessary anymore. Human experts aren’t useless, however. Instead of forgoing traditional expertise, we can combine it with super crunching to produce even more accurate predictions and analysis. In fact, traditional experts make much better decisions when they’re provided with data generated through super crunching. And experts still have to determine which variables should be included in statistical analysis. Super crunching can mathematically test a hypothesis, but a human needs to come up with that hypothesis in the first place. Several studies suggest that traditional expertise is most effective when combined with statistical algorithms. Essentially, expert opinion should be used to bolster the credibility of statistical analysis, not the other way around.  The key message in this book: Large data sets can be crunched to create meaningful guidance for real-world decisions. Statistics can predict the future and uncover the past in a way that human judgment, clouded by emotions and personal bias, simply can’t. Super Crunchers are already revolutionizing society, and traditional experts will have to adapt to work with super crunching, not against it. Ultimately, statistics are a powerful tool for understanding and reshaping the world in ways that are better for everyone. Actionable advice: Collect and crunch your own data. More and more businesses are starting to generate their own data by running randomized tests – a critical tool for data-driven decision making. Don’t fall behind! For example, you can determine which of two advertising slogans is more effective at catching your customers’ attention by placing them on your company’s website at random and crunching data about click-throughs or the time visitors spend on your page. That information is invaluable. Suggested further reading: Carrots and Sticks by Ian Ayres Carrots and Sticks (2010) is the bible of behavior, incentives and self-control.

They feel they have to choose between a high-paying, reputable job and one that’s altruistic, where they can make a real difference in the world. Thankfully, a new type of company has emerged which combines both of these qualities. Vanguard companies such as IBM, Procter & Gamble and Banco Real are profitable businesses that contribute to community projects, environmental protection and products and campaigns that promote the universal values of trust, tolerance and innovation. In these blinks, you’ll learn how big business and altruism can work hand in hand; why investing in good causes is profitable for companies; and how vanguard companies replace hierarchy with human relationships. When you drive past a giant factory with clouds of toxins billowing from its smokestacks, you probably don’t get a warm feeling in your heart. These days, it’s common for people to cite corporations as a primary cause for many of the world’s problems. On any given day, you can read headlines about the growing obesity epidemic in the West, food shortages in Africa, oil spills in the oceans and rampant corruption – all of which can be traced back to greedy multinational corporations led by immoral CEOs with a lust for money that surpasses any concern for the well-being of the planet. However, a new generation of businesses is emerging. They’re known as vanguard companies, and they have a socially conscious business model that is both financially savvy and eco-friendly. Vanguard companies differ from non-profit organizations in that they don’t exist solely to take on issues like clean water or public housing. Make no mistake, these companies are competitive and out to make a profit, but they use their strong business sense to find solutions for social issues. For vanguard companies, being socially conscious is part of business practice. So they do more than simply make charitable donations, though this could also be a part of their business model. And this business model is especially popular with those born in the 1980s and 1990s, the so-called millennials. This generation is eager to prove that you can both earn a big paycheck and make the world a better place. This attitude isn’t without its precedents. IBM has a long history of helping communities recover from natural disasters. In 2004, the company responded to the tsunami that killed nearly a quarter of a million people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and India. A group of IBM employees rallied to provide technology that would expedite the delivery of relief supplies and speed up the recovery process. No one was forcing them to take action – they had the means to make a positive impact and simply saw it as the right thing to do. You don’t have to be a business analyst to know that this century has gotten off to a bumpy and chaotic start. There have been plenty of economic hiccups and hang-ups, the most obvious being the massive financial crisis of 2008, which spread from America and brought the global financial system to its knees. Today, it’s easy for economic crises to quickly spread across the globe. There are two major reasons for this: the rapidity with which technology continues to evolve and the increasing reliance of businesses on foreign suppliers. However, vanguard companies have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to rapid changes and remain unfazed by a volatile and unreliable economy. They accomplish this by focusing on company culture. Let’s look at the digital marketing company Digitas, which was originally based in Boston. Since the 1990s, they have specialized in helping large traditional corporations adapt to the digital era. At first, everything went smoothly. They received great capital support and expanded throughout the United States and abroad. A few years in, their shares were worth $40. But after 9/11 and the dot-com bubble burst of 2001, that price fell to a measly 88 cents per share. Digitas’s CEO, David Kenny, recognized how unreliable the marketplace had become, so he decided to focus on aspects of his company that were reliable: its values and corporate culture. To strengthen these aspects, Kenny issued a voice mail to his employees each week. These messages honestly addressed the instability of the market and how it affected the company, for example, if lay-offs had to be considered. In so doing, Kenny’s voice mails built trust and helped connect the employees to the executives. They also did an amazing job of uniting the employees as a team ready to face adversity. Meanwhile, Kenny built strong relationships with tech giants such as Microsoft and Yahoo, alliances that allowed Digitas to stay on the cutting edge of technological changes. Kenny’s intelligent maneuvering kept Digitas afloat during the tough times and kept the employees committed to the company’s cause. Any company can write a high-minded mission statement. But saying that your company cares about the environment or the betterment of mankind isn’t enough. As everyone knows, actions speak louder than words. A vanguard company is well aware of this, and all of their actions are therefore based on positive values and core principles. This can even turn a troubled business into a thriving vanguard company. That’s what happened when the Brazilian bank, Banco Real, was experiencing stagnation and hired a new CEO named Fabio Barbosa. Barbosa began revitalizing Banco Real by giving it a new identity. He improved values and made social and environmental responsibility the focus of corporate culture. The bank started taking action by improving its own local environment and cleaning up the alley along the side of its headquarters in Sao Paulo. Alleys like these were a common problem in Brazil. Poverty and crime were often on dismaying display. So Banco Real’s employees volunteered to turn the alley into a brightly lit garden with two kiosks that would offer employment to disenfranchised young adults. Barbosa made sure that Banco Real’s commitment to helping the community went further than updating its website or printing out some flyers announcing good intentions. The values became so fundamentally ingrained that they informed everything the bank did. And this is what vanguard companies do: they live according to their values and culture. What’s so amazing, though, is that this approach leads to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. When companies stick to their values, they’re recognized as being trustworthy, which makes them attractive to customers and investors. Indeed, in the years after Barbosa came aboard, Banco Real far outpaced its rivals. Between 2001 and 2006, profits steadily increased by 20 percent each year. Today’s unpredictable economy, along with the ever-changing and competitive marketplace, has made innovation a business imperative. The company that stops cooking up new ideas will quickly fall behind. But vanguard companies never feel pressured to innovate, since innovation is simply one of their core characteristics. After all, vanguard companies are committed to making the world a better place, a mission that goes hand in hand with constant creativity. Let’s look at IBM again. Naturally, part of a computer company’s mission is to innovate – but this innovation can be social as well as technological. In 1994, they saw an opportunity to innovate in education and develop the technology needed to do so. They began a partnership with K-12 public schools to help them tackle some of their everyday problems. For instance, the partnership produced a tool called Watch-Me!-Read, software that aims to help children improve their reading. Procter & Gamble (P&G), a global leader in consumer products, is another vanguard company. However, there were years when the P&G branch in Brazil, which specialized in the company’s feminine hygiene products, was only earning tiny revenues. The path to fixing the problem was clear. They had a main product – the Always brand of panty liners. They just needed to devise a way to cut production costs while simultaneously increasing output. To find the solution, P&G Brazil began a process of collaboration across all of their departments as well as inviting input from their external partners, such as their trade partners and advertising agencies. Together, they came up with an innovative idea: the packaging would be transparent with colorful wrapping inside. By eliminating the outer packaging, they greatly reduced the cost of ink per package and, sure enough, within a year, the product was earning far greater profits. During the industrial revolution, efficiency meant establishing an authoritarian hierarchy at the workplace, which emphasized tireless work with little regard for individuality. There are organizations that still operate under this model, but many businesses are now offering their employees more personal freedom. At most vanguard companies, employees are allowed to find the work-life balance that fits for them. They’re offered flexible schedules and the option to work from home. This establishes a trust between the managers at vanguard companies and their employees. By providing them with more freedom, employers entrust employees with the responsibilities of motivating themselves, performing well and following the company’s mission for social change. Every day, 40 percent of IBM’s workforce operates away from the office, with some working from a customer’s home or office, a plane or from the comfort of their own home. Not only does this flexibility ensure that employees feel comfortable and therefore able to do their best work; it makes the company an attractive place to work. If someone prefers the quiet of their home, they’re free to work there. And if someone is a single parent, their flexibility will allow them to work around their child’s schedule so they can pick them up from school or day care. Many vanguard companies also empower their employees with decision-making authority, creating a more horizontal or flat chain of command. They’ve discovered that progress can be hindered when employees have to wait for their boss to approve something. Having to follow this traditional structure can also cause employees to always only think about what’s best for their manager instead of what’s best for the company. So vanguard companies will not only give managers decision-making authority, employees will also have the power to move things forward, make choices and speak to customers on behalf of the company. If you were to travel back to the industrial era, you’d find companies staffed with more or less one kind of employee. Back then, there was no sense of diversity in the workplace. But we live in a globalized economy now, and vanguard companies know that a diverse workforce will help them better understand the cultures of the various nations they’re operating in. Vanguard companies embrace the fact that different kinds of people exist. They know it’s important to understand the differences between people, because for example, that might mean understanding emerging social issues in a new market. Of course, understanding a new environment before you enter it can help you avoid the risk of ruining your chances before you’ve established your presence. Let’s say your company wants to expand into India or China. A vanguard company would reach out to these communities and hire people familiar with the market before expanding. What they wouldn’t do is send out an all-American envoy, thinking it’s business as usual. To ensure your company has diversity awareness, you can see to it that employees know to respect the differences that exist among different groups and individuals. Such awareness is crucial to a well-functioning vanguard company as it eases interaction and collaboration and makes it easier to function as a singular entity and move beyond cultural or social differences. When Banco Real made its changes and became a vanguard company, they formed a “diversity committee” and held events that highlighted the differences between the employees that were already working there. For example, at one event, all the employees wrote a descriptive adjective that best described them on a name tag. So some people were labeled “goofy” or “anxious,” making it clear that each person was different and unique. If you’re hoping to take your company to the vanguard, you won’t get far without an enlightened workforce that can take your business to those limitless heights. The key message in this book: Making money and making the world a better place don’t have to be in opposition with one another.  This is what vanguard companies have discovered by placing socially conscious values at the center of their business plans. But they don’t just say one thing and do another; every step they take is informed by their commitment to those values and to being a force of good in their community. Got feedback?

What about the one with Henry Fonda as a young Rutherford B. Hayes? Of course you haven’t! When it comes to American presidents worthy of screen time, no one springs to mind quicker than Abraham Lincoln. Even today, over 150 years after his death, Lincoln continues to dominate American popular culture. But what is it that makes his legacy so strong? These blinks, based on the eponymous bestselling biography, take a deeper look at Lincoln’s life and career. They show how his political genius, ability to inspire and strength of vision changed the United States forever.  You will also learn why Lincoln’s father used to burn his books; how Lincoln came out of nowhere to win the 1860 election; and why Lincoln waited on the Emancipation Proclamation. You might be familiar with the story of Abraham Lincoln being born in a log cabin and learning to read by candlelight. But his early years were filled with many more significant hardships. Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, and, as soon as he was able, he was put to work on the farm by his father, Thomas Lincoln. Young Abraham would help his father chop down and split trees, dig wells and plow fields. His father was illiterate and often at odds with Abraham’s desire to educate himself. Thomas was even known to burn Abraham’s books so as to keep young Abraham from being distracted from getting his work done. If there was one admirable trait Thomas passed on to Abraham, it was his love of storytelling and keeping friends entertained with a good anecdote. While he didn’t get along with his father, Abraham had a loving relationship with his mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln. Though little is known about Nancy Hanks, she was by all accounts a smart, strong-willed woman who helped teach Abraham to read and write. Sadly, tragedy first struck the Lincoln family when Abraham was nine years old and his mother died of “milk sickness,” a poisoning contracted from contaminated dairy. The death further strained the relationship between Abraham and his father. More tragedy followed when, less than ten years later, Abraham’s sister, Sarah, died during childbirth. And to make matters worse, his first love, Ann Rutledge, died in 1835, likely of typhoid fever. But these hardships didn’t break young Lincoln’s spirit. Instead, they toughened his resolve and strengthened his ambitions. His stepmother, Sarah Bush Lincoln, helped nurture his self-confidence and encouraged his education despite his father’s attitude. To his stepmother and all of Lincoln’s friends, it was clear that he had a spark of greatness that transcended the poverty and misfortune of his surroundings. And so, in April of 1837, Lincoln moved to Springfield, Illinois, to start a career in law. During his law career, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1834. The following decades (1840s and 1850s) turned out to be combative ones for the United States. But many politicians were making a name for themselves by debating the issues. The most pressing political issue was slavery. The United States continued to expand as western territories were established. Consequently, there was a strong national divide between the northern “free states” and southern “slave states” as to whether new territories such as California or New Mexico should allow slavery. Another big point of contention was the controversial Fugitive Slave Law, which required escaped slaves to be sent back to their masters, even if they sought refuge in a free state. In an effort to defuse increasing tensions, The Compromise of 1850 was passed, keeping slavery out of California but strengthening the Fugitive Slave Law. Any palliative effect the compromise had was only temporary, as the debates started up again in 1854 in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed these territories to decide for themselves whether slavery should be allowed. This decision effectively repealed a previous statute that stated slavery would not be allowed north of the state of Missouri. This turn of events lit a fire under Abraham Lincoln’s political career and he became more active in his campaign against the spread of slavery. The reignited debates ended up being the reason for the creation of the Republican Party in 1854. The prominent political parties at the time, the Whigs and Democrats, were so divided on the issue that the anti-slavery advocates decided to band together as Republicans. Ohio statesman Salmon Chase was among the party’s high-profile members. He made headlines as one of the most outspoken anti-slavery advocates and became the nation’s first Republican governor. After Lincoln’s Whig Party split apart, he joined the Republicans along with New York Senator William Henry Seward and prominent St. Louis statesman Edward Bates. As leaders of the Republican Party, these men became rival candidates leading up to the 1860 presidential election. It may come as a surprise, but Lincoln wasn’t initially the top choice when it came to picking a Republican nominee for the election of 1860. Lincoln had had a comparatively modest and brief career in politics compared to the other candidates. First, there was William Henry Seward, who was considered an expert politician. His exuberant personality made him well suited to his career as a lawyer. His enthralling senate speeches – considered the “rallying cries” for the Republican movement – made headlines around the country. It also didn’t hurt that his long-time advisor was Thurlow Tweed, the prototypical political boss and campaign manager. Then there was Salmon Chase, a trailblazer for the anti-slavery cause. Chase had made a name for himself in many high-profile cases by defending escaped slaves and fighting against the Fugitive Slave Law. Though he would lose these cases, the language he used to claim that the law was unconstitutional would serve as a part of the Republican Party’s foundation. Finally, Edward Bates was one of the most esteemed candidates up for nomination. At 66 years of age, Bates certainly had seniority over the other candidates. By 1860, he’d already had a long and storied law career in St. Louis and was a veteran of the War of 1812. On top of that, he was one of the men who drafted the state constitution of Missouri and was considered a national advocate for mending the division between North and South. Meanwhile, all Lincoln had to offer was a humble law career and two failed bids at the Illinois state senate in 1854 and 1858. So it’s no surprise that he wasn’t initially a front-runner for the Republican nomination. In fact, none of Lincoln’s rivals for the nomination considered him a threat. But, while the others were resting on their laurels, Lincoln was out building up momentum. In 1858, Lincoln had his first taste of national exposure in the now legendary Lincoln-Douglas debates. Though he ended up losing the senate race to Douglas, he did win the popular vote. Plus, the speeches he gave in those debates would go on to be published and studied in debate classes for years to come. Prior to the Republican Convention in 1860, Lincoln campaigned all over the north, including the important New England states, giving captivating and eloquent speeches that perfectly laid out the Republican agenda. Lincoln remained clear and consistent with his anti-slavery stance and showed a willingness to work with the south and border states to resolve the issue. Perhaps most importantly, throughout his career he made friends, not enemies, wherever he went. Seward and Chase, on the other hand, were overly confident and did not feel the need to campaign. Seward decided to go on a tour of Europe in 1859 rather than campaign for votes. Chase could have capitalized on his absence, but he felt that he deserved the nomination for the work he’d already done. Both of these candidates had always been ambitious in their careers and this meant that they had stepped on more than a few toes on their way up the political ladder. In other words, both candidates had enemies in prominent positions within the Republican Party. For Bates, it may have been a crucial last-minute error that took away his chances. Unlike Lincoln, Bates was inconsistent when asked to clarify his stance on slavery. Bates responded by being dismissive of the subject, preferring to talk about more unifying issues like the economy. Bates felt the issue of slavery was causing too much agitation and even suggested that politicians were engaging with it for their own political benefit.  There’s little doubt the Republican party wasn’t happy with his statement. All this led to Lincoln surprising his rivals and winning the nomination at the convention. Lincoln’s victory in the 1860 presidential election was the greatest testimony to his intelligence as a politician to date. And when the time came to pick the members of his presidential cabinet, Lincoln kept thinking responsibly. When selecting the department heads of his administration, his strategy was clear: to pick the men who were most qualified for the job, regardless of whether they had been Democrats or Whigs. This meant turning to his rivals: Chase, Seward and Bates. Lincoln gave Seward the prominent position of Secretary of State, made the esteemed Edward Bates his Attorney General and named Salmon Chase the head of the Treasury Department. For the other positions, he continued to select a healthy mix of important politicians. To represent the influential state of Pennsylvania, he appointed former Democrat Simon Cameron as Secretary of War and Kentucky-born Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General. The Blair family had been a powerful force in the Democratic party. With these surprising choices, Lincoln created a team of rivals. Rather than taking the common path of choosing close friends and allies who would blindly support him in his opinions, Lincoln chose a group of smart and ambitious people who could voice their diverse perspectives on issues to help him make the best choices.  Lincoln believed this mix of people could help him reunite the North and South, but he didn’t realize how dire the situation would quickly become. Immediately following Lincoln’s election, the Great Secession Winter began. South Carolina voted to secede from the Union, citing the election of a “Black Republican” as the tipping point. Further exacerbating Southern grievances were political efforts to prevent slavery from spreading to new territories and attempts to nullify the Fugitive Slave Law. This move was quickly followed by Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Texas. Lincoln’s presidential inauguration was on March 4, 1861. Relations between the North and South were already so bad that newspapers were calling Lincoln “the first president of the Northern Confederacy.” It wasn’t the best way to start, but Lincoln was up for whatever challenge came his way. And the first one landed on his desk the following day. Lincoln received an urgent letter informing him that South Carolina’s Fort Sumter had been cut off from supplies and was in danger of being taken over by Southern Confederates. Lincoln needed to make a decision: send reinforcements and risk further agitation or surrender the fort which could be seen as a sign of weakness. Lincoln didn’t act hastily. He understood the significance of this first conflict and reached out to his cabinet members for their opinions. At first, only Seward opposed reinforcing Fort Sumter, feeling it would be better to take the hit and focus on saving other Southern outposts. In the end, Lincoln attempted to send reinforcements but the plan went badly when conflicting orders were accidentally sent out. Although the mistake was caught and revised plans were dispatched, Confederate authorities intercepted the revised message and ordered a strike on Sumter before the reinforcements could arrive. Fort Sumter was surrendered on April 13 and Lincoln took full blame for the outcome of the failed mission. Throughout Lincoln’s presidency, his colleagues marveled at his magnanimous nature, his willingness to accept responsibility, and his ability to forgive others for their faults. After the fall of Fort Sumter, Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas and Tennessee seceded from the Union and the United States was on the verge of civil war. The first blood was spilled in Baltimore on April 19, 1861, after a Massachusetts regiment was attacked while passing through. The northern Union was trying to mobilize troops as they quickly realized they were quite unprepared for war. The Union had little in the way of weapons, uniforms or horses. Lincoln urged Chase and Cameron to quickly and efficiently get the Union military into fighting shape.  A bloody conflict between the North and South now appeared inevitable. But Lincoln saw an opportunity to unite the hearts and minds of the North by addressing Congress on July 4, 1861. He made it explicit to everyone that this war was not just about slavery but, much more, about fighting to keep the very idea of democracy alive. Unfortunately for Lincoln, it would take some time before he would find the right general to lead his army and match his spirit. The First Battle of Bull Run took place in Virginia on July 21, 1861. The battle was so close to Washington D.C. that it could be heard by residents in the city. But Confederate Gen. Thomas J. Jackson proved too much for the Union soldiers, sending them running in retreat and earning himself the nickname “Stonewall Jackson.” To try and rally the troops, Lincoln put General George McClellan in charge. He did well to organize the army but made the grave mistake of constantly overestimating the size of the Confederate army, often claiming there were twice as many troops as there actually were. As a result, he refused orders from Lincoln and the Secretary of War to advance his troops, instead stalling and asking for more troops. This led to more defeats outside of Richmond, VA and in the Second Battle of Bull Run where his delay in providing reinforcements caused 10,000 casualties. Lincoln knew changes had to be made and he looked to his own cabinet first. Cameron proved unreliable, and his Department of War was rife with corruption. Cameron was unaware that associates had been pocketing contract money and wasting public funds. He was replaced by Edwin Stanton, a former Democrat and US Attorney General, who would remain in the position for the next six years. Lincoln knew it was time to take drastic action. He’d heard that the Confederate armies were using slaves to help their efforts and, for months, the question of whether to enlist black soldiers in the Union army was being debated among his cabinet. So, in July of 1862, Lincoln presented the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet. As an executive order in a time of war, it would allow Lincoln to circumvent Congress. With one blow, he could strike down the Fugitive Slave Law and declare the 3 to 4 million slaves in the United States free, as well as being eligible to serve in the army. Seward wisely cautioned Lincoln against announcing the proclamation immediately, pointing out that, in the midst of all their losses, the proposal would come off as a last ditch effort and add to the Union’s low morale. Lincoln took his advice and patiently waited for a Union victory. Finally, following victory at the Battle of Antietam, the opportunity had arrived. On September 17, 1862, Confederate General Robert E. Lee advanced into Union territory and forced General McClellan to take action. A horrific battle ensued, with over 20,000 casualties. Lee eventually retreated, but McClellan once again stalled, failing to advance on Lee’s troops, allowing them to regroup. It was McClellan’s last action as Union general. Stanton considered him a traitor and Lincoln finally had him relieved from duty. But the victory at Antietam was what the Union needed after many crushing defeats. At the beginning of 1863, Lincoln announced that he would enact the Emancipation Proclamation. More success soon followed and Lincoln found a general he thought could lead the Union to victory. General Ulysses S. Grant was proving to be the Union’s best asset in a western campaign where he laid claim to the Mississippi River and divided the Confederate army. Thanks to his victories, and a hard-fought win at the Battle of Gettysburg, the war was finally shifting in the Union’s favor. Sure enough, at the beginning of 1863, Lincoln remained true to his word and issued the Emancipation Proclamation. A regiment of 180,000 black soldiers formed to help fight a war that was still costing the country many lives. The ongoing horrors of the war, including the 50,000 casualties at Gettysburg, meant that Lincoln’s reelection was far from a sure thing. But Lincoln and his administration would make an important decision that would help bring the war to a close. The Battle of Chicamauga was an intense two-day fight that took place in September of 1863. The Confederates lost over 18,000 troops and the Union just over 16,000. But, although the Union lost, they managed to hang on to the important city of Chattanooga. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton immediately jumped at the chance to take advantage of this. Calling an emergency session with Lincoln and the rest of the cabinet, he proposed a plan to quickly send 20,000 troops to reinforce Chattanooga and launch a new offensive before the Confederacy could regroup. With the cooperation of the railroad department, Stanton ensured that his plan could be carried out within seven days. Lincoln approved, and put General Grant in charge of the new offensive. Stanton’s plan – which was considered one of the fastest mobilizations in military history up till that point – was a success. Union forces pushed confederate troops out of Tennessee. Meanwhile, not sensing that Lincoln’s administration was inching the Union towards a victory over the Confederates, the Democrats were launching a misguided campaign against Lincoln. With former General McClellan as their candidate, they proposed making peace with the South at any cost. But just three days after the Democrats announced this platform, Union General William T. Sherman won a crucial victory for the North, taking the city of Atlanta. This was quickly followed by the navy’s capture of the Confederate port of Mobile Bay. These victories crippled the Democrats’ policy of compromise and secured Lincoln’s reelection. With his second term underway, Lincoln once again showcased his remarkable goodwill and loyalty to his colleagues. Lincoln was aware that his ambitious Secretary of Treasury, Salmon Chase, had been campaigning for his own shot at the presidency during the recent elections. But Chase finally overstepped his bounds when he refused to acknowledge mistakes made while appointing friends within his own department. Lincoln accepted Chase’s resignation, but, as always, he was wise not to ruin what had been a fruitful relationship. Lincoln took the opportunity to appoint Chase as a Chief Justice in the US Supreme Court. His goodwill to those who would even conspire behind his back never went unnoticed. Seward once proclaimed that, “his magnanimity is almost superhuman.” Meanwhile, Lincoln could see the end of the war approaching. And he knew that, in order to keep his Emancipation Proclamation alive during peacetime, he would have to push a constitutional amendment through Congress. On January 6, 1865, he introduced the Thirteenth Amendment to abolish slavery once and for all. Lincoln met individually with important members of Congress to stress the positive effect the amendment would have on ending the war and breaking the spirit of the Confederacy. And with the help of assistants campaigning on the amendment’s behalf, he secured the five Democratic votes needed to push it through Congress. During these first few months of 1865, representatives from both sides of the war, including Lincoln, were meeting to discuss an end to the war. Unfortunately, neither side was willing to compromise and the final battles of the war continued. General Sherman succeeded in capturing the cities of Columbia, South Carolina, and Charleston, North Carolina. And, finally, on April 2, 1865, Union troops defeated General Lee in the Battle for Petersburg, leading Confederacy leaders to flee their capital, Richmond, Virginia. To mark this occasion, Lincoln triumphantly walked the streets of Richmond, Virginia, surrounded by cheering former slaves. The war was drawing to a close, and on April 9, Lee finally surrendered his 28,000 troops to Grant. Following the surrender of Lee’s troops, Lincoln gave a rousing speech from the White House, expressing his hopefulness to quickly return the southern states to the Union and heal the wounds of the nation. In the crowd that day was John Wilkes Booth and two of his fellow conspirators, Lewis Powell and George Atzerodt. The three men had hatched a plan to kidnap Lincoln and exchange him for Confederate prisoners of war. But after hearing Lincoln’s speech, and being so enraged by the idea of former slaves getting citizenship, Booth changed the plan to kill Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward. The plan was set into motion on April 14, 1865, as Lincoln was watching the play Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theater. Booth, a professional actor familiar with the theater, showed his card and gained entrance to Lincoln’s seating box. Booth fired one shot into the back of Lincoln’s head. Major William Rathbone, also seated in the box, tried to grab him, but Booth took out a knife, slashed Rathbone across the chest and jumped from the box to the stage below. Meanwhile, Lewis Powell gained entrance to Steward’s house, slashing and stabbing his way through the home, severely injuring many other people before he found the bedridden Seward. Powell stabbed Seward in the face but, luckily, Seward had just undergone surgery due to a near-fatal carriage accident. The metal used to repair his jaw likely saved his life. George Atzerodt backed out of his part in the plan to kill Andrew Johnson. Kidnapping was one thing, but he was not a murderer. Abraham Lincoln died the next morning and the entire nation, including the south, lost a valuable friend. Both Ulysses S. Grant and the southern-born Montgomery Blair heard the news and felt that it was a tragic blow to the reconstruction of the United States. Blair said, “Those of southern sympathies know they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again.” The key message in this book: Part of the political genius of Abraham Lincoln was how he chose the members of his cabinet. He knew he could make the best decisions for the country by surrounding himself with his political rivals, i.e., people who disagreed with him and each other, but who represented the best minds to explore all sides of an issue.

Friedman","summary":"We live in quickly evolving times. Think back to 2007, the year the first iPhone came out: could you have predicted back then that the world would have become so reliant on mobile technology, apps and globalization? Unlike generations before us, people alive today must constantly adapt and readapt to rapid changes in technology, society and the economy. The good news is that some people have found ways to harness this new reality to improve the human condition. Technology-induced globalization means scientists from all over the world can share big, innovative ideas at breakneck speed, helping us tackle problems like the gradual dwindling of natural resources and climate change. Meanwhile, social media in forms such as Twitter allows individual citizens to discuss problems that they have in common with others, thus helping us come together as societies, nations and communities. In these blinks, you’ll learn how technology has contributed to – and accelerated – globalization; why no one uses MySpace anymore; and what Moore’s Law is, and why it’s important. Do you remember what 2007 was like? You might not have realized it, but that year was a turning point in human history. In fact, a great disruption occurred in 2007, in which three accelerating forces – technology, markets and climate change – all ramped up. By way of example, 2007 was the year the iPhone hit shelves, when Twitter reached a global scale and when Airbnb was created in a San Francisco apartment. Not only that, but from January 2007 to December 2014, mobile data traffic through AT&T’s national wireless network rose by over 100,000 percent! A useful theory to explain this remarkable transformation is Moore’s Law, which holds that the processing power of microchips will double approximately every two years, a  truly astounding rate of growth. In 2007, the technological acceleration described by Moore’s law contributed to, and coincided with, accelerations in the market, evidenced by increased global commerce, rapidly growing social networks and an information tsunami. At the same time, mother nature was experiencing an acceleration in the form of climate change and population explosions. So, what does that all mean for life on Earth? Put simply, it means that this is a time of constant adaptation. If prior epochs of history were characterized by occasional destabilization, the modern world is one of near-constant destabilization; humans must constantly reevaluate their ecosystem, remaining agile in order to adapt to a rapidly changing world. That doesn’t mean you can’t attain stability in today’s world. But rather than a static stability, you can expect a dynamic stability, like the one you experience while riding a bike. It’s not the kind of stability that lets you stand still, but it will keep you afloat if you stay in motion. It sounds tough, and living in this state will require adaptation – but while it may not be natural, it’s the reality humans now face. In the blinks that follow, you’ll learn more about the specific forms of accelerations at hand and how you can keep pace in a world that’s moving faster than ever. The author can remember working as a journalist abroad in 1978, when he had to wait in line for a British telephone to send news stories back to his editors in the United States. But today, he could just as easily send an email from Britain, or even Africa, and it could be published nearly instantaneously on the New York Times website. In fact, technology evolves so rapidly that, while conducting research for this book, the author had to interview each of the technologists he consulted at least twice just to stay up to speed. It’s clear that such growth isn’t natural and we can already see it disrupting the world. For instance, a few years back, digitization disrupted dairy farms in upstate New York. For decades before that, milking cows involved manual labor on the part of farm workers, but now computers are increasingly being used to control and monitor udders, supply chains and milk flow. As a result, the successful cow milkers of tomorrow may not match the image we often envision of a farmer sloshing around in the mud; the farmers of tomorrow may actually be sharply dressed data analysts. Now, this could be good news. After all, digitizing milking means fresher milk and less manual labor; but it’s also a depressing thought. It perfectly encapsulates a major problem, namely that countless mid-level jobs are disappearing and being supplanted by software programs and a few lowly laborers. Just take a study done by the University of Oxford in 2013, which found that a whopping 47 percent of American jobs are at very high risk of being supplanted by computers in the next 20 years. Beyond that, technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that it becomes obsolete every five to seven years. Consider Blackberry smartphones or MySpace – can you think of anyone who uses either of them anymore? Probably not, but just ten years ago they were both the height of popularity. It just goes to show that such changes aren’t always visible in day-to-day life, but thinking back a few years can quickly illustrate how shockingly fast technology is developing. The globalized market isn’t just about manufacturing and trading goods; it’s also about exchanging information and making financial transactions online. Consider the flow of data through Facebook, the exchanges between renters and travelers on Airbnb and the incessant stream of opinions on Twitter. Such global digital flows have made the world much more interdependent on all fronts: financially, culturally and politically. For instance, when the author spoke to Facebook in May 2017, Facebook Messenger was poised to add its one billionth user. In the same year, Twitter had 328 million active users every month. That’s more than the entire US population! It’s this level of interconnectivity that enables products to go viral at a scale and speed that was unfathomable in past generations. For example, in 2012, a photo of Michelle Obama wearing a dress from the online fashion store ASOS was retweeted 816,000 times and the dress instantly sold out. So, what are the economic implications of this change? Well, it used to be that money was earned through carefully acquired knowledge; if you had valuable skills, you could deliver products or services based on those skills. As a result, an individual could get an education, enter the workforce and feel secure in her career for the rest of her life. But today, things are dramatically different. The global flows of information and commerce are much more important than any education, and things change so quickly that the most successful products today can be old news by tomorrow. Even long-established companies have had to adapt to this shift, and General Electric is a great example. Instead of relying on its own base of engineers in the United States, China, India and Israel, the company now taps into the global flows by running contests that invite ideas from all over the world. You don’t have to be a meteorologist to know that the weather has been out of control in recent years; a scorching, record-high heat index of 163 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) was recorded in a city in Iran in 2015, while traditionally frigid winter locales are experiencing milder and milder temperatures over the years. It’s a tangible reminder that climate change is here and it’s not going anywhere. You’ve already seen how the power of men, machines and flows has disrupted the workplace, politics and the economy – but these forces are also reshaping the entire biosphere. For instance, Bloomberg.com reported that the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is 35 percent higher than at its peak over the past 800,000 years; sea levels have reached their highest point in 115,000 years; and the nitrogen cycle is experiencing a more dramatic upheaval now than at any point in the last 2.5 billion years. Or take reporting from Discover magazine, which deemed July 2016 to be the hottest July on record. Since July is typically the hottest month globally, this was really the hottest of all 1,639 months ever recorded. It’s just one more sign that the global climate “sweet spot,” which has afforded humanity such a hospitable environment, is rapidly dissolving. What are the other impacts of this cataclysmic change? Well, Americans may be focused on the migration of people from the Middle East into Europe, but two-thirds of all migration comes from other places, and most frequently as a result of climate change. In fact, shifting global weather patterns, resulting in droughts in Africa, produce more migrants than any other factor or phenomenon. Terrorism, unemployment and generally frightening futures in these failing African states can be linked to worsening environmental degradation, and leads these countries’ citizens to head for European shores. To make matters worse, there’s no sign that climate change will slow down. According to the United Nations, by 2050, the world population is expected to rise from around 7.2 billion today to 9.7 billion. All those additional people will mean more cars, more homes, more water and electricity consumption and a far greater carbon footprint. To put it bluntly, over the course of two generations, humans have absolutely maxed out Earth’s ability to sustain us. In the end, accelerations are a mixed bag; some of them bear fruit while others can provoke disaster. Even so, there’s good reason to be optimistic. Technology and globalization have made it possible for anyone with a basic education and access to the internet to help humanity make collaborative decisions, while also handling the challenges these same trends produce. For instance, in 2016, the author met a man whose family founded New Media Inc., an information technology firm specializing in big data analytics and media monitoring for the Turkish government, among others. The company was founded by the man’s family in 2007 and now has 100 employees. Most of the important positions are filled by his family members and the vast majority of the company’s employees have only a basic education. Another reason we can be optimistic is that there’s a clear antidote to being overwhelmed by change: working toward the common good through human cooperation. Just take the author’s hometown of St. Louis Park, Minnesota. This suburb of Minneapolis-St. Paul went from being a white, anti-Semitic backwater to a progressive multicultural community thanks to decades of forward-looking social policies. By acknowledging the need for change, visionary leaders in the community helped support a rapidly growing middle class through good jobs and a great school system. People helped each other overcome their problems and, pretty soon, partisanship, prejudice and pessimism were things of the past. As a result, the community there today is thriving and harmonious. For instance, 70 percent of voters still support funding schools, even though only 15 percent of the population have children of school age. We can all take an example from this incredible transformation. Each of us, no matter where we are, must abandon the selfish, narrow-minded outlook that has been instilled in us and help pave the way to an equitable, dignified society. The key message in this book: The world is changing more quickly than ever. Rapidly evolving technology, global markets and climate change all imply significant accelerations to the pace of life – and these factors are exerting a major impact on our lives. In this wild new world, working together for the common good may be humanity’s last hope. Actionable advice: Get out there and interact. When the author asked Surgeon General Vivek Murthy what the leading disease affecting Americans is today, he answered immediately, “It’s not cancer. . . not heart disease. It’s isolation.” Ironically enough, while we’re living in the most technologically networked and interconnected period in history, we are feeling more isolated than ever. In this environment, human-to-human interaction is essential to your health. So, put down your smartphone and strike up a conversation in the real world. Got feedback?

This question divides opinion, but one thing’s for sure: throughout the last 70 years, the US has seized upon the role. These days are drawing to a close, though. In the near future, the country will decrease its commitments and withdraw from its massive involvement in world politics. That’s partly because, thanks to their growing shale oil industry, the US no longer depends on imported fuel, which was its main incentive to maintain safe naval routes and a stable Middle East. But what about the world? How will it fare without US interventions? Before we answer these questions about the future, we’ll go way back in time to explore the origins of superpowers, from the Egyptian empire to the United States. You’ll understand why there’s a rather gloomy, if thought-provoking, prognosis. And it’s one you won’t necessarily agree with. In these blinks, you’ll discover why traveling might become really difficult in the next few decades; how the Mississippi River contributed to the power of the United States; and why another great European war isn’t out of the question. How did the ancient Egyptians build an empire that dominated their regions for hundreds of years? Let’s start with geography. An empire or nation flourishes both culturally and economically when it has an advantageous geographic position. Before widespread globalization, nations were heavily dependent on the natural resources they had nearby, so regions with forests, rivers and oceans were more prosperous. Communities in harsh, mountainous, desert-like, or snowy areas struggled just to survive. That's why so many ancient empires were situated in regions with abundant food and water. A surplus of food and water allows a community to trade, grow their wealth and focus more effort on developing their cultural life and military power. In ancient Egypt, for example, the Nile provided them with a constant water supply and easy trade routes; the surrounding desert kept the community together while serving as a barrier to outsiders. Meanwhile, artistic and cultural development was a central focus. The government forced people to build huge monuments attesting to the greatness of the pharaohs. Another important factor in how a nation gains power and influence is an advantageous geopolitical position, that is, how their relations with other nations was influenced by geographic factors. After all, it's difficult for a society to dominate a region if they're surrounded by competing societies, as was the case in modern-day Germany and France. That's a big part of the reason why the Egyptian empire was so powerful for so long – enemy nations rarely challenged them because doing so would mean crossing the sea or the desert. These geographic and geopolitical factors are also apparent in the rise of other ancient empires, like the Ottoman and Roman empires. All in all, an empire's power rested largely on factors outside their control, like fertile soil and natural barriers. The same holds true for the modern United States. The United States is now an economic, political and military powerhouse. Why? Plenty of luck. The United States has a great geopolitical situation. Its borders have been mostly protected from neighboring populations for hundreds of years. While European powers fought each other for centuries across the Atlantic, they ignored the United States, which became more and more organized and stable. The most important geographical factor in US global dominance is its waterway network, however. The United States has 12 interconnected rivers, including the Mississippi, which is the longest navigable river in the world – a perfect route for trade. These waterways allow for a lot of trade, which bolstered the nation's economy. The country's fertile land, ideal for growing large amounts of crops, also brought the country great wealth and more goods to trade. And of course, a wealthy nation can build up its military, which gives it more sway in the global political landscape. The United States was also careful about addressing outside political threats early on. The US bought Alaska in 1867 and annexed the Hawaiian Islands in 1898, so it already had defenses against dangers from outsiders before entering the Second World War. After the war, the creation of NATO brought even more protection to the United States, as countries like the Faroes and Cyprus could serve as launching points for American troops into Europe. Today, no nation on earth possesses the manpower, industry and naval power necessary to conquer the United States. It’s in a very secure and comfortable geopolitical situation. In 1944, the United States did something unheard of. After proving military and economic power during the war they proposed the Bretton Woods Agreement, which was aimed at reshaping the world in the wake of World War Two. It ushered in a new era of globalization and allowed the US to establish a degree of global economic stability between the former Allies. The agreement contained several important points. It established a network of free trade and introduced a shared monetary system based on the value of the dollar, which in turn was linked to the price of gold. The agreement also granted the US Navy safe travel on trade routes all around the world. The United States' overall global influence increased tremendously. As a result, the US could manage international trade and help foster growth in potential new allies, like China, Japan and Germany. Plus, the American military gained the right to station itself all around the globe. Overall, the effects of the Bretton Woods Agreement were so widespread that some countries redesigned their entire economic system around it. For example, free, safe trade meant some countries could reorient much of their production toward exports and start relying on imported raw material. They relied on American supremacy, then, to keep import/export routes safe and open to keep their economies stable. But the days of the Bretton Woods Agreement are coming to an end. As it turns away from global trade and is less and less interested in protecting other nations’ trade routes, the US is reconsidering upholding the agreement. If it does pull out of the agreement, the US will soon return to its status as a superpower acting mostly independently from other countries. Humans are living longer than ever in the modern era, thanks to a high level of nutrition and excellent medical care. That's great, but it also means that global demographics are shifting wildly and creating problems we've never faced before. In most modern nations, the proportion of older citizens is growing very rapidly, meaning governments have to find a way to take care of them. In Japan, for instance, one-third of the population is already over 60. People rarely have children after a certain age, so if a large percentage of the population is over that age, the trend is unlikely to reverse. Governments in industrialized nations, like Japan’s, now have to support an unprecedentedly high percentage of older citizens. This demographic change is going to cause a lot of strong economies to struggle. An aging population, of course, means there are fewer people to serve in the labor force and contribute to the nation's wealth. So as the Baby Boomer generation continues to phase out of the workforce, the next generations will shoulder the responsibility of supporting their pensions and emergent health care needs, while also keeping the economy running. The problem is that these following generations aren’t as large as the Baby Boomer generation. Generation X – people born between 1960-1980 – is 25% smaller, to name just one. These generations won’t be able to generate as much capital as their parents and grandparents did, and therefore won’t have the capital to buy what the economy is producing. That will lead to chronic economic slowdowns around the world. Even countries with large surpluses will struggle to handle this economic transformation. About 30 of the world's largest economies will reach the limits of consumer market growth within the next decade. These countries include China, the United Kingdom, Germany and Norway. That will result in a decrease in exports, and a lower standard of living for the sectors of the population that can no longer support themselves. Technology development will slow down too, as there will be a shortage of capital and resources to conduct research. From this perspective, it’s hard not to feel like we're on the brink of a new era of unprecedented change and disorder. As we’ve seen, the world is changing faster than ever. Globalization, demographic shifts and climate change tell just part of the story. What does all this mean for Europe? It’s going to change completely. First, the demographic changes we learned about in the previous blink will chip away at European countries’ productivity. Second, the European Union is falling apart. EU leaders are increasingly quarrelsome when it comes to managing the euro, for example, while countries like Greece struggle to recover from recent financial crises. Germany and France remain on the fence about bailout programs, and the United Kingdom seems poised to move away from the EU alliance entirely. We've become accustomed to thinking of Europe as a peaceful and prosperous place, but it's only been 70 years since European countries nearly destroyed each other in World War Two. Germany is going to become a powerful player in the region again. The country is now very export-oriented but since the United States looks ready to abandon the Bretton Woods Agreement, Germany will soon have to deal with the consequences. That means it'll have to find other ways to get crude oil and metal, and maintain control of political and economic trends in Europe. Germany isn't a superpower at the moment, but it also wasn't a superpower just a decade before the war! And there could be another war on the horizon between Germany and France. The two countries have a long history of waging war and competing for domination in the region. If the EU collapses and Europe falls into disorder, their old rivalry could re-emerge. Europe and Japan are poised to face serious problems in the coming decades, and we've just seen that Europe may even fall into war. Does that mean the United States will fall apart too? Doubtful. The US will remain strong because it depends very little on food, technology and energy resources from other parts of the world. The American market will remain stable because the US will fare much better than other Western countries in the face of demographic change. Why? Well, partly because of immigration and partly because the country still has a lot of potential to grow more domestic, internal markets. Its location is also an advantage, as the Navy can easily protect its trade routes. Plus, if the Bretton Woods system falls apart, the United States won't have to spend as much on military power anymore, as the country will no longer be responsible for protecting international trade. Other countries will be desperate to align with the US which will have its pick of potential alliances – some of which will be new. There will be new opportunities to increase global influence, particularly in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia has a young, urbanized and relatively cheap labor force that could be extremely valuable to the US. Lastly, if Iran gains control of its neighbors' oil supplies after the fall of Bretton Woods, it could still become a very profitable ally for the United States. Iran is in a good position to control the surrounding region and if it became the United States' ally, the United States would no longer have to consider it a military threat. It's fairly easy for Westerners to travel the Western world these days. Trade agreements and the EU allow people to move from country to country looking for work. This means more and more people are not living in the same place they were born. Without Bretton Woods and the EU, however, migration will become much more difficult, dangerous and expensive. Travel will become a privilege for the highly skilled or wealthy. We'll see an increase in travel restrictions as more countries begin requiring outsiders to apply for residency permits and expensive visas. When the United States stops guarding the naval lanes, other nations or the travel industry will have to step in to ensure naval safety, which is very costly to maintain. Individual travel costs will increase as a result and few people will be able to afford to go overseas. Only a small number of elites will be able to move abroad, or escape from distressed countries like Syria or Greece. Moreover, fewer countries will be desirable as relocation destinations. The US will be one of the last. The brain drain of people privileged enough to travel will make things even worse for the countries they flee. Certain countries, like Pakistan, will also see an upsurge in terrorism once the United States withdraws its power. Pakistan has a great deal of internal conflict, and the US has been paying it considerable sums to protect US routes to Afghanistan. US bribes amount to roughly 8 percent of Pakistani GDP, and the US also provides cheap loans and military equipment. When the United States withdraws this support, it will weaken the Pakistani state even further and make it harder for it to control militant groups like Al Qaeda. The key message in this book: Today, the United States dominates the globe both politically and economically, but we're on the brink of some major changes. The US will withdraw its protection of global trade, and demographic and political shifts are going to weaken industrialized areas like Europe and Japan. Migration will decrease and instability will rise, but the US will seek out new allies and remain a superpower thanks largely to its unique geopolitical position in the world. Got feedback?

But whereas King’s “I have a dream” speech and his tragic murder are common knowledge, many people know little of what Malcolm X said or wrote or the story of his life. In these blinks, we get to know the man from his own perspective: where he came from; how he joined the Nation of Islam; his travels to the Middle East and Africa. These are all crucial pieces of the puzzle behind one of the most influential African-Americans of the last century. In these blinks, you’ll find out what the X stands for and how Malcolm came to adopt it; how Malcolm X’s life changed after the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and why he broke with the Nation of Islam. Note: The following blinks contain strong, offensive language. A racist term is used to illustrate the author's experience, which is central to his story. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925. His father, Reverend Earl Little, was a Baptist preacher who helped spread the teaching of Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Malcolm was the seventh of eight children and his mother, Louise, struggled to look after them all. Louise was born in the West Indies, the product of her mother’s rape by a white slave master, which meant that Louise had very fair skin that sometimes resulted in her being mistaken for a white woman. This also meant that Malcolm was born with reddish hair and a light complexion – the lightest of any of his siblings. Malcolm believed it was this difference in his appearance that led his mother to be harsher on him than her other children. In her eyes, he was a living reminder of the white rapist in the family’s past. Meanwhile, perhaps because of this same difference, his father favored Malcolm, frequently taking him to UNIA meetings. But his father’s efforts to create a sense of pride and identity in the black community led to a tragic end. One of Malcolm’s first memories dated from when they were living in Lansing, Michigan. He woke up in the middle of the night in a panic. A white supremacist group, The Black Legion, had set fire to the Littles’ house, but luckily the family escaped unharmed. Predictably, it got worse: When Malcolm was six years old, his father was murdered. Despite having been fatally beaten, the police called his death an accident. After that, Louise struggled to keep the family together as a single mother. She was prideful and didn’t like resorting to government aid, but eventually had to. This meant dealing with the government’s child welfare officers, who were especially cruel to Louise, trying to turn the children against her. They finally succeeded, putting Louise in a state mental hospital when Malcolm was 12 and sending the kids to live with different families. Malcolm didn’t have an easy time in school, and at the age of 13, got into trouble after pulling a prank on one of his teachers. After being scolded for wearing a hat in class, he placed a tack on his teacher’s chair when the teacher wasn’t looking. As a result, Malcolm was expelled from school and sent to a detention home. The people who ran the home treated him well, but they freely used the word “nigger” around him and talked about him as if he couldn’t understand what they were saying. It was the first time Malcolm had lived with white people, and he began to see that it was common for them to treat black people as though they couldn’t possibly have the same intellect or sensitivity as whites. A year later, Malcolm entered junior high, where this sort of treatment continued. He was one of only a few black students in the school, and did his best to integrate with his white classmates. He joined the basketball team but wasn’t allowed to dance in the presence of any white girls at the post-game parties. Malcolm was even elected class president that year, but he came to believe that his classmates were treating him as a mascot, not an equal. When his teacher asked him what he wanted to be, Malcolm answered, “a lawyer.” Malcolm was hurt when the teacher told him he should be more realistic and think about being a carpenter instead. But Malcolm soon saw a new world on a visit to Boston. The summer after seventh grade, Malcolm accepted an invitation to visit his half-sister Ella, who lived in the Roxbury area of the city. For the first time, he saw black people proudly being themselves in their own neighborhood and not trying to be white. When Malcolm returned to Lansing, he could no longer tolerate the racist jokes of his teachers and classmates; he knew there was a better place for him. Luckily, his sister Ella was able to make herself Malcolm’s legal guardian, allowing him to move to Roxbury, where he quickly learned about street life. By coincidence, one of the first people Malcolm met was a man named Shorty, who just happened to be from Lansing, Michigan. Shorty took Malcolm under his wing, pointing out the finer details of Roxbury’s seedier side and getting him a job shining shoes at the legendary Roseland Ballroom jazz club. Not only did young Malcolm shine the shoes of musicians like Duke Ellington and Count Basie, but he also learned how to hustle: the job of the shoeshine boy also entailed providing musicians and customers with booze, marijuana or the phone numbers of local prostitutes. During this time, Malcolm himself indulged in booze, marijuana, flashy clothes and dancing. Shorty showed Malcolm how to conk his hair – a painful process of using hot lye to straighten the curls. But he would later come to view conked hair as an emblem of self-degradation, “the brainwashed black man” damaging his hair in an effort to make it “look white.” Still not yet 18 years old, Malcolm bounced from job to job before landing steady work as a porter on trains, selling food and drink to passengers. Working on the line from Boston to New York City, Malcolm had his first opportunity to visit Harlem. In just one night he fell in love with the city, especially the huge Savoy nightclub, twice the size of the Roseland. Malcolm decided to move and, in 1942, became a waiter at Small’s Paradise, a Harlem restaurant and popular cultural landmark. Working at Small’s Paradise offered Malcolm the chance to quickly learn how lots of people made a living on the streets of Harlem: by hustling. Malcolm discovered who to trust, who to avoid, and the ins and outs of all kinds of criminal activities, including robbery, pimping and gambling. Malcolm would soon put this knowledge to work when he lost his job at Small’s Paradise after making the mistake of offering a prostitute’s number to an undercover cop. After getting fired, he turned to a friend known as “Sammy the Pimp,” who suggested he might make money selling marijuana. From his time at the Roseland and Savoy, Malcolm had many musician friends who were reliable customers. On a good day, the 17-year-old Malcolm would make $50 to $60. And when the police began to suspect Malcolm of dealing in Harlem, he took his business on the road, traveling on tour with the musicians and keeping them in supply. But by 1943, things were getting tougher. The police temporarily closed down the Savoy and rumors that a black soldier had been shot by a white cop almost resulted in a riot. This effectively stopped what little money white people were bringing into Harlem and increased the police presence. So, Malcolm found work “steering,” or escorting white customers to secret locations in Harlem where their sexual needs could be serviced. Through all of these experiences, Malcolm saw that Harlem was nothing more than a “den of sin” to white people. Clearly, Malcolm was on the wrong path, and that path was about to come to an end. By 1945, 20-year-old Malcolm was falling into the same trap as many hustlers: he was taking more dangerous chances to make money and increasing his drug intake in order to boost his confidence. Things began to get truly bad when a gambling dispute forced him out of Harlem. Malcolm was accused of cheating after winning a bet placed by a man named “West Indian Archie.” Archie gave Malcolm a deadline to pay him back – on pain of death. As a result, Malcolm spiraled into a paranoid drug haze of opium, cocaine and Benzedrine. He left Harlem and returned to Boston, hoping things would cool off. But Malcolm kept hustling. In Boston he teamed up with Shorty and two white girlfriends to rob rich households. Their crime spree came to an end when he was arrested trying to pawn a stolen watch. This was Malcolm’s first criminal offense, which usually would have resulted in a two-year sentence. But the judge was particularly upset about Malcolm conspiring with two white girls. So, in February 1946, Malcolm was sentenced to ten years in prison. It was in prison that Malcolm had a spiritual awakening. Malcolm was impressed by an old convict named Bimbi, who showed him that you could command respect by being well spoken. Bimbi encouraged him to use the prison library and Malcolm quickly became obsessed with reading. He read everything from English and Latin dictionaries to philosophy and world history. Malcolm would spend entire nights reading, and as a result of the bad light, developed astigmatism that required corrective lenses. It was at this time that two of Malcolm’s brothers wrote to him, telling him about the Nation of Islam: a religion that was trying to help the black man reclaim his long-forgotten identity. While in prison, Malcolm passionately took to the message of the Nation of Islam, praying for the first time and reading more and more about the tragic history of African-Americans. Prison proved to be a good training ground for Malcolm to find his public speaking voice. While there, he took part in staged debates in which two people would argue opposing sides of an issue. In these debates, Malcolm found many opportunities to spread the message of the Nation of Islam and what he was learning in history books. He would condemn the atrocities that the white man had committed on the non-white people of the world in the name of Christianity and profit. He made a particularly memorable impact during one debate when he challenged the idea that Jesus was the pale, blond, blue-eyed image that the white man prays to, and eventually got his debate opponent to concede that “Jesus was brown.” When Malcolm was released in 1952, he moved to Detroit to stay with his brother Wilfred. Malcolm was eager to devote his life to the Nation of Islam. Before he left prison, Malcolm had been writing daily letters to Elijah Muhammad, the Nation’s leader. Muhammad noticed Malcolm’s dedication and at the first opportunity invited him to dinner. During the meal, Malcolm freely offered his services to the Nation of Islam. Malcolm immediately began a recruitment drive in Detroit, slowly gaining more followers. His success was noted by other ministers in the Nation who asked him to stop by and speak during services. Malcolm proved adept at passionately spreading the teachings of Elijah Muhammad and the founder of the Nation of Islam, W. D. Fard. These teachings included the idea that the “original man” was black and that African-Americans are all descendants of African Muslims who have had their true identities taken away by white men. Malcolm was proving himself to be a natural activist and speaker. Malcolm was quickly made an official minister of the Nation of Islam. Like other ministers, he was given the last name of X, which stood for the true ancestral family name that had been forever lost. Malcolm X soon began establishing new Nation of Islam temples around the country. He opened them in places like Boston, Philadelphia and Atlanta. And in many of these cities, Malcolm attracted new members by catching people coming out of Christian churches and convincing them to hear about a faith that wasn’t a “white man’s religion.” Eventually, Malcolm X was made minister of his own temple in New York City. Being back in New York City after nine years away offered Malcolm the chance to sit down with West Indian Archie and talk. He ended up thanking Archie for forcing him to leave New York City, likely saving his life. By the end of the 1950s, the Nation of Islam was making headlines. In 1957, a member called Brother Hinton was attacked by police in Harlem who were breaking up a fight in which he was not involved. Malcolm heard about the incident and led 50 members of his congregation to the police station. He found Brother Hinton covered in blood and demanded he be sent to a hospital, which the police eventually allowed. Brother Hinton recovered and the Nation of Islam helped him successfully sue the city of New York for over $70,000. Soon after, television and newspapers were reporting on this incident of police brutality and bringing national attention to the Nation of Islam. By 1961, the Nation of Islam was flourishing. Huge rallies were being held and, as the press were drawn to Malcolm’s passionate personality, he used interviews to get his message across. Malcolm wanted to set the record straight about the Nation of Islam. The Nation wasn’t about “black supremacy,” it was about empowering the black man and giving him a sense of pride and dignity in his identity. Malcolm also answered many questions about why he used the term “the white devil.” He explained that it was not about spreading hate, but stating the facts about the “devilish” behavior that the European and American white man had shown to non-white races throughout history. To Malcolm, it begged the question: Why should the black man try to integrate with such a people? The second point Malcolm tried to make to the press was to remind everyone he wasn’t teaching his own message, but that of Elijah Muhammad. He would even turn down interview requests, telling people to address their questions to Muhammad instead. To Malcolm, Muhammad was unassailable – the man responsible for his salvation. So it came as quite a shock when, in 1963, Malcolm received disturbing news about his mentor. It turned out that two of Elijah Muhammad’s secretaries were filing paternity suits against him for fathering their children. Malcolm felt betrayed. This rift with Elijah Muhammad deepened as Malcolm’s fame increased. To Elijah and the other leaders of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm was now a threat. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy at the end of 1963, Malcolm once again made national headlines by calling the event a sign that “the chickens had come home to roost.” Immediately following this remark, the Nation of Islam publicly banned Malcolm from speaking for 90 days. Then people Malcolm knew within the Nation informed him that orders had been given for his death. Malcolm X had to reassess everything at this point. The man to whom he’d dedicated his life had let him down and was now prepared to kill him. When Malcolm’s assistant told him that he’d been asked to plant a bomb in his car, X knew it was serious. To escape the threats and reaffirm his spiritual beliefs, Malcolm decided to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. Malcolm was interested in broadening his knowledge of Islam. Over the years, people had spoken to Malcolm about “true Islam” and how it differed from Elijah Muhammad’s teaching. So, Malcolm was eager to make the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, a sacred duty that every Muslim is asked to do at some point in his life. The trip was an eye-opening experience. On his journey, Malcolm quickly learned that the orthodox Muslim religion was indeed quite different from what he’d been led to believe. As he toured the holy land he saw Muslims of all colors. He was particularly impressed when he was given brotherly respect and hospitality by blue-eyed, blond-haired people who would be considered white back in the United States. He met Saudi Arabia’s Prince Faisal and was given books to read and told not to be misled by false prophets. Moved by his experiences, he wrote a letter to the US press expressing his astonishment at the displays of brotherhood that he’d encountered among all races and that he must reconsider his previously held beliefs. After Mecca and Cairo, Malcolm traveled to Beirut, Nigeria and Ghana. Along the way he made public appearances at colleges and met with politicians. He tried to rally support from these countries, arguing that just as much effort should be made to help African-Americans as there was to help black South Africans. Malcolm returned to New York on May 21, 1964, two days after his 39th birthday. The press had many questions upon his arrival. Malcolm quickly elaborated on his newfound perspective. He explained that he was beginning to understand that white people were not inherently racist. But he still felt that white “so-called Christian” society had planted the feeling of superiority into generations of white people and that this had led to a destructive problem. This could be seen in the riots breaking out in ghettos around the United States. These ghettos had formed as a result of generations of racism and mistreatment by white society. Malcolm saw it as “sociological dynamite” that had been planted by whites and said that unless action was taken to improve the situation, it was only a matter of time before it exploded. To solve this problem, Malcolm understood that it was time for a new all-inclusive message to be spread. To spread the word and make his break with the Nation of Islam public, Malcolm formed the organization Muslim Mosque, Inc. But he knew that more conventional efforts would be needed to create the kind of sociological change needed to free black people from the ghetto. In an effort to be more inclusive he started the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). While white people couldn’t join OAAU, Malcolm had constructive advice for those who wanted to help. One of his biggest regrets was an incident years before when a white college girl had asked what she could do and he’d responded: “Nothing.” He explained that he would now tell that girl to start her own organization in her own neighborhood, to spread the word of anti-racism and anti-violence among white people. The death threats that surrounded Malcolm X gave all his actions an urgency. After all, his father and four out of six of his uncles died as a result of violence and Malcolm believed he would be killed by a white racist or the Nation of Islam. While he was at peace with this possibility, he was not at peace with his family being threatened. He was especially upset when violence was brought into his home. Malcolm was fighting a lawsuit brought by the Nation of Islam, who were trying to force his family out of the home given to them by the Nation many years previously . On the night of February 13, 1965, Malcolm and his wife Betty, who was pregnant with their sixth child, were startled awake when a Molotov cocktail was thrown through their front window. But that was only a prelude to the tragedy of February 21, 1965. On this day, Malcolm X’s OAAU organization was holding a meeting at the Audubon Ballroom in New York City. Malcolm’s wife and children were in the audience. When Malcolm walked onto the stage, three gunmen from the Nation of Islam opened fire, killing him almost instantly. Betty protected their children, covering them with her own body during the shooting. But after the shooters fled the scene she collapsed next to the body of her husband, crying, “They killed him.” Actor and friend Ossie Davis delivered a moving eulogy at his funeral. Davis predicted that some people would think of Malcolm X as a racist or a man of hate, but he pointed out that Malcolm actually never associated with any violence in his life. And if people were to listen closely to what he was saying, they would hear the words of a man who simply wanted the best for his people. To Davis, Malcolm represented a proud example of a strong, uncompromising black man. The key message in this book: Malcolm X was a complex individual. Like many people he struggled to understand himself and the world around him. But he remained diligent and throughout his life he stayed curious and searched for the truth. Through hard work and commitment, he proved that redemption is possible in one’s lifetime.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Without it, we’d be stuck with the system our ancient ancestors used: barter. Trading chairs for pigs and candles for milk is all well and good as long as you have what your neighbor needs, but it’s a tricky system to scale up beyond a small village – and it’s all but useless in the global commodity trade. The trick is finding something that everyone will accept and trust. In the modern age, that meant paper currency backed by gold. The idea was simple yet effective. After all, few things are better suited to retaining value than precious metal. The result was an age of unprecedented growth and prosperity. Things started going wrong in the early twentieth century when governments abandoned what had become known as the “gold standard” and began simply printing money. The result? A century of boom and bust and increasing debt. We don’t need to return to gold if we want sound finances, however. In fact, there’s a new kid on the block that’s perfectly suited to our digital age: Bitcoin. Like gold, it’s a highly stable way of storing value over time and it can be used anywhere, anytime. If the new cryptocurrency can overcome some teething problems, it may become the new standard for a new age of growth. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why the arrival of new technologies spelled the end for an ancient rock currency; how governments have undermined the value of currencies to fund their wars since Caesar; and why Bitcoin is perfectly suited to play the role of a new standard. How does an economy work without money? Simple, you swap stuff. Call it barter, or direct exchange. You could trade two pigs for a cow, or for a haircut – it all depends on what you have and what your neighbor needs, or vice versa. But here’s the problem: sometimes those things don’t align. Don’t have anything to tempt your would-be trading partner? Well, tough luck – you won’t get what you want, either! That’s where money comes in. Because everyone wants it, you can use it for any transaction. That’s known as indirect exchange. Early money wasn’t anything like the stuff you keep in your wallet today, though. Take the inhabitants of Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. Well into the nineteenth century, they used “Rai stones” for their trading. These stones came in all shapes and sizes, the largest weighing a staggering four tons! When a new stone was ready, it was dragged up a hill so that everyone could see it. Its owner would then exchange ownership or part-ownership of the stone for goods and services. Every transaction was announced to the whole community, which in turn acknowledged the exchange. This kind of money worked for so long because it was salable. The Yap Islanders knew that if they owned Rai stones, they could also sell them. The added boon was that they could be used around the whole island since the stones were visible from any point. They were also divisible. If you wanted something small like a basket of fruit, you sold a small part of your stone; if you wanted something bigger like a raft, you sold a larger piece, or even the whole stone. So if Rai stones worked so well, why don’t the Islanders still use them today? Well, there was a snag: they didn’t retain their value, or salability over time. Initially, that hadn’t been an issue. Quarrying and moving them from nearby islands was such a difficult business that the supply of stones was limited and their value remained stable. That changed in the late nineteenth century with the arrival of David O’Keefe, an Irish-American captain who’d been shipwrecked on the island. O’Keefe started importing Rai stones in large numbers using modern technology to exchange for coconuts. Soon enough, they were so commonplace that they no longer worked as money – they had been transformed back into mere stones! The first money resembling the change in your pocket was a product of a revolutionary technology pioneered in early pre-Christian civilizations: metallurgy, the craft of smelting metals. This technology made it possible to create highly salable coins that were both small and light enough to be carried far and wide. One metal stood out from the crowd when it came to coinage – gold. Why? Well, it has a couple of unique features. First, it’s virtually impossible to destroy and can’t be synthesized using other materials. Also, if you want gold, you better have a shovel, because underground’s the only place you’ll find any decent amount of the stuff. Furthermore, the more gold you mine, the deeper you have to go to find more gold, meaning that, even as gold-mining technologies improve, the supply of gold grows slowly and predictably. Combine all those traits and you have a material that’s incredibly effective as a store of value, which makes it salable across time. It didn’t take long for people to figure this out. King Croesus was commissioning gold coins in Greece over 2,500 years ago! Gold may have been around forever, but the love affair between money and gold only really blossomed in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. That’s gone down in history as the age of sound money. But before we define this term, let’s provide a little context. These centuries were shaped by rapid advances in communications and transportation. Technologies like the telegraph and trains made it easier than ever for both people and goods to get from point A to point B. That, in turn, justified the increasing use of ultraconvenient, nonphysical forms of payment like checks, paper receipts and bills. But how do you convince merchants and consumers that the pieces of paper they’re using to buy and sell are worth anything? The answer governments worldwide came up with was to issue paper money backed by precious metals, which they stored in vaults. In the leading European nations, the most commonly used metal was gold. Britain led the way, with Isaac Newton - who was Warden of the Royal Mint at the time - introducing the \"gold standard\" in 1717. By 1900, around 50 other countries had followed suit and officially adopted the same standard. Gold became increasingly marketable – and thus increasingly valuable – as more and more nations issued paper currency backed by gold reserves. This was sound money: the markets had chosen gold freely as the best store of value, and money was now backed by it. In the first century CE, the Roman emperor Julius Caesar issued the “aureus,” a coin containing roughly eight grams of gold. It became a standard method of payment across the Roman Empire. But as growth in the Empire began to slow, rulers started “coin clipping” – a sneaky practice whereby a portion of the precious metal contained in coins was removed to bolster the government’s spending power. Easy money, right? Maybe, but it eventually drove up inflation and triggered a series of economic crises that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the once-mighty Roman Empire! But the gold standard had one major flaw: the gold had to be stored in a small number of bank vaults. This facilitated the exchange of paper money for gold, but it also created a highly centralized system in which governments controlled the value of paper money. If they wanted to, they could always increase the supply of money without increasing the corresponding amount of gold. The salability of paper money, in other words, was entirely at their mercy. In 1914, nearly every major European power decided to make the most of this. War had broken out and they needed cash to fund their operations. Rather than raising taxes, they followed the Romans’ lead and simply printed new money. But it wasn’t “backed” by gold, and while the printing machines churned out new notes and bills, no new gold was added to the banks’ vaults. Within a couple of weeks, the countries fighting the First World War had suspended the convertibility of paper money into gold. The standard had been abandoned. That had two effects. First, this source of ready cash allowed governments to continue funding their war efforts for four more blood-soaked years. The second result of this money-printing spree was to severely undermine the value of existing currencies. The Austro-Hungarian krone, for example, fell by 68.9 percent compared to the Swiss franc – a currency that remained tied to the gold standard thanks to Switzerland’s decision to remain neutral and sit the war out. Both factors would go on to play a major role in shaping the economic life of postwar Europe. When the First World War came to an end in 1918, the European powers that had been involved in the conflict faced the thorny issue of revaluing their currencies. The obvious solution was to return to the gold standard, but a fair revaluation compared to gold would have been an unpopular admission of how little currencies were now worth. Returning to the old exchange rates wasn’t possible, either, as it would have overvalued paper currencies. The result would have been a flood of citizens demanding gold for their paper receipts, gold that they could then have sold abroad for a profit. So the governments chose to introduce fiat money – money backed by decree rather than gold. The adoption of fiat money led to an age of unsound money shaped by ever-greater intervention in the economy as governments scrambled to stabilize the value of their currencies. By 1944, the end of the Second World War was in sight and the victors began planning the postwar economic order. This was called the Bretton Woods system, a reference to the small New Hampshire village in which they signed their agreement. The basic idea was that all the world’s currencies would be tied to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate. The dollar would in turn be tied to the value of gold, again at a fixed exchange rate. The newly created International Monetary Fund – IMF – would be in charge of policing these exchange rates. Incredibly, the whole system required all participating countries’ gold reserves to be transported to the United States! In theory, Bretton Woods resembled the pre-1914 gold standard, as all currencies were ostensibly exchangeable for gold. In practice, it didn’t quite work like that. The United States bent the rules and inflated its own currency compared to gold while other nations inflated their currencies compared to the dollar to fund economic expansion. Eventually, the pretense was dropped and gold was completely abandoned as a standard. Keeping a rapidly inflating currency tied to gold was simply impossible. On August 15, 1971, President Nixon announced that dollars would no longer be convertible to gold. From now on, the value of currencies would be freely determined by the interplay of the world’s major fiat currencies. As we’ll see in the following blink, the results would be disastrous. Sound money reached its high-water mark in the nineteenth century. Paper money was backed by gold, a precious metal adopted by the free market due to the qualities that made it such an effective store of value. That, in turn, underwrote an era of prosperity. Let’s take a closer look at how that worked. The first thing to note about sound money is that it’s a great way of encouraging people to save and invest – the perfect recipe for sustainable, long-term growth. Why? Well, humans have a natural positive time preference: we prefer instant gratification over future gratification. Sound money nudges us to think more about the future. After all, if we can reasonably expect our money’s value to increase over time, it makes sense to take a look at what we can do now to maximize our future income. And that’s what investment’s all about – postponing gratification today to reap greater rewards tomorrow. Investment thus leads to capital accumulation. People pump money into producing capital goods, commodities that can be used to create other goods and revenue streams in the future. And the more capital accumulation there is, the greater the chance of stable, long-term economic growth. The problem with unsound money is that it distorts capital accumulation. The reason for this is simple. When governments interfere with the money supply by, say, manipulating interest rates, they also interfere with prices. That’s an issue because prices give investors the information they need to make good decisions without having to learn every tiny detail about global events. If a Malaysian businesswoman decides against expanding her offices because the cost of copper wiring has skyrocketed, she doesn’t need to know that the price spike is due to a recent earthquake in Chile. The price tells her everything she needs to know. Government intervention, however, means that prices no longer reflect market movements. Investors don’t have the information they need, thus distorting capital accumulation. Unsound-money policies like those implemented by European governments during the First World War create all sorts of problems. Two issues stand out – recessions and the endless accumulation of debt. In this blink, we’ll find out why. Let’s start with recessions. Government interference in the market takes the form of central planning. Here’s the rub. No single person, agency or department ever has access to all the information necessary to understand the vast and constantly changing web of preferences, choices, costs and resources that define an economy. And if you don’t have that information, you’re bound to make bad decisions – and this is precisely what governments do when they manipulate the money supply. Their interventions distort markets, especially capital markets, creating a “boom and bust” cycle. During the upcycle, artificially inflated money tricks investors into thinking they can buy more capital than they can afford. The resulting boom soon becomes a bubble; when it pops, the economy goes into recession. Then there’s debt. To see how unsound money leads economies to become indebted, let’s take a look at the Great Depression in the 1930s. During that era, governments increasingly adopted policies favored by the British economist John Maynard Keynes. According to Keynes and his followers, the “Keynesians,” recessions happen when total spending is too low in an economy. The best way to respond to recessions, they argued, is to increase spending. How do you do that? Well, you could lower taxes, but people don’t usually spend their extra money. The only other option is for the government to provide the cash for all that spending. Because raising taxes in the middle of a recession is difficult, governments invariably decide to increase the money supply. This has secondary effects on the way people spend money. Remember the idea of time preference from the previous blink? All that cash sloshing around the economy tends to push people into focusing on the present. Saving becomes less attractive and a culture of unwise, opportunistic investment takes hold. Soon enough, people are up to their eyeballs in debt. The overall effect is endless crisis. Government intervention causes recessions and the Keynesian response makes things even worse. But there is an alternative. We need to return to sound money and a new gold standard. The new technology of Bitcoin might just help us do that. After decades of reckless spending and debt accumulation, it’s high time that governments mend their ways and return to sound-money policies. That’s where Bitcoin comes in. So how exactly can the world’s first digital currency help put economies on the road to recovery, stability and growth? Think back to the gold standard. Markets chose gold to store value for two reasons – it’s scarce and it’s predictable, meaning that there’s little risk of the supply increasing enough to significantly deflate its value. Bitcoin has similar traits. In fact, its supply is literally fixed. Whatever else happens, there will never be more than 21,000,000 individual bitcoins. Once that number is in circulation, no additional bitcoins will be issued. The way bitcoins are created also leads to stability since the supply of the currency grows at a constantly diminishing rate. Here’s how that works. Like gold, bitcoins are mined. To access new coins, computers across the Bitcoin network pool their processing powers to solve complex algorithmic problems. Once these puzzles have been cracked, the “miners” – the computers that helped crack the puzzle – receive bitcoins as a reward. To prevent online gold rushes, Bitcoin’s designer, Satoshi Nakamoto, added an inbuilt failsafe – the number of bitcoins issued is halved every four years. The icing on the cake? The algorithmic problems become more and more difficult to solve as the number of computers working on them rises, guaranteeing a steady and reliable supply in much the same way as the increasing difficulty of mining gold makes the supply of gold steady and reliable. Bitcoin will continue being issued in ever-smaller quantities until 2140, after which no more coins will be released. That makes bitcoins unique. They’re the only good that is defined by absolute scarcity. Compare that to conventional commodities like oil and gas. We think of them as scarce, but we also know that if we’re willing to invest the necessary resources we’ll probably be able to find new sources. For all our increasing consumption of oil, total proven oil reserves globally are increasing! Bitcoin is radically different. No amount of time or resources can create more coins than the algorithmically programed supply allows. The upshot is that bitcoin can never be devalued by manipulating the supply, making it a perfect store of value. Sound money isn’t just about the scarcity of the unit in which its value is stored. It also needs to be secure. After all, if you’re not absolutely convinced that bitcoins are safe, you’re likely to look for an alternative. Luckily, the digital currency is also incredibly secure. That’s because of the Bitcoin ledger, which uses an innovative technology called the public blockchain. So what’s that? Well, when mining computers crack an algorithmic puzzle, they create a block. This is essentially a record of all recent transactions and mining activity. Each block is added to a chain of older blocks, creating the Bitcoin blockchain. This ledger contains every last detail about every blockchain transaction ever completed. And here’s the kicker: all that information is available to every network user. Ownership of bitcoins is only valid once it’s been registered on the blockchain, which is only possible if the majority of network users approve it. That means the Bitcoin network is entirely self-sustaining; there’s no need for a central authority to oversee transactions. More importantly in terms of security, it also means verifying transactions is easier than cheating. That’s because would-be fraudsters need to expend a significant amount of processing power on creating a fraudulent block – and, thanks to Nakamoto’s difficulty adjustment, it will become even more difficult as bitcoin increases in popularity. Verifying new blocks, on the other hand, requires virtually no energy. A majority of nodes can simply refuse a suspect block without making a dent in their processing power. It’s an effective fail-safe because it stacks the odds against cheats. Even if a user decided to expend vast amounts of energy and successfully hacked a majority of all network nodes to approve a fraudulent block, they’d still gain very little. Breaching Bitcoin’s security would quickly undermine trust in the network, leading to a drop in demand and value. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face! We know Bitcoin is both scarce and secure, but is that enough to make it more than a flash in the pan? The answer depends on how well it can master a couple of major challenges. Take price volatility. When bitcoins were first used to complete a transaction in May 2010, an individual coin was valued at $0.000994 US dollars. Fast forward to October 2017 and that had risen to $4,200 – an increase of 422,520,000 percent! And that’s just long-term volatility. In 2017 alone, the value of a bitcoin jumped from $750 to $20,000. These fluctuations are a product of demand. The supply of bitcoins is fixed so the currency can only respond to rising interest through price. Because Bitcoin is new, demand has naturally been highly variable. The result, however, has been to undermine the currency’s status as an effective store of value. Will things settle down? Well, according to the author, these fluctuations should even out as the market grows. That brings us to the second challenge facing Bitcoin. If the currency is to become a new standard, it needs to grow; but growth, even for Bitcoin, would eventually depend on an increasing reliance on large, centralized institutions. That’s an issue when a currency is designed to give people an exchange system that doesn’t rely on government-approved third parties like banks! Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a way to square this circle. Bitcoin’s transaction limit is currently set at 500,000 per day. That could be increased, but whatever the new figure, there’s no getting round the fact that there’ll be a daily cap. Then there’s the question of costs. The more transactions take place, the more nodes there’ll need to be. That increases the number of copies of the Bitcoin ledger that need to be updated, ratcheting up both transaction fees and the amount of processing power expended. Put these facts together and you’ve got a pretty compelling case for taking bitcoin trade off the blockchain – in other words, trade in currencies backed by bitcoin. That would create a new standard, but it would also mean that centralized institutions would need to be created to manage this system. Bitcoin may well provide a framework for establishing a contemporary sound-money policy. A question hangs over its future, however: will it be able to dodge the fate of the gold standard? Only time will tell. The key message in these blinks: Money has come in all shapes and sizes throughout history, but there’s only ever been one truly sound system: money backed by gold. The “gold standard” underwrote an age of prosperity and stability. That all changed in the early twentieth century, when European governments abandoned gold and fiscal prudence to fund their war efforts. The world hasn’t been the same since, and we’ve endured decades of rising debt and boom-and-bust cycles. High time for a change, then. That’s where Bitcoin comes in. Like gold, it’s a highly effective unit of exchange. But if it’s going to lead us to a new age of sound money, the digital currency will have to overcome some teething problems.  Got feedback?

He calls these seemingly random events, which often have profound consequences for the individual and even for societies on the whole, “Black Swans.” Taleb gives us a better understanding of our own shortcomings when it comes to making predictions. This can help us to recognize when our judgment is clouded by the desire to fit information into neat, easy-to-understand narratives. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to avoid mistaking noise for knowledge, and how to make better use of your ignorance. You’ll learn why thinking like a turkey could be bad for your health. You’ll also find out why the greatest threat to a casino might actually have nothing to do with gambling. Finally, you’ll discover why “knowing what you don’t know” can save you from losing your life savings. As human beings, we are particularly good at turning all of the stimuli from our environment into meaningful information. This is a talent that has allowed us to create the scientific method, philosophize about the nature of being and invent complex mathematical models. But just because we’re able to reflect on and order the world around us doesn’t necessarily mean we’re very good at it. For one thing, we’re inclined to be narrow-minded in our beliefs about the world. Once we have an idea about how the world functions, we tend to cling to it. But because human knowledge is constantly growing and evolving, this dogmatic approach makes no sense. Just two-hundred years ago, for example, doctors and scientists were supremely confident in their knowledge of medicine, yet today their confidence seems ludicrous: just imagine going to your doctor complaining of a common cold, and being given a prescription for snakes and leeches! Being dogmatic about our beliefs makes us blind to those concepts that fall outside the paradigms we’ve already accepted as true. How, for example, is it possible to understand medicine if you’re not aware that germs exist? You might come up with a sensible explanation for illness but it will be flawed by a lack of crucial information. This kind of dogmatic thinking can result in huge surprises. We’re sometimes surprised by events not because they’re random, but because our outlook is too narrow. Such surprises are known as “Black Swans,” and they can prompt us to fundamentally reconsider our worldview: Before anyone had ever seen a black swan, people assumed that all swans were white. Because of this, all their depictions and imaginations of the swan were white, meaning that white was an essential part of “swanness.” So, when they discovered their first black swan, this fundamentally transformed their understanding of what a swan could be. As you’ll see, Black Swans can be as trivial as learning that not all swans are white, or as life-changing as losing everything because of a stock market crash. The effect of a Black Swan isn’t the same for us all. Some will be hugely affected by them, others hardly at all. The power of their effect is largely determined by your access to relevant information: the more information you have, the less likely you are to be hit by a Black Swan; and the more ignorant you are, the more you are at risk. This can be seen in the following scenario: Imagine making a bet on your favorite horse, Rocket. Because of Rocket’s build, her track record, the skill of the jockey, and the poor competition, you believe that Rocket is the safest bet and gamble everything you own on the horse winning. Now imagine your surprise when the starting pistol is fired and Rocket not only doesn’t leave the gates but opts instead to simply lay down on the track. This would be a Black Swan event. Given the information you’d gathered, Rocket winning was a safe bet, yet you lost everything the instant the race began. But this event will not be a tragedy for everyone. For example, Rocket’s owner made a fortune by betting against his own horse. Unlike you, he had additional information, knowing that Rocket was going to go on strike to protest animal cruelty. Just that small amount of information saved him from having to suffer a Black Swan event. The impact of Black Swans can also differ widely in scale. Rather than affecting only individuals, sometimes, entire societies can experience a Black Swan. When this happens, a Black Swan can transform how the world works, impacting many areas of society, like philosophy, theology and physics. For example, when Copernicus proposed that the Earth is not the center of the universe, the consequences were immense, as his discovery challenged both the authority of the ruling Catholics and the historical authority of the Bible itself. In the end, this particular Black Swan helped to establish a new beginning for all of European society. Although humans seem to be the most intelligent animals on the planet, there’s still a long way to go before we’ll have outgrown all of our bad habits. One such habit is creating narratives based on what we know of the past. While we tend to believe that the past is a good indication of the future, this is often a fallacy. It leaves us prone to mistakes because there are simply too many unknown factors which could go against our narratives. For example, imagine you’re a turkey living on a farm. Over the years the farmer has fed you, let you roam freely, and provided a place to live. Using the past as your guide, there is no reason to expect that tomorrow should be any different. Alas, tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and you are decapitated, filled with spices, thrown in an oven, and devoured by those who had housed and fed you. As this example shows, believing that we can base predictions about the future on knowledge of the past is a fallacy with potentially dire consequences. A similar fallacy is confirmation bias: we often search for evidence only for those beliefs we’ve formed already, even to the extent that we ignore any evidence that contradicts them. When we encounter information that goes against what we already believe, we’re unlikely to accept it and even less likely to investigate further. If we do investigate, we’ll probably look for sources that undermine this information. For example, if you strongly believe that “climate change” is a conspiracy but then happen to see a documentary called “The Undeniable Evidence for a Changing Climate,” it’s likely that you’ll be upset. If, after this, you did a web search for information about climate change, it’s more probable that the search terms you use would be “climate change hoax” and not “evidence for and against climate change.” While both of these fallacies are anti-scientific, it turns out that we can’t do much to avoid such bad reasoning: it’s simply in our nature. During our evolution, the human brain developed certain ways to categorize information. While these were great for surviving in the wild, when we needed to learn and adapt quickly to our dangerous surroundings, they are terrible in today’s complex environments. For instance, one way we incorrectly categorize information is the so-called narrative fallacy, where we create linear narratives to describe our current situation. This is due to the massive amount of information we’re faced with every day. To make sense of it all, our brains select only that information it considers important. For example, while you probably remember what you ate for breakfast this morning, it’s doubtful you remember the color of everyone’s shoes on the subway. In order to give meaning to these unconnected bits of information, we turn them into a coherent narrative. For example, when you reflect on your own life, you probably select only certain events as meaningful, and you order those events into a narrative that explains how you became who you are. For example, you love music because your mom used to sing songs by The Beatles to you every night. However, creating such narratives is a poor way to gain any meaningful understanding of the world. This is because the process works only by looking back on the past, and doesn’t take into account the near-infinite explanations that are possible for any one event. The fact is that tiny, apparently insignificant events can have unpredictable, major consequences. Imagine, for example, that a butterfly flapping her wings in India causes a hurricane one month later in New York City. If we catalogue each stage of cause and effect in this process as they occur, then we’d be able to see a clear, causal relationship between events. But since we only see the outcome – in this case, the hurricane – then all we can do is guess at which of the simultaneously occurring events actually influenced that outcome. We humans have developed many methods and models for categorizing information and making sense of the world. Unfortunately, however, we’re not very good at distinguishing between the different types of information – most crucially between “scalable” and “non-scalable” information. But the difference between those types is fundamental. Non-scalable information – such as body weight and height – has a definite, statistical upper and lower limit. Body weight is non-scalable because there are physical limitations on how much a person can weigh: while it is possible for someone to weigh 1000 lbs, it is physically impossible for anyone’s weight to reach 10,000 lbs. Because the properties of such non-scalable information are clearly limited, it’s possible for us to make meaningful predictions about averages. On the other hand, non-physical or fundamentally abstract things, like the distribution of wealth or album sales, are scalable. For example, if you sell your album in digital form through iTunes, there’s no limit to how many sales you might make because distribution is not limited by the amount of physical copies you could manufacture. Furthermore, because the transactions take place online, there is no shortage of physical currency to prevent you from selling a trillion albums. This difference between scalable and non-scalable information is crucial if you want to have an accurate picture of the world. And trying to apply those rules that are effective with non-scalable information to scalable data will only lead to mistakes. For example, say that you want to measure the wealth of the population of England. The simplest way to do this is to work out their per capita wealth, by adding up their total income and dividing that figure by the number of citizens. However, wealth is actually scalable: it’s possible for a tiny percentage of the population to own an incredibly large percentage of the wealth. By merely collecting data on the per capita income, you end up with a representation of income distribution that probably doesn’t accurately reflect the actual reality of the citizens of England. We all like to keep ourselves safe from harm, and one of the ways that we do this is assessing and managing the possibility of risk. This is why we buy things like accident insurance, and we try not to “put all our eggs in one basket.” Most of us try our best to measure risks as accurately as possible to ensure that we don’t miss out on opportunities, while also ensuring that we don’t do something we may later regret. To achieve this we have to evaluate any possible risks and then measure the probability that these risks will materialize. For example, imagine you are in the market to purchase insurance. You want to buy the kind of policy that will protect you against the worst-case scenario, but also will not be a waste of money. In this case, you’d have to measure the threat of disease or accident against the consequences of those events transpiring, and then make an informed decision. Unfortunately, we are far too confident that we know all the possible risks which we need to protect ourselves against. This is called the ludic fallacy, and according to it, we tend to handle risk as we would a game, with a set of rules and probabilities that we can determine before we play. Yet, treating risk like a game is itself risky business. For example, casinos want to make as much money as possible, which is why they have elaborate security systems and ban players that win too much, too frequently. But their approach is based on the ludic fallacy. The major threats to casinos may not be lucky gamblers or thieves, but rather, for example, a kidnapper who takes the owner’s child hostage, or an employee failing to submit the casino’s earnings with the IRS. The casino’s greatest threats might be completely unpredictable. As this shows, no matter how hard we try, we’ll never be able to accurately calculate every risk. Next, we’ll find out how being aware of our ignorance is far better than remaining unaware of it. We’ve all heard the phrase “knowledge is power.” However, sometimes we’re constrained by what we know, and at these times recognizing what you don’t know is far more advantageous. Indeed, by focusing only on what you know, you limit your perception of all the possible outcomes of a given event, and create fertile ground for the occurrence of Black Swan events. For example, say you want to purchase stocks in a company, but your knowledge of stock statistics is limited to the period 1920-28 – one year before the greatest stock market crash in US history. In that case, you’d observe a few small dips and peaks, but in general you’d notice that the trend is upward. So, thinking that this trend must continue, you spend your life savings on stocks. The next day, however, the market crashes and you lose everything you have. If you’d studied the market a little more, you would have observed the numerous booms and busts throughout history. By focusing only on what we know, we open ourselves to great and unmeasured risks. On the other hand, if you can at least establish what it is that you don’t know, then you’d be able to greatly reduce your risk. Good poker players understand this principle well, as it’s crucial to their success at the game. While they know the rules of the game, and the probabilities that their opponents have better cards than they do, they are also aware that there is certain, relevant information they don’t know – such as their opponent’s strategy, and how much their opponent can stand to lose. Their knowledge of these unknowns contributes to a strategy that doesn’t focus solely on their own cards, thus enabling them to make a far more informed assessment of the risk. Perhaps the best defense against falling into the cognitive traps we’ve seen is a good understanding of the tools that we use to make predictions, and their limitations. While knowing our own limitations certainly won’t save us from every blunder we’ll ever make, it can at least help us to reduce our bad decision-making. For instance, if you’re aware that you are subject to cognitive bias, like everyone else, then it’s much easier to recognize when you’re only looking for information that confirms what you already believe to be true. Likewise, if you know that we humans like to organize everything into neat, causal narratives, and that this kind of approach simplifies the complexity of the world, then you’ll be more likely to search for further information to gain a better view of the “whole picture.” Just this small amount of critical self-analysis can help you gain a competitive advantage over others in your field. It’s certainly preferable to be aware of your shortcomings. For example, if you know that there will always be unforeseeable risks in pursuing any opportunity, despite how promising that opportunity seems, you’ll probably be less inclined to invest heavily in it. While we cannot triumph over randomness or our limited capacity for understanding the vast complexity of our world, we can at least mitigate the damage inflicted by our ignorance. The key message in this book: Even though we’re constantly making predictions about the future, we’re actually terrible at it. We put far too much confidence in our knowledge and underestimate our ignorance. Our over-reliance on methods that seem to make sense, our basic inability to understand and define randomness, and even our biology, all contribute to poor decision making, and sometimes to “Black Swans” –  events we believe to be impossible but which end up redefining our understanding of the world. Actionable advice: Be suspicious of “because.” Although it is absolutely in our nature to look for linear, causal relationships between events in order to make sense of this complex world, the reality is that we are absolutely pitiful at both making predictions of the future and establishing causes for the present. Rather than feeding our desire to see events in clear-cut cause and effect, it’s better to instead consider a number of possibilities without being married to any single one. Know what you don’t know. If you want to make meaningful predictions about the future – which, if you are buying insurance, making investments, attending college, changing jobs, conducting research, or just being a human, then you certainly do – then it’s simply not enough to take all of the “knowns” into consideration. This leaves you with only a partial understanding of the risks involved in your prediction.

She abandoned her promising career to try to help people suffering from poverty in Africa. At first, she was a rather naive Westerner with little idea of what people in the developing world really needed or desired, but soon she began to understand. She found that experts in the West who tend to assume they know what poor people need are often wrong: aid and charity frequently wind up going to the wrong people or is squandered on poorly planned projects. What people in the developing world want is not handouts, but rather the dignity that comes from being able to help themselves. As the author traveled through Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, among other countries stricken by poverty, she realized that making people in developing countries accountable for their aid projects makes them far more likely to succeed. In the following blinks, you’ll find out: why it’s actually more difficult to give away your money efficiently than it is to earn it in the first place, how a man named Innocent was anything but, and how development aid can work better if you demand the recipient pays it back. Anyone who has watched the news knows the devastations of poverty in the developing world. People in the West have tried to lift the developing world out of poverty with various approaches like government aid and charitable organizations, yet, time after time, they have failed. Why? Often, aid and charity is not directed to the right people – women. In the developing world, it is women who generally decide how a family should spend its money, which makes them the most responsible spenders in their communities. Giving them the aid is most likely to yield effective results. Novogratz came to this conclusion when she wanted to help the poor in Rwanda. She had helped found a micro-credit company called Duterimbere, which makes very small loans to poor people who wouldn’t qualify for traditional bank loans. Soon she found that many women in developing countries were taking out loans to expand their tiny enterprises, mostly involving selling vegetables like tomatoes and onions. Duterimbere turned out to be very successful, and its success was largely because it let local women, rather than so-called experts, decide where money should be spent. This method went against the prevailing aid industry logic that dictated that experts should direct aid, with locals getting little say. Although these micro loans effectively helped poor communities rise out of poverty, Duterimbere was faced with the problem that a lot of women were not paying them back. Novogratz found a solution in making borrowers more accountable. Many poor people face a frustrating catch-22: they can’t get bank loans because they are considered too poor to qualify, but without a loan, they can’t start an enterprise to earn a proper livelihood. This vicious cycle is partly because of a prevailing bank (mis)conception that poor people suffer from a culture of poverty: they don’t even want to better themselves, so they would squander any loan given to them and never pay it back. The vast success enjoyed by micro-creditors has shown this perception is, in fact, incorrect: poor people can and do pay back their debts, as long as there is accountability. Accountability was the key that enabled Duterimbere to raise its loan repayment rates. In the beginning, the company found very few women paid back their loans because they saw no reason to: why would a finance company backed by rich Westerners miss a small loan? For example, one rice seller claimed she couldn’t pay back the loan as her rice stock had been stolen. Yet when a Duterimbere representative visited her house, she found a huge sack of rice that was hidden. The borrower had figured she could easily get away with not paying back the loan. To combat such faults, the company sent a message to borrowers that they absolutely had to pay back loans. Duterimbere said that if a borrower fails to repay, she cannot borrow again – no excuses. The policy worked. As soon as the aforementioned rice seller heard about the new rule, she repaid her loan in full and subsequently became a reliable client. What’s more, the accountability tactic helped make Duterimbere not just another gullible Western charity in the eyes of the women, but a serious financial company that could help get them out of poverty. Many people think that those in poverty can lift themselves out if they just receive enough charity. But in fact, money is not enough. People need to feel dignity to be truly encouraged to transform their lives. The only way to give them dignity is by letting them work their own way out of poverty. Consider a small bakery that was set up in Kigali by the Rwandan government for poor women to work in. The bakery was backed by two charities, and it sold its goods to government offices while employing 20 women. While it may sound good on paper, it was not working: the bakery generated continuous losses of $650 a month, and could thus only survive while the charities supported it. At the same time, the women working there earned 50 cents a day, which wasn’t enough to raise them out of poverty. The solution? Empowerment and accountability. Novogratz stepped in and insisted the bakery be run like a business, where the women would be accountable for its costs and sales. They would earn a base wage, and get commission for the total sales made, effectively connecting their wages to the project’s outcome. Gradually the employees started to feel like they had a stake in the bakery’s success, and began making decisions and improvements themselves. They called it the Blue Bakery, and it soon grew, so much so that the women quadrupled their income, earning two dollars a day, which was much more than the typical earnings of Kigali women. The success and sense of ownership gave the women confidence and dignity to no longer rely on support from others. They felt confident in choosing for themselves what they wanted. In the next two blinks, you’ll discover what we can learn from the failures of traditional aid programs. While there are many unfounded myths about developing countries, one is true: corruption is rife and it is stifling prosperity. Where does corruption stem from? Simply put, it stems from a lack of accountability. For example if no one tracks where a charity’s money goes or how productively it is being used, it’s highly likely that someone is taking advantage to profit. Novogratz discovered this trend when, after her time in Rwanda, she travelled to Kenya to write a report for UNICEF about women’s groups funded by foreign aid. There she found that a lack of accountability had made the Kenyan government highly corrupt. It was in the position to choose which projects should be funded based on a bidding competition, and blatantly abused its power by asking for a “fee” of 20 percent of the funding to secure the winning bid. Corruption and lack of accountability lead to bad services, as money is skimmed from project funding and no one feels responsible for seeing that the project delivers what it’s supposed to. Corruption and lack of accountability mean that donor-funded projects, started with the best of intentions, often fail. For example, maize mills that have been built throughout Africa as part of a plan to energize local economies have been found idle, because there’s no fuel to run them or no one in the community knows how to fix them. In many cases, projects never produce enough benefits to cover their initial investment. Having those involved fully accountable means earnings are more likely to return on the investment and projects are more likely to have the positive impact the investors, donors, and recipients intended. People in the developed world often take trust for granted. When, for example, you hire a builder, you probably trust her to deliver a house that is built according to regulations. And if the builder cheats you, the justice system will hold her accountable. But in the developing world, trust cannot be taken for granted in the same way, there being a lack of regulatory agency or lawful judicial participation. Novogratz experienced this different standard of trust firsthand, when the guard she had hired to watch her house stole her money, jewelry and clothes. This was after she had given him about two months’ extra salary to cover his children’s school fees. Ironically, the guard’s name was Innocent. Faced with this betrayal, she naturally wanted to report Innocent to the police. But doing so in Rwanda would have been an unfairly severe punishment, for the local criminal justice system is brutal and unreliable. Because she could trust neither Innocent nor the justice system, her only option was to fire him. The Rwandan government exemplifies and reinforces this lack of trust by going to public places regularly to spy on what people are saying about politicians. This underpinning of a lack of trust severely hurts a nation’s potential for development. Novogratz found that in Karachi, Pakistan, though half the population lives in slums, they don’t sign on for affordable housing planning because they lack trust. In the past, housing developers promised affordable housing and never delivered, so poor people today are skeptical of being swindled. One manager for such a project even had to live on the construction site in order to build trust with the locals who watched him closely. In the last blink, you’ll discover an alternative philanthropy tool to traditional aid. One truth that often surprises people is that giving your money away so that it is used efficiently is actually much harder than earning it! This problem is evidenced by the frequent failures of philanthropic schemes in the developing world. And not only is philanthropy failing to lift people out of poverty: traditional financial investment is too. Investors are falling short because they often refuse to lend to poor people, viewing them as unlikely to provide immediate returns. However, there is a third way: neither philanthropy nor traditional business, but a combination of the two. This approach is called patient capital: money is invested into projects over long periods of time with the understanding that returns may be below market expectations. This approach focuses on developing and supporting the enterprise, not giving handouts or earning quick returns. The author’s venture capital fund Acumen does exactly this. It invests, often large amounts, into entrepreneurial schemes that aim to deliver important social benefits, like safe water systems and low-cost, quality housing to impoverished areas. The patient capital approach combines the best parts of philanthropic and market approaches. As for a normal investment, patient capital expects to see returns from the funding it provides. This approach avoids the pitfall of giving money without attaching accountability. What’s more, patient capital entrusts funds to local people instead of allowing outsiders, so-called experts, to decide where the money is spent. This way the people who are most familiar with their local problems can be in control of where to invest in solutions. In a housing project in Pakistan, for example, its organiser was a local man, Tasneem Siddiqui, who had a unique understanding of the local people, the kind of understanding that comes with being part of the community. He knew what they wanted: first to build small homes for themselves and then gradually expand as they could afford to. He also helped Acumen decide which land to build on, as he knew more about the land than an outside expert could. And he helped Acumen gain support in the community. Only an organizer with such local knowledge could prove so crucial to a project’s success. The key message in this book: Traditional development aid often fails because the recipients of the aid are not held accountable, and because local people are not empowered to decide how to best use it. A new form of philanthropic investment called patient capital has shown some promising results in addressing these issues. Actionable advice: Put yourself in the shoes of others. Often when we think of helping others, we develop our own ideas about what would work best and then follow through on our own perception of solutions. But, to truly help others, we should first find out what they want and need, not what we think they want and need. To truly understand others, we can put ourselves in others’ shoes. Live with those you are trying to help, and face the daily adversities they face.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Opponents and supporters continue to clash about this complicated     energy source. Opponents see a new disaster ahead: fracking is a reckless industry pushing forward while we lack an understanding of the risks. Supporters sees the chance for energy independence and a smooth transformation towards renewable energy. Which side is right? Unfortunately, the issue isn’t black and white. In these blinks, you’ll learn about fracking’s speedy history, and the reasons that people are so divided on it. You’ll also learn: why supporters use a different “F” word for fracking; why fracking developed almost entirely because of one company; why people used to search for oil just by digging into the ground and hoping they were lucky; why the fracking industry quickly blunders ahead without understanding the consequences; and why some people believe that fracking could lead us to a safer and cleaner environment. When we first started mining for oil, the process was much simpler than it is today. Oil wells were quite accessible, and the oil came up easily. However, as the flow of oil slowed, many wells closed, so people had to turn to other energy resources. One largely untapped resource was the supply of shale gas trapped inside rocks. The process of releasing the oil and gas inside rocks is called fracking, and the first experiments to extract it began after the American Civil War. The first tool for fracking rocks was the “petroleum torpedo.” It was lowered into the ground and exploded, pressing water into the rocks and releasing the gas and oil. The petroleum torpedo, however, was expensive and dangerous. Oil wells were still favorable at the time. Fracking experiments after WWII also had limited success. A new process called hydrofrac treatment was used to try to make existing wells more productive. Water and sand were pressed into the rock, so that the sand would stay in the rock after the water was removed, creating an opening for gas. Hydrofrac treatment worked, but most of the gas still remained trapped inside. Further experiments were still unable to convince the industry to frack widely in the US. Between 1967 and 1973, the US Atomic Energy Commission even attempted using atom bombs for fracking. This process was eventually abandoned, because the gas released was radioactive, and the experiments were met with protest. Even the energy crisis in the 1970s didn't lead to a new search for domestic gas and oil. The Unconventional Gas Research Program was given very little funding: $30 million in its best year. Overall, domestic efforts to extract shale gas were largely abandoned. It was much easier to get oil and gas in foreign countries. Most people are unaware of how far oil drilling technology has come. Actually, people used to just drill into the ground and hope they hit oil! The technology for extracting oil and gas was developed before the technology for locating it. Sometimes oil could be seen from the ground, but other methods had to be used when it couldn't. Early methods were very imprecise. Wildcatters tried to predict the locations of oil reserves by analyzing reports, or just through random trials. Success was far from guaranteed. Prediction technology would eventually improve drastically, but there was still a need to find new ways to pump out the oil and gas. This was difficult, however, because using and developing new drilling technologies was quite risky and expensive. Most people continued to use traditional techniques, even though they weren't completely efficient, and there was little investment in new technological development. Modern fracking eventually proved to be the answer. Interestingly, it was first made possible by a very small company. Fracking works by pressing water mixed with sand and chemicals down a well at a high pressure, so many people thought it was dangerous. Larger companies typically didn't think it was worth the risk. Small companies had limited sites where they could drill and a greater need to extract as much gas as possible when they did manage to find it. In 1998, a small company performed the first successful modern frack. The arrival of successful fracking meant that shale stone was no longer a barrier to extracting gas. Before fracking, only sandstone was seen as a potential source of gas. Fracking opened up an entirely new market for gas and oil extraction. In and of itself, fracking seems quite illogical. Oil can't be mixed with water or else it won't be pure, yet fracking relies on blasting high-pressured water to release oil and gas. The new field of shale gas and oil fracking needed investment in order to grow. Some people had to take personal risks. A company called Chesapeake, founded in 1989, became a huge energy player and greatly accelerated the development of fracking. The CEO, Aubrey McClendon, bought vasts amounts of land and kept drilling more and more wells – all at the risk of his company and himself. Within years, shale gas became a major energy source in the US, mostly due to Chesapeake. However, Chesapeake was only able to fund this development by attaining huge loans from Wall Street investors. Chesapeake's debt grew into the billions, eventually leading to McClendon stepping down, but not before he became one of the most famous and wealthiest energy CEOs of all time. Fracking was developed further as the energy community shared more knowledge and experience about it. Different companies allowed their engineers to visit each other's drilling sites to share data and convince everyone of the advantages to be gained by using water to frack rocks. Because of this, fracking techniques continued to improve. After 1998, fracking engineers eventually discovered that horizontal drilling was more effective than vertical drilling. This process is still used today. Many of the engineers were motivated to improve fracking not only for profits, but rather because they wanted to help the country. Some people feared that the US might run out of domestic energy sources. Overall, fracking was able to progress rapidly after the initial investments and technological breakthroughs of the late 1980s and early 1990s. All over the world, land ownership is crucial for oil and gas drilling. In the US, however, the search for natural resources and fossil fuels was different because of two special conditions. Land in the US is primarily privately owned, meaning that the resources on it belong to the owner. Landowners can thus reap huge profits if they allow drilling on their land. This system is rather uncommon. In most countries, including Saudi Arabia, Mexico and other countries in Europe and Africa, oil and gas belong to the state. That means the state also has to take the risk of investing in oil or gas development. There's another special condition in the US that helps drilling. The surface and mineral rights to a plot of land can be divided. So, you can buy a house and the surface of the ground, but the former owner might still own the mineral rights below the ground. If oil or gas is detected, the owner of the mineral rights is allowed to drill, even if someone else has the surface rights. In other words, the US has a highly pro-drilling legal framework. The quick development of shale gas drilling started with a land grab for shale. Chesapeake sent out workers called landmen to research and attain land. Landmen would research who owned which areas and then negotiate with owners to buy plots, mineral rights or the right to drill on private property. Chesapeake built its success on its landmen and their transactions. Previously, large oil companies had negotiated directly with governments, not thousands of individuals. The role of the landmen changed the nature of the energy market. McClendon didn't merely take part in the shale land grab – he invented it. To keep his system alive, he needed a constant flow of cash. He needed foreign investors who trusted his business model. In 2008, the US entered a severe economic crisis. Shale gas companies were certainly hit by the crisis, but it eventually led to a shale gas boom that overcame the recession. The expansion of the fracking industry has created many new jobs, and shale gas companies typically pay high wages. Fracking in the US allows for the market price to decrease, making domestic gas production competitive with foreign sources and reducing American dependence on volatile foreign sources. Also, not only is fracking a source of well-paying jobs in the US, as well as a means to affordable gas prices, but it also means that energy-intensive industries can reopen their facilities domestically, rather than abroad. The expansion of domestic energy sources has other benefits, not only for Americans. As the US decreases its dependency on oil from OPEC countries, it's likely to launch less intervention in them to protect oil interests. However, there's still a limit to the number of wells that can be drilled because in the end, shale gas is a finite resource. Shale gas fracking provides a tremendous new opportunity, but it alone isn't a solution to the energy crisis. Many people believe fracking could be a valuable way to buy time until better energy resources are developed. American oil production peaked in 1970, which peak-oil theories had predicted leading up to 1970. In 2008, production was at half of its former peak, but it began to increase again. It's still increasing now, and it's unclear when we'll hit the next peak. Shale gas extraction is likely the last possible way American oil production can keep increasing. After all shale gas and oil is extracted, further digging won't be possible. Some people view fracking as the potential bridge to renewable energy. For others, it's a dangerous last attempt to extract fossil fuels. What's the truth? Well, fracking isn't black and white. Gas plants are more environmentally friendly than coal plants, but burning gas is still not good for the environment. Fracking therefore both benefits and harms the environment. Fossil fuels have some advantages that renewable energy does not: they're very dense, and they can be transported easily. Fossil fuels are also much more consistent than many forms of renewable energy. Solar and wind power, for example, only work under favorable weather conditions. People who rely on solar and wind powered energy need back up energy sources or a means of energy storage such as batteries. Gas plants, on the other hand, can be turned on and off much faster than nuclear or coal plants. Although fracking “extends the age of fossil fuels”, which may be an age we’re eager to end, we do still have an ongoing need for fossil fuel energy. One advantage of shale gas is that it buys us more time to develop better renewable energy sources. Fracking itself is still a rather new technology. Fracking also helps develop local communities, but there's often tension between fracking companies and the residents near them. Shale gas companies bring in money, but the use of land is often a point of tension. Local farmers who allow fracking on their land of course want their best fields to be spared. They also want their water protected and as few trees cut as possible. By contrast, most fracking companies only want easy access to the shale in the ground. While farmers on adjacent land or with conflicting land interests often clash with fracking companies, most local protest comes from residents who want to protect the peace and quiet of their rural areas and may be concerned about fracking’s effects on local water sources. You can see the divided opinion on fracking in the way people write the word. Supporters write it “fracing” which is closer to the “fracturing” in “hydraulic fracturing”. Critics call it “fracking” because it's closer to the vulgar f-word. In the early 2000s, many environmental activists promoted the use of gas over coal, believing it to be a better alternative. At the time, fracking was seen as an alternative to building more coal plants. It was generally viewed more positively than it is today. Early on, environmental activists saw gas as a possible bridge to more renewable energy. Others criticized this stance for being a fracking-friendly position. For example, the Sierra Club, one of the most important American environmental organizations, had a positive position on fracking after 2006. Although local branches argued against its environmental hazards, the Sierra Club’s national stance was in favor. Eventually it was revealed that the organization had received some private donations from McClendon, dismantling its credibility on the topic. Overall, the message of most pro-fracking environmentalists was that coal was the more serious problem, and even though gas isn't perfect, it was a much better option. It is true that gas does emit fewer carbon dioxide molecules than coal or oil, but it causes other problems. Today, many environmentalists have a negative position on fracking, even those who were early supporters. They believe that gas is not a solution to coal. Furthermore, as natural gas prices fall, it is shrinking the motivation for more expensive renewable energy development, rather than lengthening the opportunity to develop it. All in all, it's still debated whether or not shale gas is truly more environmentally friendly than coal. Drilling and fracking cause methane gas emissions, which do affect the earth's climate. Scientific studies remain split on gas's benefits and drawbacks, and further research is certainly needed. Fracking has developed very rapidly since 1998. It has advanced so quickly that little time, and attention has been given to developing safer techniques or researching its effects. Many people in the fracking industry are aware of the risks, but generally view them as manageable. A wide range of studies are needed to prove the potential dangers and consequences of fracking. Unfortunately, little money was devoted to research as fracking was developed. Problems that arose between fracking companies and local communities were also brushed off in some way – they were presented as misfortunes, or the offended or victimized people were simply compensated and forgotten. For many people, the biggest potential problem from fracking is cementing, the process that is meant to protect the water supply from contamination by pumping cement into the gap between the earth and water well casing. Good cementing is costly, not only in terms of money. Cementing must be very tightly controlled. If there are any small pores, water can come through, and searching for these pores is expensive. One engineer named Claude E. Cooke Jr. managed to invent a potentially crucial controlling device, but it's no longer produced, and there's no funding available for further production. Companies have generally continued with uncontrolled cementing and other risks and compensate people for any errors as they go. This strategy is easier and possibly cheaper than paying for safety research beforehand as well as the increased costs of enforcing stricter operating protocol. The fracking industry has grown rapidly, and as its potential continues, the industry needs to address recurring problems and improve environmental remediation protocol, to minimize harmful impact on the environment and adjacent communities and to protect its public image. It has to slow down and devote time and resources to perfecting the fracking process rather than blundering ahead. The key message in this book: The fracking industry has developed at an incredibly rapid pace in the last 25 years. In fact, it developed so rapidly that there still hasn’t been sufficient research to understand all of its consequences. It’s possible that fracking holds the key to the energy crisis, but the industry needs to slow down and perfect its process if we want to use shale gas without irresponsibly blundering the natural environment. Actionable advice: Fracking is complex. Consider where it falls for you on the spectrum of energy options. The fracking industry is presently reckless and has stirred up a lot of resentment in the environmentalist community. Caution is vital, but don’t forget that fracking might also buy us time while we develop affordable renewable energy technology.

Every day, thousands upon thousands of colorful containers, filled with every kind of good imaginable, from socks to iPods, are stacked and unstacked by enormous cranes and loaded onto massive ships where they’re sent off to the other side of the world: a marvel of order and efficiency.  Believe it or not, shipping used to be a slow and costly process. But the container turned the shipping industry on its head – and its impact reaches far beyond the shipping world. In these blinks, you’ll learn how containers made everything so damn cheap; why globalization would have been impossible without them; and  why the US army loves them. Have you ever thought about all the different places you’ve seen shipping containers? On trains, trucks and ships; some are even retrofitted to become people’s homes! But there's more to these ubiquitous industrial objects than meets the eye. That’s because the container isn’t just a box, but the core of an extraordinarily system that transports goods all over the world at unbeatably low prices.  On April 26, 1958, when the first 58 containers ever to be launched shipped from Newark, New Jersey, to Houston, Texas, nobody could’ve predicted the world-changing impact they would have. But today, the incredible speed with which containers load and unload has cut transportation costs so drastically that it’s the go-to solution for practically every company. For instance, in 1961, before international container use, ocean freight costs alone comprised 12 percent of the costs of US exports and 10 percent of those for imports. This expense, coupled with taxes and other transportation-related costs, meant that international trade was rarely profitable.  In fact, freight handling at ports used to be a major expense, but containers and the level of automation they make possible have greatly reduced these costs. Containers have also completely transformed the face of manufacturing: small, local operations have given way to huge companies that buy and sell globally, which has also enabled a reduction in consumer prices.  The container fundamentally altered the scale at which goods are traded. The companies that employed them became larger, better organized and more reliable, and it was all due to the container’s place in a highly efficient system of perfectly fitting components.  For instance, a 25-ton container of coffee at a factory in Malaysia can travel 9,000 miles to Los Angeles in just 16 days. From there, it can board a train to Chicago and then a truck to Cincinnati for a total trip of 11,000 miles in a mere 22 days. That’s 500 miles a day and the total cost of shipping is less than a single first-class plane ticket.  When you think about a port, what’s the mental image you get? Well, if you’re imagining droves of sweating, muscle-bound workers, you might be surprised to learn that they’ve largely been replaced by heavy machinery, like cranes.  However, shipping once was an extremely labor-intensive business, with somewhere between 60 and 75 percent of all shipping costs being tied to the docks. As containers became increasingly prevalent, the demand for dock workers became less regular, which gave rise to both corrupt job hunting methods and stronger social bonds between workers.  Government regulation decreased corruption but the fellowship among the workers remained. Ports were essentially their own social worlds: children often followed in their parents’ footsteps and entire neighborhoods worked in nearby ports or at shipping-related jobs.  Entire livelihoods depended on the ports, but the work there could be dangerous – and even deadly. In fact, the industry had a higher injury rate than any other! The combination of generally poor working conditions and fear of job loss due to automation eventually brought about a resistance to any change and a culture of stealing. This began in the labor-intensive ports of the 1950s.  This pre-container maritime world of the 1950s was a much slower one. Most ships were small; their cargo the same. Not just that, but nearly every vessel held mixed goods bound for different destinations, which often made it necessary to unload everything before repacking a ship – a job guarantee for dock workers. Vessels were often in port for a week or more.  Though the idea of using boxes wasn't new in the 1950s, most containers were too small or couldn't be stacked, while others were simply overloaded. Non could go directly from train to ship, which meant they always had to be unloaded and reloaded. The list of problems with the early containers goes on: they were costly, because the boxes had to be returned; design flaws and the need to unpack resulted in poor usage of space; and the price of shipping varied from item to item.  But who came up with the idea?  You might be surprised to hear that container shipping wasn’t invented by someone in the maritime world, but by an outsider. His name was Malcolm McLean, a self-made trucking mogul battling regulation.  In the wake of World War II, just about everything was regulated. Even the cost of shipping was fixed – and it was killing competition. In the trucking industry, the Interstate Commerce Commission, or the ICC, only let companies haul approved commodities on approved routes at approved rates.  The regulatory bodies were purely interested in order, not efficiency, which made transportation extremely inefficient. McLean, who'd already made a fortune, had a revolutionary idea: Why not put truck trailers on ships instead of driving them through congested coastal highways? But that would’ve gone against regulations, so McLean left the trucking business and went into shipping. He began searching for outside expertise and came up with a totally new approach to the industry.  The first thing he realized was that trailers with wheels would take up too much space and that movable boxes were preferable. He then found an aluminum box manufactured by the company Brown Industries and set his sights on transforming cranes into loading machines. But just as McLean’s plan was coming together, the railroads objected, and it wasn’t until after their protests were overruled by the ICC that the first container transport was ready to launch.  So, McLean’s genius wasn’t to invent the container but to bring a radically new idea into the shipping industry. Because for him, it was about moving goods, not sailing ships.  However, container shipping wasn’t an immediate success. Even though packing in cells allowed containers to be unloaded and loaded at once – a major point of interest for competitors – the containers weren’t welcome everywhere. In fact, after McLean’s company, Pan-Atlantic, began serving Puerto Rico, they were met with huge, costly strikes at the docks of San Juan. Longshoremen feared that containers were going to put them out of work. Handling containers is nothing like handling barrels and sacks. This change in the industry necessitated both new skilled workers and new ports. The transformation of the Port of New York epitomizes how ports transformed worldwide:  Until the early 1950s, New York’s port was doing great business, handling one-third of America’s ocean shipments. However, goods produced in other cities had to be transported to New Jersey by train and then taken to New York on small ships where they were put on larger ones. The logical solution was to produce goods in New York. But when McLean began looking for harbor space and New York had none to offer, he found a spot in Newark, New Jersey, a location that, unlike New York, had easy access to highways and railroads. So, what was once New York's advantage – namely, the proximity of the port to manufacturers – became its disadvantage when New Jersey, which could easily expand, became the new hub for container shipping in the New York area. Strikes and theft were also making New York even less desirable. The lack of space for terminals hindered New York’s ability to expand, while the Port of New Jersey, which had the space, had a number of ship lines relocated there.  Jobs were also transformed. Between 1967 and 1976, the number of factories in New York decreased by one-fourth and the city lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs. Additionally, the port was no longer a major employer, so the unions, aware of the changes taking place, began fighting the container. After all, the early container ships required just one-sixth of the time and one-third of the labor that previous cargo ships had.  It was ultimately a question of automation and modernization. The unions feared lost jobs and companies didn’t want to battle over every technological development. After many years of difficult negotiations, a compromise was reached in the 1960s: the shipping companies set aside money for their workers’ retirements and instated a guaranteed payment system. In exchange, the unions let modernization run its course. For the components of a system to work interchangeably you need everyone involved to agree on some basic principles. But as we all know from the ever so complex task of choosing a place to eat out, reaching a consensus isn’t always easy.  So although containers were all the transportation world was talking about in the late 1950s, there was still no agreement on what shape and size they should be. The Marine Steel Corporation offered 30 different container models! Then, in 1958, the US Maritime Administration attempted to set standards for the container. After all, there was an urgent demand as more and more companies wanted to use them. However, the Maritime Administration only had control over domestic standards and could only hope that others would follow its guidelines. Not to mention that there was also the American Standards Association, a group supported by private industry that was also rearing to set standards.  The industry needed an international standard and eventually the market made the decision. So while Sea-Land, McLean’s company, continued to use 35-foot containers for years, everyone else went with 20- or 40-foot models, and the internationally accepted 10- and 30-foot sizes weren’t used anymore. That’s why the 20- and 40- foot containers are standard today.  Yet another international agreement was reached regarding the corner-fitting and locking systems – one that employed Sea-Land’s patent. However, when these systems were put into practice, there were multiple failures. For instance, the norm set by the International Organization for Standardization had to be changed for them to be secure and everything went too fast for the necessary tests to be conducted.  The consequence was that the committees involved didn’t end up with the best technical and economic standards; instead, the market had to adapt to a system based on compromise, which had been instated in the mid-1960s. As with countless other game-changing innovations, the container faced many obstacles before it became the standard it is today. And, as is often the case, antiquated ways of thinking were what held it back.  One major roadblock in the spread of containerized transport was that ship line cartels set fixed shipping prices. These prices were based on an old mentality that costs should match the type of good being shipped, e.g., a per-mile price for coffee. So despite the fact that containers were faster and more efficient, though not necessarily capable of shipping more of any given good, the increased efficiency didn’t mean lower prices for consumers.  Another issue was that the railroads and trucking companies were unwilling to make the switch to containers. This was due to an ICC regulation that made it less appealing to invest in new container carriers. And with no single rail company spanning the entire country, the container was faced with the challenge of seeking a consensus between many different railroad operators.  While railroads were the best option for long-distance cargo transport, trucks were better suited for local distribution and some railroads even began shipping trucks but failed to link this practice to shipping in general. Railroads in Europe began adapting to containers during the latter part of the 1960s, meanwhile, the US railroads fought containerization by jacking up their prices.  Eventually, however, the major obstacles were removed and containerization took off. It was at this point that construction of the first ships specifically designed to handle containers began. The change was momentous: in 1966, only three lines ran international container services; by mid-1967, that number had jumped to 60! When you think about the Vietnam War it’s unlikely that containers come to mind, but they actually played an essential role.  In the winter of 1965, the United States began quickly amassing troops in Vietnam. The result was a logistical catastrophe as the entire country only had one deepwater port, a single railroad line and a disconnected highway system.  Another issue was that the sections of the US military employed 16 different logistical systems and, when president Johnson first ordered troops into Vietnam, there were no organized supply chains in place. For instance, ships had to remain at bay and be unloaded by ferries, an extremely time-consuming process.  So, the US Army attempted to solve the problem by building one port in Cam Ranh Bay, south of Saigon, and another one closer to the capital, called “Newport.” However, as the stream of troops steadily increased, so did the problems; cargo that needed individual handling was just too time intensive.  To solve their issues, the Army consulted shipping executives and, after he entered the conversation, McLean became obsessed with bringing container ships to Vietnam. It wasn’t long before McLean convinced the Army of his strategy; in March of 1967 he signed a contract for Vietnam. Sea-Land would provide seven ships, tend to the shipping terminals and use their own trucks to deliver within a 30-mile radius of the piers, all for a fixed price per ton. But Sea-Land also turned Cam Ranh Bay into a modern container port, replete with a state-of-the-art computer system that tracked every container. The Army couldn’t have been happier, but for Sea-Land there was an added bonus. On the way back to the United States their ships would stop in Japan, which was the world’s fastest-growing economy at the time. McLean boosted his profits by shipping containers between Japan and the United States, fostering the containerization of Japan in the process. As we’ll see, all of this shipping action in Asia was just a prelude; containers would eventually help connect the entire world more closely.  While it’s possible to start a business today with little capital, the container business was always one of big investments. This was especially true for ports that had to spend on infrastructure to get their share of container traffic.  That’s because containerization meant only shipping through the few ports that were the best connected and equipped. If you wanted to be one of those lucky ports, you had to have more train connections, the best cranes and even better logistics, none of which came cheap.  Some fell while others excelled. Take the United Kingdom, where Liverpool and London had been the maritime hubs. Unions at these ports launched anti-container campaigns, fearing that the new automated system would eliminate jobs and a government container port in Tilbury, outside of London, was shut down for months due to striking workers. At the same time, Sea-Land invested in transforming the small private port of Felixstowe into the major UK container handler that it remains to this day, leaving London in the dust.  But ports weren’t the only place that investment was necessary. For ship lines to gain market share, they had to put up the money for container ships. In fact, at the end of the ’60s, the demand for container ships had spiked and, while the first ones had been cheap, old World War II vessels, the new ones were big investments.  However, the benefits of container transport were innumerable: lower packaging costs, decreased insurance rates and an easier option for shipping things like electronics. While at first the new transports brought more competition with only marginal increases in the amount of freight shipped, the overcapacity of the industry started to produce serious price cuts in 1967. That’s because many of the container-shipping companies were struggling to stay afloat, even shipping half-full loads just to be able to afford costly repairs and rent for terminals.  As a result, the cartels fell apart and new consolidations formed between carriers like the joint venture in Germany between Hapag and Lloyd. While bigger isn’t always better, it definitely is when it comes to container shipping. So while the first container boom created an overcapacity for most shipbuilders and made container ships cheaper, container shippers, including McLean and his new company United State Lines, also began opting for bigger vessels.  That’s because bigger ships could operate with the same-sized crew and comparable fuel requirements as those half their size. The industry seized on what then became a lucrative cycle: lower operational costs per container also allowed shippers to cut their prices and receive more orders in return. Naturally, with more freight came more income, thereby enabling greater investments.  For instance, in 1978 a single ship could hold more containers than had come through every port in America combined during an average week in 1968 – that’s 3,500 20-foot containers! But larger ships necessitated larger ports, because the bigger the port, the bigger the vessels it could serve and the faster it could get them unloaded, packed and back to sea. Bigger ports also often had deeper berths, a greater number of faster-moving cranes, superior shipment-tracking technology and better road and rail connections. As a result, port investments went through the roof, but rapid developments likewise made it possible for a harbor to lose its ship lines to a newer, bigger harbor from one year to the next.  However, as the ships grew so did the debts. At the dawn of the 1980s, many ship lines were struggling to stay afloat. The global economy was also in trouble. Overcapacity was affecting prices and, despite all predictions, the price of oil was falling.  For McLean, the slow but fuel-efficient ships he had invested in were no longer competitive and failed to bring in the profits necessary to pay his debts. In 1986, McLean declared bankruptcy – the biggest bankruptcy case in US history. But container shipping itself was here to stay and the industry overall was destined for steady growth. The emergence of the container immediately affected the maritime world, but the impact containerization had on the global economy took some time to develop. In fact, it wasn’t until around 1977 that containers truly affected industries outside of shipping, like manufacturing and wholesaling.  Containers didn’t require warehouses and were harder to rob, yielding lower insurance rates and fewer damages. But the largest impact containers had on the global economy came when prices started to drop dramatically.  Here’s what happened: In the early 1970s, Australian shippers and manufacturers pooled their power in an attempt to depress prices. The two facets of industry went with independent carriers instead of shipping conferences, i.e., the monopolistic method employed by the cartels. As the conferences were forced to accept price reductions, they eventually fell apart.  This made space for independent carriers, who were gaining market share and growing quickly. Take Maersk from Denmark: in 1973, it built its first container ship. But by 1981, it was the third-largest container shipper in the world! The company’s size let it offer service that was both flexible and reliable at unprecedented prices.  Another major change was deregulation. When US President Ford took away much of the ICC’s authority over trucks in 1975, it resulted in the eventual deregulation of railroads in 1980. The changes enabled price deals for major customers and investments in new rail cars that transported containers on long-term contracts, while providing for seamless transitions between the different forms of transport: now containers could move easily from trains to trucks to ships.  The result was an overall decline in transportation costs that enabled the transportation of manufacturing parts and on-the-dot production without wholesalers or warehouses. In fact, prior to the 1980s, logistics was only a military term. By 1985, logistics management was a routine function of business.  Transportation only rose in significance as prices dropped, and it was all thanks to the container. Today, for example, it’s cheaper to buy parts from one continent and assemble the final product in another!     The container made shipping cheaper and more efficient, and its impact on the global economy created a more interconnected world. The key message in this book: The rise of container shipping has been a fundamental force in driving globalization. That’s because the transportation revolution that containerization brought on enabled the interconnected economy of the modern world. However, containerization was no quick success story, overcoming countless obstacles to make the impact that it has today.  Actionable advice: Although container shipping has globalized the market, it’s still essential to consider transportation when choosing a location. Just because containerization has globalized markets doesn’t mean that the transportation costs of a region are irrelevant. In fact, countries with inefficient ports or little container ship service suffer from huge disadvantages that even rock-bottom labor costs can’t make up for. Therefore it’s essential to take transportation infrastructure and the related costs into consideration when planning a location for your operations. For instance, landlocked countries with little infrastructure struggle to break into other markets. Just take China where, in 2002, transporting a container from a central city to port cost three times more than shipping that same container to America! Got feedback?

This is where capitalism 2.0 comes in. This new way of doing business aims not only to create wealth but also save the world – and it’s the clearest path to solving many of our global problems. Social entrepreneurship combines profit motives with social problem solving. Businesses don’t just sell products; they sell with the added aim of curbing poverty, fighting disease and providing essential infrastructure so everyone, company and customer, benefits. So forget about making that quick buck. These blinks show how capitalism 2.0 is about focusing on long-term wealth and prosperity – which won’t happen if we’re destroying the world. In these blinks, you’ll learn why social entrepreneurship is more effective than charitable giving; why today’s social entrepreneurs come from the millennial generation; and how successful social entrepreneurs focus on the cause of a problem, not the symptoms. What do you know about the concept of social entrepreneurship? You might question whether such a concept is even possible, as it certainly costs plenty of money to tackle issues such as climate change or poverty. Social entrepreneurs seek out investors who are interested in making both a social impact and seeing a return on their investment. Such investments are called impact investments. An impact investment differs from a regular investment because the intent behind the investment is rooted in the desire for social change. In other words, the goal of an impact investment is to create a beneficial social impact. To measure success, it’s necessary to account for profits, as well as the amount of social good inspired by the investment. A survey by the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) and JPMorgan Chase found that in 2014, some 146 impact investors invested a total of $10.6 billion in projects. According to the report, 91 percent of impact investors experienced returns that met or exceeded expectations and a whopping 98 percent said the social impact of the investment was in line with or exceeded what they expected. So from an investor’s perspective, impact investments are effective. When it comes to companies, however, it’s also possible to turn a profit while changing the world for the better. Just like an impact investor, a business can make a social impact, too. While many companies already have sustainability departments or donate to charity, social entrepreneurship works differently by making the social impact of charity as central to the business as profits. The author’s real estate agency, for example, had a social mission. For every deal it closed, a portion of proceeds went to a charity that builds wells in communities without access to clean water. Focusing on this social good gave the young company a competitive advantage, and helped it attract new clients. This example proves that it’s possible to make money while addressing social issues. When you think of the word “charity,” you undoubtedly think positive thoughts. And why wouldn’t you? Giving money to a needy cause is a good thing, right? The truth is that charities aren’t always up to snuff. In fact, many established charities aren’t effective at all, as their operations focus on costs rather than social change. Why is this the case? When people donate to a charity, they want their money to do good and not just get lost in the bureaucratic process. This pressure makes charities focus on minimizing costs, affecting even the necessary overheads that can be essential to producing the desired impact. In short, random cost-cutting can be detrimental to a charity’s mission. So charities should instead focus on measuring social impact and not just on trimming administrative fat. When charities don’t directly measure the impact of donations, they may start to feel as if they’re pouring money into a black hole, getting nothing in return. This doesn’t make them very attractive to prospective donors. But it’s not just that charities fall short in creating a positive impact; sometimes they can have negative effects on a community. For instance, in his book Banker to the Poor, Bangladeshi microfinancer Muhammad Yunus says that charity in general is a way of diverting responsibility rather than ending poverty. Here’s another example: since 1997, the National Football League has shipped T-shirts of the losing Super Bowl team to Africa as a charitable act. Yet those free T-shirts have destroyed the local clothing industry in many communities, leaving people even poorer than before. Having learned from its mistakes, today the NFL works in conjunction with local distributors to send shirts only to communities that truly need and want them. When social entrepreneurs talk about the bottom of the pyramid, they’re referring to the four billion people who live in developing countries and earn less than $1,500 a year. This demographic represents a huge potential market. How huge? Approximately $5 trillion. Even though this group doesn’t earn much, they do account for over 50 percent of the world’s population and are therefore the largest untapped market in the world. Given these astounding facts, producing products that meet the needs of the bottom of the pyramid might not be such a terrible idea. While it might feel “wrong” to make products that people with little money should buy, remember that poor people also want products that make their lives simpler and safer. Some companies have already targeted this market. Multinational company Unilever maintains over 400 brands, covering food, personal care and cleaning products, and takes in over $60 billion in annual revenue. In 2015, 60 percent of company sales derived from emerging markets. In another example, doctors in Vietnam were treating babies for jaundice using donated phototherapy devices, machines that use light to cure illness. Yet they were getting poor results. The Medical Technology Transfer and Services (MTTS), a for-profit company, wondered why this was the case. Company researchers found that the doctors were treating two babies with one device, meaning that neither child was getting the required amount of light to effect a cure. Inspired, MTTS engineers developed a sleek device that specifically could hold only one baby at a time. Their design was a success; the doctors and patients liked the stylish machines, and more babies received the correct treatment. Remember that the people at the bottom of the pyramid want the same things that every person wants: quality products and simple design. If your product satisfies those conditions, you can tap a vast market while providing products to people who need them. Have you ever tried kicking a habit such as smoking? When you work to change a behavior, there’s always a risk of falling back into old patterns. In today’s society, however, there are two groups that have the power to sustain a lasting transformation to capitalism 2.0: kickstarters and millennials. Unlike generations of wealthy donors before them, kickstarters aren’t interested in just writing checks and checking out. Kickstarters have learned a lot from old capitalist habits, which means this group is ready for results and will gladly contribute to making those results happen. Instead, kickstarters want to make sure that their money actually has an impact on the world. Consequently, kickstarter investors often do everything in their power to arm a social entrepreneur with the tools he or she needs to succeed. EBay co-founder Jeff Skoll, for example, formed the Skoll Foundation to invest over $500 million in social ventures. Recipients of the annual Skoll Awards for social entrepreneurs don’t just get money but also enjoy institutional support for three years, as well as access to the network of previous Skoll Award recipients. While kickstarters are crucial to financially supporting social ventures, today’s social entrepreneurs come from the group of people born between 1980 and 2000, known as the millennials. This generation grew up in an era in which powerful mass technology such as smartphones was common, offering them instant connections with the world, and instant gratification at their fingertips. Simultaneously, this group also came of age at a time when societal problems, such as global warming, appear to have reached crisis point. Because of this, many of the millennial generation want to change the world for the better, and they want that change to happen now. This desire means a majority of millennials aspire to entrepreneurship. In 2014, Bentley University released a study that found only 13 percent of students wanted to climb the corporate ladder, while 67 percent wanted to launch their own companies. Let’s learn how an aspiring entrepreneur can build a social enterprise. If you want to bake a carrot cake, you can’t use a cheesecake recipe. In a similar vein, just because a social enterprise is a business, doesn’t mean it can follow the same rules as a regular, for-profit company. When it comes to launching a social enterprise, there are several factors for which you should account. Let’s examine two of them. First, a social entrepreneur should focus on the cause of a problem, not the symptoms. To have a real impact, you need to get to the root of an issue. In Africa, many people were falling ill as open cooking fires and poor ventilation made the air in their homes unsafe to breathe. The company African Clean Energy looked at the problem logically. Instead of focusing on simply treating sick people, the company designed a new, environmentally friendly stove to replace the polluting open cooking fires. Importantly, when your company offers a solution to an underlying problem, people will jump to purchase your product. Families were happy to find a product that could keep them and their children healthy and meet a daily need efficiently. Second, be sure to measure the impact of your activities. Metrics are your holy grail. No responsible social entrepreneur should be unaware of to what extent his product or service is making an impact. To this end, it’s important to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of your actions. Effectiveness refers to the extent to which problems are solved; efficiency considers how much in resources or cash was spent to achieve a result. For instance, if you want to bring electricity to a community off the grid, your company’s effectiveness would be the number of people that have working lights thanks to your efforts. Your efficiency would be the amount of money you spent relative to the income generated by selling your product. Once you’ve measured your success, the final step for a social entrepreneur is to scale up. Every business faces challenges regardless of industry. The biggest hurdle for social entrepreneurs, however, is how to ensure a lasting impact. If you don’t scale your business, the issue you’re tackling will not go away, or could get even get worse. If you want to make a difference, you need to make your product widely available. One strategy is to create an inexpensive product and offer it to lower-income people at the bottom of the pyramid. For instance, social enterprise d.light created a solar-powered light for people living without electricity by taking advantage of the dropping costs of solar panels, batteries and LEDs. By designing an affordable light, the company was able to sell it widely, and today, d.light has over 51 million customers in 60 countries. It’s also important to let go of any fear that you’ll fail. Remember that failure can be the next step to a brighter future. New York City officials lamented that some 50 percent of youth offenders after serving time at Rikers Island prison returned to jail after committing more crimes. The city approached Goldman Sachs to invest $9.6 million in a government program aimed at lowering recidivism rates. This was not a loan in the traditional sense; instead, the returns on this social impact bond were tied to the program’s success. If the city could cut recidivism rates by more than 10 percent, for example, Goldman Sachs would make a profit of up to $2.1 million. In the end, the program wasn’t able to achieve the desired reductions, yet investors didn’t see the experiment as a complete loss – clients’ interest in social impact bonds grew, inspiring Goldman Sachs to pursue other social impact programs, such as one to improve the reading levels of preschoolers. The key message in this book: It’s possible to make money while working on social causes, and many investors and entrepreneurs are already making a difference while enjoying impressive profits. Social entrepreneurship in a capitalism 2.0 world is here to stay, and we as a global society will all benefit.  Actionable advice:   Measure your impact with IRIS!

But, as you’ll learn from these blinks, it’s actually becoming more and more relevant, particularly if you own a business. Through their online presence, young people are now profoundly interconnected, much like the inhabitants of a small village. And, as it would in a village, any news about your business will spread quickly – whether you are donating to an orphanage, developing great products, mistreating your employees or poisoning a river with industrial waste.  In contrast to traditional villagers, however, the well-informed new generation of customers is acutely aware of environmental problems and social injustices occurring well beyond their hometowns. In these blinks, you’ll learn about modern-day consumers’ high ethical standards, as well as how exactly you can bring these young people on board as customers: stop obsessing over bottom lines, start shouldering more responsibility for the welfare of the planet and never, ever, try to lie to them.  In these blinks, you’ll also find out how brands are making your life easier; why, in the near future, marketing as we know it will die; and why these days, even bleach comes with an attitude attached to it. We all know the cliché of the ruthless businessman who will go to any lengths to cut costs and maximize profits, regardless of the ethical implications. It was during the twentieth century that this stereotype reached its peak.  Back then, it was cool to be bad if you could earn a fortune doing it. Bad behavior was admired in celebrities and entertainers. Mass media and its readers loved nothing more than to worship those that acted naughty.  But times are changing. Young consumers today know and care about the impact of their lifestyle on the environment. Working conditions and quality of life around the world are challenges that mobilize individuals, companies and even celebrities. It seems as if we’re all determined to make the world a better place; where did this change in perspective come from? Well, this is the information age, after all! Thanks to the internet, as well as regulations for honest product labelling, shoppers today have loads of information about everything they buy. Whether it’s finding out how products were manufactured, where factories are located or even how energy efficient production processes are, the modern consumer buys products that are in line with their morals and values.  So, an elegant coat produced by a prestigious brand with stunning marketing at a great price won’t look so great once buyers discover that it was produced using child labor. In fact, most conscious buyers are likely to go online and share this kind of information on social networks, condemning brands and organizations as they see fit.  In order to win the favor of this new generation of discerning consumers, companies have no choice but to start genuinely caring about humanity and our planet.  How long does it take for a radical new invention to become a functional element of our daily lives? Sociologists have discovered that societies take around 40 years to wholeheartedly embrace a given innovation.  The revolutionary electric lightbulb was invented in 1880, yet it wasn’t until the 1920s that large public spaces were lit by tungsten bulbs. The world wide web was invented in 1990, but only 40 percent of the world’s population uses the internet today. Even so, it has already profoundly changed the way we live and interact.  Imagine what the world will be like when the internet has truly been integrated into society. We’ve already seen some radical examples of how powerful the internet can be. For example, in January 2011, it allowed young people in Egypt to organize and stage a revolution that shook the nation. Meanwhile, internet users on the other side of the world were able to follow that very revolution in real time.  We’re only two decades into using the internet and still have much to learn about the advantages and implications of living in a hyperconnected world. The intersection between new technologies and traditional morality has proven to be especially promising.  Our conscience goes hand-in-hand with our connectedness. We aren’t born with a conscience; rather, it's when we connect with others and learn of their ideas, hopes and fears that it truly emerges.  The way we behave impacts others’ lives, which is a basic lesson we learn at our church, mosque or temple, through our parents or teachers and in the playground with our kindergarten classmates. These experiences are what allows our conscience to develop and grow.  In our information age, we can also see how our actions have implications for people all around the world. The more connections we experience, the stronger and more advanced our conscience grows. This has resulted in a new conscience culture shared around the globe. In other words, a culture of empathy has taken the world by storm.  Whether you’re browsing news websites or chatting online with friends from countries affected by natural disasters, it’s hard to ignore the fact that the environment is very fragile. Gone are the days when climate change was argued to be a myth. Dried-up riverbeds, depleted reservoirs and rapidly melting icebergs simply can’t be denied. Nor can our role in these problems – today we know that each time we fly, we’re doing our bit to exacerbate global warming.  As the world around us seems to disintegrate, our internal health is also suffering. More and more people around the world suffer from illness and obesity because they depend on cheaply manufactured food products made with excessive sugar and unhealthy fats. Global warming and human health are just two examples of pressing problems that constantly make headlines online and in mass media worldwide. As a result, we’re able to learn quite a bit about these issues. The more people learn, the more they demand that solutions be found; this is something every business should keep in mind. The modern consumer cares about how their lifestyle impacts the world on a local, national and even international level. In turn, these consumers care about whether the businesses they buy from harm the environment, manipulate customers or mistreat employees. Unless they change their ways, unscrupulous companies are facing total elimination in the new conscience economy.  Ethically responsible companies are those that will thrive over the coming decades by ensuring that corporate culture prioritizes strong values and good causes over their own profits.  Culture is a complex thing. Our world consists of many different cultures, though the way they differ is often quite subtle. Consider the United States and the United Kingdom. Outwardly they may share several similar characteristics, including the same language.  But the ways in which they differ are crucial. In the United States, an ostensibly upbeat manager with a cheerleading attitude may be praised for his leadership skills; conversely, in a British context, people might consider the same behavior to be excessive or strange. Different generations also have their own cultures, as illustrated by the vast cultural differences between baby boomers and their children, or even the deeply differing experiences of Generations X and Y.  Yet another clash at the heart of society today is the one between conscience culture and established global culture. Like the established culture, conscience culture emphasizes self-actualization; but the way each culture views the self is radically different.  In conscience culture, we’re so connected to others around the world that the self is seen as part of a collective. We don’t seek to self-actualize alone, but together. In conscience culture, improving the lives of others and improving your own life are seen as equally valuable. A prevailing belief has emerged, positing that what’s good for other people is also good for you.  The contrast between our established culture and the emerging conscience culture is starkest when it comes to environmental protection. While previous generations grew up believing that they could count on the environment to provide for their needs, younger generations today have already witnessed how fragile and volatile the environment has become.  This, in turn, informs their purchasing decisions, which explains the overwhelming trend toward eco-friendly brands and businesses. Now that we know about the conscience culture, and that businesses have to adapt if they want to survive, let’s take a closer look at the changes companies should start making. Connecting with other people and understanding their needs is shaping both our conscience and the way we spend our money.  Not convinced? Say you’ve got the choice to buy from one of two brands. The first is famous for its stylish design, while the other is an influential supporter of sustainable technology and has also won awards for its design. Which one would you go for? Now, imagine you’re one of these brands. Which one would you prefer to be? Brands help us orient ourselves in a sea of buying options. Imagine shopping in a supermarket where products are all the same shape and color, completely devoid of brand names. You’ll definitely spend a lot of time reading labels!  Brands allow us to recognize and form attachments to manufacturers that are familiar and trustworthy. This way, we can head straight for them in the supermarket and make our shopping a lot more efficient.  And it’s not always reason or rationality that lie at the heart of these brand attachments. In fact, 80 percent of our decision making is actually based on our emotions, whereas only the remaining 20 percent is rational. Great brands naturally seek to trigger our emotions by developing an image that evokes certain empathetic emotions.  This is particularly important when it comes to conscience culture. The conscious consumer will seek out brands that resonate with her and her personal values. Likewise, people will reject any products or services associated with values that they don’t support.  Companies need to understand this new culture and attach an emotional message to their brands – even if they’re just selling bleach! Imagine a bleach brand that confidently claims to protect groundwater because it’s completely biodegradable – in addition to fighting diseases by killing germs. Plus, the same company supports health-related social enterprises abroad. If a brand of bleach can transmit this information to you, will you buy it or the brand next to it on the shelf that merely says “whiter than white”? Like it or not, companies are an integral part of society. We work in companies, we buy from companies and companies use our natural resources. As it happens, companies that focus on giving back to society are often those that consistently thrive.  The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has actually been around for a long time. It has its roots in the industrial revolution, when it became clear that factories were forcing inhumane working conditions on their employees.  In the nineteenth century, William Blake’s poetry famously made reference to England’s “dark Satanic Mills” to raise awareness about the cruel exploitation of workers. Further writers criticized the effects of the industry’s “explosive growth.” Eventually, the government responded. Businesses were at one point required to prove the social usefulness of their factories in order to receive a charter of incorporation.  Much later, in the wake of World War II, businesses started to think about specific areas where they could contribute to rebuilding the country.  But it wasn’t until the 1970s that CSR became a common aspect of business strategy. Even then, it was seen as an additional tool, a nice thing to do alongside real business duties. This has changed in today’s businesses. In the conscience economy, CSR is at the heart of business operations. As a result of the growing awareness of social problems, businesses that fail to support social issues risk damaging their reputation. And, of course, without CSR initiatives ensuring that natural resources are used sustainably, most businesses will eventually run out of materials to work with! In this way, CSR is a vital strategy that allows businesses to invest in the society that supports them, as well as their future as a company. Eventually, the very concept of CSR will be seen as outdated, as it will instead become an indelible part of all successful businesses. Conscience culture has changed a lot for today’s companies. But there’s one branch of business that’s facing a complete revolution: marketing.  Up until now, marketing was driven by manipulation. Customers had to be convinced to buy, and marketers used the 4 Ps to do this: designing an appealing product, placing it just right to attract as many customers as possible, naming the right price and promoting the product with catchy slogans or moving commercials. Unfortunately for marketing teams, the conscience economy means things won’t be quite so easy in the future. Marketing must become more interactive, more accountable and much more innovative. At the core of marketing in the conscience economy lies matchmaking, or the ability to create great fits between people’s needs and business interests.  An important part of this matchmaking role is identifying relationships that build business value. Whether it's between customers and employees or leaders and innovators, marketers must understand what people want from their company. This necessitates a new set of competencies, or the five Cs: context, conversation, clarity, cohesion and creating reasons.  First, matchmakers need to adapt their marketing to the customer’s context, by considering their mood, location and circumstances. For example, if it's forecasted to rain heavily, an umbrella brand may send customers a friendly alert about it, and offer to deliver umbrellas straight to their door.  Matchmakers should also spend time conversing with customers to learn more about their needs and values. This gives them helpful information that can then be analyzed and shared with companies, giving greater clarity about what customers want.  Next, matchmakers must ensure that there’s cohesion between prospective companies, the brand image and the company’s purpose. Finally, matchmakers should encourage everyone involved in the company, whether buyer or employee, to share meaningful stories about their experiences with the product, creating more and better reasons for new conscious customers to join in.   The key message in this book: Consumers today care about social and environmental challenges facing the world, and expect the brands they buy from to understand these challenges as well. In order to meet the needs and expectations of today’s new generation of intelligent, inquisitive buyers, companies must demonstrate that they share their customers’ values and concerns.  Actionable advice:  Involve your employees in corporate changes.  The next time you want your company to change its practices and policies to make sure that it becomes more fair or sustainable, involve your employees right from the start. Ask them how they think about the problems you want to address, such as global warming, and discuss how the company could counter such problems. This way, instead of resisting change, they’ll be open to it and may even make their own suggestions or contributions.

This refers to the process by which industries become dominated by a smaller and smaller number of companies, which grow bigger and bigger, until just a handful of corporate giants reign supreme. Today, the most visible giants are those of the tech industry, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But those are just the tip of the iceberg. In the United States, for example, more than 75 percent of all industries have seen increasing economic concentration since the year 2000. In these blinks, we’ll look at how and why this problem first emerged in the late nineteenth century, subsided in the early to mid-twentieth century and then reemerged in the late twentieth century. While taking this whirlwind tour of economic, political and legal history, we’ll also look at the troubling consequences of economic concentration, as well as some possible solutions. Along the way, you’ll learn the counterintuitive arguments in favor of monopolies; the compelling arguments against monopolies; and the important figures and movements who made those arguments. The story of economic concentration began in the Gilded Age – the period of American history that ran roughly from the 1870s to 1900. In recounting this story, we will focus primarily on developments in the US, which exemplified the trends that were unfolding in industrialized economies all over the world. At this time, the overall trend could be described as economic concentration on steroids. During the Gilded Age, the industrialized economies became tremendously concentrated, as one company after another merged into larger and larger corporations. These were called trusts. Between 1895 and 1904, about 2,274 American manufacturing companies consolidated into just 157 trusts. Many of those trusts became dominant players within their particular industries. Out of the 93 major consolidations of the era, 72 of the resulting trusts captured market shares of more than 40 percent, and 42 of them reached more than 70 percent.   Beyond those heights, the most dominant of the dominant trusts became monopolists. A monopolist is a company that has gained almost total control over an entire industry – a condition that is called a monopoly. The word “monopolist” can also refer to the leaders of those monopolistic companies. By the early 1900s, trusts formed monopolies in nearly every major industry in the United States. Their domains included steel, shipping, railroads, telecommunications, oil, cotton, tobacco, sugar and rubber. The largest monopolists of the Gilded Age became the most famous names of the era, such as John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil and Andrew Carnegie’s Carnegie Steel Company. These men became two of the wealthiest individuals in history, with fortunes worth over $300 billion each, when adjusted for inflation. However, the most successful monopolist of them all was the banker JP Morgan, who achieved monopolies in a range of industries. These included the Northern Securities Company (a railroad trust), the International Mercantile Marine Co. (a shipping trust), AT&T (a telecommunications trust) and US Steel, a steel trust that he formed by fusing together hundreds of steel companies and then buying out his chief rival, the Carnegie Steel Company, in 1901. Together, Morgan, Carnegie and Rockefeller became the main proponents of the pro-monopoly trust movement, which we’ll look into next. Traditionally, competition has been viewed as one of the cornerstones of capitalism. It forces companies to continuously strive to raise the quality and lower the prices of their products and services. If they succeed in doing so, they can take their rivals’ customers. If they fail, they may lose their market share. Thus, they must innovate to survive and thrive – and everyone benefits as a result. Or at least that’s how the traditional thinking about competition goes – but monopolies run directly counter to that thinking. After all, by definition, monopolies eliminate competition. But the monopolists of the Gilded Age were unapologetic in their opposition to this idea. Instead, they believed that monopolies were a superior form of economic organization, which would usher in the next stage in the evolution of capitalism. Advocates of this view became collectively known as the trust movement.    Far from viewing competition favorably, the trust movement’s members blamed it for the economic turmoil that had shaken the industrialized economies of the 1890s. Too much competition had led to prices falling too fast and too low, which had bankrupted hundreds of companies, they claimed. To them, competition was a form of chaos. It meant distributing the market for a product or service between many small companies. These companies then fought against each other in a never-ending struggle for survival at each other’s expense. The result was constant turbulence. In contrast, monopolies provided stability and order to the markets in which they established themselves. By bringing each of those markets under the centralized control of a single large company, monopolies put an end to the constant volatility and fragmented disarray of competition between multiple smaller companies. In doing so, they also made those markets’ products or services more efficient. That’s because larger companies can achieve economies of scale – meaning they can reap the cost-saving benefits of mass production. These benefits follow from the fact that production costs tend to go down when producing on a large scale. For example, it’s cheaper to build an additional car on an assembly line than in a neighborhood garage. By creating a more efficient, stable and orderly version of capitalism, the trust movement viewed itself as heralding a new dawn for humanity – but there was a dark side to this vision, as we’ll see in the next blink. Although monopolies are antithetical to competition, they can also be viewed as the natural culmination of it – or so the trust movement argued. The logic here is simple. When companies compete over a market, there are winners and losers. Some companies win greater shares of the market, while others lose their shares and are put out of business or swallowed up in mergers or buyouts. Either way, competition results in fewer competitors commanding larger percentages of the market. Eventually, this process leads to a single, gargantuan company emerging as the supreme winner and establishing a monopoly. From this perspective, a monopoly can be seen as both the logical conclusion and just reward of capitalist competition. The trust movement argued that by winning out over their competitors, the monopolists had proven themselves to be the most capable, effective and resilient companies in their respective markets. In making this argument, the trust movement’s perspective was informed by a sociological theory derived from Charles Darwin’s biological theory of evolution, as encapsulated in the English sociologist Herbert Spencer’s famous phrase “survival of the fittest.” According to both theories, an entity’s survival is dependent on its adaptation to its environment. When applied to the social sciences, this theory is called social Darwinism. Within an economic context, this means that companies that are well-adapted to their markets will tend to outlive their less-adapted competitors. If only a single company is left standing at the end of this culling process, then it must be the most well-adapted company. The destruction of competition and the subsequent rise of concentration and monopolies are therefore symptoms of progress, the trust movement argued. The government should therefore let the culling process play itself out. This hands-off approach to the market is called laissez-faire economics. In advocating for this, the trust movement argued against nearly all forms of governmental intrusion into the economy on behalf of the public. Motivated by the social Darwinistic principle of letting the weak perish, the trust movement even fought against child labor bans and working-hour limits. There was one notable exception to the social Darwinists’ resistance to government intervention. Some of them supported campaigns for government-led eugenics programs, taking the idea of letting the weak and poor perish one step further. While these consequences of the trust movement’s ideology are damning enough, the problems didn’t stop there. For the trust movement, the enormous size of monopolist companies was a virtue, not a vice, since it enabled them to benefit from economies of scale. However, when a company gets too big it starts suffering from diseconomies of scale – its operations become less efficient as it gets bigger. That’s because the bigger a company gets, the more complex it becomes. It needs more employees, which means more managers and more complicated hierarchies. On top of that, bigger companies are less adaptable to changes in the market. With more moving parts, corporate behemoths are simply less nimble than smaller companies. If becoming an economic giant comes with such disadvantages, why would a company want to become one in the first place? Well, there are also advantages to becoming so big. Unfortunately, they come at the expense of everyone else. The bigger and stronger a company gets, the more power it has over workers and consumers. After all, it’s hard for workers to reject the working conditions imposed on them if there are no other companies in the industry that they can turn to for employment. Meanwhile, consumers cannot purchase goods from other sources if the monopolist is the only company in the market. Thus, a monopolist can decrease wages, increase work hours and raise prices with impunity. In theory, these unsatisfactory consequences of a monopoly would create an advantageous environment for new competitors. This doesn’t work out in practice, however, because the big companies create barriers to entry into their markets. If there’s a scarce resource or type of infrastructure that companies must access to compete, the big company can take control of it. For example, Rockefeller convinced railroads to guarantee him a special discounted rate for shipping his oil. He also made them charge higher rates to his competitors. With the threat of those rates, he forced his competitors to let him buy them out at favorable prices. He also artificially lowered his prices to the point where no other company could compete. He could do this only because he had enough capital to subsidize the prices. This allowed him to temporarily sell at a loss until his rivals went out of business, at which point he could dramatically increase prices. But it wasn’t just the economic realm in which monopolists were able to use their heft to get their way. Their influence extended to the halls of political power as well. In order to carry out their more dubious schemes, the big companies of the Gilded Age needed the government to turn a blind eye – or, even better, lend a helping hand. To that end, they used their economic clout to exert influence over the government. For example, when pipelines started replacing railroads as the way to transport oil, Rockefeller convinced the government to withhold the permits that would-be competitors needed to build oil pipelines in many areas. And when they did manage to build pipelines, he worked to bankrupt them and then buy them out by using tactics like overpaying for crude oil in certain markets, while artificially lowering its prices in others. Unfortunately, this kind of influence is endemic not just to monopolies, but to economic concentration in general. In addition to monopolies, it can also be exerted by oligopolies – markets dominated by just a few companies that become noncompetitive as a result of their shared dominance. For instance, an oligopoly might lobby the government with aligned interests in mind, rather than continuously striving to put each other out of business. The rewards of doing this can be enormous, as the contemporary US pharmaceutical industry amply demonstrates. In 2013, the pharmaceutical industry spent $116 million on lobbying Congress to prohibit the federal insurance program Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices when purchasing medicine. That’s a lot of money – but it’s pocket change compared to the payoff, an estimated $90 billion per year in additional revenue. In theory, the numerous companies of a healthy market could exert a similar influence, but it’s harder for many different companies with diverse interests to come together, cooperate and present a united front. The fewer companies there are, and the more their interests are aligned, the easier it is for them to cooperate. That helps to explain why oligopolistic and monopolistic companies have so much power compared to ordinary citizens. It’s not just their money and resources; it’s also the basic mathematics of the organization involved. It’s much easier to organize an oligopoly of three like-minded companies than a nation of millions of diverse citizens. And if a company holds a monopoly, it doesn’t need to do any organizing at all! Thus, concentrated industries are in an excellent position to convince the government to take a hands-off role, and even to help them maintain their monopolies by giving them goodies like tax cuts or subsidies. Given this fact and all the power and wealth they have, it takes a serious assertion of authority for the government to push back against them. We’ll look at that next with the antitrust movement. The effects of the trust movement didn’t go unnoticed. Indeed, there was significant dissatisfaction with monopolists and oligopolists among citizens and the government. Increased economic concentration led to civil unrest starting around the 1880s and extending to the 1900s. Workers went on strike, an Anti-Monopoly Party was formed and the populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan ran for president three times. Meanwhile, over in Europe, there were socialist, communist and anarchist movements afoot, portending the possibility of even greater unrest and revolution if things didn’t change. Within this context, the first anti-monopoly law – more commonly referred to as an antitrust law – was passed: the Sherman Act of 1890. The law strongly condemned monopolies, declaring the formation of them a felony and banning trusts or any other combination of companies that was “in restraint of trade.” At first, however, the government resisted enforcing the Sherman Act. For example, under the administration of President William McKinley from 1897 to 1901, the act was ignored. McKinley believed in a laissez-faire economic policy and saw the act as a symbolic gesture toward the populist wings of the Democrat and Republican parties. When word got out that JP Morgan was planning to buy out Andrew Carnegie’s steel company to create the gargantuan US Steel trust, violating the Sherman Act, McKinley took no legal action. He even threw a dinner party in celebration of Morgan. After McKinley was assassinated in 1901, however, Theodore Roosevelt took office, and things began to change. Roosevelt saw monopolies as a threat to democracy for two reasons. First, they had too much power and influence. They represented a form of private power that rivaled and was on the verge of overwhelming the public power of the state. Second, they were giving rise to an economic situation in which people were miserable and desperate, which might lead them to join their European counterparts in looking for more extreme solutions, like a communist revolution. Hence, aiming at giants such as JP Morgan’s Northern Securities Company and Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, Roosevelt’s administration filed 45 antitrust lawsuits in total. His successor, President William Howard Taft, picked up the baton and ran with it, filing another 75 cases, including ones that took aim at JP Morgan’s US Steel and AT&T. Many monopolies were broken up as a result. In 1911, Standard Oil was broken into 34 separate companies, some of which remain some of the most powerful companies in the US today, such as Exxon, Mobil and Chevron. The US government continued to pursue this policy of trust-busting throughout much of the twentieth century, as we’ll see in the next blink. With one notable exception, the government kept busting the monopolies into the second half of the twentieth century. That exception was the Great Depression, particularly around the early 1930s. During that time, Congress suspended antitrust laws, hoping this would help jumpstart the economy. But after the Great Depression and World War II, the US government returned to its trust-busting ways with renewed fervor. Part of that was because they’d seen what those monopolies could do if left unchecked, as had happened in imperial Japan, fascist Italy and Nazi Germany leading up to and during the war. For instance, prior to the rise of Adolf Hitler, the German Republic had tolerated monopolies in many of its major industries, leading to powerful monopolists such as the Krupp armaments company, the Siemens railroad and infrastructure conglomerate and the IG Farben chemical cartel. The latter became one of the main industrial hubs around which the Nazi war economy was organized. Meanwhile, the Nazis helped organize and fortify monopolies in material industries such as steel, rubber and coal. The state and the monopolists formed a sort of symbiotic relationship, becoming deeply intertwined and complicit with each other in the process. After the war, during the Nuremberg trials, 24 of IG Farben’s executives were tried for war crimes, including the practice of human slavery. To many members of the US government, such as Senator Estes Kefauver, Nazi Germany and other fascist states represented one possible outcome of unchecked economic concentration. Another possible outcome was communism, which happened when the state decided to step in and nationalize its industries in order to take back power from the private actors who ran monopolies. Under this immediate historical backdrop, trust-busting came to be seen as a vital part of maintaining democracy. It was a matter of avoiding the dangers of fascism and communism, and it was pursued with renewed vigor. In 1950, Congress passed the Anti-Merger Act (also known as the Celler-Kefauver Act), enabling the government to prevent, control or even reverse mergers that might lead to monopolies. This way, it could nip monopolies in the bud, rather than waiting for them to grow. Meanwhile, the tradition of engaging in trust-busting by pursuing landmark cases continued into the 1970s, culminating in one of the biggest antitrust cases in history. Created by JP Morgan, the telecommunications corporation AT&T was the largest company in the world in 1974, and it had been a monopoly for six decades. In fact, by the 1970s, it wasn’t just monopolist – it was a “super monopolist,” controlling six or seven monopolies at once. These were in industries such as local telephone service, long-distance telephone service, physical telephones and telephone accessories. In theory, it was a regulated monopoly, since its operations were subject to oversight from the government. But in reality, the relationship often worked the other way around, with the government regulating the telecommunications industry on the company’s behalf. For example, Congress made it illegal for companies to compete with AT&T in certain markets, and the Federal Communications Commission (or FCC) helped it quash even small competitors. For instance, the FCC disallowed them from selling answering machines that would attach to AT&T’s phone lines. To its credit, the FCC of the 1970s also introduced policies aimed at fostering competition in certain sectors of the telecommunications industry, such as long-distance telephone service. But AT&T felt so confident in its power that it just ignored them. This flagrant disregard of the law was a step too far for the government. Under President Nixon, the Justice Department initiated antitrust lawsuits against the company in 1974. By the early 1980s, the company was broken up into seven separate regional telephone companies. With the breakup of the monopoly, numerous competitors and innovations flooded the market. Companies were now free to sell equipment that plugged into AT&T’s former phone lines. This enabled not only the proliferation of answering machines but also the introduction of modems, which allowed online service providers like AOL and CompuServe to arise, paving the way for the internet as we now know it. The playing field also opened to emerging mobile phone companies, such as T-Mobile and Sprint. AT&T thus provides a prime example of both the dangers of monopolies and the benefits of trust busting. By monopolizing a market, a corporate giant can stifle innovation and thwart the public’s power, which it wields through government regulation. In contrast, when the government reopens that market by breaking up the monopoly, it can spark innovation and reassert that public power. However, to this day, the breakup of AT&T remains the last major triumph of trust-busting. Since then, trust-busting has fallen by the wayside, and economic concentration has reemerged, as we’ll see in the next blink. Just as the early twentieth century’s rise of the antitrust movement was led by trailblazers such as Theodore Roosevelt, the late twentieth century’s demise of the movement’s legacy also had its key figures. One of them was Robert Bork. Bork was a legal scholar who studied law at the University of Chicago, which became a hotbed of conservative economic, political and legal thought from the 1950s onward. Bork became one of the institution’s main legal thinkers in the 1960s, especially with the publication of his landmark 1966 paper, “Legislative Intent and the Policy of the Sherman Act.” The paper basically argued for an extremely narrow interpretation of the Sherman Act. Rather than broadly aimed at monopolies and their pernicious effects on a macroeconomic, political and societal level, it claimed that the act was targeted at one thing and one thing alone – consumer welfare. The paper proposed a simple litmus test for whether a monopolistic company ran afoul of the Sherman Act – did it raise consumer prices? If not, there was no reason to break up the company. This interpretation of the Sherman Act significantly disempowered trustbusters, as it was difficult to prove that prices would be lower if a monopolist were out of the picture, given the hypothetical nature of the matter. Lawyers and judges liked Bork’s interpretation of the Sherman Act because of the simplicity and its apparent scientific rigorousness. They no longer had to deal with politically thorny, philosophically complex issues like the tensions between public and private power. Instead, they could just focus on narrow, quantifiable matters like prices. Bork’s interpretation gained popularity in law schools and courts throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until even the Supreme Court was espousing it in 2004. In that year, Justice Antonin Scalia declared that monopolies and monopoly pricing were “not only not unlawful,” but an “important element of the free-market system,” since the possibility of being able to take over an industry and charge high prices was what attracted businesses to compete in the first place. The influence of Bork’s interpretation has continued to the present day, as we’ll see next. After the triumph of Bork’s reinterpretation of the Sherman Act, trust-busting would never regain its former vigor. In the 1990s, the Clinton Administration initiated a major antitrust suit against Microsoft, but it proved to be the last hurrah of the trust movement’s legacy. Winding through the court system, the suit against Microsoft seemed to be heading toward a big breakup – but before it could get there, George Bush was elected president, and the Justice Department decided to settle the suit. Under the Bush Administration, the Justice Department failed to pursue a single anti-monopoly case or block a single merger in eight years. As a result, monopolies and oligopolies returned. In the 2000s, the eight parts into which AT&T had been split reformed into two giants, Verizon and AT&T. The latter then bought the cable and satellite television providers DirecTV and TimeWarner, growing even bigger. Three major regional cable monopolies were allowed to arise, and they used their monopoly powers to raise their prices. Cable bills that were once as low as $30 rose to as high as $200 per month. Airlines were allowed to merge until there were just three major companies, which have worked together to shrink seat sizes, introduce new fees and make record profits. From 2005 to 2017, the international pharmaceutical market has gone from about 60 companies to ten. In the US, monopoly pricing has allowed companies to raise the prices of drugs by as high as 6,000 percent. These days, you can’t even blow off steam without escaping economic concentration. Want to see a concert? Before 2010, you’d probably have to buy your ticket through Ticketmaster and then attend a concert hosted by LiveNation. And now those two companies have merged! How about a drink? Well, the merger of Anheuser-Busch, InBev and SABMiller has resulted in a conglomerate that controls 2,000 brands of beer, including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, accounting for 70 percent of beer sales in the US.   Meanwhile, if you go online or buy a technology product, you’re confronted with one giant company after another – Google, Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Apple – the list goes on and on. In becoming as big as they are today, many of these companies swallowed up their competitors, while the government just stood by and watched. For example, Facebook bought up WhatsApp and Instagram, while Google acquired YouTube. The ubiquity of economic concentration and the power of the giant corporations that result from it may make it seem like there is little to be done about the situation – but there are a number of potential solutions, which we’ll turn to next. There are a few simple things the government can do about the dominance of monopolies and oligopolies. Instead of a consumer welfare litmus test, the government can institute a “protection of competition test.” The aim here is to broadly encourage and preserve competitive markets, rather than narrowly focus on prices. That focus is a dead end, as witnessed in the legal arguments over the 2018 merger between AT&T and TimeWarner. Instead of talking about the public good and the dangers of concentrated private power, the lawyers ended up arguing over whether the merger might lead cable customers to pay an extra 45 cents per month for their cable service.    That perspective misses the big picture. Mergers that lead to too much concentration are inherently problematic, regardless of how they affect pricing. For that reason, they should be outlawed. To that end, the government could institute a simple rule, such as a ban on mergers that reduce the number of major companies in an industry to four or fewer. The US could also take a cue from the UK and institute a law calling for market investigations. Under such a law, if an industry is dominated by a single company for 10 or more years, it would be automatically put under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (or FTC). Why? Because in such a situation, the facts speak for themselves –  the market’s not going to deconcentrate itself. Otherwise, it would have already done so. The FTC can then propose remedies, which would be subject to judicial review. The UK has already done this with success, reintroducing competition into the airport industry, for example. Finally, the government shouldn’t be afraid to go after big companies and break them up. Nowadays, there’s a widespread fear that breaking up companies is too messy and can lead to chaos – but that notion is wrong. Here’s the thing – big corporations are already divided into a bunch of regional, functional or operational subunits. Breaking them up is therefore just a matter of separating those subunits. Why pursue measures like these? Well, if left unchecked, the private power of concentrated industries may overwhelm the public power of democratic governments. What’s needed, therefore, is a return to the tradition of trust-busting. The key message in these blinks: Economic concentration arose with the trust movement of the late nineteenth century, receded with the antitrust movement of the early twentieth century and returned with the demise of the antitrust movement’s legacy in the late twentieth century. This is a troubling development because monopolies and oligopolies have pernicious effects on the economy and society at large. The government should, therefore, return to its former tradition of trust-busting in order to safeguard democracy from the dangers of concentrated private power.  Got feedback?

Would there be anyone to help you get back on your feet? As these blinks will explain, you'd find yourself in deep trouble, and the government certainly would not be there to lend you a helping hand. You’ll learn how the US justice system protects the rich and criminalizes the poor. The machinery of the current system will become shockingly clear: Your legal rights are determined by your income. Today, being poor is essentially considered a crime. In these blinks, you’ll find out: why you shouldn’t smoke a hand-rolled cigarette outside a New York subway station, why an additional toothbrush could land you in prison, and how some people turn illegal immigrants into a highly profitable business. If you thought that US jails would be full of bankers after the 2008 global economic crash, you’d have been wrong. Despite their obvious responsibility for ruining the economy, very few bankers were brought to justice by the government. Perhaps this seems strange. It’s even stranger when you consider the phenomenal cost of criminal activities in the financial sector, a.k.a. white-collar crime. Roughly $4 trillion – 40 percent of the global economy – has been lost as a result of the recent financial crisis, and while we can’t know exactly how much of the deficit was a result of illegal activities, there’s no question that fraud played a huge role, especially in the mortgage industry. For years, many profiteering banks like Washington Mutual simply gave out as much credit as possible without ever ensuring that their customers could actually afford the mortgages they were signing up for. These banks disregarded any moral or legal issues, leading to an enormous build up of unsustainable debt and eventually economic devastation. So why haven’t these bankers been locked up? Because rather than prosecute anyone, the government has sought to control these crimes through expensive fines and agreements. For example, in the 21 biggest mortgage-fraud cases of the crisis, record-breaking sums of $26 billion in fines have been shelled out by the government, but not a single banker involved was charged for his or her misconduct. Taking bankers to trial is not the government’s favored disciplinary strategy. Instead, the government prefers “deferred prosecution agreements,” where companies merely agree to future restrictions on their business activities, like not being allowed to gamble on the housing market anymore. With no fear of prosecution, bankers and other financiers are left to take careless risks. In the last blink, we learned that the government doesn’t put much effort into punishing financial criminals, but why not? Wouldn’t it be better to live in a society where serious crimes had serious consequences? The US government is simply ill-equipped to bring crooked bankers to justice. Government prosecutors are intimately linked with the world of finance. For example, US Attorney General Eric Holder and his assistant Lanny Breuer, both former white-collar defense lawyers, should’ve been in charge of prosecuting banks while they were in public office. But when Breuer stepped down from his position in 2013, he returned to his earlier private-sector job at a major law firm, where he defended financial companies. He had gone full circle in the revolving door between private companies and public office. The prosecution of financiers is also hampered by the government’s don’t lose doctrine. What does this mean exactly? After Obama became president, a large number of former defense attorneys from the lobbying industry were hired by the Department of Justice. As a result, these attorneys came to their new government positions with the economic rationale of always maximizing results while minimizing risk. Unfortunately, this logic causes prosecutors to settle outside court even when a charge might have succeeded in front of a jury. The norm among government prosecutors is: Don’t go to trial if there’s any possibility of losing. A final factor hampering the prosecution of banks is that the government has also put into practice a collateral damage doctrine. This ideology maintains that when reviewing a charge against a company, a prosecutor needs to consider the larger consequences a sentence might have on the economy and job development. Because of this, many prosecutors in the Department of Justice often see banks and other financial companies as simply too big to jail. When it comes to white-collar crime, convictions aren't straightforward to obtain. You might have plenty of evidence or even a confession but that doesn't always lead to a sentence. One explanation for this is that people who accuse banks are mistrusted by the courtroom. Simply put, it’s an attitude problem: Unlike a murder trial, in the case of financial crime the judge and jury are often sensitive to the defendant, whereas those who have lost everything due to a bank’s negligence are viewed as spiteful and greedy. Incredibly, it’s the victims who are often seen as careless risk takers. They should have checked the small print, apparently. It’s also difficult to maneuver around huge institutions and companies to bring a single individual to trial. This is partially because of differing laws between states and nations. For example, while the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) was created to hold executives accountable for company wrongdoings, it is difficult to implement because it doesn’t apply in all US states. So if a German employee working for a British subsidiary engages in fraud for the New York mother company, and the only evidence of the crime comes from New Jersey, would RICO even be helpful? It’s tough to say. The fact that RICO only counts in certain areas makes it easy for defense attorneys to claim the law doesn’t pertain to their clients. In addition, it’s hard to collect evidence that can hold up against powerful executives in court. For example, when the insurance company Fairfax sued multiple hedgefund managers for deliberately damaging its reputation in order to artificially lower the company’s stock price, the suit was dismissed despite the existence of emails in which the accused boasted about their crimes. These emailed confessions were not judged to be legitimate evidence. While the police are quick to lend assistance after a bank has been robbed, don’t expect the white-collar friendly justice system to help when it’s the bank which robs you. Many people believe the financial crisis was a result of George W. Bush’s policies. However, both the crisis and its lack of management can be linked to the Democratic Party. Bill Clinton’s elimination of financial regulations in the 1990s set the scene for the crisis. Clinton repealed the Glass–Steagall Act, a piece of legislation which required banks to keep their investment operations separate from their commercial operations, which handle money from regular citizens. As a result, banks could gamble with the savings of private citizens, thereby exposing people to increased financial risk. In addition, the loosening of restrictions enabled bankers to create risky new financial products, such as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). CDOs are complicated financial instruments in which individual loans like mortgages are combined into a single debt which can be resold to big investors for higher profit. The trading of unstable CDOs was a major contributor to the financial crisis. Another Democrat who has been very lenient on white-collar crime is Barack Obama. While Bush attempted to fight financial crime with tough prosecution techniques like imposing jail time on fraudsters, Obama has sought to curb the problem through much milder settlements. It was also Obama who initiated the hiring of many new Justice Department staff directly from Wall Street, so it seems that he’s never been very eager to prosecute the financial sector. It’s not hard to believe how small a budget Obama gave his financial crisis investigation team: a mere fraction of the cash behind Oliver Stone’s second Wall Street movie, which dealt with financial fraud. Coincidentally or not, investment banks provided huge donations to the election campaigns of both Clinton and Obama. Perhaps this explains why the Democrats have been so soft on white-collar criminals. In the past few blinks, we’ve come to understand how the rich easily avoid the justice system. Unfortunately, the opposite is true for society’s poorest members. Poor people frequently find themselves targeted by the police. For example, though police departments deny it, officers are commonly required to meet certain arrest quotas. As a result, many charge innocent people with all sorts of ridiculous crimes, including jaywalking. Police officers search for criminals to fill their quotas in poor neighborhoods, where statistics suggest they might be found. Only after a “suspicious” person has been arrested and detained will an officer attempt to blame that person for a crime. Often people are stopped for something as simple as driving a car that the police think is too expensive for them. In addition, officers can subject the poor to “Stop and Frisk,” a controversial policy allowing police to publicly search citizens at any time and for any reason. Especially notorious for its use among New York City police, Stop and Frisk was first introduced in the 1990s to dissuade criminals from committing illegal acts, though poor black males, immigrants and homeless people are actually the ones who end up being singled out. Furthermore, Stop and Frisk produces more crimes than it prevents. Consider the case of Tory Marone, a homeless man found sleeping in a park. When police searched Marone, they discovered a concealed joint. Marone could’ve possessed the joint legally as long as he didn’t display it in public. However, after discovering it, police placed the joint in Marone’s visible hand, thereby causing him to commit an illegal act. Marone couldn’t afford to pay the fine and later went to jail. Unlike rich, white-collar criminals, poor people who commit poor people crime must cope with police that hassle them constantly and a justice system that already views them as hopeless cases. By now you’re probably beginning to see that when it comes to justice, those who have the fewest rights suffer the harshest consequences. In the United States, those people are illegal immigrants. Why is that? The truth is that both the police and the private detention-center industry profit by exploiting illegals. The police can take advantage of illegals who have no rights. For example, Natividad is a single mother of two whose job requires her to drive every day. However, Natividad cannot obtain a license because she immigrated from Mexico to the United States illegally. When Natividad was pulled over, she discovered there are special rules for illegals: Her car was impounded until she paid $1,000, which is more than the car’s value. Incredibly, this has happened to Natividad three times over the past six years. Because illegals can be deported if they make even the tiniest mistake (like fishing without a permit), there’s also money to be made in immigrant deportation centers. The government has contracted out these centers to private companies, which make roughly $160 per immigrant per day. What’s more, these correction companies are suggested to investors as reliable sources of growth, further solidifying illegals as the industry’s best source of profit. As a result, many industry insiders lobby for stricter deportation laws so that they can make even more money. Now compare this to foreign bankers who commit white-collar crimes. Wealthy foreigners are shielded by their riches. Not a single executive at Deutsche Bank or British bank HSBC was deported even though their banking fraud was far more damaging than driving without a license. The difference in how authorities deal with white-collar crime versus poor crime also holds true for the treatment of immigrants: You can stay if you have money, but if you’re poor then either pay or get out. Thinking about applying for welfare? You’d better verify that the number of toothbrushes in your home matches the number of inhabitants, otherwise you could be committing fraud. Believe it or not, officials seem more interested in catching welfare “thieves” than murderers and rapists. In fact, the social security system actually operates in a way that results in more cases of perceived fraud. For example, in California social security caseworkers are constantly being reshuffled, with an increasing number of employees assigned to pinpoint fraud instead of managing cases. This makes it very unlikely that a welfare applicant would ever meet the same caseworker twice. Just imagine meeting a new doctor every time you visit the hospital to treat a chronic disease. Clearly this constant change makes it easier for the claimant to make mistakes during the claiming process. On top of this, many California counties reward people who report welfare fraudsters. For example, Riverside County pays out $100 for each fraud conviction, and even prints the names of welfare criminals in the newspaper – an archaic public shaming technique that isn’t even used against rapists or murderers anymore! Moreover, people receiving welfare lose some of their rights in return. For example, before being approved for welfare you must consent to home inspections to prove you’re not trying to claim social security fraudulently. Officials don’t need a warrant to search your home for evidence of this so-called fraud, and something as simple as having more toothbrushes than family members makes them assume fraud is being committed. So while welfare is not the only type of government support available, it is the only one that comes with reduced rights. Although preventing fraud seems to be a major concern to US policy makers and the justice system, authorities appear less conscientious when they handle crooked mortgage schemes and other large-scale financial fraud. What behavior does society criminalize and what does it tolerate? Even if it’s hard to believe, by now it should be apparent that US authorities would rather allow mortgage fraud to happen than let a black man drive around unmolested in a nice Range Rover. This attitude can be traced to the collateral damage doctrine adopted by policy makers. This doctrine requires prosecutors to consider the financial repercussions of charging corporations and their executives: In other words, if there’s a chance other jobs are at risk, not prosecuting is believed to be the best option. But is that really the case? Unfortunately not. What this doctrine doesn’t recognize is that it’s ultimately more harmful to the economy to ignore white-collar crime than to prosecute. For one, it’s unlikely a company will fold as a result of a fraud conviction, because there will always be more executives to replace those removed. Additionally, failing to take these criminals out of their positions will result in greater economic problems in the future: Not only will companies believe they’re above the law, but they’ll also think there aren’t any consequences to cheating and will continue taking financial risks and committing crimes. Meanwhile, the collateral damage caused by pursuing poor criminals is never taken into account. For example, after they thought they smelled marijuana, police detained and searched an innocent black man under the Stop and Frisk policy and the man later lost his job. Each year over 600,000 people in New York City alone experience similar outcomes after encounters with the law. They’re fired, their records are ruined, their families get into trouble, etc. The only difference is that these collateral consequences are accepted. It’s obvious that collateral damage is a good enough reason to curb the prosecution of white-collar crime, but not poor people crime. Is justice really being served? Many of us have heard the phrase, “All men are equal before the law.” In reality, the US justice system is more concerned with money and power than people. Take a look at bureaucracy: the rich face increasingly lax rules while the poor must jump increasingly difficult hurdles. Consider financial regulation again: The rules are constantly cut back so investors can pretty much do what they please because they have money to influence the process. Many of the richest corporations also have enough money to lobby Washington directly and change financial regulation so that it suits them better. Meanwhile, poor people live with a massive bureaucracy that increasingly dehumanizes them. Not only must they tolerate reduced rights and welfare fraud investigators who can search their homes at any time, but it’s also becoming more difficult for the poor to get the government assistance they need. Nowadays, applying for welfare is almost as hard as buying Rolling Stones tickets was in the 1970s: The only way to get an appointment is by standing in line for days. But perhaps the biggest takeaway here is that the justice system just doesn’t respect people, regardless of whether they’re rich or poor. In fact, rich people only survive and benefit from the system because it answers to their power, which they buy. However, should a rich person fall into a financial hole – maybe lose his or her retirement savings due to fraud – they will end up with the worst of the system too. Likewise, the fact that most of the system’s victims are black, single parents, immigrants or other marginalized people also comes down to money (or lack thereof): If any of these people suddenly came into riches, then they’d probably escape it. To change the system, you’ll need plenty of time and money. With both, you can invest in world-class lawyers and lobbyists who will combat the inhumane justice system at your request. The key message in this book: The full extent of the rights conferred by US citizenship are not universal: The extent of your rights in the US justice system depends on the amount of dollars in your bank account. By treating the poor as criminals and the rich as special cases, the justice system further reinforces these structural wealth inequalities.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

It’s entirely imaginable today that robots with all manner of human traits could be developed, capable of displaying empathy, speech cognition and a high level of intelligence. If the robots are compliant, this could be very practical, such as for the many single people in the world who need a steady and reliable partner to live with. But the robots could also decide to take over and make humans into slaves. Leaving aside science fiction, technology and machines have thus far not wreaked havoc on Earth; on the contrary, mechanization has meant that human beings have to work less and less, leaving them to be creative, productive or just lazy. This tendency is bound to continue as technology progresses, so let’s consider the positive and negative aspects that this increase in AI has in store for us. In these blinks, you will learn why there are so many more consultants than carpenters these days; how technology is evolving to master complex human skills; and why you may be getting a paycheck without working in the near future. When machines and factories began to appear in nineteenth-century Victorian England, many people were critical of this new development. Charles Dickens, in particular, worried about the effect machinery would have on England’s working-class laborers, and expressed these concerns in his books. Even then, people were worried about losing their jobs to new technology. But as mass production took over during the Industrial Revolution, there was no stopping the progress made. Actually, it wasn’t the machines that brought about this change so much as the steam engines that were powering them. People were already familiar with machines powered by wind and water, as these had been around since medieval times. What really fueled the Industrial Revolution was the fact that new machines along assembly lines were harnessing the power of Thomas Newcomen’s steam engine. Invented in 1712, the steam engine accelerated the onset of the industrial age and was far more powerful than any of the water- or air-powered contraptions that preceded it. With machines taking over a large portion of the labor, a significant percentage of the population could now focus on other things – and it was this extra time that would lead to the Information Revolution. As time went on, machines became increasingly efficient and less manual work was needed on the assembly line. As a result, workers turned their attention to the service industry. Prior to 1940, only half of America’s gross domestic product (GDP) came from the service industry, but by 1950, this industry was employing over half of the nation’s workforce. This shift, from industry and agriculture to service, marked the start of the Information Revolution, an era that would focus on producing knowledge and information rather than raw materials. Since the Information Revolution is still ongoing, we can’t be certain of its overall consequences; in fact, it remains difficult to speculate as to what our workforce will look like in the future. But before looking ahead, let’s first take a closer look at how we got to where we are today. Are you familiar with the term Luddite? You might be if you prefer to live a life free of technology. But do you know the origins of the name? As the story goes, in 1779, a textile worker by the name of Ned Ludd revolted after being whipped by his employer. For Ned, it was the final straw, and he smashed his new mechanical knitting machine in protest. The story lingered in the public imagination, and when textile workers in nineteenth-century England faced further mechanization of their profession, they united in protest over the threat to their livelihood, calling themselves Luddites. And much like the Ned Ludd story, the workers smashed the new weaving machines in defiance. But is technology really to blame? When we look at the evidence, we can see that machinery generally increases a nation’s wealth while the resilient job market adapts. Since machines don’t need to sleep and don’t require wages or benefits, they make production cheaper and faster. And with more products being made, a higher demand can be met, which results in more wealth and more jobs in the long run. So it’s shortsighted to assume that automation automatically leads to unemployment. After all, there isn’t a fixed amount of jobs to be had or work to do. Thus far, the general rule has been that when societies and companies innovate and become more prosperous, new jobs are created. Today, more machines than ever are being used. And at the same time, humans are working as much as we ever have, because machines allow us to be more productive and accomplish new and exciting tasks. In 2015, the financial consulting firm, Deloitte, studied employment trends dating back to 1871 and found that machines have indeed generated more jobs – primarily due to the automation of the agriculture industry and laundry-related professions. Workers in these sectors were suddenly freed up to fill the jobs of the expanding service industry, including teachers and nurses. Between 1992 and 2014, the number of teaching and nursing jobs in the United States increased by six and nine percent, respectively. So far, machines have done more good than harm to the job market, so you might think that improving machines through artificial intelligence (AI) would make things even better, right? Not so fast. As machines get smarter and smarter, in large part thanks to AI developments such as deep learning, it means they’ll eventually be able to replace the very jobs in the service sector that we’ve come to rely on. Deep learning is a process wherein a machine is fed different data sets and uses algorithms to make predictions and draw future conclusions based on the results of those predictions. So, in a sense, the machine is learning. And the more data the machine is given, the more comparisons the machine can make and the more intelligent it becomes. This is how machines are learning to perfect a range of human skills like speech and image recognition. In 2012, computer scientist and cognitive psychologist Geoff Hinton led a team to victory in an AI image recognition contest. Through deep learning, their computer recognized the most images, including clouds, cats and dogs. This is the kind of knowledge that will enable machines to make informed decisions and perform human tasks, making them much cheaper and efficient workers than humans. And some jobs in the service sector are already at risk of becoming automated. The software program, Quill, is automating some of the more basic jobs in the journalism sector by writing Associated Press articles on sports and financial news. Developed in 2010 by Narrative Science, Quill can analyze data and pick out the most relevant details for an article. It can then quickly generate a structure for the article and use its language-generation software to compose the necessary sentences. This shows us that even complex jobs requiring cognitive analysis can either be partly or completely performed by machines. And once one company starts using them, other companies will be forced to follow their lead or else fall behind their competition. Once a new technology becomes readily available, rapid change inevitably follows. Think back to how quickly people switched to digital cameras, or how typewriters became obsolete virtually overnight. With constant advancements being made in AI, we’re guaranteed to see more rapid change happen in the near future, such as the proliferation of self-driving cars. A renowned competition for self-driving cars in the United States is the DARPA Grand Challenge, and in 2004, the winner was Sandstorm, a converted Humvee that only made it seven miles before getting stuck on a rock. But a lot has changed since then: the self-driving cars that Google has designed for Lexus and Chrysler have already logged over a million miles on California roads – and there hasn’t been a significant setback yet. Experts are predicting that public roads will be taken over by self-driving cars by the year 2041. This means that driving tests will become obsolete, as will most chauffeur and commercial driving jobs. With fewer accidents on the road, there will be a drastically reduced demand for mechanics and hardly any need for car insurance. So when can you expect to get your first self-driving car? Chris Urmson, the head of Google’s automated driving project predicts that the general public should have the option of driving hands-free by 2020. Another industry that’s especially vulnerable to automation is the healthcare sector. In fact, the first caregiving robot is already being used in Japan. Both the robot and its parent company are called PARO, and the robot itself looks like a small seal, complete with fur and big eyes. Animal therapy has become quite popular recently, as patients exposed to cuddly creatures get some much-needed cheer to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. And PARO allows more patients to experience these benefits by reaching those who don’t have access to a real animal. The author believes that by 2041, we’ll all have access to devices that will constantly monitor our vital statistics. As a result, we’ll see a dramatic decline in the demand for doctors and nurses, as their basic functions will be automated. There are going to be a number of challenges facing our society in the future, not the least of which will be the economic impact that will accompany a surge in joblessness. When large numbers of people suddenly become unemployed, there will be a subsequent period of economic contraction that could bring society to a grinding halt. When we put the AI technology to use, productivity will increase and the prices of goods and services will drop so that people continue buying. But the initial positive effect of these changes will eventually level off, and will be replaced by an economic contraction caused by so many unemployed people. We’ve seen this happen in Greece, where 46.5 percent of the country’s young people are unemployed. While family members are able to provide a temporary safety net for relatives in situations like Greece’s, there’s no precedent for the sprawling unemployment that will happen in the future. It will cut across all ages, classes and demographics, so there’s no safety net big enough to prevent the economy from deteriorating under such stress. Another issue is the disparity between classes, which could lead to some people not being able to afford access to certain technologies and getting left behind. While technology changes quickly, there’s still a lengthy period before new products become affordable to the general public. So, let’s say implants emerge that allow wealthy people to enhance their bodies and minds far beyond what’s possible today. This could make the social divide even worse than it is today by making the lives of the wealthy so drastically different that their access to technology makes them “superior” beings. We’ll need to work together if we’re going to overcome future challenges, and in the final blink we’ll look at how we might just persevere. How would you feel about making money and not having to work? It might sound like a dream, but it could soon be a reality for many of us. This concept is known as universal basic income and it will be a necessity in a future where most jobs can be automated. After all, we’ll still need an income, even when sophisticated AI is taking care of the tasks that keep services functioning. A universal basic income allows a fixed amount to be distributed to all citizens, either unconditionally or through what’s known as a negative income tax, a method that works by providing a certain amount of money to help you reach a set figure. This model of basic income welfare has already been tested in some areas, with the biggest experiment taking place during the 1970s, in the Canadian town of Dauphin. The Canadian government determined that every family would receive a minimum amount of money each year, with no strings attached. Adjusted for inflation, they decided this amount would be $16,000 Canadian. So if a family’s normal income dropped below that amount, the government would cover the difference. Between 1974 and 1976, 10,000 citizens benefitted from the program, and despite worries that it would lead to voluntary unemployment, only mothers with newborns and teenagers quit working altogether. Universal basic income should allow for more artistic endeavors, but it could also lead to depression. A job is what gives meaning to many people’s lives, and we can safely predict that around ten percent of the population will suffer psychologically from being unemployed. They’ll either sink into a depression or escape into the world of virtual reality entertainment. But the majority of the population will find healthy endeavors to bring joy to their lives, such as writing, playing sports or discovering other creative and artistic pursuits. If we’re going to make this happen, we’ll need to be prepared, with strategies and structures in place to allow for a smooth economic transition and to avoid some of the biggest dangers we’re sure to face. The key message in this book: Unlike previous changes in society, the information revolution will end up having a major impact on employment, making many of the jobs we perform today largely unnecessary. In order to prevent a major catastrophe, we need to plan ahead for this inevitability and find a way to organize a successful society that will continue to function in the absence of work as we know it today.

There is so much wealth in the world – clearly enough to go around – and yet many developing societies remain incredibly poor. Many simply accept this bizarre situation. They think it’s the natural state for some to have a lot and others very little. Others fight the problem, but in the wrong way. Just look at the amount of aid sent from the developed world to the developing one. Year upon year aid is sent, and yet poverty remains. So should we give up? Or spend more? No. These blinks show you the reasons poverty persists, and how we can overcome them. They also show how nations like China and India have pulled themselves out of poverty; just how little actual aid goes to the people who need it; and why many poor countries are landlocked. Equality varies tremendously from one country to another. In fact, while the people in wealthy countries have enormous resources at their disposal and consume much more than they need, those in the poorest nations struggle every day just to fill their stomachs with the food necessary for survival. The result is that every day 18,000 children die of malnutrition. That’s one child every five seconds! But these huge disparities in wealth haven’t always existed. In fact, they are a product of the last 200 years. For instance, 200 years ago, most people, regardless of where they lived, were pretty poor. As a result, the differences in poverty level between Europe and Africa were relatively small. However, as some countries rapidly developed during the Industrial Revolution, they left others behind. For example, the steam engine enabled the mass production of goods while steam trains and ships boosted trade. Furthermore, the advent of electricity and telecommunication made further progress possible, resulting in the constant growth of the global economy. But certain states benefited from this progress more than others: namely the Western nations. As a result, countries outside the West remain poor to this day. For instance, today about one billion people are in extreme poverty, living on less than $1 a day. Another 1.5 billion are in moderate poverty, meaning they live on $1–2 a day. That’s enough for basic survival, but not enough for luxuries like a flush toilet or clean running water. Then there are the 2.5 billion people in the middle class. That means they can afford shelter, a television and maybe even a motorbike. So why do some countries remain poor to this day? So, the Industrial Revolution made lots of Western countries rich, but there are still tons of poor developing nations. How come? Well, while poverty can be caused by lots of things, most poor countries face a common problem: they’re caught in what’s called the poverty trap, a vicious cycle that prevents them from pulling themselves out of impoverishment. Basically this means they don’t have the tools for economic growth and prosperity. But the poverty trap has some more specific aspects. For instance, a major problem for poor countries is often their geographical positions. That’s because many of these developing nations lack the conditions necessary for economic growth. That might mean their climate is too hot for consistent agricultural success or that the country is riddled with deserts and mountain chains, making for poor farming conditions and high transportation costs. State governance is another issue. If a state doesn’t prioritize economic growth, it will lack infrastructure and therefore a good business outlook. For instance, without strong infrastructure like roads, education and communication networks, economic development is impossible. An additional problem facing small, poor countries is a lack of innovation and a brain drain. In places like this, anyone who receives an education soon emigrates to a richer country since their local market is too small or intellectual property is unprotected. And finally, demography is a huge issue. That’s because plenty of developing countries have astronomical birth rates and the higher the birth rate is, the lower the economic growth tends to be. Why? Because a big family usually can’t send all their kids to school and, without an education, the new generation doesn’t have the tools to succeed. So, there are lots of reasons why some countries remain trapped in poverty. That means any strategy for solving poverty will need to take aim at multiple problems. We all know the phrase, “it takes money to make money” and it’s true for both people and countries: to become richer one first needs to accumulate capital. After all, building wealth requires a healthy stream of capital investment, which, if used wisely, will create more wealth for further investment. However, wealth only builds if economic growth exceeds inflation and increases in population. Inflation is the decreasing value of a currency. So, if a country produces a surplus, but is suffering from an inflating currency, it’s likely that little or no additional wealth will actually be created. But population increases can also be a disaster for the same reason. They mean that a country’s surplus is shared with more people, leaving little for investment. So, building wealth and growing economically are only possible if the economic surplus of a country exceeds the combination of its population growth and inflation. As you might imagine, this is easy for rich countries, but hard for poor ones. That’s because economic growth in wealthy nations is simple: the economy makes a huge surplus that’s reinvested in industry while inflation and population growth remain low. But poor countries often experience a high rate of inflation as well as staggering population increases. That’s because countries like Bolivia find themselves deep in debt and their governments begin printing money to pay off their loans. This devalues the currency, leading to hyperinflation. Simultaneously, their stalled economy produces little, if any, surplus – certainly not enough to overcome the extreme inflation and population growth the country is experiencing. As a result, the nation remains poor. And even in the rare cases that poor countries do manage to grow economically, this growth tends to be inequitably distributed. That’s because the elite, with the privileges of education, capital and networks, often profit disproportionately from the growth. People are always talking about magic solutions that would put poverty to rest once and for all. But the truth is that a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely to exist. That’s because every country is dealing with poverty for its own individual and complex reasons. That means the only true solution is to carefully unpack every issue. Just take Bolivia, a prime example of the long-term struggle to develop a solution to economic strife. In the 1980s the country was dealing with hyperinflation in the region of over 24,000 percent! As a result, over just a few years, the exchange rate between pesos and dollars had multiplied by millions. It seemed likely that the issue was caused by the state spending money that it didn’t have on the production of oil and gas. Constantly running a budget in the red was devaluing the currency – and fast. So, the country implemented a shock therapy, a series of rapid-fire economic measures designed to stall inflation. For instance, one tactic was to quit spending government money on the production of oil. It only took a week to eliminate the budget deficit and stabilize the exchange rate. Just like that, Bolivia’s hyperinflation was dead. That is, until a few years later when the country found itself in crisis once again. Why? The issues facing Bolivia ran much deeper than a simple budget deficit. For instance, the country’s geographical position was playing a major role as Bolivia is landlocked and, as a result, its only profitable exports were high-quality natural resources. That’s because exporting anything else simply wasn’t worth the high cost of transporting it. The result was that Bolivia became increasingly dependant on the prices of natural rubber and tin for its livelihood. The country’s skyrocketing debts were also draining. As in the previous crisis, these were caused by high public spending and lackluster revenue streams. So, identifying these structural problems allowed the country to implement a sustainable solution. It defaulted on its debts and reformed the tax system to increase governmental income. Most people today know China as a global superpower – one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But that wasn’t always true. In fact, until the 1970s, China was a more or less poor and rural country, isolated from the rest of the world. During this time, a huge percentage of the population lived in poverty and the communist government built diplomatic walls around its economy to defend it against outside markets and interference. However, a changing government, paired with some of the natural advantages of China’s geographical placement, have helped the country break this cycle and rise to the power it holds today. First, let’s look at the superb geographical location of the country. China’s long coastline and abundance of large harbors give it a natural advantage over other nations. That’s because, once the country opened its doors to international trade, this coastline enabled the rapid exchange of goods in and out of China. This abundance of trade generated a huge economic surplus early in the country’s development, helping it out of the poverty trap. But that’s not all. The Chinese government also wisely opened the agricultural sector to private markets. That’s because agriculture in China had long been run by the state, meaning it was under-producing and employing too many laborers. However, that all changed when the nation began growing. The state ceded control of agricultural production to private farmers, resulting in skyrocketing productivity, increased yields and the potential for many workers to enter more profitable industries. And lastly, China also benefited from its extremely mobile population. That’s because the government opened a variety of special, job-rich economic areas across the country. Workers migrated to these areas in droves to fill the manufacturing jobs the economy needed to grow. The result was a flourishing industry which attracted greater investments, especially internationally, thereby boosting growth further. So, China developed its way out of the poverty trap, but it’s not the only example of such success. India is another instance in which the correct strategies really paid off. Their story is one of opening markets while providing a stellar education to the country’s elite. But before we get there it helps to know some history. During the colonial period, the exploitative British empire plundered Indian resources and largely ignored the impoverished population. But even after the country got its independence in 1947, things hardly improved. That’s because then Prime Minister Nehru cared more about politics than economics when he declared the country one of “democratic socialism.” What he really desired was total financial independence from foreign governments and companies, and so under his government, the state began controlling practically all economic activities. For instance, even opening a bank account required you to get a license! As a result, from this time until 1970, the country’s economy only grew by 1.9 percent a year. But that all changed with the green revolution and the freeing of the market, which began in the 1960s. Here’s what happened. First off, a bunch of new crops were introduced, dramatically increasing agricultural productivity so that, for the first time ever, India had a food surplus. At this point the state loosened the tight control it exercised over the economy and big segments of the market were opened up. Finally, in the 1990s, India began growing as it had never done before. The service sector grew tremendously as firms like Microsoft set up huge centers to make use of the cheap, qualified labor. But growth has also been spurred by the country’s elite universities, known as the Indian Institutes of Technology. The graduates of these schools have enjoyed success in tech hubs across the globe, starting firms like Infosys and Tata, which rank among the most successful businesses in the world. To the confusion of many, Africa has been trapped in poverty for ages. Developmental aid has been routinely injected into the continent, but seems to vanish south of the Sahara with nothing to show for it. How come? Well, the continent’s crippling poverty is in large part the result of European colonization and poor geography. For instance, the poor administration and resource robbery of the European colonists left the continent with no education system, political leadership, infrastructure or basic health care. But the continent’s challenging geography only exacerbated the problem. That’s because Africa has few navigable rivers or irrigation systems but plenty of areas of extreme drought and extreme rainfall. So, how can poverty be abolished in this context? By increasing developmental aid – i.e., funding for social and economic development – while channeling it to the areas of greatest need. This method of ending poverty in Africa doesn’t require a new world order, and there doesn’t need to be a total redistribution of wealth across the third world, either. In fact, the richest countries would only have to stand by a promise they’ve already made to invest at least 0.7 percent of national income in development. The problem is, little foreign aid currently ever makes it to Africa. In fact, only $30 per person makes it to the continent’s shores every year. And from that already minuscule amount, $5 goes to consultants, $4 to service African debts and $5 to debt relief operations. After these and other deductions, only about $12 per person is actually given to aid development every year. But long-term growth requires a surplus for investment in technology like machinery and fertilizer. Without this surplus, it’s impossible to increase productivity and eliminate poverty. That means the first step to solving African poverty is international aid. And it would only take about $70 per person per year to entirely transform the average village. In fact, lifting a country like Kenya out of poverty would only require about $1.5 billion in total. Alright, now you know how developmental aid can fight poverty, but that’s not all that’s necessary. It’s also key to transform international politics. Here’s how: First of all, poor countries need to have their debts canceled. That’s because these crippling debts simply can’t be repaid. In fact, they only produce rising costs in borrowing and financing for countries already mired in poverty. These costs further deter such countries from investing in their futures and escaping the poverty trap. But if poor countries are to grow economically, they’ll also need to boost their exports. Free trade is essential, so the second step is giving developing countries the opportunity to sell their goods to Western nations. However, the agricultural customs duties of the United States and the European Union currently place restrictions on these exports. So, for the sake of eliminating poverty, these restrictions have got to go. Beyond that, the medicinal and agricultural sciences need to stop ignoring the problems facing poor countries. For instance, billions of dollars are invested in fighting diabetes every year while practically no research is done on treating dengue fever. So, it’s essential that we begin acknowledging and working on the problems of the developing world. And of course there’s the issue of climate change. Wealthy nations should help poorer ones, especially those in Africa. Because while Africa releases little carbon dioxide and consumes little energy, the continent is disproportionately affected by the changes in global weather. The continent is plagued by droughts and floods which destroy the lives of humans and animals alike. Such extreme weather renders arable land useless while decimating crops, infrastructure and long-fought-for developmental gains. After all, countries like those in Sub-Saharan Africa have contributed the least to climate change, but feel its effects most acutely. So, it’s only fair that the nations who bear the greatest responsibility for the crisis do the most to aid those who are suffering. The key message in this book: The inequitable distribution of global wealth has trapped much of the developing world in poverty. But the good news is that Western nations could end the impoverishment of millions worldwide with a modest amount of developmental aid, invested correctly.  Got feedback?

Hubbard","summary":"Every weather forecast relies on highly complex models and huge sets of data. Once analyzed and presented, this information allows you, with impressive accuracy, to see whether your picnic in the park will be a wet affair or not. You might think it doesn’t really matter. After all, you can always put on a raincoat. However, for multi-billion dollar companies operating on volatile markets, or for scientists trying to calculate the likelihood of a tsunami or an earthquake, risk, and risk management, is serious business. And these days it’s more important than ever. But many of the methods used to assess and manage risk today are flawed. Luckily, there are ways to overcome this problem. These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll learn why experts’ opinions are overrated; what Monte Carlo has to do with risk management; and how you calculate the risk of an event that has never happened before. You’ve probably heard the term risk management; it’s part of the jargon used by organizations and governments, but it’s also entered the public vocabulary. While there are many definitions of the terms risk and management, it’s helpful to keep things simple: Start with risk. You could say that risk is the likelihood and magnitude of an undesirable event. For instance, in a scientific or mathematical context, risk always describes the probability and magnitude of an undesired effect. But what do probability and magnitude measure? While probability always estimates the odds that something will happen (that your home being struck by lightning, for example), magnitude can be measured in a variety of dimensions, most commonly the loss of money or of lives. But keep in mind that an undesirable event could be anything – from a natural disaster to a major product recall to political instability. Now that you know the definition of risk, what does it mean to manage it? Managing risk means effectively using resources to decrease danger. For instance, one of the most common definitions of the word management is “the planning, organization, coordination and direction of resources toward defined objectives.” In other words, using what you have to get what you need. In order to achieve this goal, a risk manager always tries to reduce the risk of pursuing an objective. Just like any other management task, managing risk is an effort to effectively use limited resources, like money and time, to complete a task. Now that you know what risk management is, it’s time to learn how it developed and how it applies today. It could be said that organizational risk management began when some king or leader first made the decision to fortify their city’s walls or put away extra provisions in case of a tough winter. But risk management has come a long way since its beginnings; the advent of computers in particular has dramatically improved the field. But even prior to digitization, the risk of nuclear power and oil exploration in the 1940’s increased the sophistication of risk management, a major reason why it’s in the minds of most large organizations today, regardless of their field. So how did risk management evolve into such an important field? A major breakthrough was the use of risk analysis during World War II and, later, the Cold War. During wartime, the “war quants,” a group primarily made up of engineers and economists, were given extensive training in quantitative calculation methods. They used these techniques to ascertain a variety of things – the likely production capacities of the enemy and the potential risk of invasion, for example. But today risk management applies to much more than war. In our time, risk is analyzed by everyone, from governmental institutions to corporations. Consider this: In 2007, three large independent studies were conducted by, respectively, The Economist, Aon Corporation, an insurance broker, and Protivity, a risk management consulting firm. The surveys examined the role of risks and risk management in more than 320 organizations across 29 countries. The results? Although the studies were worded differently and focused on slightly different factors, there were interesting consistencies between them. For instance, all three studies showed that the function of risk management is increasing on an organizational level. Depending on which survey you look at, anywhere from 35 to 60 percent of all companies have hired or intend to hire a Chief Risk Officer, or CRO. And Aon’s report showed that the boards of 88 percent of surveyed companies are “actively engaged in the review of risk management.” So it’s clear that risk management is important. But there’s an issue: the most commonly used methods are flawed. How? For starters, commonly used qualitative descriptions like “very likely” are open to interpretation and mean different things to different people. How can you maintain consistent understanding in a group when some practice is described as having a “level 5” impact? To put it differently, everybody knows that something with a “very low” probability is less likely to happen than something with a “medium” probability, but how much less likely? It’s impossible to say. To prove this point, the author asked a client who had just attended an intensive risk-assessment workshop with co-workers what it meant to say an event was “very likely.” The client said that it meant it had a 20 percent likelihood of occurring; his colleagues disagreed, however, and a heated argument erupted. Some thought his estimate too low; others thought it too high. But that’s not the only way common methods are flawed. Another major issue is that scoring methods don’t take into account the relationships between risks. For instance, more often than not, risk factors are related to each other, whether by a correlation or a common mode risk that increases the likelihood of both risked outcomes occurring. Just consider the hydraulic controls in planes. Oftentimes, three identical systems are installed in one aircraft; the redundancy supposedly makes the likelihood of all three simultaneously failing one-in-a-billion. But there’s one problem: the common mode risk – that is, the potential for an action that either triggers other actions or makes them more likely. In this situation, the common mode risk results from the hydraulic tubes being installed in close proximity to one another; such proximity makes them highly prone to total failure from a single event, like shrapnel from a broken propeller severing all three. Unfortunately, the issues don’t stop there. Another flaw with popular methods is that they rely exclusively on expert opinions. We’ll explore that next. The opinions of esteemed experts are respected and relied on by people for all manner of things, and risk-management methods are no exception. But expert opinion may not actually be so helpful for assessing risk. Why not? For one, extensive psychological research has consistently shown that people tend to overestimate their capabilities. Just consider the fact that 87 percent of Stanford MBA students put their academic performance in the top half of their class. Another famous study showed that a clear majority of people claim to be better than average drivers, something most of us know to be false. But the proof goes on: the Cornell psychologists Kruger and Dunning published a book called Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Awareness, which showed that approximately two-thirds of the population consider themselves exceedingly reasonable, humorous and grammatical. According to the author, even so-called experts are affected by these statistics. They tend to be overly sure of their predictions and they therefore underestimate risks. But there’s another issue with expert opinion in risk management: the fact that people’s experience is biased – a fact that psychologists like Daniel Kahneman, recipient of the Nobel Memorial Pize in Economic Sciences, have used to show that our ability to evaluate probability is flawed. But flawed how? The simple truth is that our memories aren’t 100 percent perfect and we don’t work like computers. Therefore our minds are influenced by biases such as the peak end rule, which states that we usually remember extreme and recent experiences better than others. For instance, if we once went on a picnic that was ruined by rain, even though the forecast only predicted a 5 percent chance showers, we tend to assume that the forecast is inaccurate because we fail to remember all the times the weather prediction was correct. While the opinions of experts are biased like those of everyone else, even the most quantitatively accurate methods require some sort of expert advice in order to effectively identify risks. The good news is there’s a way to improve expert opinion. It’s called calibration training and here’s how it works: The main purpose of calibration training is to give people an accurate picture of their uncertainties. While the most important parts of these trainings are repetition and feedback, there are many ways to calibrate. For instance, a straightforward calibration exercise is to test for ranges. This training is especially important for calibrating estimates for probabilistic models such as the Monte Carlo Simulation, a tool we’ll cover in more detail later on. For now, here’s how range testing works: The testee is asked questions like, “How old was the youngest person to fly into space” or “What was the dollar price for a ton of steel a year ago?” They then respond with lower- and higher-end estimates, the lower bound meaning the testee is 95 percent certain that the actual value is higher and the higher bound meaning they’re 95 percent certain the correct value will be lower. Another testing method is the post-mortem analysis. In this exercise, the testee is asked to estimate the probability of a disaster by assuming it already occurred and then asked why it happened. This method has proven effective at producing more complete and creative ideas about potential risks than brainstorming alone. Remember, experts who have been calibrated with such methods are the best source of data for any probabilistic risk-assessment method, but what’s the best method of risk assessment? The absolute best method for assessing risks is called the Monte Carlo Simulation. It’s been used to evaluate some of the biggest risks imaginable from nuclear power safety to oil exploration and even environmental policies. How does it work? Monte Carlo tests analyze the variables associated with any given risk and process data to produce risk analysis models. In other words, a Monte Carlo displays all the factors that influence the probability and magnitude of a risk and then uses them to run thousands of random scenarios which ascertain the real probability of particular outcomes. For instance, imagine you want to invest $1.5 million in a new factory to produce wrenches. The variables are how much the factory could produce, the average price you can get for a wrench and the average demand per year. By combining these variables you can determine the return on your investment in the first year, aka the risk of making no money. The next step? Once you have your variables in place you need to set realistic ranges for them. In the ideal scenario you’ll have empirical data to go off, but in most cases you’ll need to rely on some sort of expert opinion, of course improved through calibration training. So, say your calibrated experts come up with a low to high range for production capacity of 400,000 to 1 million, price boundaries of $0.7 to $2.5 and a demand range of between 300,000 and 1.5 million. Your model then randomly creates 10,000 or more scenarios within these ranges and tells you how much money you’d make or lose in each situation. As long as your variables were certain, the mean of all the returned outcomes should be your real return. But remember that this hypothetical was simple and didn’t include tricky things like the correlations between variables, for instance between demand and price. In a standard simulation you’ll likely be dealing with more than 50 variables that are complexly interrelated! One of the most common criticisms of quantitative probability methods like the Monte Carlo simulation is that there’s simply not enough data to simulate specific events. The skeptics agree that methods like these are preferable to soft methods such as scoring, but maintain that there’s no way to get the data necessary for a simulation to be effective, using this claim to justify the use of expert opinion and scoring methods. But the truth is, there’s a better option. Institutions like insurance companies and the nuclear-power industry compute the odds of hypothetical events all the time. For instance, nuclear power companies have run several simulations of events that are likely to occur once every 500 years – longer than the industry has even existed. How do they do it? By deconstructing the risk model – in this case a nuclear power plant – into its component parts and computing the risk of failure for each individual component. This works because while some disasters have never occurred and as a result there’s no data for such events, the nuclear power industry does have extensive research and empirical data on the failure rates of the individual parts which compose a power plant – things like human error, valves and different materials. This technique of deconstruction can be applied to most situations. You’ll be amazed at how much you can learn by carefully taking the object of your risk assessment apart and searching for data. Once you’ve attained data in this way you can pass it along to someone with the requisite knowledge about the relationships between the components and construct a risk model like a Monte Carlo. The model will in turn calculate the probability of multiple parts failing simultaneously or in quick succession; it will also calculate the magnitude of the disaster, and just like that you’ve ascertained the risk of something that never occurred. So the accuracy of any probability assessment is based on the quality of the model that’s used and the precision of the parameters and assumptions that are fed into it. Knowing this, you can ensure your model is accurate by comparing your estimates with the facts on the ground. Why? Because testing your predictions against reality will uncover flaws, such as variables that are consistently missing from your estimates. This information is key to finding weaknesses in your model and will help you improve your probabilistic tools. But how can you know if conducting a risk analysis is worth it for your organization? To figure that out, you need to consider the value of additional information. For instance, the ultimate goal of conducting a risk analysis is to mitigate danger, because in a business context this almost always means saving money. Therefore, it’s essential to calculate what risk experts call the expected value of additional information. For example, if you could save $30,000 in minimized risk by spending $8,000 on a survey, the expense is a no-brainer. But according to the experience of the author, most people don’t take the time to determine the value of additional information. You can avoid this mistake by calculating what a risk analysis is worth to you with these easy steps: Begin by determining what’s called your expected opportunity loss; this probability of your losing money in any scenario multiplied by the amount of money you'd lose. Let’s say this number, your expected “cost of being wrong,” comes out at $60,000. Now you know how much money you’re willing to spend for information that’ll make you sure of your investment. Once you’ve determined this, it’s time to look for uncertain variables in your model that contribute the most to your target parameter – the return on your investment, in this case. For example, being more certain about the average price of your goods could drastically increase the assurance that you’ll turn a profit. Building, utilizing and maintaining the appropriate risk-management tools is essential to mitigating risk, but even with the right tools there are still plenty of barriers to managing risk – for instance, things like organizational silos, a type of structural problem resulting in the blockage of information, resources and authority. Consider the fact that all managers are in part risk managers because every manager is required, to some degree, to measure risk and return. In most cases, managers can effectively monitor the risk of their own area. But when it comes to assessing the risk of major decisions that have implications for multiple departments – like the construction of a new production facility, for example – you’ll need a more comprehensive approach to analysis. Why? Because it’ll help you overcome problems like organizational silos, stubborn departments and managers who don’t readily share information with others. It’s therefore essential to have a department devoted to reviewing and standardizing all risk-related decisions while unifying decision-makers and subject experts. Because such a department, in addition to keeping tabs on risks and their relationships across your organization, will also be better at identifying the stakeholders and experts who are essential to assessing risk and return. Not just that, but by having a standardized process for risk analysis you can optimize your existing risk models by adding new empirical data and building what’s called a scenario library – a collection of standard corporate risk scenarios replete with a set of variables and correlations. This tool can then be used as the standard for everyone in your organization! The key message in this book: The most common risk-management methods are flawed because they rely on qualitative descriptions and don’t account for human bias and the relationships between risks.Therefore, in order to effectively determine and manage risk it’s essential to use probabilistic models, which rely on calibrated experts and comprehensive variables.  Suggested further reading: The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb The Black Swan offers insights into perceived randomness and the limitations we face in making predictions. Our over-reliance on methods that appeal to our intuition at the expense of accuracy, our basic inability to understand and define randomness, and even our biology itself all contribute to poor decision making, and sometimes to “Black Swans” – events thought to be impossible that redefine our understanding of the world.

Using his experience of political strategy, his media savvy and his deep knowledge of how political and regulatory decision-making works, Tusk has helped start-ups like Uber, FanDuel and Lemonade fight back against an establishment that wanted to eliminate them. In these blinks, we’ll discover how Tusk learned the craft of political campaigning and strategy, from securing press coverage for Chuck Schumer to ruining Anthony Weiner’s prospects for the New York mayoralty. We’ll find out how as an advisor to, and investor in, major start-ups, he has battled against corrupt decision-making, entrenched corporate interests and regulatory laziness. In these blinks, you’ll learn: what a funeral for dead trees taught Tusk about the power of the media; how Uber demonstrated that people power could override establishment interests; and why if things had been just a little different, we could have had President Bloomberg instead of President Trump. All politicians crave two things: Constant attention and constant validation. Outside of elections, the best way to achieve those is to get good publicity. Tusk learned this in the 1980s working for Henry Stern, a New York City council member and the city’s parks commissioner. Tusk’s job was to get as much publicity for Stern as possible, partly because it kept the politician happy, and partly because the more time the Parks Department spent in the public eye, the easier it would be for Stern to secure his budget and policies. Parks aren’t inherently that interesting, so Tusk was forced to be creative. When Stern wanted to push for new measures to make it a crime to fell trees without permission, Tusk staged a funeral for \"murdered” trees. When a new bathroom was constructed in one of the city’s parks, the media were invited not to a ribbon-cutting ceremony, but the ceremonial cutting of a toilet roll. The press lapped it up, the coverage was great, and Stern was happy. Tusk’s creativity came in handy in his next job, as communications director to Chuck Schumer, Democratic senator for New York. Schumer understood that most voters don’t really know what politicians do all day. But they do like to see that their politicians are busy. As a result, the whole Schumer operation revolved around getting constant media coverage. This could be difficult, because as a junior senator, Schumer didn’t have all that much to do. So Tusk and his team would invent things, like writing a tough letter to the Ford Motor Company in protest at the rising cost of windshield wiper liquid. On one occasion, Tusk worked up and released to the media a proposal for the modernization of the old-fashioned, unreliable voting machines used in elections. This idea proved unexpectedly prescient when, weeks later, the 2000 presidential election descended into chaos due, in part, to disputed votes made on old-fashioned punch-card machines. It seemed clear that America needed a new system. An avalanche of press coverage for Schumer – now regarded as the expert on the subject – ensued. Tusk learned how to give his political bosses what they craved. And that was an important lesson for his future career: if you can mold the media narrative, you can get what you want from politicians. When Tusk became campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg’s bid for a third mayoral term in 2009, the outlook wasn’t great. During eight years in office, Bloomberg had put up taxes, raised water rates and cost New Yorkers a lot of money. The mayor was in for a fight, whoever his opponent turned out to be. But what Tusk wanted to avoid was going up against state congressman Anthony Weiner. At the time, Weiner was a leading Democratic contender. He was charismatic, a great fundraiser, and – importantly in multiethnic New York – a Jewish guy with an Italian name. So Tusk built an entire campaign solely to knock Weiner out of contention for the Democratic nomination. How? By making Weiner feel like the risk of standing was so great that he would simply quit. This entailed fighting dirty to make Weiner nervous about the scrutiny he’d face if he did run. The only legislation Weiner had passed was a bill giving more visas to models. Tusk’s research team found that Weiner had received donations from some of the models in question. This was not just pay-to-play – donating in return for favors – it was also illegal, as only US citizens can make donations. After a briefing from Tusk’s team, the New York Post ran a damaging story about “Weiner’s ‘Naughty’ Hottie$.” Tusk also wanted to intimidate Weiner with a show of strength when canvassing voters house by house. Normally, starting this activity early is pointless, as voters largely ignore elections until near voting day. But this time, the aim wasn’t to win votes. It was to intimidate Weiner. Bloomberg volunteers went doorknocking in Weiner and his family’s neighborhoods. When Weiner’s dad opened his front door to the Bloomberg campaign, it sent a message. Tusk did the same with digital, bulk-buying online adverts, but only for users in Weiner’s zip code. Every time Weiner went online he’d see \"Bloomberg for mayor” ads. The highly personal, targeted strategy worked. Eventually, with his polling numbers looking weak, and his sense of personal jeopardy growing, Weiner chose not to run. Bloomberg went on to win a third term. This was Tusk’s last campaign in politics. He got a bonus, $234,000 after taxes, from a grateful Bloomberg, and used it to set up a political strategy consultancy. Things started a little slow, but then Tusk took a call from a contact. A transportation start-up was having problems. Could Tusk help? Today, Uber is part of everyday life for millions of people. But not long ago, the rise of the ride-hailing company was under threat from all sides. The unions hated Uber because they couldn’t organize its drivers, who were all small businessmen. The taxi industry hated Uber because lifelong taxi users were abandoning them overnight after experiencing a single Uber ride. Regulators disliked Uber because it was new and different. And politicians hated Uber because their donors from the taxi industry were harassing them about it. In response to these challenges, Uber hired Tusk. Washington DC was an early example of the fight they faced. At the request of the city’s taxi commissioner and taxi industry, a local politician introduced legislation that would, in practice, ban Uber. Tusk had seen time and again in his earlier career that politicians can be manipulated if you can shift the public narrative. Politicians don’t necessarily consider issues by looking for the best public policy solution. They think \"Is this going to anger my donors? How is this going to make me look good or bad in the media?\" Therefore, Tusk aimed to demonstrate that popular opinion on this issue was so strong that it outweighed the interests of taxi-industry donors. Tusk’s team crafted a press release accusing DC politicians of keeping transportation prices artificially high to protect the influential taxi industry. This started to shape the media narrative. Then, through its app, Uber encouraged drivers and customers to contact their DC city council member directly to express their anger at the ban, providing the contact details to do so. Usually, a city councilor gets just a couple dozen calls or emails about even a contentious issue. So they were not prepared for what happened next – almost 40,000 tweets and 50,000 emails from Uber users and drivers to city politicians in just a couple of days. When you can show a politician that your ability to generate negative media and hurt his poll ratings far outweighs the benefits of keeping his donors happy, then you can get him to do pretty much anything you want. After Tusk’s campaign, not only was the legislation abandoned, but new legislation explicitly authorizing Uber passed unanimously later that year. But Tusk and Uber would still face a hard fight with higher stakes. Nowhere was more important to Uber than New York, because what happens in the nation’s cultural and financial capital sets a precedent that other cities and states often follow. Unfortunately for Uber, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed legislation to limit Uber’s growth at 1 percent a year. In effect, de Blasio’s bill would kill Uber in the Big Apple and send a huge negative signal to the world, likely damaging Uber’s growth elsewhere. Tusk came up with a strategy to surprise de Blasio. Firstly, they hit him from the left. De Blasio’s whole brand was about being on the side of New York’s vulnerable – people on lower incomes, immigrants and people of color. But these were precisely the people who benefitted from Uber, whether as drivers or users. So Tusk ran ads that featured passengers from the Bronx and from Queens. They related how yellow taxis ignored them because of the color of their skin, and how with Uber they could finally reliably catch a ride. De Blasio was suddenly on the wrong side of his own supporters. Secondly, they pushed the idea that de Blasio’s agenda was pure corruption. Taxi drivers were the mayor’s second largest donors, and Tusk would later discover that the industry had written the legislation that de Blasio published. The taxi industry in New York had deep pockets, but Uber was rapidly eating up their market. Tusk’s team generated media stories about the dubious links between the mayor and industry, and suddenly, de Blasio looked to be the very thing he’d always railed against – a man in the pocket of moneyed interests. Thirdly, Tusk again unleashed the full power of Uber’s users. Uber added a \"de Blasio” button on the app. Users who tapped on it received an explanation of the problem, along with a request to email and tweet their council members. In just one week, 250,000 people did just that. After a couple of weeks of pressure from the media, drivers and users, city council members started to drop support for de Blasio. Supporting de Blasio and the taxi industry was no longer more important than stopping the public beating they were getting from real voters. A little later, the mayor’s office abandoned the bill. Uber’s future was safe. Handy is a platform that connects customers with handymen and cleaners. The workers are independent contractors, just like Uber drivers. But the start-up planned to do something new – to give its independent contractors benefits like a pension or healthcare. Handy’s idea was to set up a benefits fund that other sharing economy platforms like Uber or Lyft could also pay into if they wished. Potentially millions more American workers could get benefits while maintaining the flexibility of being an independent contractor. All Handy needed were clarifications to labor laws so that contractors paying benefits wouldn’t be reclassified as full-time employees. So who stood in the way of this improvement to working conditions? Surprisingly, unions and Democratic politicians. Unions hate independent contractors. They can’t organize them, represent them or, crucially, charge them membership dues. And the United States’ existing, vague labor laws gave unions influence. Vague laws meant unions could put pressure on politicians – usually in receipt of union donations – to apply state laws in a way that prohibited the rise of independent contractors and the sharing economy. Tusk and Handy took the fight to New York but immediately ran up against a brick wall in the form of SEIU 32BJ, the union for security guards and janitors. SEIU 32BJ doesn’t represent any housekeepers, but nonetheless regarded anything related to cleaning as their jurisdiction and wouldn’t give ground. The union’s president, Hector Figueroa, had good political reasons not to. After all, he would soon be up for re-election. His opponents would pounce on any sign of weakness, like modifying New York’s labor laws in a way that could make life easier for non-unionized independent contractors. When Tusk’s team talked to the office of the state governor, Democrat Andrew Cuomo, the problem was clear. Cuomo’s labor-issues representative clearly understood Handy’s proposal. But the same question kept coming up \"What’s 32BJ’s view on this?\" The governor wouldn’t do anything that the union opposed. Tusk didn’t win this fight in New York. But he and Handy continue to battle at state and federal levels to secure new laws. Sometimes, creative campaigns can overcome self-interested politics. Other times, that creativity needs to be matched with persistence. The ancient Greek philosopher Pericles said that just because you take no interest in politics, it doesn’t mean politics isn’t going to take any interest in you. The daily fantasy sports industry should have heeded those words when it was thrown off course by a political risk it didn’t see coming. Daily fantasy sports games are now big business. The games allow fans to create fantasy team lineups for major sports like the NFL and win money depending on their selected players’ performance in real-world games each day. In 2014 and 2015, the new market grew incredibly fast. The two companies which account for almost all the market, FanDuel and DraftKings, received hundreds of millions in investments, and their customer base rocketed. The two businesses were so relentlessly focused on competing with one another that they didn’t give much consideration to the opponents they shared. These included the casinos, who have long established and tight relationships with state governments, and the politicians and advocacy groups from both left and right who hate gaming. Tusk even met with FanDuel in 2015, but while the business liked Tusk’s ideas, it was so focused on its competition that it felt political strategy wasn’t a priority. So FanDuel were poorly prepared when, in October 2015, the New York Times published a damning accusation claiming that a midlevel DraftKings employee had used confidential information to enhance his teams in a FanDuel competition, winning $350,000. The accusations would never be proven, but the damage had been done. The attorney general for New York State announced an investigation into the industry, and other states followed, urged on by local casinos and anti-gaming advocates. Suddenly, the legality of daily fantasy sports was in doubt in 39 states. The situation rapidly turned into a lobbying match between casinos and daily fantasy sports. Tusk, now working with FanDuel to fight back, knew well that in a battle between long-time political donors – the casinos – and start-ups with no political relationships, the casinos would win. Unless, just like with Uber, they could fight back with a wave of customer advocacy so big that politicians wouldn’t be able to ignore it. Using the FanDuel app, 150,000 customers contacted their state legislators. By the end of the 2017 legislative session, they’d passed legislation securing daily fantasy sports in 15 states. It was a good outcome but, had the start-ups been better prepared, they wouldn’t have needed to defend themselves. If you’ve ever had to deal with all the bureaucracy and costs of traditional insurance companies, you’ll probably agree that the industry needs a little disruption. So Lemonade, a fully digital insurance company that promised easy sign-up, low prices and a typical payout time of three seconds, seemed like a pretty good bet to disrupt the industry. Lemonade’s model was different from normal insurers. It was based around customers paying into a pool from which Lemonade drew its costs and profit, and from which any claims were paid out. Any money left over in the pool at the end of the year would be paid back to customers instead of Lemonade keeping it as profit, as a traditional insurer would. There was just one problem – the New York Department of Financial Services, or DFS, was refusing to grant Lemonade an insurance license. Lemonade seemed to be too different to tick all the boxes needed to grant a license because DFS’s inflexible processes were based around traditional insurance models. It was clear to Tusk that simply talking to the regulators wouldn’t work, so he decided on a political strategy. Tusk and Lemonade would persuade the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, to overrule the regulator by showing the high political cost if Lemonade wasn’t approved. As a start-up, being able to take on the regulator and politicians depends on having a couple of things: a narrative into which the media can buy, good inside lobbying, money to spend on advertising, the ability to hurt the politicians by leaving town and the moral high ground. Luckily, Lemonade had them all. Tusk’s team started spreading the story that New York was so under the influence of its entrenched business interests that innovative Lemonade would be forced to relocate to London. This was supported by a more aggressive line. A researcher collected lists of political donations from the insurance industry to Cuomo, enabling Lemonade to pitch stories about pay-to-play decision-making. Tusk’s team prepared a letter from a group of venture capitalists saying that if New York couldn’t license an innovator like Lemonade, what was the point of investing in the city’s tech sector? Tusk saw some signs that the DFS’s senior team were getting nervous about the pressure, but with no decision forthcoming, Tusk’s lobbyists told the governor's office to make up its mind. Either the newspaper headlines the next day would say that New York just approved an innovative, customer-friendly insurance business, or they could say that one of the hottest start-ups in the United States just left town because the governor preferred bureaucracy to jobs. A few days later, Lemonade was approved. Michael Bloomberg looked, on paper, like a great candidate for the 2016 presidential election. He was an independent at a time when distrust for both parties was high and he could self-finance his entire campaign, meaning he wouldn’t be beholden to any special interests. In early 2016, Bloomberg started seriously considering a run for the presidency, and Tusk agreed to take a leave of absence from his business to run the campaign if it went ahead. The strategy for victory was complicated. Bloomberg could never win a majority in the electoral college – the usual route to the White House. But if he could win enough states to prevent anyone else getting a majority, then the House of Representatives would have to elect the president. Then he might be able to secure the critical votes. Tusk had to get imaginative about how Bloomberg would get his vote out. After all, Bloomberg had no party infrastructure on which to rely. So he made a proposal to Uber. If the Bloomberg campaign would pay for a ride for every United States voter to and from the polling station, would Uber put a Bloomberg button on its app? Customers taking a free ride wouldn’t have to vote for the guy, of course, but there was a good chance they would. Tusk’s second idea was to differentiate Bloomberg from Clinton and Trump. He wanted to build the campaign around the idea that one person can’t solve America’s problems alone. But if you believe America is broken, went Tusk’s thesis, Bloomberg will give you a team of the brightest and best to fix it. The idea was to recruit the most talented people to fill the government. On Tusk’s wish list were Bill Gates for education secretary, Elon Musk for energy secretary and Warren Buffett for the Treasury. In the end, Tusk’s innovative campaign ideas didn’t matter because Bloomberg decided not to run. At the time, the polling indicated that he was most likely to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances if he ran, increasing the chances of Trump getting into office. That, for Bloomberg, was the issue settled. He wasn’t prepared to risk letting Trump take the presidency. For Tusk, the decision was hard to swallow. It meant missing a once-in-a-lifetime chance to run an innovative presidential bid on an unlimited budget. And when Trump's victory later came to pass, Tusk regretted the lost opportunity of a Bloomberg presidency, which could have – in Tusk’s view – offered a safer, better America. Traditional businesses have a competitive advantage when it comes to politics. They know plenty of politicians, have lobbyists in all the right places and make tactically savvy donations. They’ll use all of these advantages to stop the start-ups trying to disrupt their markets. So if you work for or have founded a start-up, it’s time to even things up. Here’s how to get a little savvier about how to fight back. Firstly, if you aren’t clear whether your product or service complies with all regulations, then work out whether to ask for permission before launching or just get on with it and beg for forgiveness later. Uber took the latter approach, deciding that its best interests lay in rolling out the service without asking regulators for explicit permission. It quickly built a loyal customer base and then fought its regulatory battles – begging for forgiveness for any infringements it had committed and working through its problems from a position of strength. As Uber showed, this can be a powerful approach to take. But it isn’t always right. A key question to ask is \"from whom would you be begging?\" There’s a big difference between dealing with an irritated regulator and finding yourself up in front of a judge and jury with the prospect of a jail sentence. Try and avoid the latter. Whatever approach it takes, every start-up that threatens the status quo will face a political fight at some point, so consider what tools you have to fight with. Firstly, what are your politically valuable assets? Can you either give or take away? Like jobs, for instance, or your HQ. Can you threaten a move out of the state? Secondly, who are your allies? Fighting alone is hard, so try to build a coalition that will convince your decision-makers, whether that means consumer-rights advocates or VC investors. Or get creative – perhaps a local politician has recently gotten tough with a different start-up and wants to prove he isn’t completely anti-innovation. If so, recruit him to your cause. Ultimately, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to fighting political battles. But investing in understanding the politicians who could impact your business, and how to shape the narrative in a way that will keep them on your side, could prove to be one of the best investments you’ll ever make. The key message in these blinks: When you disrupt someone, in industry or in politics, they don’t thank you for it. They punch you in the face. So start-ups facing political and regulatory risks need to learn to punch back. They can do that by understanding how to shift the public and media narrative in favor of their interests by exploiting signs of corruption in political decision-making and by mobilizing their customers. If you are a start-up founder, getting savvy about politics could be one of the best investments you ever make.  Actionable advice: Incorporate political analysis into your expansion strategy.  If you are plotting market expansion, include an analysis of the political and regulatory outlook. Consider what laws may permit or limit your activity, and whether the political climate is pro-innovation or a little conservative. When weighing up potential new markets, consider how powerful your opponents are in each. That way you can be best prepared for any political battles ahead of you. Got feedback?

But this isn’t the only industrial revolution. In fact, there have been three, and we’re currently experiencing a fourth. Like those before it, this new industrial revolution is transforming the world, but it’s doing so in much more significant ways than any of the previous industrial revolutions; it’s moving more rapidly, happening on a larger scale and having a more profound impact on life and industry. We’re now seeing the rise of incredible technologies like self-driving cars, 3D printing and robots that can follow very precise instructions. And, meanwhile, fields that hitherto never interacted are joining to produce unimaginable results. The fourth industrial revolution marks the beginning of a new era, one that it’s essential for you to understand. In these blinks, you’ll learn about a new nanomaterial that’s stronger than steel and thinner than a strand of hair; why automation will actually increase the number of jobs and improve the economy; and what to expect from the future. Some 10,000 years ago, a massive shift in the history of humanity took place: humans began to farm. This move away from foraging and hunting was profound. Indeed, it marked a revolution in human history – the agrarian revolution. This was but the first in a series of revolutions, each of which would transform life on Earth. Over the course of human history, there have been three industrial revolutions. The first occurred when we began using mechanical power rather than sheer human muscle. It happened between 1760 and 1840, spurred in particular by the development of steam power and construction of railroads. The second industrial revolution dawned with the rise of mass production in the late nineteenth century and continued into the first half of the twentieth. The hallmarks of this industrial shift were the assembly line and electrified power. And, finally, the third industrial revolution is often referred to as either the computer revolution or the digital revolution. Its contributions were the advent of computers, as well as semiconductors and the internet, which was developed in the latter half of the twentieth century. But that wasn’t the last industrial revolution to date. In fact, we’re currently experiencing a fourth industrial revolution, which began early in the twenty-first century. This revolution brought about a much more mobile internet, as well as better, cheaper and smaller sensors that are enabling the development of new technologies. It has also seen the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, this new industrial revolution isn’t only about smart machines. It encompasses a number of different fields as well, from material science to nanotechnology, energy to biology. What really separates this fourth industrial revolution from those that preceded it is that it merges these fields and connects them across digital, physical and biological platforms. Naturally, there are a number of other characteristics that distinguish the fourth industrial revolution. In the next blink, we’ll explore this shift in greater detail, teasing out how it’s truly distinct from those that came before it. As you’ve learned, the fourth industrial revolution is underway. It’s happening faster, on a larger scale and having a greater impact on the world than previous revolutions. First, it’s moving at lightning speed. This makes perfect sense given that the modern world is more interconnected and richer in technology than ever before. Such factors allow this revolution to evolve exponentially, rather than linearly. Just consider the smartphone. The iPhone was introduced in 2007, and by 2015, a mere eight years later, there were around two billion smartphones. Additionally, this technology was dramatically developed and refined during those few years. So this revolution is defined by speed, but also by unprecedented returns to scale that allow businesses to produce the same or greater value with relatively fewer employment-associated costs. This change is driven by digitization and automation of production. As an example, consider the fact that when taken together, the three most successful businesses in Detroit in 1990 – when the city was still a hotbed of industry – had a $36 billion market capitalization, $250 billion in revenue and employed 1.2 million people. By contrast, the three largest Silicon Valley companies in 2014 had revenue of $247 billion and market capitalization of over a trillion dollars but employed just 137,000 people. That’s just over a tenth of the workforce that the Detroit firms had in 1990. Finally, this revolution is having an outsized impact on our world by integrating a range of domains and disciplines. For example, fields such as 3D printing, computational design, materials engineering and synthetic biology are now being fused in ways that could enable creating entirely new organs for people who need them. Okay, so the fourth industrial revolution is clearly unlike previous ones. But how exactly is it being driven? Well, in addition to the souped-up digital computing power at the root of modern information technology and digitization, there are also a few significant physical trends: autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, advanced robotics and new materials.  The first, autonomous vehicles, refers to driverless cars, but also to trucks, boats and even aircrafts. These new forms of transportation are possible because of technological innovations like artificial intelligence and sensors, both of which are core to the fourth industrial revolution and are permeating all manner of fields. For instance, because of advanced sensor technology, drones can now navigate much more effectively in response to the environment and therefore can be used for a number of new tasks, like dropping medicine into war zones and helping farmers measure their crops’ need for water or fertilizer. The second physical trend of this industrial revolution is 3D printing, or, as it’s sometimes called, additive manufacturing. This new technology has been enabled by advanced computing, including digital drawing and modeling. Incredibly, 3D printing is already being used in fields as diverse as medicine and energy production, producing everything from micro medical implants to massive wind turbines. The third trend, advanced robotics, is spreading like wildfire across every industry, from nursing to precision agriculture. Robots are becoming increasingly adapted to their environments as they no longer require autonomous instruction and can instead pull data from the cloud. They can even collaborate with humans. Lastly, new materials are also making a splash; they’re stronger, lighter, recyclable and more adaptive than the materials of the past. Some can even heal or clean themselves. Just take graphene, a newly discovered nanomaterial. It’s 200 times stronger than steel and a million times thinner than a single human hair. It’s also a very efficient conductor of both electricity and heat. But not every trend in the fourth industrial revolution is physical. Next up, you’ll learn about some that are much more ethereal. While physical innovations are a major aspect of the fourth industrial revolution, others are purely digital. One of these is known as the internet of things, or IoT. The IoT is a core concept that brings together physical and digital applications. It describes a network between physical devices – be they smartphones or home appliances – and the people who use them. Constructing such a network is possible thanks to advances in technologies like transmitters and sensors. For example, these days packages in the post are often equipped with a sensor, a transmitter or some other radio frequency identification equipment, enabling us to follow their progress as they make their way to us. Uber and Airbnb present other examples. Through digital platforms, these businesses connect physical objects, namely cars and houses, with the people who need them. And, finally, in the fourth industrial revolution, there are a range of biological trends and innovations around things like genetics. Genetic engineering, in particular, will have a tremendous impact on humanity. For instance, compared to the Human Genome Project, which lasted for ten years and cost billions, a genome today can be sequenced within hours for less than a thousand dollars. We owe this progress to increased computing power. Contemporary scientists can use models to test genetic variations, evaluating them much more quickly than through the previous method of trial and error. In fact, science may soon be capable of precision medicine. That is, scientists could do things like decode the genetic composition of a tumor and offer a treatment that’s tailored to that specific case of cancer. And that’s not all genetic innovation could enable. It will also allow us to design plants, animals and even babies with the characteristics we desire. Such technological applications are no longer the stuff of science fiction. While such interventions, of course, pose ethical and regulatory considerations, the technology to make them happen has either already been developed or soon will be. So the fourth industrial revolution is clearly a powerful engine of progress and growth. But how will it impact the world around us? Well, there are several areas that will be affected in particular, and the first is the economy. More precisely, this industrial revolution will likely have a significant positive impact on the global economy, simply by spurring economic growth. While pessimists might argue that we’re still living out the recession of the 2008 financial crisis, we’re really in the midst of a massive economic upswing brought on by the fourth industrial revolution. And this process of technological growth is only beginning; with time, it will translate into real economic growth. For instance, advanced technologies and digitization are making it cheaper to invest in renewable energy, energy storage and more efficient fuels. This will make investment much more profitable, which means companies won’t have to rely on government subsidies and, as a result, GDP will rise while we reduce the threats posed by climate change. That being said, the global economy could also be negatively impacted as these new technologies challenge the current employment market. More specifically, the fourth revolution could trigger a destruction effect in the labor market, wherein people lose their jobs to computers. In fact, we’re already seeing a number of positions – telephone operators and bookkeepers, for instance – being taken over by computers. More jobs are likely to meet the same fate in the near future, including those of legal secretaries, tax preparers and real-estate brokers. However, the same industrial revolution that causes this automation of the economy will also trigger a capitalization effect. In other words, the increase in automation will bring prosperity, thereby increasing demand and creating new jobs and businesses. So while detractors might frame this as a battle between humans and machines, that’s not exactly correct. Humans are tremendously adaptable and shouldn’t fear this change. Instead, we should focus on helping those in danger of losing their jobs so they can transition into other work, as well as educate ourselves about how to best collaborate with machines. Now that you understand the fourth industrial revolution, let’s zoom out a bit to the national and global levels. Taking such a broad view is essential since public bodies are also being impacted by this technological transformation, governments in particular. After all, new technologies disrupt traditional, centralized structures of power. For instance, digitization has enabled the private sector and individual citizens to easily and publicly express their opinions on digital platforms, while also allowing them to unite and possibly even act against traditional governmental systems. WikiLeaks is a great example. This relatively small enterprise successfully confronted an entire state. That being said, it’s equally possible for governments to use new technologies – surveillance systems, for example – to counteract this increasing citizen power. Whatever the eventual outcome, it’s inevitable that public institutions will feel the impact of new technologies and be forced to conceive of novel ways to interact with their citizens. That’s why, in the world of the fourth industrial revolution, governments must rapidly adapt their regulations to the constant changes around them. For instance, prior to this industrial revolution, governments could use an entirely top-down approach to regulation; they could take their time to create, revise and enforce all manner of industrial regulations. But today, technologies develop at such incredible speed that regulations need to evolve far faster than before, and the rapid news cycle means leaders are under pressure to make fast decisions. To respond to such constant changes, governments must collaborate with their citizens and private institutions in a brand new way. One example of this is investment in e-governance, which uses digital technology to increase citizen participation and the efficacy of government. Regardless of what these new approaches look like, the rise of the fourth industrial revolution and the technology it creates certainly mean one thing: the future will be fundamentally different than the past. The key message in this book: Human civilization has been marked by a series of three industrial revolutions, and we’re currently living through a fourth. It is distinguished from those before it by its lightning speed, large scale and the unprecedented impact it is wielding on everything from industry to our daily lives.  Got feedback?

Did this not strike you as strange? Money really is an odd thing. Humanity has been using it for a long time, but even economists are still divided over its exact character. Also, it comes in many different forms, both tangible and not, from shells to bills to Bitcoins. These blinks offer an in-depth look at money’s turbulent history, its uncertain future and the many ways in which the economy has tried to make sense of it. As we move through the centuries, you’ll also discover one more reason to envy Australians; how money is related to quantum theory; and why two pizzas once sold for what would be worth millions in today’s money. Have you noticed how bartering comes very naturally to children? Perhaps you remember exchanging a juice box for some cookies, or your best set of marbles for a Matchbox car. One old and popular theory holds that money was “invented” as societies outgrew the barter system. In fact, this theory dates back to Aristotle. Though it was essentially pure speculation, the theory gained traction with many great thinkers who followed, including the influential eighteenth-century economist, Adam Smith. They all believed that money was an outgrowth of commercial trading – where, for example, some valuable bit of property such as cattle could be traded for a certain number of slaves. But this isn’t very efficient; things like cattle aren’t very easy to transport, whereas coins are. Plus, the precious metals in coins were seen as being valuable just about anywhere, while other goods may not be in demand in some areas and are therefore less valuable. This idea of money evolving from bartering may sound plausible, but it’s actually been debunked. In 1913, Alfred Mitchell-Innes, a British economist, published his own findings, noting that there was no evidence in commercial history to suggest that a barter-only system ever existed. And Mitchell-Innes has yet to be proven wrong – in fact, historians have only gone on to find more evidence of ancient civilizations using old forms of money in addition to bartering. Around 5,000 years ago, in Sumer, one of Mesopotamia’s earliest urban civilizations, commercial transactions were recorded on clay tablets, which show us that salt, beads and bars of precious metals were all used as early versions of money. The truth is, we don’t know exactly how or when money came to be used, but we do know that the first coins began appearing in the seventh century BC, in the Mediterranean kingdom of Lydia. And by the sixth century BC, Greek city-states were minting their own coins as a demonstration of power and independence. You probably know that Sir Isaac Newton is one of world history’s most influential physicists, but did you know he also had a huge impact on our currency? Indeed, Newton is responsible for developing the relationship between money and its weight. This happened in 1649 after Newton suffered a nervous breakdown and took a job as warden of London’s Royal Mint. It was here that he put England on the gold standard, a system that uses a fixed rate between the currency’s weight, such as England’s silver coins, and the value of gold. This is how we got the name for a British “pound” – one of these silver coins used to be worth one pound of gold. But when it comes to money, it’s important to consider both its tangible and intangible properties. Money is, of course, a real and tangible object, like the coins and bills in your pocket. But money can also represent intangible things, such as the number denoting its value. Some people consider the dual nature of money – what it physically represents versus what it theoretically represents – to be similar to a quantum object, like a photon that has the characteristics of both a particle and a light wave. And like some quantum objects, money can change from one moment to the next. A one-dollar bill’s worth is determined by a trusted authority, such as the Federal Reserve. But once we begin using it to buy goods or services, that value can change due to market rates. So today a dollar might get you a bottle of water, but tomorrow conditions could change, and you might be able to sell that same bottle of water for two dollars. This complex nature has been confounding and enchanting economists for centuries. No one enjoys being in debt, but debt itself is a necessary part of a functioning economy. Debt can’t exist without negative numbers. And the first person to demonstrate the use of negative numbers was Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician who explained their purpose in his seventh-century book, The Opening of the Universe. From this point on, businesses could use bookkeeping and the double-entry system, which notates two kinds of transactions, negative debits and positive credits. This system made it a whole lot easier to find out when a transaction error may have occurred and also to evaluate how profitable a business was. Once transactions were recorded in a ledger, ideas of money lending began to emerge, introducing intangible concepts, such as interest. In seventh-century Mesopotamia, promissory notes known as sakk were introduced. Around the same time, Islam officially forbade usury, the practice of lending money at high interest rates, but it did allow for fees to be accepted in exchange for loans. Loans proved to be useful in the Middle Ages, as European towns used them to build churches, which was seen as justifiable since it was in service of God. With economies becoming more complex in the Middle Ages, an international banking system began to emerge. It began with tradesmen forming associations that led to companies, prompting moneylenders to require a more formal system of finance. Port cities like Venice and Florence began trading with Asia, which led to their becoming major financial centers. Moneychangers then formed their own guild called Arte del Cambio at the turn of the thirteenth century, making them the earliest version of modern bankers. Eventually, international traders realized that heavy coins weren’t ideal, which is how bills became popular. At first they were simply letters, instructing a banker or a foreign agent to make certain payments on the writer’s behalf. This dramatically boosted the efficiency of international trade. Now a merchant in Venice could purchase goods from a French supplier using a bill valued at an agreed exchange rate. The discovery of the Americas was, of course, a big deal for folks in the Old World, and part of that was due to the economic impact it had. After Hernán Cortés conquered Mexico in 1521, Spain soon learned about the financial chaos that too much of a good thing can suddenly cause. When Cortés landed in Mexico, he found that the Aztecs were rich in gold and silver, which they used for jewelry and decoration. For money, they used other things, such as cacao beans. And even though the Aztec emperor, Moctezuma II, offered the Spaniards gifts of silver and gold, they instead chose to conquer and take as much of the Aztec riches as they could. As a result, Spain was flooded with more precious metals than they could have imagined. Between 1500 and 1800, around 150,000 tons of silver and 2,800 tons of gold was produced. This influx led to a new problem: inflation, as the value of the precious metals declined. Prices now had to be adjusted, and as Spanish goods became more expensive, massive debt caused Spain to default on its loans a whopping 14 times between 1500 and 1700. However, this surplus of gold and silver allowed more European nations to mint coins. Even the lower classes now had access to them. The newfound riches also led to the development of mercantilist nations, such as Great Britain, which extended its military reach to secure as much of these precious metals as possible. Such nations operated under the mercantilist theory, which assumes that there’s a fixed amount of resources in the world, and a nation’s wealth depended on how much precious metal it possessed. So, for one to gain, another must lose. With very few gold and silver mines, Great Britain became eagerly expansive by granting a royal charter to the East India Trading Company at the beginning of the seventeenth century. This charter allowed the company to mint its own coins and spread England’s power to India, where the silver rupee became the Indian standard. Paper money has come a long way. It’s now a complex mix of numbers, watermarks and even holograms. The history of banknotes goes back to the early eighteenth century when France was facing some tough economic times. To help straighten things out, economist John Law convinced France to let him start his own bank and to use banknotes as currency. This led to the nationalized Bank Royale in 1718 and a similar bank in the settlement of New France, in what is now Mississippi. Banknotes were attractive since they could be produced cheaply and in huge amounts without using expensive metals. But, once again, people soon discovered the dangers of having too much currency. Coins were in short supply in the New World, so people relied on old-fashioned commodity trading and foreign coins. But this wasn’t ideal for the ongoing military campaigns in the area, and colonial governments were forced to issue bills, which again led to inflation. To fix this problem, and ensure that the supply of physical money didn’t exceed the economy’s needs, Pennsylvania came up with a brilliant solution in 1723. Supported by Benjamin Franklin, the state tied its supply of bills to measurable assets, like land and future taxes, meaning that more bills were only issued in relation to growth in these assets. And, sure enough, the economy stabilized and grew. But a stable system needs a stable relationship between banks, which is a concern that Abraham Lincoln had to deal with. He wasn’t happy with the power struggle that was going on between the private and the federal banks, both of which could issue money. Eventually, the Federal Reserve in the United States ended up providing reliable supervision and regulation of private banks, which has enabled a relatively stable and robust money system, even when the economy has faltered. It’s worth noting that when the economic crisis of 2007 unfolded, it was mostly the private banks that were abusing their power, not the federal ones. If you’ve taken a class in economics, one of the first names you’ll have encountered is that of the eighteenth-century philosopher, Adam Smith. In his desire to create a universal theory of finance, he gave birth to the science of economics. Smith laid a very solid economic foundation, but our understanding of the relationship between money and its value has certainly evolved since then. Smith typically determined the value of something by considering the labor required to obtain it. So, for instance, the value of gold should reflect the amount of work it takes to unearth it. But this relationship isn’t always clear-cut. For instance, what’s the value of the labor when a company uses unpaid slaves to do the work? This is why, two centuries later, economist Irving Fisher developed the quantity theory of money. This became the prevailing philosophy for the twentieth century. Fisher, arguing that an active economy is the healthiest, felt that monetary value isn’t as important to an economy as the momentum or flow of money. So an ideal economy is one where people are constantly investing and buying, not hiding their money under mattresses or in piggy banks. Another important factor that is now being reexamined is the psychology of consumerism. Most economists up until the latter half of the twentieth century assumed that our economic decisions were rational. More recently, economists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have shown that that’s not the case, and we are in fact profoundly irrational when it comes to money. They created a new field called behavioral economics to help explain why we make biased, irrational and emotionally charged decisions about how we spend and save money. For example, behavioral economics illustrated that we place a higher value on money that we can have now rather than in the future. Here’s a funny thought: one day, a government employee shows up at your door with an envelope filled with cash and says, “Enjoy.” Pretty unrealistic, right? Actually, a number of economists believe that providing people with extra spending money is a very realistic way of helping economies bounce back from recessions, like the one that followed the 2007 crisis. In December of 2008, Australia did just that, giving every taxpayer $900 to encourage spending. And unlike many other countries, Australia did not experience a recession after the crash. Another strategy is called quantitative easing (QE), which involves a central bank providing extra money and boosting reserves by buying assets from private banks. While some think this could stimulate the economy by making loans more readily available, critics think this is too close to printing money and could lead to inflation. Yet a QE plan has recently been put in place in Iceland after the nation experienced a banking collapse, and it has since proved successful. A third option for resolving an economic crisis is to change the currency altogether. Ever since the gold standard ended in 1971, the International Monetary Fund has reported around ten systemic financial crises every year. Economists think that one solution to this recurring problem would be to simplify economies by using a universal currency. And solving a problem by changing a nation’s currency does have a history: In 1922, after Russia faced a crisis with the ruble, it reintroduced gold chervonets, a move that did help stabilize the monetary system. However, if currency is in short supply, introducing negative interest rates can help stimulate spending. For instance, during the Great Depression, stamp scrips were introduced. These were notes that would lose their value unless every week, you bought a one-cent stamp and stuck it onto the scrip. This incentivized people to spend them quickly. Clearly, when times are tough and money is tight, creative monetary solutions abound. Things have been changing fast in the new millennium, and it’s not over yet. Before long, things like piggy banks and coin jars might be a thing of the past. So far, the Bitcoin is the closest we’ve come to a truly universal currency, and it’s also a threat to the traditional banking system. Bitcoin was created in 2008 as an electronic currency unconnected to any banking system. It can also be seen as a response to rising distrust of the global financial system after the 2007 banking crisis. Unlike traditional money, new Bitcoins aren’t issued by any central bank based on a government order; they’re created as a kind of reward whenever someone with a powerful computer, or a network of powerful computers, solves a difficult math equation. It’s part of a process called mining, and as more Bitcoins get put into circulation, the more difficult the equations become. At first, Bitcoins were seen as being part of a game, but once people began buying real things with them, they quickly became legitimate. One of those first purchases with the new currency was for two pizzas that were bought by a computer programmer in Florida for 10,000 Bitcoins. In 2016, that amount of Bitcoins was worth millions of dollars. This kind of innovation may actually be good for the economy since it is currently facing some big problems. Right now we’re in a largely deregulated capitalist system that aims for unlimited growth by exploiting more and more of nature’s very limited resources. Every level of the environment is being damaged; we release massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, we exploit the land in search of metals and minerals and we overfish the already polluted seas. Meanwhile, income inequality is at an all-time high. An average CEO in the United States earns 354 times more than an unskilled worker. It’s no wonder that we’re facing immense tensions due to social conflict. While it’s difficult to predict how all this will ultimately resolve itself, it’s not unreasonable to think that an economic revolution might play a role. The key message in this book: It’s trite but true: money makes the world go round. Throughout history, money has taken on a number of different forms, but some things never change – those with money wield immense power, and the strength of a civilization’s economy may spell its success or demise.

Yet today the images we see from the streets in Athens are anything but inspiring. Rioters burning cars amid chaotic protests; queues of despondent pensioners outside banks closed for weeks; neo-Nazi groups boldly marching to preserve the “purity” of Hellenistic society. How did it come to this? In 2009, the Greek government came clean and admitted that its economy was in shambles and that it was in far more debt than it could ever repay. This shock rocked not just Greek society but exposed cracks in the very foundation of the European Union. These blinks tell the tragic story of corrupt government, cruel austerity policies and a suffering population just trying to get by – often through fraud and graft. Importantly, you’ll learn how Greece’s terrible past of foreign occupation and passion for nationalism still haunts its actions today, and potentially will continue to do so in the future. In these blinks, you’ll also discover  why so many investors were convinced Greece was stable before 2009; why thousands of island residents told the government they were blind; and  how far-right parties and the church are connected through Greek nationalism. To understand the current Greek crisis and Greece’s fraught relationship with the euro, let’s first take a look at the country’s economic situation when it first entered the eurozone in 2001.  When Greece joined the eurozone, its economy was booming. Foreign investment flowed into the country; cheap credit was available and easy to obtain.   As a result, Greek citizens began consuming more, with fancy cars on the road and busy retail shops a common sight in even the smallest of Greek towns. In fact, Greece’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an impressive 4 percent each year.  Yet this boom was based on a credit bubble, meaning Greece’s strong growth wasn’t sustainable.  At the time, the Greek industrial sector was less developed than in other European countries. Instead of investing borrowed money to improve industry, train workers and develop new technologies, Greece’s government used it mostly to increase wages, pensions and benefits.  As a result, the economy failed to produce or export enough goods to cover its growing debts.  Yet crucially, the trust creditors had in Greece’s economic health was based on a lie.  As a member of the eurozone, Greece was by default considered creditworthy. Membership signalled financial stability, as countries were required to meet certain criteria before joining. A country’s annual deficit, for example, had to be less than 3 percent of GDP. Yet it was realized too late that Greece from the very beginning didn’t meet the criteria, and had actually faked its numbers to join the eurozone.  In 2009, the government through a large accounting revision revealed that Greece had a projected budget deficit of 12.5 percent of GDP, instead of a previous estimate of 3.7 percent – a discrepancy so large that it couldn’t just be blamed on the global economic crisis alone.  What’s more, the EU statistical office also found evidence of previous “widespread misreporting” on behalf of the government. The headlines screamed: Greece has deceived the European Union! The scandal shocked not just the eurozone but all of Europe; yet it was only the beginning.  As soon as Greece’s fraud was discovered, its credit bubble burst. With its newly revised budget deficit, the country faced a series of downgrades from credit rating agencies. As the situation worsened, more downgrades were to follow.  Investors, previously happy to put their cash in Greece, were alarmed. Creditors began pulling out of the country, and borrowing costs overall started to skyrocket.  This chain of events was disastrous for both the Greek economy and the state. Many enterprises depended heavily on credit to operate. Companies failed, and like dominos, other bankruptcies and closures followed. Unemployment rose to 29 percent. Thousands of newly unemployed citizens were suddenly unable to pay the debts they had accumulated.  The country’s banks eventually succumbed to the credit crunch, and no longer able to meet obligations, closed as well. At this point, the Greek debt crisis was in full swing – causing problems not only for Greece but for the entire eurozone.  It may seem odd that a small country like Greece could cause such enormous problems. Yet it is important to realize that much of Greece’s foreign debt was held in German and French banks, two countries with large and stable economies.  Yet in 2009, Greece wasn’t the only country in financial trouble. Other eurozone nations, such as Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal, were suffering with high unemployment and their own credit crunches.  Much of the financial support for these countries was coming from more “stable” countries like Germany and France. Thus if their economies began to weaken as well, Europe as a whole would be in serious trouble. Eurozone leaders realized this, and knew they had to limit the Greek crisis.  But how? Read on to discover how international bodies and creditor groups stepped in to stem the effects of the crisis. As events in the eurozone came to a head in 2009, international groups realized that Greece wasn’t going to fix its problems on its own, and decided to step in. The so-called troika of the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission came together to assemble a package of debt relief and loans in exchange for political and social reforms.  One thing was clear: Greece was going to default if it didn’t get the cash to meet its debt obligations. The troika’s first package, as well as subsequent aid deemed almost immediately necessary, represented the biggest debt restructuring in history.  Altogether, Greece’s debt burden at the expense of private bond holders was reduced by €107 billion. The country received some €245 billion in loan pledges as well. In exchange, the Greek government promised to enact a series of austerity measures to strengthen the economy, in addition to pledging to fight tax evasion and cut jobs in the country’s bloated public service sector.   Many Greeks didn’t see the upside to this heavy-handed “help,” however. Some said that the troika’s wide-ranging influence, from banking to domestic issues, felt like a foreign occupation.  Daily protests quickly turned into riots as Greeks fought against the harsh terms of the bailout. Many Greeks felt that the situation was essentially unfair: why should they bear the brunt of austerity measures, losing jobs and incomes, for mistakes the government made? Since the beginning of the crisis, Greeks have held more than 20,000 protests and rallies against the troika-led reforms.  And austerity measures have only weakened the Greek economy further. As public sector wages were cut, spending power was diminished even more – and this in the middle of a recession! Yet while regular people on the street suffered, Greece’s political ranks were due for a revolution. The debt crisis didn’t just create problems between the international troika and the Greek government, it also sparked power struggles among Greece’s political parties.  Greece’s social democratic party, PASOK, held power when the crisis began.  PASOK Prime Minister George Papandreou was in a very tough position by 2011. The European Union demanded he accept a second bailout program, after the first failed. EU ministers were furious when Papandreou decided to leave the decision to a public referendum. There was no question that Greeks were unwilling to have another austerity program forced down their throats. What’s more, they mistrusted Papandreou for agreeing to the terms of the first bailout, and for even considering a second.  Seeing no way out, Papandreou cancelled the referendum and then resigned. In late 2011, Lucas Papademos was sworn in as prime minister, and immediately pushed for the second bailout, causing massive uprisings in Athens.   Extremist political parties gained strength as social turmoil continued. In a parliamentary election in May 2012, center-right party New Democracy finished first over a coalition of far-left groups called Syriza. The Greek far-right party Golden Dawn also won seats in parliament.  None of the parties were able to form a government, however, so another election followed just weeks later in June. New Democracy again was victorious and its leader, Antonis Samaras, formed a new government with PASOK. Both parties favored honoring the second bailout agreement.   Yet Greece continued to struggle financially, and austerity measures weighed heavily on the populace. In 2015, Greek voters finally brought the far left into power, as Syriza with its anti-austerity platform under leader Alexis Tsipras won early parliamentary elections.  Syriza’s stance against the troika and against austerity clearly enraged European creditors, however, pointing to a showdown ahead.  The island of Zakynthos is the site of one of the most audacious health scams in Greek history. Hundreds of people there claimed, in cahoots with local doctors, that they were blind in order to receive monthly disability checks from the government.  According to official records, some 1.8 percent of people on the island were reported to be blind – a rate of “blindness” some nine times higher than in other European countries – and these people collected over €9 million in state benefits.  Zakynthos wasn’t the only place where Greeks were cheating the system, however. Plenty of doctors or officials across the country would lend a hand to “patients” or other individuals and claim they were ill in exchange for a bribe, or in Greek, a fakelaki. During the crisis, many Greeks were unable to maintain their standard of living or provide for their families when wages or pensions were cut, so they faked a disability to claim benefits.  One of the major problems of the state social security system was that information was not digitized or centralized, and different state offices rarely collaborated. This systemic failure meant that a very large number of pensions were paid to people over 100 years old, who actually died years ago!   Fraud was a key issue to be addressed as part of the bailout packages. The troika especially wanted to curb disability and pension fraud. Billions of euros were being poured into the health care system every year, and nothing was being done to see if the money was being used properly. Under pressure, the government started compulsory checks and discovered that some 36,000 people were receiving benefits through fraudulent claims. The “island of the blind” and armies of healthy invalids were the least of the government’s worries, however. Tax evasion countrywide was a problem even more pressing.  As Greece’s economy continued to crumble, it was ordinary people who were bearing the burden. Part of the problem had to do with tax evasion, in particular by Greece’s wealthiest citizens.  Greeks across the country have historically and systematically avoided paying taxes. Even before the crisis, it was clear that wealthy Greeks in particular should carry a larger tax burden, but many didn’t even declare their income to the government – and they also didn’t face any consequences for doing so.   Lawyers and doctors lived in grand mansions with swimming pools, but according to the official books, they claimed to earn less than €12,000 per year. Corrupt tax auditors often cut deals with wealthy clients to find ways to reduce their overall tax burden, for example. The Greek government claims that it’s addressing tax evasion, but instead of going after the most egregious fraudsters, it continues to push the burden to middle- or lower-income citizens.  Even when information on hundreds of tax evaders came to light, the government did nothing. Finance Minister Giorgos Papaconstantinou claimed first that the new information had been misplaced, and when it was finally recovered, it was alleged that he had deleted data that indicted his own family members.  Instead of going after the rich, the government instead has raised taxes that have hit the middle class particularly hard, to both pacify the troika and not upset influential and affluent citizens.  For example, the government raised the consumption tax to 23 percent – a burden for small businesses like family cafes but which does little to reduce the national debt.  Meanwhile, the Greek government still claims that it is fighting corruption and tax evaders, but to date few people have actually been called to court. Public sector jobs can be appealing, as they’re often well-respected, stable positions and come with a secure pension plan. Many people seek such jobs, but there aren’t enough to go around.   That is, unless you live in Greece. As of 2009, one in five Greek citizens worked in the public sector.  Greek law protects public servants’ positions, ensuring that an individual wouldn’t lose her job if a new government wanted to replace a prior administration’s people with their own.  Each successive government then would essentially create a whole new layer of bureaucracy, without thinning or eliminating positions at the same time. And getting fired was almost impossible. So Greek public servants were untouchable, regardless of their quality of work or behavior at work! The public sector as a result swelled to absurd proportions.  As part of austerity measures, the government tried to cut public sector costs, yet with mixed results. It eliminated some jobs and reduced salaries by up to 35 percent.  Yet many public servants avoided being laid off by deciding to retire early, in order to retain their pensions. So while there were fewer public servants, there were also a lot more retirees with high pensions still on the books.  And to complicate things further, when Syriza came into power in 2015, the party vowed to reinstate many of the public sector workers who previously had been laid off. News on the Greek crisis is full of tales of misery and desperation. Greek children are reported to be fainting from hunger during lessons; elderly pensioners line up for days at banks trying to collect their pittance of a pension.  While politicians argue, daily life for the average Greek citizen has become a struggle.  As companies succumbed to the credit crunch and closed their doors, Greeks en masse lost their jobs and the country’s unemployment rate skyrocketed to a high of 28 percent.  Of course, behind each worker was often a whole family that depended on the income to survive. Poverty is now widespread; homelessness equally so.  Even highly qualified young people with college degrees are struggling, fighting for even the most basic jobs at fast food outlets, just to make some cash. Many have given up completely, emigrating elsewhere in the European Union or further abroad in search of a better life.  Pensioners especially have been hard hit. As pensions were either reduced or frozen altogether, many elderly Greeks have resorted to searching through dumpsters for food.  Austerity programs, instead of putting the country back on track, have made things even worse.  Each bailout package or “rescue program” released by the troika, while billed as a way to help Greece’s economy recover, has imposed harsh rules, pushing Greek society further into penury.  The Greek government cut wages, pensions and benefits, while at the same time raised taxes that hit the weakest parts of society the hardest. In 2013, after several rounds of austerity measures, some 36 percent of the population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Just a few years ago, most Greeks enjoyed a decent standard of living. Today, more than a third live in poverty. And what’s more, some 100,000 refugees arrive in Greece each year, seeking a better life – in a land that can barely care for its own. Imagine that you have to flee your war-torn country. You walk for weeks; food is scarce; your safety is in question. You finally make it across the Mediterranean and land on a Greek beach.  Are you finally safe? Sadly, the Greeks might not give you a warm welcome. The country is overwhelmed with refugees, and the European Union isn’t doing enough to help.  Many African refugees seek Greece’s shores when escaping their own troubled nations, as Greece is easier to reach than most other EU countries. Furthermore, EU law stipulates that migrants have to apply for asylum in the first EU country they arrive in.  Yet still reeling from its own economic woes, Greece is ill-equipped to care for all these asylum seekers. Greece’s asylum procedures, for that matter, can take years. Small reception centers are more and more crowded. This is bad news for Greece, but worse for refugees.  When migrants arrive in Greece, they usually go to the police to start the process of applying for asylum. After this, they’re often held in cells or old warehouses already full of hundreds of people, often with no toilets or access to water or food.   Many refugees are neither physically nor psychologically sound, weakened by their journey and even possibly sick – some critically ill. Human rights organizations have even reported cases of torture and negligence in detention centers.  To escape such conditions, many refugees try to return to Turkey and then move on to other countries. While Greece is seen as very welcoming to well-heeled tourists, its immigration policy and ingrained racism is a source of trouble for its future.  In any country, extremist parties often gain popularity in times of crisis. In Greece, the far-right party Golden Dawn is experiencing its own renaissance.  With its anti-immigration stance and nationalist ideology, Golden Dawn offers Greeks a false sense of Hellenistic pride to counterbalance the humiliation of austerity and poverty. Golden Dawn first gained attention when its members aided angry Greek citizens fight against immigrants. In the Athens neighborhood of Agios Panteleimonas, local residents alleged that immigrants were involved in criminal activity and living rough in the local playground. As crime rates were actually dropping, there was little evidence to support the locals’ claims. Yet members of Golden Dawn saw an opportunity to gain power by taking advantage of local racism and xenophobia. The party officially denied being affiliated with the residents’ protests, but nonetheless strongly supported their fight. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch has reported hundreds of attacks on immigrants in Greece. Golden Dawn supporters have become more violent, allegedly attacking a pregnant woman and ganging up in groups of more than 15 people to attack a single Afghani man.    Yet many police officers and high-ranking government officials support Golden Dawn, so many of these attacks go unreported. Golden Dawn remains the third-strongest political party in the country, and despite increased pressure by other parties to curb its activities, the party still retains voters’ support. In the 2012 elections, Golden Dawn received 7 percent of the national vote.  Yet a potential turning point came when a Golden Dawn member stabbed and killed a Greek rapper known for his anti-fascist beliefs. The government arrested party leaders and widespread rallies condemned the party’s actions.  Yet in the next election, Golden Dawn still won enough votes to remain in parliament.  While resistance to Golden Dawn and its positions may be growing, these self-proclaimed “saviors of Greece” are still popular and are working to gain more power. Throughout its history, Greece has come in contact with many cultural influences and has lived often under foreign rule.  The Ottoman Empire ruled over Greek lands for centuries, and many Greeks have lived in Turkey. There are also many Turkish communities in Greece, some that date even before the country’s fight for independence in 1821.  Different political groups however have interpreted Greek history to suit their own ends. Nationalists, often linked to the church, say that outside influences have been a menace to Greek culture, and seek to rid the country of such influences.  After Greece gained its independence, the government and church attempted to “Hellenize” the country. Children were taught that Orthodox Christians were oppressed by the Turks for centuries, that Greeks weren’t even allowed to speak their own language and had to attend church schools secretly – stories that had no base in fact at all.  This nationalist approach still continues today, and many church officials endorse it. For such authorities, every non-Christian Orthodox influence is a threat to Greek culture.  The Greek Orthodox Church opposes Turkish immigration to Greece. It also doesn’t consider Jewish Greeks to be part of true Greek culture; the church is even hostile toward foreign Jewish investors.   Progressive politicians, on the other hand, embrace multiculturalism. They welcome Jewish and Turkish tourists and investors. They also stress that “Greek culture” as it is known today is the product of many varied influences.  Thessaloniki mayor Yiannis Boutaris planned to named a street after Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, as he was born in the town. The church however opposed this and fought Boutaris, accusing him of being a traitorous “Turk lover.” For many Greeks, however, another foreign enemy has returned: Germany. In May 1941, two young Greeks in Athens climbed the Acropolis at night to tear down a swastika flag put there by the German occupying army.  One of these men was Manolis Glezos, a hero of the Greek resistance during World War II. Today, Glezos is a leading member of the left-wing Syriza party. He compares Germany’s austerity politics during the crisis to the policies of the Nazi occupation.  The Nazis did commit terrible crimes against the Greek people during the war. The army invaded in 1941 and proceeded to kill Greek Jews, plunder historical artifacts and take control of Greek companies. The army’s actions also led to the Great Famine in which over 300,000 Greeks died.  Greeks today still resent Germany’s actions during the war and have for decades sought war reparations. And today, many people see German austerity politics as a new type of occupation.  They hold that the financial crisis is a form of economic war against their nation. Because of the stipulations of multiple bailouts, many Greeks can’t afford to pay for basics like food or rent.  In Athens, newspapers have even likened Germany’s Angela Merkel to Hitler. The conflict between Greece and Germany is further stoked by envy. While it’s hard for Greeks to get loans or just get by, Germans live well and have a growing economy.  The way the two governments communicate with each other makes the situation even worse. Merkel and other German politicians have often talked about the Greek crisis in a judgmental and patronizing fashion, saying Greece should “do its homework” and so on.  Naturally, this makes Greeks resentful. In return, however, Syriza politicians have spread blatant lies about German politicians. The key message in this book: The Greek debt crisis is the result of a number of international and domestic mistakes and missteps. The country’s disorganized social system has for years allowed many of its citizens to claim false benefits, while the wealthy historically have evaded taxes with impunity. Stipulations tied to bailouts meanwhile have hit ordinary citizens the hardest. Many Greeks have been resentful toward foreign creditors and in particular Germany, seeing its policies as a modern extension of its wartime occupation.

Yet capitalism hasn’t worked for most people since the decades following the Second World War.  While technological advances should be enabling the dissemination of wealth to a wide number of people, the wealth generated by capitalism remains in the hands of an elite few. The resulting anxieties have left our political systems in a state of crisis, polarized between left and right ideologies, while populist politicians such as Donald Trump gain ground. Without some urgent changes, capitalism is heading down the road to calamity. In these blinks, you’ll find an analysis of modern capitalism and discover pragmatic policy changes that could mend the rifts in our politically, socially and economically fragmented world. By working together to cultivate a new hard center, we can create a better version of capitalism— one in which everyone feels valued and is able to lead a purposeful, happy life. In these blinks, you’ll learn why ideologies like Marxism or Libertarianism are futile responses to today’s problems; how corporate greed isn’t an inherent feature of capitalism; and  how a moral capitalism could help everyone prosper. In the decades following the Second World War, capitalism created a time of extraordinary economic growth that was enjoyed across class boundaries. Following the Allied war efforts, people felt a new sense of solidarity and a shared national identity that resulted in a commitment to helping each other and a general acceptance of social democracy and its communitarian ethics.  In the United States, New Deal legislation that provided benefits for everyone from the young to the elderly was embraced and the rich paid over 80 percent income taxes with little complaint. Meanwhile, in Britain, the liberal National Health Service – free for all at the point of use – was devised and implemented by a collaboration between Labour and Conservative powers.  Yet despite the minimal conflict between political parties, the pillars upholding social democracy began to fracture. Due to the new economic stability, a growing number of people pursued increasingly higher ranks of education, and over time, a new class of highly educated people found jobs that required specialized skills and offered wages to match. In the 1970s, these intellectuals achieved their sense of pride in their work rather than their national identity, while a growing number also began supporting left- and right-wing ideologies that emphasized individualism.  One such ideology that seized political consciousness was Utilitarianism, which argued that it was the responsibility of the state to redistribute advantages to the least fortunate. The adoption of Utilitarianism transformed the communitarianism of the postwar era into social paternalism, in which the state claims moral authority over its citizens.  Meanwhile, due to widening wage differences, unskilled workers were granted less dignity for their labor than the professional classes. Over the decades to come, these people continued to embrace their national identity while increasingly feeling the anxiety of marginalization. As a result of these political and economic transformations, social democracy today is in a state of crisis. In the past decade, Donald Trump’s populist message has won over the hearts of the marginalized masses, the social democratic parties in countries including Germany, Spain and Italy have all seen a collapse in votes, and in the United Kingdom, the Labour party has become arguably Marxist.  From all sides of the conflict, it’s clear that capitalism today is only benefiting the few at the top. Rather than perpetuating hateful nationalist sentiments, we need to cultivate a sense of patriotism, or a willingness to support one’s country felt by all citizens. In short, to create a system that works, we’re going to need to find our way back toward communitarianism. According to Marxists, capitalism blocks mass prosperity. Yet the record shows that communism hasn’t actually lifted workforces out of poverty. North Korea’s Kim dynasty, for example, shows that communist regimes can be more corrupt than capitalist societies. There’s no question for the author that we need decentralized, market-based competition for society to prosper. But we also need a capitalist system that isn’t guided by greed.  Rather than the top-down paternalism of recent decades, we need what the author calls social maternalism, or a state which puts forth pragmatic policy choices rather than ideologies and fosters a true patriotic community. Such a state would ensure that citizens of all economic situations can obtain social respect.  In essence, social maternalism takes moral responsibility out of the hands of the few and gives it to the many, encouraging a communitarian society. Instead of telling citizens what is best for them, it enables other actors such as families to promote moral values, creating a seamless chain of moral support for citizens from childhood to productive young adulthood.  If you’re wondering how such a system could ever materialize, let’s take a look at what changes need to be made.  Part of the problem with various ideologies such as Marxism or Libertarianism is that they can often privilege reason over values.  What’s more, the values that ideologies do have tend to be irreconcilable. For example, you’d be hard-pressed to find any common values between the left-wing politics of Bernie Sanders and the populist ideas put forth by President Donald Trump. If we want to create a moral capitalism that works for everyone, we need to eschew our support for ideologies. Instead, we need to create policies based on pragmatism. Just consider Lee Kwan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister. When Yew came to power, poverty and corruption abounded in the south-east Asian city-state. But by pragmatically taking on corruption and refusing to engage in nepotism, Yew was able to turn Singapore into one of the world’s most prosperous societies. By focusing on their specific context rather than applying far-fetched ideologies that seldom meet the needs of specific problems, leaders today will also be able to find solutions upon which everyone can agree. But what sort of practical policies will ensure that communitarian values return to capitalism? Head on to the next blink to find out. In the 1970s, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman famously disseminated the idea that a company’s only purpose is to maximize profits, suggesting that successful companies forgo any responsibility to their employees or customers. Since then, this idea has only grown stronger, and today most employees have neither representation on company boards nor any direct benefit from a company’s success, regardless of their contributions. But this wasn’t always the case. In the United Kingdom up until the 1980s, many businesses called mutual companies were collectively owned by employees or customers rather than shareholders. Then, in 1986, regulation changes combined with cultural changes made it less ethically frowned upon to tear ownership away from the employees, in what was known as demutualization.  While many British companies demutualized, some took the ethical high ground. Take the John Lewis Partnership, one of Britain’s most successful and respected companies. John Lewis is owned by a trust organized in the interests of its employees through various local, regional and national councils. What’s more, not only do workers receive a share of profits as an annual bonus, but they also each receive the same cut as the CEO! As the success of John Lewis demonstrates, communitarian companies can still thrive in a capitalist society. Today, with privately owned companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Google increasingly monopolizing the market as well as playing a central role in society, it's clear that we need public policy that encourages more firms to behave like John Lewis.  One way to do this is, of course, taxation. Currently, global companies such as Amazon have made exponential profits by finding loopholes in the tax system. Holding companies accountable for contributing to society is a clear step in creating an ethical capitalism. But another way that public policy could create ethical firms could be by mandating that companies incorporate public interests into their boards. In the United States, this already exists in Public Interest Companies with boards that consider both public and commercial interests. Though representing just a fraction of the American economy, this system might serve as a good testing ground for policies that could be mandated on a larger scale. Inevitably, companies will lobby against taxation and find loopholes in public policy. This is where the general public’s participation will be crucial. We can only expect ethical capitalism to be adopted by firms if it is first embraced by individuals who hold firms accountable for ethical behavior. Growing up in a working class family in Sheffield, the author became aware of the detrimental impact of broken families from an early age. While the author was accepted into a grammar school and ultimately earned a scholarship to attend Oxford University, his cousin – born on the same day – lived a different story: her father’s early death upended her education prospects and she gave birth to her first child as a teenager. More than just an anecdote, the story of the author’s cousin holds wider truths for why capitalism is broken today. In recent years, lower income families of the less educated class have been increasingly falling apart, disrupting children’s lives so that it becomes difficult to find a meaningful place in the workforce or society at large. In the case of America, two-thirds of children from families in the lower 50 percentile of total education have been raised by a single parent or no parent at all. More concerningly, Western paternalist states have increasingly assumed the responsibility over child rearing in the form of foster care and children’s homes. That’s because although legislation has made it easier than ever to remove children from families, it’s made it notoriously difficult for parents to adopt children into new ones. As a result, 70,000 children are in foster care in Britain today.  To help people feel like a vital, productive part of an ethical capitalism, social maternalism might strive to keep families together rather than tearing children away from them. This could be done by offering parents living in the same house tax-credit bonuses as an incentive for young parents to stay together, which statistically has been shown to lead to happier and more productive members of society.  In addition to helping families stay together, social maternalism would also aim to find successful ways to provide relief for the inevitable stresses faced by young parents. One successful experiment in the United Kingdom along these lines was the Dundee Project. The Dundee Project offered practical support in the form of mentoring and relief to young families, but unlike most relief programs, the project was detached from threatening social services that assessed parents’ responsibility. This enabled trust to be built between the parents and social workers in a way that helped young parents find their feet. By focusing on fixing broken families, social maternalism could create a hospitable society in which children could grow up. And in turn, the families helped by a system of social maternalism would be likely more willing to perpetuate it through their own election choices. We’ve now considered what states, firms and families would look like in a society of ethical capitalism. But what about an ethical world? Today, over 65 million people around the world have abandoned their homes on account of famine or violence. In an ethical world, affluent nations with comparative advantages such as the United States would extend their solidarity to nations that border crisis states. This might be done not only by channeling money into these countries to supplement the costs of assisting refugees in rebuilding their lives, but also by international firms bringing jobs to those locations. Though individual nations can set an example for what ethical actions might look like, one country alone cannot create a truly ethical world. To bridge the global divide, we’ll need international groups to set standards and hold each other accountable.  This was something that was recognized in the years following World War Two – a time when world leaders saw the need for mutual cooperation. Among the various global organizations founded in the postwar years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was created in 1949 to ensure the security of its 12 members. Unfortunately, today these groups have become too large and diffuse to be effective. In the case of NATO, at the time of writing only five of its current 29 members meet their pledge on defense spending. At the same time, organizations such as the IMF and the EU have become quasi-imperial bodies in which a handful of powerful countries dictate the economic agendas of less powerful member nations. To rebuild the vision for an ethical world, we might be better off creating new bodies that address critical global issues.  The G7 is a good example, but the fact that China and India are not included is a severe limitation. A small body that accounts for world powers today might include the United States, the EU, India, Russia, Japan and China.  Though these countries have little in common, their conflicts of interest will prevent any regulations they create from benefiting them unfairly at the expense of the rest of the world. What’s more, in the coming years, they will increasingly share goals as climate change brings on more crises such as the depletion of water supplies. We should create “clubs” like these with a shared ethical foundation now as they will be the only way to face the problems of tomorrow. Sheffield, Lille and Detroit were once reputable cities known for their industrial production, but by the 1980s, each began to crumble as they were outcompeted by markets in faraway lands fueled by cheap labor. The same forces of globalization that transformed cities such as London or New York into centers of capital and culture have made provincial cities obsolete in today’s economic system.  But is there any way we can fix the broken provincial cities and bridge the geographical divide? One option might be to tax the gains accrued by skilled workers in metropolitan cities.  In the capitalist system, just being in a certain place means that you accumulate more wealth. This is known as the gains of agglomeration. For example, a high-earning lawyer in London has greater access to wealthy clients and would therefore accumulate more wealth. As such, it would be both ethical and efficient to tax this lawyer higher than a lawyer in Sheffield who lacks the same geographical advantages.  Though taxing highly skilled workers in urban centers will level the geographical playing field, wealth distribution is not the only aspect of the class divide. If we really want to forge a kind of capitalism that enables everyone to prosper, we’re going to have to look at the underlying root of class satisfaction. That means getting creative in bringing working class people a sense of purpose. One way to do this is through providing more vocational training. And unlike taxing the benefits of agglomeration, there is a precedent for how this can be done.  There are specialist vocational training schools across Germany. Students hone their craftsmanship in their chosen field while receiving mentorship from professionals. They also take required placements within the workforce during their studies, making the transition from student life to professional life much smoother. The result is a society with a highly productive workforce that is both dignified and well paid. Of course, even if we were to create more vocational schools today, social maternalism won’t happen overnight. But it would be one important step in implementing pragmatic policy that cultivates a capitalism in which everyone is cared for. The key message in these blinks:  In a world where capitalism increasingly favors the few at the cost of the many, we need to leave behind the limitations of ideologies and create policy rooted in pragmatism. Social maternalism promises to create an ethical capitalism that benefits everyone through the means of modest but ethically grounded state activity. Such activity would include the taxation of globalized firms and the beneficiaries of agglomeration in metropolitan cities, combined with measures that cultivate a sense of purpose in the national workforce, as well as increased efforts to reach ethical international agreements.

West","summary":"Drones dropping off Amazon packages at your front door. Digital menus at restaurants. Algorithms buying and selling stocks and approving loans. Driverless cars and trucks taking you and your goods to their destinations. These are no longer ideas for the future, they’re just some of the ways automation is impacting the workforce today, and more developments are expected tomorrow. In many ways, technological advances like these are inevitable and make perfect business sense. You can’t expect a company to decide not to save millions of dollars by carrying on employing people to do something that a robot can do four times as fast, non-stop with fewer mistakes. When McDonald’s announced their plan to replace cashiers with automated menus, their stock went up immediately. It’s good business. So what does all this change add up to? It’s what people are calling the new digital economy, and while it may be inevitable, there are many things that need to happen if we hope to prevent chaos and disarray. As author Darrell M. West explains, we need to rethink our approach to work, job training and how we receive benefits like health insurance and pensions. If we act now, we may be able to make the transition smooth; if not, there may be trouble. In these blinks, you’ll learn which 1888 book was quite prescient in its depiction of a future workforce; which CEO considers artificial intelligence one of the greatest threats facing civilization; and how something called a citizen account may be key to the future workforce. Back at the turn of the twentieth century, the United States underwent what the author refers to as a “megachange” as a result of the nation’s shift from an agrarian economy to an industrial one. It took decades for the government to deal with the effects of this change and for things to settle down. Now, we are at the brink of another megachange, and this time, the nation will be shifting from an industrial economy to a digital one. At the heart of this change is a new business model built around automated robots and artificial intelligence (AI). And we’re already starting to see it emerge, especially around blue-collar jobs. Some of the most reliable jobs for people who didn’t or weren’t able to go to college have been in restaurants, retail or in transportation – and these are now being affected by automation. Restaurants across the United States are replacing waitstaff with tablets that make recommendations and explain the menu. An increasing number of retail stores are replacing cashiers with self-checkout options that are getting more advanced. Amazon has a chain of retail stores where customers will soon be able to use an app to have purchases charged to their Amazon account. Meanwhile, at an average income of $43,590 a year, driving a truck has long been one of the more lucrative jobs for someone with a high school education. But now, automated vehicles are expected to become an industry standard. In all of these cases, automated services offer a way for businesses to save money. Not long ago, robots and automated services cost more than it would cost to pay an employee for the same job. But this is no longer the case. At Dynamic, a manufacturer of metal parts, a robot can perform the same job of four people for the one-time cost of $35,000. Plus, it doesn’t catch colds, need breaks or health insurance. Another noteworthy factor is the reduction in human error. At the cell phone manufacturing company, Precision Tech, 60 robots now do what 650 employees used to, and mistakes have dropped from 25 to 5 percent, while production has more than doubled. As for automated vehicles, experts expect fewer accidents and better fuel efficiency due to smoother acceleration and braking than with human drivers. Steven Mnuchin, the Trump administration’s treasury secretary, told the press that he isn’t concerned about AI as he believes it won’t be a factor until 50 or 100 years from now. Others aren’t so quick to brush off the immediate concerns surrounding AI. According to Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, AI poses one of the greatest risks to civilization and can certainly be a cause of great disruption to the job market. What really makes AI competitive is machine learning. This is the ability to make a decision based on a certain set of factors, and then use the results of that decision to inform future choices. This process results in continuous improvement, and it’s what allows AI to now be a viable replacement for all sorts of jobs that were once strictly human occupations, like driving vehicles or making financial investments. Indeed, while AI is likely found on your mobile device or at home, whether it’s Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa or Microsoft’s Tay, it’s also currently making decisions about a lot of important everyday things, including finances, defense systems and public safety. Already, AI is replacing many jobs in the financial sector because it can spot tiny fluctuations in the stock market that could signal a good time to buy or sell stocks. It can also quickly make thorough background checks to determine if someone qualifies for a bank loan. As a result, experts predict that bank branches could soon let go of as many as half their staff. The US military is using AI as part of Project Maven, a national defense scheme. The military uses AI to scan through massive amounts of surveillance footage and flag anything that looks suspicious or unusual. Some hospitals are using AI in a similar way by having it scan medical images to detect things like potentially cancerous lymph nodes. Again, this automated service saves money, since radiologists can charge upward of $700 to look at four images in one hour, while AI is seen as more efficient and also more accurate. But some ethical issues have already arisen. In Chicago, AI is being used by law enforcement to determine which areas are most likely to have criminal activity. Already, there are complaints that this has led to innocent people in those areas being harassed by the police. This highlights another important aspect of AI: its predictions can never be totally objective, as they are heavily influenced by the amount and quality of the data used, as well as the value judgements of the designers when they define “fair criteria” for the system. A major component in the digital economy will be the Internet of Things (IoT). Made possible by the high connection speeds of the fifth generation (5G) internet network, the IoT is when entire systems of physical goods and household objects become connected and can be monitored and adjusted in real time. For example, your smartwatch could be used to track vital health statistics that are monitored by a physician who could periodically advise you to cut down on your sugar intake or drink more water. Indeed, healthcare is an industry that is expected to be hugely impacted by the IoT and its use of sensors and monitors. Your health data is expected to be available soon to any medical professional through cloud storage, and with an increasing number of portable monitoring devices, patients in rural or hard-to-access areas will benefit greatly from these services. Already, in Taipei, Taiwan, the Citizen Telecare Service System monitors the elderly in their homes using the city’s free wi-fi. The program has already shown great results in quickly recognizing the warning signs of cardiovascular disease by monitoring heart rates for arrhythmia. Infrastructure has also seen improvements from the IoT. In some US towns, as much as 30 percent of water usage is wasted through leaky pipes, and 5G sensors allow these leaks to be spotted immediately. Water usage sensors are particularly valuable in dry areas like California, which is already putting them to use in homes, leading to a reduction in water usage of 15 to 20 percent. Some areas have taken up “smart city” initiatives where real-time monitoring of everything from garbage collection, transportation, traffic lights, energy management and public safety is underway. And some 75 towns in the United States are using a sensor called Shot Spotter, which recognizes the sound of a gun being fired and immediately sends the coordinates to the police for a speedy response. And who wouldn’t want to sit in less traffic? With smart traffic lights, cities and towns will no longer have to deal with inefficient lights that only operate on one pattern, regardless of how many cars are on the road. And the benefits go beyond reducing traffic. By adjusting traffic lights in real time, there will be less pollution from fewer cars idling, and people will get to their destinations faster. According to MIT economist, Andrew McAfee, we should expect most of the jobs currently available to be replaced by automated services at some point in the future. The jobs that are more likely to continue existing are interpersonal ones like mental health therapy and social work. This brings us to one of the primary changes we need to make in order to prepare for the new economy, which is to rethink and broaden our definition of which jobs are worthy of receiving a wage and benefits like insurance and a pension. Currently, people perform many jobs that benefit society yet aren’t paid, including various volunteer posts, mentoring, parenting and other community activities. But it’s time we started considering the monetary value of such jobs. In Edward Bellamy’s novel Looking Backward (1888), the protagonist falls asleep in 1887 and awakens in the year 2000 to find that people are no longer defined by their jobs. With technology keeping the world running, people spend their days learning new skills, teaching others and following their own personal interests. What once was science fiction is looking very much like the near future. The United Kingdom has already taken a step in this direction, as the government considers volunteer work to at least qualify as “looking for work,” so it therefore helps a person qualify for social insurance if they are unemployed. To take it a step further, why not make the activities we now consider volunteer work worthy of a salary? Art is also something that benefits society and could therefore be considered a worthwhile pursuit. Harvard economist Lawrence Katz believes that the new economy could very well have a category for those who find meaning in life through self-expression. This meaning is at the heart of many concerns about unemployment. For so long, many of us have centered our purpose, identity and meaning in life around our nine-to-five job, and therefore unemployment can come with great existential worry. However, it wasn’t always like this. In fact, throughout much of human history, our identity was based on family, community, religion and tribal matters – and it may very well be that this is what we’ll return to in the new economy. Back in 1954, union boss Walter Reuther was visiting a Ford Motors plant that had recently installed new robotic machines on the factory line. A Ford employee asked Reuther how he planned on getting union dues from the robots, to which Reuther replied, “How are you going to get them to buy Fords?” This anecdote cuts right to the problem of a changing workforce: When workers are displaced by companies eager to cut costs and raise productivity, it doesn’t just mean there are fewer people working, it also means they’re making less money and are therefore less likely to buy the products sold by the company. The effect of displaced workers is far reaching and extends beyond a drop in consumer spending. One of the big concerns is health insurance. Currently, most Americans, over 155 million of them, get their insurance through their job. But already there is a growing tally of people who earn their income through freelance or contract work that comes with no benefits. In fact, many new businesses cut costs this way, by hiring a small number of full-time employees and contracting out the rest of the work. So, to avoid a bigger healthcare crisis than already exists in the United States, some economists are suggesting portable or flexible citizen accounts. These would be accounts with a number of safety net items to which all workers would be entitled, regardless of whether they were unemployed or working full- or part-time. These items would include health and life insurance, retirement funds and unemployment compensation, as well as credit that could be put toward continued education and learning new skills. This brings us to another step we need to take in preparing for the new economy: job training. The idea that a person’s education stops at around 25 is no longer relevant. Technology and jobs are quickly and constantly changing, and society needs to recognize education as a lifelong endeavor. Fortunately, there have already been impressive strides in remote learning, which uses online courses that allow people to learn on their own schedule, which could be a great asset for job training. These are just some of the considerations that need to be made now, before the next economic crisis hits. We should also be talking about the possible benefits of providing people with a basic minimum income, more flexible requirements around professional licensing and new ways to tax the wealthiest citizens in order to fund the programs we’ll need to transition into the new economy. As we can see, society needs to prepare for the job displacement many economists anticipate. Yet there is very little discussion happening on Capitol Hill. A big reason why few politicians are paying attention to the growing threat of automation is the extremely polarized nature of today’s politics. Getting a fiercely partisan Congress to agree on anything, never mind broad changes to fundamental programs like unemployment insurance or creating new employment options, is virtually impossible. It’s worth noting that Barack Obama did address these very concerns before leaving office. He made a speech telling Americans how changes in the workforce were making it necessary to rethink traditional ideas about a 40-hour workweek and minimum wage. In his view, the United States needed to act immediately to give itself a “runway” that would hopefully “make the transition less abrupt.” This is precisely what the author is stressing, but he sees little movement from the Trump administration or the House and Senate to suggest that this runway is being worked on. Trump’s actions suggest that he blames any unrest in the workforce on bad trade agreements and lost manufacturing jobs, but the threat of displaced workers goes far beyond these factors. He should recognize that technological advancements are changing business models and threatening jobs in nearly every sector. If Trump’s current attitudes go unchanged, the populist, anti-Wall Street, anti-globalization sentiment he has stirred up will likely worsen, and this does not bode well for easing the transition into a new economy. Inaction will only increase the tensions and insecurity being felt by the US workforce. In the past, Trump has recognized that workers feel like their jobs and even their identities are at risk, but unless he does something meaningful about it and seeks to address the new digital economy, the plight of American workers will only get worse. Researchers already see a direct correlation between unemployment and the number of suicides, drug overdoses and alcohol-related deaths in the country. A study by Princeton University concluded that these issues are especially prevalent among people with only a high school education or less – which is a group that is particularly vulnerable to job losses caused by automation. The societal impact of automation is already being felt. As it currently stands, many new businesses are worsening the wealth inequality in the United States. Thanks to automation, they have relatively few full-time employees, meaning that only a small group is reaping the earnings. To prevent an unemployment crisis and dangerous levels of social unrest, the United States needs to enact social and political reforms. Regarding social reform, citizen accounts could separate health insurance and retirement pensions from being tied to one job, and social programs like permanent job training need to be put in place. One problem with getting such them enacted is that while Democrats tend to support government spending on social programs that benefit low-income families and the unemployed, Republicans tend to advocate for a smaller government and less spending on such programs. But the real problem here likely stems from a disproportionate influence of the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent. Data from the 2016 election shows that just 100 people account for $1 billion of the $1.8 billion that went to super PACs (political action committees), which are used to fund candidates’ campaigns. That’s a lot of political influence from a small number of people. And what kind of values do the wealthiest 1 percent have? In surveys, only 35 percent believe the government should work to provide jobs if none are available in the private sector. They are also more likely to believe the government shouldn’t care for the unemployed or the quality of public schools. While the wealthiest in the United States have a disproportionate influence on politics now, it doesn’t have to stay that way. Political reforms could reduce inequality and bolster democracy, starting with campaign finance reform and putting an end to the electoral college. Political donations need to be more transparent so that voters have faith in the electoral process. This faith in democracy also extends to the voting process. Currently, the electoral college gives sparsely populated states a disproportionate amount of power. For example, the densely populated state of California gets one elector for every 713,637 people while Wyoming gets one for every 195,167. In the recent past, two presidents have already been elected despite not having won the popular vote. Each time that happens, more people lose faith in democracy and start believing that the system is rigged. If the United States hopes to ease tensions, democracy needs to be strengthened. This is necessary for preparing the nation for what lies ahead. The key message in these blinks: There’s a new economy on the horizon: a digital economy, which is based on automated robots and artificial intelligence performing most of the tasks most day jobs comprise today. To prepare for this inevitability, we need to rethink how we define the jobs we deem worthy of wages and benefits. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

For a long time, intellectuals have debated this point, wondering why some nations prosper and succeed while others dwindle and suffer. Is it down to some kind of superior racial biology of the more prosperous society? Or perhaps sheer luck? In fact, the true answer is more subtle: A society is made great by its institutions. Why? Because humans tend to be selfish, so without some kind of rules to force them to think about the common good – the good of their society as a whole – they tend to simply look after their own interests. Institutions provide such rules and boundaries. For example, consider the institutions of the law, like the judiciary and the police. They provide certain rules and boundaries that the rest of society abides by. The importance of institutions means that the nations with better institutions are more likely to prosper. And what makes institutions good or bad? Quite simply, the things they incentivize people to do with the rules and boundaries they set. Good institutions will encourage the population of the nation to strive harder for worthwhile goals, like economic growth or a fair legal system. Bad institutions do the opposite; for example, they may encourage crime. A good example of the importance of institutions can be seen when comparing the economies of former East and West Germany. Both countries were essentially populated with the same people, but the difference in their institutions was immense: In West Germany, the political and economic institutions encouraged people to work hard, innovate and take risks (for example, by starting their own businesses). In East Germany, this kind of entrepreneurship was discouraged. The result? West Germany became a vibrant economic state while East Germany stagnated. About 500 years ago, a powerful geopolitical shift began to take place on Earth. Prior to this, Western nations had not been particularly powerful or influential in global affairs. But then began what is known as the great divergence. Western nations started to outstrip the rest of the world in terms of economic growth, military power and technological development. Why did this divergence happen? Because Western nations developed the best institutions, which allowed them to prosper. For example, England developed very successful political institutions, most notably by creating a parliament that pledged to protect the private property of citizens. This meant citizens had an incentive to work hard and grow wealthy, safe in the knowledge that the fruits of their labor would not be stolen by, say, a greedy king or queen. This, in turn, spurred economic development, which culminated in the British Empire dominating the entire world through trade. At the same time, the rest of the world had relatively poor institutions, because the rulers in these nations were autocratic and all-powerful, and wanted to keep it that way. This meant they resisted the development of important institutions. For example, China had a totally corrupt political institution that allowed the state and its elite bureaucrats to help themselves to the property of citizens whenever they felt like it. This meant that Chinese subjects had little incentive to work hard, and the once-powerful nation stagnated, eventually even succumbing to Western imperialism. The West may have been the dominant economic and geopolitical force for the past 500 years, but this time seems to be coming to an end. This can be seen in the way the rest of the world is catching up to the West in terms of economic power. To see this trend, it is enough to glance at recent economic growth figures: In 2012, the US economy grew by a measly 2 percent, while the European economy actually contracted. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy grew by a whopping 8 percent. The reasons behind this trend are the subject of quite somespeculation. Some experts theorize that the rest of the world is catching up, because, having observed the success of the Western economic doctrine and model, they are now successfully copying it. However, this view is too simplistic. The real reason lies with the slow decline of Western institutions – the very same institutions that originally made the West so powerful. For an example of this, you need look no further than the West’s financial institutions, like banks, and the governments' financial authority. Once upon a time, financial institutions were the backbone of the West’s economic power, encouraging entrepreneurship and economic growth. Today, however, they are in complete turmoil and mired in scandal. Bankers have crashed the economy and yet go unpunished, while the government stifles businesses with red tape and overly complex bureaucracy. Thus, the once great institutions are declining, and bringing Western society down with them. In the eighteenth century, the political philosopher Edmund Burke put forth the idea that civilized society was in fact a kind of contract between generations: those dead, those now living and those yet to be born. In a civilized society, no one generation should act without considering what the others would think, meaning that the values of dead generations cannot be trampled on and the well-being of future generations must be considered. This philosophy was thought to bring about a stable, prosperous society. However, in the West today, this cross-generational contract has been broken: older and middle-aged people are living selfishly at the expense of those not yet born. They do this by enjoying generous government benefits, in terms of wages, health care plans and pensions. But these benefits are not free, and the government is running up a huge public debt by spending on these things. The public debt of Japan, a Westernized nation, has reached the dizzying level of almost 2.5 times their gross domestic product. Clearly this is unsustainable, so why do the Western nations continue along this path? Partly because of their democratic form of government. Many voters, especially the elderly and public sector workers, have much to lose if they no longer receive the generous government benefits they are used to. This means they consistently vote to uphold the status quo. Another reason for this seemingly senseless spending is that Western governments tend to hide the true cost of the debt from voters. Official accounts only publish a fraction of the debt levels, resulting in younger voters remaining tragically unaware of the massive debt they will have to pay back in the future. This means they too will often vote for the status quo, even though it is against their own interests. You may recall that after the 2007 financial crisis, there were ever louder calls for stronger regulation of the financial system. This approach is misguided and dangerous, because financial crises are caused not by lack of regulation, but rather by bad regulation. To understand this, you must first understand that the financial system evolves in an organic way, without following a predictable or consistent pattern. This is because the financial system is made up of many interacting parts, such as companies, banks, government entities and so forth, all of which are constantly reshaping and reacting to changes in their environments. This means that within the system a kind of natural selection, similar to the process that drives evolution, is constantly underway. Businesses compete for scarce resources, some succeeding while others fail. This dynamic means the entire financial system is in constant flux, making it very difficult to regulate it effectively because changes to one part of the system can have unforeseen consequences in another part. For example, in the 1980s, well-meaning regulation of the banking sector encouraged banks to increase the total assets under their control, relative to the capital they actually had. The result? Banks saw their profits skyrocket, but simultaneously they also became very fragile and, therefore, at greater risk of going insolvent during a financial crisis. Despite the inherent difficulties, it is possible to create effective regulation. The secret is that it must be simple and flexible so it does not suffocate enterprise. Also, it cannot be rushed and must be based on a careful study of financial history to avoid past mistakes. The legal systems of both the United Kingdom and the United States are developed through the process of common law, meaning the law is not determined solely by a strict legal code but can be interpreted and developed by judges. This common law system was one of the main drivers behind these two countries’ evolution into global economic powerhouses. This is because, first of all, common law protected hard-working citizens from having their property seized by the state. This made populations under common law more entrepreneurial, driving growth. Another reason is that because common law leaves much to the interpretation of the judge, it is very flexible. As conditions change – due, for example, to new technologies– judges can quickly adapt the law accordingly. This flexibility helped businesses seize quickly upon novel ideas based on new technologies. Unfortunately, today the legal systems in these countries are far from flexible. In fact, legislation is so complex that it suffocates enterprise: just setting up a small business these days demands a costly and time-consuming navigation of a veritable jungle of legislation regarding things like health and safety, insurance, etc. It is little surprise then that the World Economic Forum actually ranked the United States lower on its Global Competitiveness Index than places like Singapore and Hong Kong. These excessively complex legal systems are clearly bad for business, bad for entrepreneurs and bad for the economy. In fact, the only people they are good for are lawyers. Consider that the cost to businesses of navigating regulations is a whopping $1.75 trillion per year in the United States alone. This massive cost is incurred because businesses need to fork out huge legal fees just for the act of setting up their business, never mind actually doing business. Until the early twentieth century, many people in the West were active in various societies and clubs – for example, in political parties and private clubs. This phenomenon is known as civil society, where such organizations form an important part of how a community deals with those less fortunate. Clubs and societies encouraged people to pull together for the common good and to help each other. Sadly though, as decreasing numbers of people wish to participate in such organizations, the civil society is fast becoming a thing of the past. Consider that in 1908, over 33 million people belonged to so-called “friendly societies,” meaning voluntary organizations like a working man’s club, which was a social club for working-class men, or a co-operative organization, where ownership of, say, the village shop was shared among many people, making all of them responsible for it. But by 2001, this figure had declined to just 10.5 million. Why? Their role has been usurped by the “welfare state,” an arrangement in which the well-being of citizens is under the responsibility of and controlled by the state. Whereas under civil society citizens had to rely on each other for support and aid, they can now just cash benefits and free health-care provisions from the state. At the same time, citizens are getting a raw deal because the state cannot deliver the welfare services efficiently. The state has a monopoly on those services, and all monopolies are inherently inefficient. Once people have gotten used to the benefits without responsibility, as provided by the welfare state, they tend to be unwilling to revert back to a more proactive civil society. Nevertheless, it is the only way to end the inefficient monopoly of state control. It’s no secret that the population of world is growing. In fact, it is slated to reach nine billion souls, with most of them living in the developing world. Even more precisely, the growth will be primarily in cities and megacities (a city with a population over ten million) in the developing world. It has been predicted that over half of all global population growth between 2012 and 2025 is estimated to come from less than 500 cities, all non-Western. Cities will swell because they are natural centers of innovation, creativity and investments, so people flock to them in search of work. Obviously, such rapid growth also has drawbacks. Megacities in the developing world tend to be always on the edge of chaos, and they could easily slide into riots or be consumed by epidemics if out-of-control growth was thrown into the equation too. So what determines whether a city can grow sustainably? The strength of its institutions: strong institutions provide important rules and frameworks (especially important in urban living) that make a city robust and secure. Consider, for example, how chaotic Western cities would be if they did not have a strong local government that provided and cared for the cities’ infrastructure, like roads, sewage and emergency services. To understand this phenomenon in a historical context, consider Rome in AD 410. It was attacked by Visigoths, and because it had such weak political, religious and social institutions, the city slid into chaos. Soon, the entire Roman Empire followed suit and collapsed. The decline of Western power and influence is likely to continue into the future. This is because Western nations are currently crippled by huge debts, so instead of expanding their influence in the world they will have to deleverage – which means they will have cut back their global economic, military and political presence in order to save money and reduce their debts. For example, Western powers used to play a vital role in maintaining security in the Middle East, but they may soon need to withdraw from such areas. This development will unfortunately lead to a more uncertain or volatile world, as the Western withdrawal will inevitably leave behind a power vacuum. Instead of the current safe and secure global hierarchy, where the West dominates, many nations will battle for influence, making the division of power unpredictable and shifting. The consequence of this volatility? The world will become a more dangerous place. This is because the Western powers will no longer wield the kind of military power that enables them to limit and address security threats arising around the globe. The most startling example can, of course, be seen in nuclear weapons. In the past, the West was so powerful it could persuade smaller countries not to pursue the ownership of nuclear weapons, but today these countries, like North Korea, no longer feel the need to hold back. Similarly, in the past, when a country seemed unstable, the Western powers had the influence to intervene to prop up a weak government and thereby stabilize the country. But when support from such government is removed, it can lead to instability and even revolutions, as was seen in the Arab Spring. It is repercussions like these that will make a world without strong Western influence violent, revolutionary and war-prone. The main message of this book: The economic decline in Western nations is a result of a degeneration in the quality of their institutions. For the last 500 years, the development of strong institutions in the West meant that democracy, capitalism, the rule of law and civil society flourished. This gave the Western powers the advantage over the rest of the world. Now, with their decline, the other powers are catching up. The West will have to go through a period of radical reform or else its decline will continue.   What will the future hold? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Needless to say, a lot has changed since then. Thanks to scientific discoveries, political ideas and new technology, life has vastly improved for much of the world’s population. But not for all of it. By and large, richer countries benefit and poorer ones suffer on.  So what can we do about this? That’s exactly what these blinks are all about. You’ll also learn why our earliest ancestors’ way of life might not have been so bad; how the United States became an aristocracy; and why foreign aid is a blunt instrument in the fight against poverty. When listening to the news these days, one gets the impression things are just getting worse and worse. But the news never gives the whole story. In fact, rather than getting worse, our well-being has, on average, never been better than it is today. Until about 250 years ago, most people throughout the world lived in poverty. And today, although a lot has happened since then, more than a billion people live in extreme poverty, suffering the same terrible living conditions as their forebears. But overall well-being – which includes things like access to health services, higher pay, longer lifespans, happiness, opportunities for education and progress as well as general quality of life – has increased considerably.  For example, a white middle-class girl born in the Unites States today has a life expectancy of over 80 years (with a 50 percent chance of living to 100). She also has opportunities for education and better economic prospects than her parents. Despite all this, however, there is still extreme inequality in well-being worldwide. Though people today earn more money and enjoy better living standards than ever before, there are still massive disparities between rich and poor countries. The health standards in Sierra Leone, for instance, are actually worse than health standards were in the United States in 1910, when 25 percent of children died before the age of five. And over half of the population of the Democratic Republic of Congo lives on less than a dollar per day. The good news is that these inequalities can lead to progress – if they’re used in the right way. For example, if the difference between, say, the rate of child mortality in rich and poor countries is well known, poor countries will likely try to adopt the innovations that allowed wealthier countries to increase life expectancy, and thus diminish these inequalities. The first humans, members of hunter-gatherer communities, lived healthy, albeit short, lives. Members of these nomadic tribes lived until about the age of 40, and spent their days looking for food and shelter.  This might seem like a hard way of life, but that’s not entirely true. For instance, these tribes enjoyed a very balanced diet, and shared what they found with one another. Instead of getting stuck in dirty villages, they were able to move on before a lack of sanitation caused disease to spread, and their diet consisted of highly nutritious wild plants and meat that was probably healthier than what we consume today. Then, millennia ago during the Neolithic Revolution, these hunter-gatherers began settling down into an agricultural lifestyle alongside their newly domesticated animals. But this agricultural revolution actually led to a decrease in well-being and a massive increase in mortality brought on by disease. One would expect that settling in villages would have increased our ancestors’ well-being. After all, a settled life meant less dependence on the seasons and climate, less travel and less competition with other tribes for food.  But it turned out that the opposite was true: settling down actually decreased well-being. These early villages and cities were dirty – people kept their food next to the feces of domesticated animals, and disease spread fast as new epidemics arrived through trade. As a result, both quality of life and life expectancy drastically decreased during the Neolithic Revolution. People lived shorter lives, and often died young due to diseases or catastrophic famines after droughts. In the last century alone, life expectancy in wealthy countries like the United Kingdom has increased by about 30 years! How did this happen? The biggest reason for this amazing increase in life expectancy is a decrease in child mortality. Until very recently, life was short and child mortality was high. Yet with improvements in health care and disease prevention, many countries in the world have brought child mortality down to a rate of only 0.5 percent! If you consider that, a few centuries ago, almost a third of all children wouldn’t have made it to age five, these are massive improvements.  In addition, better nutrition, health care and education mean that most babies born in wealthy countries can expect to live long enough to see their grandchildren and maybe even great-grandchildren – something that might not have been possible a few centuries ago. Another important factor in improving health and mortality rates was the spread of scientific knowledge and other developments. Advances like the germ theory, governmental stability, improved sanitation and increased research into disease prevention and treatment have improved health and decreased mortality in many countries. When the city of London improved their sanitation in the early nineteenth century, for example, disease rates quickly dropped as the government could more effectively fight the cholera epidemic of 1854. That’s not to say that the progress has been entirely smooth. For example, the Great Famine of China, between 1959 and 1961, resulted in the deaths of around 30 million people. Then there’s the 34 million people that have died of HIV/AIDS. And let’s not forget that there are children in the world today who still suffer and die from preventable diseases like cholera, measles or diarrhea.  In the previous blink, you learned that there is a pretty easy way to manage the majority of diseases that have plagued humanity for thousands of years: proper sanitation. So why do children in poor countries continue to suffer from such high mortality rates? The knowledge that improvements in sanitation or the use of cheap, yet effective vaccines can help prevent diseases and infections is accessible all over the world. And yet, in many countries, this knowledge isn't actually put to use. But why? Often, the government simply lacks the motivation to implement these measures, and the local population is still too uneducated to know that such simple improvements could save the lives of their children. As a result, children die of treatable or easily preventable illnesses like diarrhea, or suffer from malnutrition for years before dying when their weakened immune system is attacked by a virus. Compounding this problem is the fact that poor countries often have little or no health care provided by the government. Consequently, access to advanced medicine is sorely lacking for many people. For instance, Zambia and Senegal allocate a much smaller percentage of their budget to improving their citizens’ health than countries like the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, there are plenty of undemocratic countries that don’t act in the population’s best interest. All too often, quality health care is available only for those who can afford it, while the majority continues to suffer and watch their children die from preventable diseases. To make matters worse, many people don’t even realize that their government could and should help improve their health, having never been educated about their rights as citizens. The Gallup World Poll, for instance, regularly surveys citizens on what they consider to be the primary issues that their government should focus on. Health care ranks very low in these surveys, far behind things like job creation. As a result of our technological innovation and scientific breakthroughs, life expectancy in wealthier countries has risen to unprecedented heights. However, this growth is beginning to level out. We’ve made amazing progress in extending the lives of children, but we seem to have hit a wall when it comes to ways of lengthening the lives of the elderly.  Indeed, diseases such as cancer remain the leading cause of death among the elderly. The biggest existential threats that an elderly person in a rich country faces are cardiovascular disease, cancer and pneumonia.  Rather than dying of diseases and infections, today’s elderly die as a result of chronic diseases that begin to manifest at 50 years of age and older. For this reason, billions of dollars are being invested in research on cancer treatment, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s prevention. But increasing healthcare spending isn’t necessarily the solution to these problems. In the United States, for example, around 18 percent of taxed income is spent on health care – twice as much as in any other country. And yet, Americans don't live as long as many people in other rich countries. One of the most important medical and social developments of our time has to do with lifestyle decisions. For example, people today smoke less and live healthier lifestyles than those that lived in the ’70s and ’80s. People today know that they could potentially live long, fulfilling lives, and they’re starting to work hard to get there. Instead of only throwing money at healthcare initiatives, this money should also be spent on better education and improvements to living standards, which would help prevent illness instead of simply treating symptoms as they develop. When thinking about inequality, we often only consider the disparity of wealth between the rich and poor within our own society. Today, however, we have to start thinking globally. It’s certainly true that inequality can be seen in all countries. But the greatest gaps are found between nations. Before the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, most countries were on a similar footing, and the largest disparity of wealth was found between poor farmers and the rich aristocrats who owned the land the farmers worked.  However, the Enlightenment essentially abolished aristocracy and, with the growth of the middle class, these massive disparities began to shrink. For some nations, these intellectual and technological revolutions brought great wealth; others were left behind. While the United States and many European countries enjoy plenty of wealth and high standards of living, many African and East Asian countries still struggle to get by and develop. In Africa, for instance, the number of poor people actually doubled between 1981 and 2008, from 169 million to 303 million. Nor has the disparity of wealth within nations been wiped out entirely. The United States, for example, is quite a rich country, but it’s also plagued by inequality. In the United States the one-percenters – the top one percent of income earners – control the vast majority of wealth, while the rest of the population lives only slightly better than their parents did, or live in poverty.  And the consequences of poverty include much more than just struggling to afford housing and food. Poverty also entails an inability to participate in social and political processes, as well as a much slimmer chance of ever getting a higher education. On the other hand, the super rich (that is, the top 0.01 percent of income earners, who hold 4.5 percent of total US income) are becoming even richer due to lenient tax regulations and benefits. In a certain light, one could argue that the United States is building a modern-day aristocracy. Globalization has enabled us to buy more things, for less money, from more areas of the world than ever before. Not only has globalization made consumer life easier; it’s also had a wonderful impact on poverty. Globalization makes it possible for innovations to reach all corners of the globe. Global telecommunications infrastructure, for example, makes information and scientific innovations easily accessible via the internet. Today, it’s easier to travel, transact and communicate globally than ever before, all thanks to global technological innovation. One would think that poor countries today should be able to easily use the information and innovation that rich countries have accumulated during the last 250 years, and quickly catch up with them. Unfortunately, however, access to information isn’t the only ingredient necessary for escaping poverty. In many countries around the world a lack of fundamental institutions impedes growth and progress. While the knowledge of how to treat preventable diseases or establish a functioning democracy might be available, the institutions required to implement these innovations are not. Some countries, including Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, as well as China and India, are indeed growing at a rapid pace. But their growth leaves countries like Liberia and Afghanistan behind. While some poor countries have developed into middle-income ones, others have become even poorer than they were decades earlier. The Democratic Republic of Congo is one such example. Thanks to massive and continual political and economic problems, its population is now worse off than it was after World War II. Charity is all about giving to those in need. And that’s a good thing, right? Well, that depends on what you give, and how you give it. Rich countries often suffer from the aid illusion. Indeed, development aid in the form of cash injections from a rich country to a poor one happens everywhere in the world. In fact, in 2011 alone, governments around the world provided over $133.5 billion in development aid, and charities and NGOs raised another $30 billion. This should have been enough money to finally end poverty once and for all! Yet, the opposite is happening. While rich countries remain under the illusion that simply throwing money at poor countries will end people's misery, a lack of money is not the only cause of poverty. Bad governance, malfunctioning institutions and unprotected human and civil rights are the more prominent problems.  Cash aid can easily land in the hands of corrupt regimes that have absolutely no incentive to bring about an end to poverty and suffering, because that would stop the flow of aid. Zimbabwe, for example, is under the autocratic regime of Robert Mugabe, and receives development aid that amounts to around ten percent of its national income. Luckily, there are other ways to fight poverty more effectively. For instance, dissemination of scientific knowledge, information about democratic processes, private remittance sent back by those who have immigrated to other countries or capital funding by private investors are all better than lump-sum development aid. Most importantly, rich countries can lift trade restrictions that effectively lock farmers in poorer countries out of the international market. The World Bank, for example, could provide diplomatic help to countries in need to level the playing field during trade negotiations, and migrants from Africa could be allowed to temporarily enter rich countries in pursuit of higher education. Indeed, there are many ways to help poor countries escape poverty. Simply throwing money at their problems, however, doesn’t seem to be the most effective one. The key message in this book: Times have never been better for human beings. In rich countries, scientific and political developments have made life quite comfortable. However, many countries have been left behind in the process, and they need help to catch up to modern standards of living.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Time to learn who – other than your mom – is so keen to find out. Hint, these aren’t self-help blinks, but a journey into e-commerce, neuroscience and big data. The Happiness Industry is full of valuable insights into a world in which happiness has become a commodity that can be quantified in an MRI or an algorithm. In these blinks, you’ll discover what Jeremy Bentham had to say about happiness; how neuroscience, economics and happiness are interlinked; and which (hidden) incentives your government might have to make you happy. Are you happy right now? How can you tell? Perhaps you can’t stop breaking into a grin. Or maybe it’s just that feeling that everything will turn out alright. Though everyone might answer that question differently, it’s clear that happiness is something that can be measured.  Developments in neuroscience have allowed us to understand pleasure as a physiological event, comprised of observable chemical processes. Put simply, the human brain operates with a special “code” of emotion, including happiness. This code is computed in the orbitofrontal cortex.  Neuroscience isn’t the only field convinced that happiness is measurable. Some schools of philosophy work from that premise too. Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), founder of modern utilitarianism, suggested that the intensity of happiness can be objectively observed using two metrics: human pulse rate and money. Findings suggest that people’s pulse rates increase during moments of happiness – a straightforward way to measure the intensity of their feelings. Money can also help us gage positive emotions. If we count happiness as utility or usefulness, then when you buy a product the amount of money you spent on it becomes a measure of your happiness with the product or its usefulness to you.  Politicians also have a vested interest in happiness. One of their responsibilities is, after all, to maximize the happiness of society. Governments strive to achieve this goal by punishing and rewarding.  Punishing refers to making an individual suffer for committing a crime or bad behavior. A criminal, for instance, must serve a certain sentence in prison. Conversely, in the free market people can be rewarded with money in the form of income for being hardworking and talented. In this way, a government is theoretically able to direct human behavior toward maximizing happiness.  From the early 1990s on, economists began to use (and abuse) research into the relationships between pleasure and money. Studies compared the happiness of people with different levels of income, with the controversial, but perhaps unsurprising, findings that the richer are indeed happier.  Research into the topic continued, with neuroscientists taking the lead. Further studies revealed that a pleasurable activity corresponds with an increase in dopamine levels in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that activates the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. One of these centers is the nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that also triggers decisions to purchase a product. In light of this, some neuroscientists have proposed that every buying decision is actually the result of specific neural pathways in the brain. Perhaps, then, when we spend $10 on a pizza, or $500 on a new tech gadget, we receive an equivalent quantity of dopamine as a reward. Of course, it’s important to consider who is carrying out such research, and why. Economists, business leaders and marketers would all be absolutely thrilled if they could prove that money wields power over the chemical processes of happiness. So long as capitalism exists, there will be people trying to link psychological happiness and money together! And happiness itself is becoming increasingly commodifed. Find out more in the following blinks. How gullible are you? Most of us think we’re pretty tough to fool, but just think about all the products that you own. There might be several that you’re using right now. Why did you buy those particular headphones, or socks, or snack bars?  Because our brains are more easily swayed than we’d like to believe. Cunning advertising teams have made use of neuroscience to get inside your head and make you buy and then buy some more.  Brian Knutson, a Stanford neuroscientist, found that humans experience a significant amount of pleasure when anticipating receiving a product. In fact, thinking about having a product makes us happier than actually owning it.  Current advertising trends reflect this finding in their fixation on the experience of using a product, rather than the characteristics or features of the physical product itself.  For example, an ad for jogging shoes sells the experience of happy, carefree running, perhaps encapsulated in a smiling, toned female jogger running along a forest track. This approach is highly effective at increasing the anticipation of receiving the marketed product.  Marketers also make clever use of research into behavioral analysis. Advertisers have long known that they aren’t just selling a product, but seeking to generate a specific psychological response. Consumers’ feelings can be manipulated, and powerfully too.  John Watson (1878–1958), an American consumer psychologist, evoked feelings of purity and cleanliness in his ads for baby powder, making shrewd use of the profound emotions of young mothers. The ad was a success, but of course not all women were taken in by it. That was one shortcoming of advertising in the past: even with focus groups and market research, it was tough to get a comprehensive picture of how your ads were received by the public.  Today, things have changed. With online advertising and growing e-commerce, behavioral analysis is being used more slyly than ever. Online, it’s incredibly easy to measure how consumers behave, and in turn, easier to get consumers to do what you want them to.  But it’s not just marketers that want to harness our happiness. Your employer does too. Capitalist companies love making profits. But what happens when their employees don’t love their jobs? Dwindling enthusiasm and productivity are some of the greatest threats to any aspiring firm.  A study by Gallup revealed that as little as 13 percent of the global workforce are engaged in and enthusiastic about their jobs. A further study also found that a quarter of absenteeism is not the result of real sickness, but general burnout experienced by employees.  A lack of engagement doesn’t just mean suffering employees, but massive costs to businesses and governments too. Active disengagement, be it absenteeism, sickness or even just inertia when on the job, costs the US economy a whopping $550 billion a year. Simply put, capitalism can’t sustain itself unless businesses can rally commitment from their employees. Why? Because productivity goes hand-in-hand with health and happiness.  Researchers estimate that companies can increase their output by 12 percent if employees feel happy. Findings also highlight the personal dangers of burnout for employees, leaving them at greater risk of heart attacks, strokes and nervous breakdowns, all of which are naturally disastrous for productivity.  With this in mind, some businesses make serious attempts to promote their employees’ happiness and health, hoping to improve their performance and reap the benefits. Executive wellness programs, for instance, are designed for the senior employees of companies in order to keep them fit enough to run the ship.  An increasing number of companies even employ specialist “happiness consultants” who guide managers to creating a cheerier workplace. Google, for example, has an in-house “jolly good fellow” to spread mindfulness and empathy in order to make employees healthier and happier, and, of course, maintain profits for the business. Who are you more likely to believe: a pushy salesman, or one of your close friends? Word-of-mouth is one of the oldest forms of advertising. It’s stood the test of time because it works. But these days, it’s received a bit of a makeover.  Marketers today have figured out just how much use they can make of social bonds when advertising products. There are two main strategies. First, they deepen the “social” relationship between company and customer. How? One highly effective tactic is corporate giving. This is nothing more than giving products and services away for free. Companies do this not out of generosity, but to win a customer’s favor and build up their own reputation in the market.  Even simpler is the technique of saying thank you. For example, Tesco, a leading UK supermarket chain, released YouTube videos with men in Christmas jumpers singing “thank you” as part of the brand advertising campaign. This marketing tactic boosted revenue and allowed Tesco to recover after an unsuccessful sales performance in 2011.  The second strategy that companies use to take advantage of social bonds is friendvertising. Friendvertising refers to the creation of images and videos with positive brand messages that appeal to social media users, who in turn share the ad with their online friends.  The most shared ad of 2013 was a three minute YouTube video called “Dove’s Real Beauty Sketches.” The beauty and skincare brand centered their ad on the positive message “you are more beautiful than you think,” something highly relatable and highly shareable. Online sharing is rather like a faster, wider-reaching version of word-of-mouth advertising.  This is something to remember next time you scroll through your feeds! You may have been subject to marketing campaigns without even realizing. Or your friends may have been turned into brand advocates, whether they were aware of it or not. If you take a moment to think about the vast amount of digital information you create everyday, from your Google searches to Facebook likes to your Amazon.com purchases, it’s reasonable to say that it’s quite a lot of data. And data, like happiness, is rapidly becoming a commodity.  Our everyday digital transactions with retailers, governments and each other generate confidential data that is nevertheless used to analyze and predict human behavior. This makes it easier for scammers to hijack our credit cards, for example.  Despite this, we continue to pour out personal information online, often without a second thought. Think about it: there are 500 million new tweets per day on Twitter. This means that the risk of privacy invasion is high.  Our personal information, so sought after by companies and advertisers, is now, for the first time, readily available to them. Facebook sells information about our activity on Facebook to advertisers, for example. This information is analyzed and manipulated by marketers who ensure we see ads that match our tastes and interests, often with spooky accuracy.  Moreover, in 2014, Facebook published a paper on emotional contagion in social networks. Unbeknownst to us, Facebook had been using an automated system to identify positive or negative words in news feeds. Facebook then experimented by altering levels of positive or negative content across the feeds of 700,000 users for a week to assess the impact on their emotions, based on their status updates. In other words, your happiness is constantly under surveillance.  The key message in this book: Happiness is an emotion that is real and measurable. In our capitalist world, those in power seek to use money to measure positivity, manipulate our emotions to make us more productive, and mine our data to channel our happiness into consumption.  Actionable advice: Trust your own subjective feelings of happiness. People you know and don’t know constantly try to measure and define your level of happiness. Don’t let them! Your emotions are your best guide as you learn what makes you happy, what doesn’t and how you can experience more happiness in your everyday life.

In many countries, a thin slice at the top seems to hold all the wealth, while many suffer to make ends meet. Huge gaps exist even between countries, as some receive billions in foreign investment while others struggle to improve roads and basic services for their citizens. What exactly is inequality, and why does it exist? In short, inequality is an imbalance, the measure of haves and have-nots. There are various factors that come into play when we talk about or try to measure inequality. These blinks will help you better understand the causes of inequality and how one person, one country or even the world can work to level the economic playing field. In these blinks, you’ll discover why inequality in certain cases is considered a positive thing; how scholars measure inequality; and why inequality is on the rise again. Do you think a capitalist society would have different levels of inequality than would a socialist society? Your answer is probably “yes,” but in the early days of income distribution studies, the answer wasn’t always so obvious. In the early 1900s, Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, a pioneer in the field of inequality, was the first scholar to study inequality in terms of income distribution among individuals rather than among classes. Pareto’s central belief was that social arrangement – whether a society was capitalist, socialist or feudalist, for instance – had almost no effect on income distribution. He reached this conclusion through the omnipresent 80/20 law, which states that 80 percent of an economy’s effects – such as sales in stores – are a result of 20 percent of the causes – such as the demand of clients. In turn, this means that the wealthiest 20 percent of the population controls 80 percent of the total income. In Pareto’s view, changes in social arrangement couldn’t ever effectively challenge this law. As a result, Pareto believed that levels of inequality would always remain more or less unchanged. Russian-American economist Simon Kuznets challenged this idea in 1955 when he theorized that inequality among individuals does, in fact, change as society changes. After conducting extensive research, Kuznets found that economic growth initially increases income inequality, but later decreases it. When society shifted from an agricultural focus to an industrial focus, the new industrial class began to earn much more money than did farmers, and thus income inequality increased. As society advanced, however, increased education and progressive state policies – such as government spending, taxes and other forms of income redistribution – caused income inequality to stall and eventually decrease. Such policies shifted the balance of income toward the bottom and showed that, in contrast to Pareto’s ideas, Kuznets was correct in believing that social arrangement does have an impact on income inequality. Inequality is a hot-button issue for good reason, as it affects everyone by directly impacting a country’s economic growth. In fact, one way to determine whether inequality is “good” or “bad” is to see how much inequality encourages or discourages economic growth. In this way, we can liken inequality to cholesterol – it can be either good or bad, depending on the amount and the effect it has on the overall “body” of society. For instance, when inequality motivates people to apply themselves and work hard, perhaps even pursue groundbreaking entrepreneurial projects, it facilitates growth and is thus considered good, or even essential. On the other hand, when inequality creates complacent populations in which individuals remain in protected positions, thus stifling creativity and economic growth, it is considered bad. Such situations are easy to imagine. Consider a society in which only the smallest, wealthiest group of people receives the best educational training and the top jobs, limiting the rest of society to taking low-skilled and limited-growth positions. In such a society, only a very small segment of the population would be contributing significantly to overall growth. As a result, growth would be much lower than in a society where a greater part of the population was contributing more to total economic output. In this way, inequality is directly linked to a society’s economic efficiency. Inequality is also strongly linked to economic justice or the acceptance or repudiation of certain social arrangements. For instance, when inequality is the result of practices that favor or discriminate against certain populations based on race, gender or inheritance, it is clearly bad and unjust, even if it doesn’t negatively impact economic growth. When people come together to protest income injustice, they are questioning the social arrangement that enables such injustices. Their demand for a refashioning of the very social foundations in place shows the relationship between inequality and economic justice.      If inequality as an element of society is so influential, it’s necessary to have a way to measure its effects. Let’s investigate some of the methods in place to do so. One of the first things to realize about measuring income inequality, however, is that it is hard to do. Household surveys measuring income haven’t existed for long. Though there are surveys on record that were taken during nineteenth-century England, most are incomplete and unreliable. Most available data starts in the early 1950s, and for developing countries, even later – some African nations have surveys dating back only to the 1980s. Let’s say that we did have complete household income data – even then, measuring inequality would prove difficult. We can assess a country’s national income with a single number, such as gross domestic product (GDP), by simply adding each person’s yearly income. Yet when it comes to the diversity of income distribution, it’s much more difficult to sum up neatly. This doesn’t mean that people haven’t tried. Take the Italian economist Corrado Gini, for instance, who invented a method for measuring inequality which is still preferred today. His method was to compare the income of an individual with the incomes of the rest of the population. Mathematically, this consists of dividing the sum of all income differences by the total number of people and their average incomes. This calculation results in a unit of measurement called the Gini coefficient, which ranges from zero, indicating no inequality whatsoever, to one, which indicates maximum inequality, in which one individual is getting the income of the entire community. Using the Gini coefficient, we can compare inequality levels of entire countries and continents. Accordingly, Latin America is the most unequal, followed by Africa, Asia and the rich and postcommunist countries. The most egalitarian countries, such as the Nordic countries, have Gini scores from 0.25 to 0.3, while the most unequal countries, such as Brazil and South Africa, have Gini scores around 0.6. Let’s say you’re doing a research project and need to compare China’s income in 1850 with that of France in 2000. Luckily, there are methods that enable such comparisons, though the math won’t necessarily be easy! To make this comparison, we convert the currency of the different countries into an imaginary standard currency, based on the US dollar. This currency is called the PPP, or purchase power parity, and it has the same purchasing power everywhere – so $1 PPP buys the same basket of goods in Japan as it does in Spain. With some complicated math, we can figure out the GDP per capita of a country in PPP dollars, fix it for a specific year, and then, using the country’s GDP growth rates over the years, project backward to find GDP per capita in the past. Another method to compare the wealth of nations at different times is to measure income by its ability to purchase human labor. American industrialist John D. Rockefeller was the richest person ever by this measurement – his worth of $1.4 billion in 1937 equaled that of around 116,000 people. So although Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates’ fortune was estimated at $50 billion in 2005, adjusting for time and inflation renders the sum about 75,000 workers fewer than Rockefeller’s total. This method also makes it possible to look at the global makeup of wealth distribution. For instance, half of the world’s richest one percent is made up of 29 million Americans. The rest is made up of four million Germans; three million French, Italians and British, each; two million Canadians, Koreans, Japanese and Brazilians; then around one million Swiss, Spaniards, Australians, Dutch, Taiwanese, Chileans and Singaporeans. Interestingly, despite the stereotype of the well-funded Russian oligarch, there aren’t any significant numbers from Russia or Africa, India and Eastern Europe. It’s no shock to discover that a socialist system creates more equality than does a capitalist system. Socialism is commonly positioned as the egalitarian alternative to capitalism. But, as we can see from models in pre-World War II Europe, as well as in the Soviet sphere, socialism’s alluring ideals of equality can also cause serious problems. After World War II, socialist systems were clearly more egalitarian than capitalist systems, with socialist countries having Gini scores in the upper 0.2 to lower 0.3 range. Western countries with capitalist economies, such as West Germany, France, Denmark and Italy, had Gini scores in the low to mid-0.3s. Among the various causes that made socialist systems more equal was socialism’s push for the nationalization of large industrial and landowning fortunes, as opposed to privatization. This was particularly true in countries like Russia following the 1917 Revolution, and in post-World War II Hungary and Poland. The problem with such societies, however, was that citizens had little incentive to work hard or creatively. When everything – your education, your job and your health care – is predetermined by the state, it’s easy to see how innovation and growth could be stifled. Even in East Germany, which at the time was the most technologically advanced socialist country, factories produced little else than Trabant and Wartburg cars, which were actually mediocre copies of West German cars. In fact, no socialist country ever produced a product that proved to be internationally successful. The lack of incentive to innovate proved the crux of socialism’s failure, and led to the question of whether equality was a worthwhile goal. It’s also questionable whether socialism actually creates egalitarian societies – despite lofty ideals, socialist governments almost always were mired in corruption, with those at the top funneling money from the rest of society. Countries like Brazil and India are noticeably poorer than the United States or Great Britain. Just as we see inequality among individuals, inequality also exists among nations, which can be measured by comparing average incomes per capita. Such intercountry inequality became an issue only after the Industrial Revolution. Of course, it did exist before then – the Roman Empire at its peak, for instance, was much richer than its neighbors. But income disparity was relatively limited because most nations were still operating at the subsistence level. The Industrial Revolution changed this because industrial countries that could produce goods charged ahead while others lagged behind economically. Other than a few exceptions, this inequality continued to rise until the 1950s. After a period of decreased inequality in the interim, the last 30 years have seen a resurgence of inequality.   Why? One reason is the Lucas Paradox, which refers to the tendency for capital to circulate among rich countries instead of flowing from rich countries to poor countries. Capital also tends to flow upward from poor countries to rich countries. You might think that the advent of globalization would encourage more investment in poorer countries, due to their low wages and high return on capital. This hasn’t been the case, however. Both rich countries and wealthy people in poor countries tend to invest in rich nations to limit financial risk. In 2007, for example, China received $138 billion in foreign direct investment. That’s comparable to what the Netherlands received and is less than what was invested in France and Great Britain. By contrast, the United States received almost double the amount – $240 billion. Considering China’s population versus these other smaller countries, its total investment sum is actually quite small. We can attribute this in part to the country’s lingering status as a poor nation, thus making it still a risky investment bet. When Karl Marx published his economic analysis of society in the late 1800s, his ideas that explored how income inequality was driven by class were largely true. In modern times, however, inequality is almost entirely based on place of birth. Today, there is more income disparity between countries than within them. As a result, your income depends chiefly on your country of birth, and this data point actually accounts for more than 60 percent of the variability in global income. Are you surprised? You may have thought that class-based inequality within countries would transfer to the international stage, with the working classes of different countries uniting in solidarity. That’s not exactly the case. We can see this in action: the working classes of emerging economies such as South Korea, Taiwan and Chile have more in common with the working classes of rich countries such as the United States and France, rather than with the poorer classes in developing countries like Angola or Cambodia. And so the overall wealth of the country into which you were born is more important than the specific income class of society to which you belong. Of course, this is not to negate the effect of being born into a rich family – this still does matter! It’s actually these two factors combined – your place of birth and parents’ income class – that explains more than 80 percent of a person’s income. The remaining 20 percent? That’s where factors like gender, race, age and hard work come in. Keep in mind, however, that even if you’re trying hard to move up within that 20 percent, doing so will often have a negligible impact on your global income position – which, as discussed before, is largely predetermined by your birth country. It’s common for people to draw cultural comparisons between the United States and Europe. In this blink we’ll see that it’s interesting to contrast the different causes of inequality between them, too. In 2007, the United States and the European Union shared roughly the same Gini coefficient, just above 0.4. But when comparing the Gini score of the United States with individual countries of the European Union, such as France and Germany, America’s inequality measure was higher. Why does the United States have a similar Gini score to the European Union but a higher score when compared with individual European countries? In the United States, rich people and poor people are dispersed throughout the country. In the European Union, however, inequality among different member countries is the main factor of income inequality. The European Union includes countries such as Luxembourg, the wealthiest country in the world with a GDP per capita of more than $70,000 PPP, as well as countries such as Romania, with a GDP per capita of $10,000 PPP. Let’s shift gears and take a look at the global middle class to further compare inequality. One way to measure a country’s middle class is by taking the incomes that are 25 percent above or below the national median income – that’s the income that divides a population in half, with 50 percent earning more and 50 percent earning less than the sum. In most Latin American countries, only about 20 percent of the population fits this definition of middle class, whereas in developed countries, it’s more around 40 percent.   If we calculate for a global middle class, however, we find that most of this group resides in Asia (at just under 600 million people), with 100 million in Africa and 90 million in Latin America. Revealingly, almost none of the global middle class comes from developed countries. That’s because the upper-income boundary of the global middle class is much lower than even the poverty threshold of rich countries – in other words, rich countries, in comparison to developing countries, are not poor enough to be included. The key message in this book: There are three main types of inequality: that of individuals or communities within a nation; between nations and countries; and global inequality. As there is more inequality between nations than between individuals, your country of birth has the largest impact on your individual income.  Got feedback?

You probably have. Recently, there’s been a parade of scandals, all having to do with the rich and their unsavory habit of trying to hide money from the government. And where do they hide that money? Tax havens. Since their inception, tax havens have been a popular way for the affluent to avoid paying taxes. The issue is often depicted as a moral one. But there’s a bit more to it than that. This practice actually removes money from the treasuries of governments, which could use it for other, more important things. So let’s explore where the hidden wealth of nations really is, and what can be done to uncover it. In these blinks, you’ll discover why new tax havens came into existence in the 1980s; how we can make a good estimate of all the unreported wealth in the world; and what FATCA is and how it can be a good model for combating tax havens. As you can imagine, world wars are expensive. And after World War I, many European nations raised income taxes in an effort to rebuild communities and assist veterans.  An extreme case is post-war France. In 1924, the country’s previous top-tier income tax (two percent) had been raised to a staggering 72 percent. Similar tax increases were popping up across the continent, and, as a result, wealthy Europeans devised methods for dodging these taxes – most commonly, by moving their money to other countries. Switzerland was the most obvious tax haven. A neutral state during World War I, Switzerland was untouched by combat and had no reason to raise taxes, and it also had a well-established banking network with high interest rates. By 1938, Swiss banks stored ten times more foreign wealth than in 1920. At the time, this amount accounted for 2.5 percent of the total wealth of European households and would equal about $130 billion in today’s value. Then in the early 1980s, tax havens began to proliferate. When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came to power in the United Kingdom, she deregulated Britain’s financial markets. This allowed cities like London and Hong Kong, as well as British territories like the Virgin Islands, to compete with Switzerland in the private wealth-management market. Soon, these policies spread to other European nations like Ireland and Luxembourg, which gave people more options to choose from. Despite of the competition, Switzerland’s private banking sector continues to thrive. As of 2015, almost $2.3 trillion is still being held in Swiss banks, an 18 percent increase since 2009. Remarkably, $1.3 trillion of that still comes from wealthy Europeans, representing a staggering ten percent of the total wealth of European citizens. Now we know how tax havens got their start. In the next blink we’ll learn how people redirect their money. You may have heard about the financial crisis in Greece, which had racked up $350 billion in public debt. That’s a disturbingly large sum. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that, in 2014, $7.6 trillion of the world’s money was being kept in tax havens. In other words, eight percent of our global wealth was hidden away. Thought hidden, we can nonetheless track this amount through recorded assets and liabilities. What does that mean? Well, let’s take a look at how a French investor buys stocks in a German corporation like BMW. German accountants would record the sale of BMW stocks to a foreign investor as a liability, which just means that BMW is liable to make payments to the French investor. On the other hand, in France, this sale would be recorded as an asset, because BMW’s payments would flow into the French economy and be taxed. But here’s the catch: If the French investor deposits these stocks into a Swiss bank account they will neither be recorded as an asset nor be taxed by France. This creates a global imbalance: liabilities outweigh assets. Indeed, in 2014, this discrepancy reached a whopping $6.1 trillion. If we combine this with the $1.5 trillion in anonymous bank deposits, we hit $7.6 trillion being hidden away for the primary purpose of avoiding tax. And this is a conservative estimate. It doesn’t include high-value, non-financial items like jewelry, yachts or real estate purchased in tax-exempt locations. Really, it’s impossible to determine how much these non-financial items are worth. But even if we could, it’s unlikely that the $7.6 trillion figure would significantly increase.  After all, people who remain wealthy rarely invest their money in things like yachts or mansions. It’s far more likely they make smart and secure investments, such as buying stock in a reliable company like BMW. Perhaps this sounds harmless enough, but, in the next blink, we’ll see how much damage it can cause. If you’re wondering how these tax havens affect the world, take a look at Greece’s $350 billion debt and consider the fact that 4.5 percent of the nation’s wealth was being tucked away in foreign banks.  It is estimated that, in 2014, tax havens cost world economies an estimated $200 billion in revenue. Even though that figure represents around one percent of the world’s total government revenue, these losses still have enormous effects. Let’s look at how tax havens can make a bad economic situation in Europe even worse. Since the financial crisis began in 2008, economic growth has dwindled dramatically, leading to increasing debt. In 2014 alone, income hidden away in tax havens removed $78 billion in tax revenue for European countries. This kind of large-scale tax fraud has a deep impact on European economies; governments end up making severe budget cuts that include defunding beneficial programs for middle and working class families, which makes it harder for these people to spend and put money back into the economy, which only adds to the problem of decreasing growth and increasing debt. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer and continue to tuck ten percent of their earnings away in Swiss bank accounts. For instance, in 2014, European personal wealth in Switzerland reached $1.3 trillion, a 20 percent increase since the financial crisis began – a huge amount of lost revenue that could have been used to prevent the budget cuts that hurt working and middle-class Europeans. In France, for example, the past few years saw an estimated loss of $300 billion in tax revenues due to tax havens. This money could have boosted the current GDP by 15 percent, an enormous amount. The funds could have been used to pay off public debt, decrease tax rates and help growth, ultimately reducing the gap between rich and poor. In the next blink we’ll see what can be done to prevent tax havens and dismantle economic inequality. We’ve seen the damages that tax havens can cause. So what can be done? A number of initiatives have sprung up; unfortunately, however, most have been ineffective at best and complete failures at worst. Essentially, most attempts at combating tax havens are simply not strong enough. There have been noble efforts. At a G20 meeting in 2009, the representatives of the 20 major economies gathered to announce they had come to an agreement on combating tax havens. French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy even declared it as the “end of tax havens.” In theory, it was a good idea: nations would be allowed to demand that banks in foreign countries reveal financial information about their citizens. But it was a disaster in practice: to obtain this information, governments first needed to provide evidence to these tax havens that tax fraud was being committed. It’s a catch-22. Even if tax evasion is suspected, it is extremely difficult to provide evidence without receiving the requested information. Therefore, tax havens rarely have to provide any information whatsoever. The failure of the G20 plan is painfully obvious; since 2009, the amount of personal wealth stored in tax havens has increased by 25 percent. This is likely due to the fact that the very politicians who are ostensibly against tax havens are actually taking part in the evasion. French Minister of the Budget Jérôme Cahuzac, who was leading the fight against tax evasion in France, resigned after his own offshore bank account in Singapore was discovered. Fortunately, there are more recent measures that show more promise. The United States has recently passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which provides an automatic exchange of financial information between international banks and US tax authorities. It also enforces economic sanctions on any foreign banks that withhold information from US authorities. But, while some countries have made progress, there is still a lot of work to be done. So where does the fight against tax havens go from here? Can nations learn from past mistakes as well as take cues from plans that show promise? The author suggests a twofold plan of action. First, there should be a global FATCA – that is, all countries continuing to act as tax havens should face economic sanctions and trade levies. Obviously, this is a tall order, requiring full cooperation between different nations, especially those in Europe and the G20. But it means that any foreign bank or nation refusing to comply with tax-fraud investigations would face financial penalties. And even if those nations were able to avoid such penalties, they would still be met with trade tariffs on commercial goods and services that they rely on. This strategy of trade tariffs underscores the importance of a truly international and cooperative approach. For example, let’s say that France imposes tariffs on Switzerland for refusing to release information. Rather than deciding to cooperate, Switzerland might take further offence and decide to close its borders to French tourists. However, if all of Europe stands behind France against Switzerland, the government would be much more likely to cooperate rather than retaliate. The second step would be to ensure tax haven compliance. This would involve creating an international wealth database containing a detailed account of international ownership of all stocks and bonds, which would make it easy for international tax authorities to verify when banks are being honest and when they’re withholding information about their clients. As a bonus, this kind of database would also provide nations with better tools in the fight against money laundering and the financial activities of terrorist organizations. While the measures enumerated in the previous blink would be big victories in the battle against personal tax evasion, preventing corporations from sheltering their money is another matter. Why is it so hard to do away with corporate tax evasion? Well, most of the time, it’s perfectly legal. As a matter of fact, multinational corporations have a number of ways to avoid paying taxes. The very nature of being a multinational corporation means that profits are earned around the world and the corporations can move this money anywhere they want, including tax havens. Much of the problem has to do with how corporations handle transfer prices, that is, how much it costs one branch to buy products from another branch within the same multinational corporation. For example, if Google or Microsoft wants to avoid the high corporate tax rate in France, they’ll get a branch located in a tax haven like Ireland to sell them services at a better price. That way, the profits of the sale remain in Ireland, and they don’t have to pay as much tax. Such corporate tax-evasion methods end up costing the US government $130 billion per year in revenue, which is why we should completely rethink how we tax corporations in today’s globalized world. Again, we’ve seen G20 nations get together in attempts to tighten regulations on transfer prices, but this has gotten us nowhere, as corporations are usually at least two steps ahead. Instead, we need to think big and come up with a way to impose global taxes on global profits. One way this could work is to think proportionately.  For example, take a large multinational corporation like Apple: If 50 percent of their products are sold in the United States, then the United States should tax 50 percent of their profits. This would make it very difficult for multinational corporations to evade their taxes. Apple would have to find a way to sell iPhones to every American customer from their branch in Ireland! The key message in this book: On average, tax evasion costs global governments an estimated $200 billion per year. Approximately $7.6 trillion is being stored in offshore tax havens, accounting for eight percent of global household wealth. These practices harm society and add to increasing economic inequality. So far, initiatives to shut down tax havens have been unsuccessful, but nations could join forces and create effective and forceful measures and end the scourge of tax havens. Got feedback?

Perhaps you’d be surprised to discover that by analyzing the behavior of stock-market traders, you can learn how your hormones influence your everyday life and how to improve the way that you deal with stress. Written by a trader-turned-neuroscientist, The Hour Between Dog and Wolf aims to explain the bubbles and crashes of the stock market in terms of the central role played by our physiology and biochemical processes. These blinks contain the key lessons of the book, which – as you’ll soon find out – are not only relevant to making your fortune on the stock market but to all areas of your life. In these blinks, you’ll learn how intuition is as much a product of the body as it is of the brain; that we make decisions to act after our body has already performed the action; why men and women differ greatly in their stress responses; and why hiring more women and older men to work on the trading floors is likely to decrease the risk of a market bubble and crash. When you think about the connection between your brain and your body, how do you picture it? Do you imagine your brain as somehow separate from the rest of your body – a kind of control center that resides in your head, steering the body and causing its every action? If so, then you’re in for a surprise: thinking involves the whole body, not just the brain. For instance, our thoughts and actions are influenced by hormones that stem from different regions of the body. Take Ghrelin, a hormone secreted by cells lining the stomach whenever it’s empty. Release of the hormone causes the brain to register hunger, prompting you to raid the refrigerator for something to eat. But you’re not a slave to Ghrelin. If you have strong reasons for not eating – e.g., a religious fast, hunger strike or a diet – you can effectively ignore Ghrelin’s signals. But this is true only up to a point: over time, the hormone acts somewhat like a lobby group, its signals becoming louder and harder to ignore. As this shows, certain body regions influence the processes in your brain – in this case, registering hunger. And this can be further demonstrated by looking at the way that the gut interacts with the brain. Whenever we’re stressed, the brain will inform the gut that the body is facing an imminent threat, and must therefore prepare for it. Upon “learning” this, the gut will halt the digestion process, in order to save energy for either fight or flight. Stress, in other words, is processed by both body and brain. It works the other way around too: an overly sensitive gut can influence our thinking. In fact, sufferers of Crohn’s disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease, are more sensitive to emotional stimuli. So, if sufferers are exposed to emotive images – such as a distressed child – they’re more likely to become emotionally aroused than healthy people are. Testosterone is considered one of the body’s most powerful hormones because it has a major influence on our behavior. If you’re facing a challenge such as an athletics tournament the body releases testosterone, enabling you to compete for prolonged periods. It accelerates our metabolism and the rate of cell growth, increases our physical strength, lifts our mood and heightens our cognitive performance. But high levels of testosterone also make us more prone to risk taking. In a competitive environment – such as the stock market trading floor – the impulse to take risks can be a destructive one. In the author’s examination of the influence of traders’ testosterone levels on their skill and risk taking, he found that high testosterone levels didn’t increase skill, as skills can be increased only through experience, but it increased the amount of risks traders took, compared with individuals with lower testosterone levels. While risk-taking can often pay off, that success will prompt the body to release even more testosterone. This feedback loop is known as the Winner Effect, and it’s a process that can result in extremely reckless behavior. This effect has been observed in animals, too. After a fight, the victorious male experiences a spike in testosterone, increasing his testosterone levels for the next fight, while the loser’s testosterone levels fall, causing him to avoid fights in the future. The high testosterone levels in the winner will, after a while, transform him. The French even have a name for this moment of transformation: “the hour between dog and wolf” – that hour where the light is so dim that we can’t know whether we’re safe or threatened. Transformed, the victor becomes overconfident and engages in reckless behavior. Animals’ high testosterone levels can lead them to win many of their battles, but, since they are more willing to take too dangerous of risks, they are also likely to die younger. Have you ever wondered how you’re able to catch a fast-moving ball so quickly and accurately, even when there’s little time to make a conscious effort? That’s because our brain anticipates such movements, since our physiology is too slow for us to see things in real time. Due to the structure of the human eye, we experience the external world with a delay of one-tenth of a second. This 100-millisecond delay between the throwing of a ball and our registering that movement means that the brain is forced to anticipate the position of the ball in mid-air. This phenomenon was demonstrated by an experiment in which participants were instructed to look at a screen that showed a circle made of two color bands – blue on the outside, yellow on the inside. The inner yellow circle, however, flashes on and off. Then, this blue-and-yellow circle is moved around the screen. But the observer doesn’t see a travelling blue-and-yellow circle; he sees a moving blue circle with a yellow one lagging behind. Why? Because the brain can anticipate the location of the blue circle, but can’t anticipate that of the flashing yellow one. This experiment demonstrates the way that the human brain anticipates the location of moving objects, rather than seeing that movement in real time. Also, since catching a ball and many other reactions are automatic, our consciousness appears to be a mere by-product of our actions. In the 1970s, physiologist Benjamin Libet performed an experiment in which he measured the electrical activity in his participants’ brains, and instructed them to lift one of their fingers. The participants’ brain region responsible for preparing the action of lifting a finger was active 300 milliseconds before the region responsible for making the decision to lift a finger was engaged. This suggests that conscious decisions come after our brain has prepared for an action. In other words, our consciousness acts much like a bystander, observing a decision already taken. Often, even if we cannot explain how we know something, we still somehow feel that it’s true. This is perhaps the reason that people tend to think of their intuition as a kind of supernatural gift. The fact is, however, that intuition is actually an effect of our body recognizing patterns in the environment. This kind of pattern recognition is particularly important in the cutthroat world of the stock exchange, where traders have to predict the ups and downs of the market. For, in fact – contrary to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which states that markets cannot be predicted at all – traders can learn to predict the market. The Efficient Market Hypothesis is a central principle in economics which argues that markets fluctuate upon the arrival of new information. Since news is by definition unpredictable, proponents of the hypothesis argue that markets must be equally unpredictable. However, if the Efficient Market Hypothesis is true, traders couldn’t make consistently more money than the stock market makes itself. The author tested the hypothesis by examining the Sharpe Ratio, a measure for success in the stock market, of experienced traders, and found it to be 2.5 times higher for them compared with less experienced traders. This shows that they were, on average, making more money than the stock market. Because the most skillful traders were those whose Sharpe Ratio had steadily increased over the years, the researchers concluded that predicting the stock market must be learnable. Yet traders themselves can’t explain how they beat the market; that’s because they depend on their intuition, which is influenced by their automatic physical reactions – or Somatic Markers. The traders can learn the patterns of the market environment subconsciously, because incoming information triggers an unconscious physical response. For example, when a trader considers his available options, his body might respond by tensing up in slightly different ways for each option. So, even though he might not consciously register these body memories, he’ll get a “hunch” and intuitively make the right trade. Even though we might think of stock market trading as an “office job,” the trading floor is often brimming with young, fit males – and often former athletes. Why? To be successful, stock market traders need to possess qualities such as high stamina, excellent concentration skills and a quickness in making trades. For example, traders often must engage in visuo-motor scanning as they survey the screens for – sometimes minute – price anomalies. It’s very taxing on our brain to engage in this kind of activity for a prolonged period, yet traders have to do it for hours at a time. Because this activity requires great concentration, being good at it depends heavily on physical fitness –  getting the right nutrients, enough sleep, and a range of other physiological factors. Traders must be quick, too. If they see a good trading opportunity, they have to pounce on it, since if another trader is quicker to purchase stock, this would cause the stock price to rise and would diminish their returns. Moreover, physical fitness gives traders a greater awareness of their bodies. Thus, they’ll likely be better at interpreting their bodies’ signals – the Somatic Markers – which, as we’ve seen, enable traders to predict patterns in the market, and leads to more reliable hunches on the trading floor. Indeed, in one study, researchers found that they could accurately measure people’s sensitivity to Somatic Markers with a “heartbeat awareness” test. Participants listened to a repetitive tone and were asked to indicate whether or not that tone was in synchrony with their heartbeat. The study showed that fit and well-trained people are better at accurately identifying synchrony than their overweight counterparts, leading some researchers to suggest that possession of this skill should be a prerequisite for the recruitment of traders. While traders are in the middle of a “bull market” – a market in which stock prices are rising – they can begin to feel that they can do no wrong. At first glance, this might seem to be a great situation for a trader to find himself in, but the truth is it can lead to both addiction and greater risk-taking. Just like gambling, risky trading can be addictive because it has the potential to increase our dopamine levels – a hormone associated with feelings of desire. In a study, rats were given one drop of juice which caused their dopamine levels to rise. When this was repeated for a while, the onset of the dopamine rise started before the rats were given the juice. Researchers concluded that the increased dopamine levels indicated that the rats were longing for the next drop. This process is a very similar one to that in drug addicts – and, as it happens, stock traders. When risky trades pay off, traders experience an extremely pleasant surge of dopamine, a rush that they want to experience again and again. As if the power of dopamine weren’t enough, when the hormone interacts with testosterone, traders become willing to take even greater risks. During bull markets or bubbles, testosterone – a hormone which increases risk taking – interacts with dopamine, because testosterone levels increase whenever dopamine surges through the brain. A trader’s testosterone level increases as a result of making a killing on a particular day, which leads him to experience the Winner Effect. This testosterone boost increases the effect of the dopamine in his system, so that every win feels even better than the last. These repeated wins will cause the trader’s testosterone to rise, making him even more willing to take greater risks on the trading floor. As you’d expect, this can easily turn into a vicious cycle, and when enough traders experience these, a market bubble can form. Whenever a big stock market crash occurs, the whole world is affected. And the stress that traders go through as a result of that crash makes it harder for them to regain control of the market. During a crash, traders’ bodies undergo a strong reaction. Among other stress responses, the hormone cortisol is released, significantly affecting the brain’s functioning. Over a short period, cortisol can energize us to escape a threatening situation, but if it’s distributed for a prolonged time, it becomes harmful. First, cortisol influences our memory negatively. Under the influence of cortisol, traders tend to remember their losses and bad trades more than their wins, which lowers their testosterone levels and makes them more risk averse. Second, it inhibits the frontal lobe, which is the brain region responsible for rational thought. Because traders become unable to think clearly, they’re prone to believing in rumors about the market. In turn, these rumors make them even more afraid to take risks. Additionally, the locus coeruleus, a brain region which helps us select the stimuli we want to attend to, starts firing incessantly. This makes it almost impossible for traders to distinguish the signals from the noise, thus making it harder to make good trades. These physiological effects can lead to irrational behavior in traders, causing them to miss worthwhile trades, therefore increasing the market’s volatility. What’s more, the effects of stress during a market crisis are further exacerbated in that traders start behaving in mean ways toward each other. According to Robert Sapolsky, who studies primates, it’s common for stressed-out dominant males to start bullying weaker males. The exact same thing happens on trading floors during a crisis. For instance, it’s typical for middle managers to fire employees even before layoffs are officially announced, or – perhaps even more stressful – to strongly hint at impending changes in the staff, making everyone fear for his or her job. As you’d expect, this leads to an increase in the traders’ anxiety, thus worsening the effects of their stress response. As we’ve seen, the human body’s stress response can lead people to make bad decisions. But, knowing this, is there something we can do to help minimize the impact of our physiology on our decisions? Even though our resilience is genetic, repeatedly putting ourselves under moderate stress can help to toughen us up. For instance, one study has shown that young rats that are handled by humans – a very stressful experience for the rats – exhibit fewer stress responses as adults, and they live up to 18 percent longer. However, the stressor has to be moderate. Major stressors, such as separation from the mother, actually have the opposite effect. Therefore, in the recruitment of traders, those candidates who’ve experienced moderate stress in their past might be preferable, because they’re likely to not be as easily stressed on the trading floor. Another stressor that can fortify us is physical exercise, especially if it involves being exposed to cold weather. Exercise releases what are known as “growth factors.” These help our neurons to keep growing, which strengthens our brain against stress and aging. One study found that rats that swim regularly in cold water respond more quickly and powerfully to negative stimuli; they have a better arousal response. When those same rats are exposed to stressors afterwards, they are tougher than their counterparts. Researchers have observed the same effect in humans and speculated that this is one reason for the development of the Nordic practice of a sauna followed by a cold shower. Of course, even the toughest traders can become mentally fatigued by stress.  However, if they’re able to freely switch between tasks, they’ll experience less stress and will thus make fewer mistakes. Many work-related illnesses and mistakes occur simply because employees are given no power of choice in the work that they do at any one time, and therefore what they should pay attention to. But, if employees are able to voluntarily switch tasks throughout the day, they complain less about fatigue and often feel rejuvenated after switching tasks. You might think it’s merely a cliche of Hollywood movies, but the fact is that trading floors are populated mostly by young men. Since testosterone levels are at their highest in young men, their behavior is also the most volatile in response to the hormone’s effects. The solution? Enforce diversity on the trading floors, as this would have a calming effect on the market. First, we should consider hiring older men, as this would lessen the impact of testosterone on the market. In males, testosterone levels rise until they are in their mid-twenties and after that point they fall gradually until stabilizing around the age of 50. This means that older men are less susceptible to the effects of testosterone, and less likely to respond in a volatile way on the trading floor. Despite this fact, trading floors are hostile to older traders because their reaction times are slower and their cautious attitude is interpreted as fear. However, famous investors like Warren Buffett or Benjamin Graham actually achieved their success later in life, showing that traits such as caution and slowness needn’t preclude success. Second, we should hire more female traders. Currently, women constitute only 5 percent of the trading floor’s population, but – like older men – they’re also less sensitive to the testosterone-induced market frenzies. One reason is that women have a vastly different biology from men, and naturally possess only 10 to 20 percent of males’ testosterone levels, making them far less prone to the hormone’s effect. For instance, women don’t experience escalating testosterone that occurs in males, such as during the Winner Effect. Another reason is that women have a different stress response than men. While they can experience the fight-or-flight response in moments of physical danger, they most often show the “tend-and-befriend” response. Originally, “tend and befriend” referred to the observation that females protect their offspring and seek out a group (by “befriending”) for mutual protection. Transferred to the workplace, it means that women respond to stress by being extra caring towards others. Think back to the last time you were going through a particularly stressful period. How would you have responded to the opportunity to take an exotic vacation? Most likely, you’d have thought that this was perfect timing: a change of scenery would do you good. However, you’d be wrong. When we’re stressed, novelty – even the pleasant kind – actually adds to our physiological stress load, and can even make us ill. In one study, psychologists asked a group of men about life-changing events in their lives – such as divorce or the death of someone close; but also more positive events, like weddings and childbirths. They found that all such events, even the ones we tend to think of as positive, lead to an increased risk of illness and mortality. Why? The researchers believe that the novelty of changed living circumstances adds to our physiological load and makes us sick. Therefore, it’s best not to take an exotic vacation if you’re already under stress, as the novelty of the place will simply increase it – even though you might not feel that increase immediately. What we really need in times of stress is not novelty, but familiarity. However, it’s sometimes impossible to avoid putting ourselves in novel circumstances. In such situations, one way to decrease stress levels is to attain a sense of control. As one study showed, patients in pain suffer even more if they’re uncertain of when they’ll receive their next pain medication, or if they can’t administer it themselves. Doctors who allow patients to have some degree of control over their pain medication reported that those patients required less medication in general. One possible explanation for this effect is that being in control reduces stress, which in turn minimizes the experience of pain. So, when patients gain a little control over an otherwise difficult situation, they feel less pain and actually need less medication. The key message in this book: The behavior of traders in the stock market isn’t rational. Rather, it’s largely influenced by the trader’s physiology, such as hormone levels and the body’s muscle memory. Both during market bubbles and crashes, hormones like testosterone and dopamine have a great impact on traders’ behavior, and therefore a destabilizing effect on the markets. Diversifying the gender and ages of people on trading floors would have a stabilizing effect on the stock market.

And what makes this time so interesting? The prevalence of data. Today, data is the raw material, and it can be processed and used to create new industries or revolutionize old ones. The industries that thrive – the industries of the future – will create opportunities for new jobs and businesses, and make it possible for developing nations to transition smoothly into the new information age. But with these developments come new challenges. For instance, how to use big data and create jobs for people displaced by technology? Let’s dive right in. In these blinks, you’ll discover why people in Kenya prefer to transfer money by text message; how cloud computing will make robots the preferred type of labor; and why Estonia is called e-Estonia. Can you remember your first job? For lots of people, their entry into the job market was at a cafe or a restaurant, waiting tables or serving coffee. But in the future, such jobs might not even be available. That’s because the introduction of cloud computing has enabled robots to do the work of humans. For instance, advances in cloud robotics – robots’ ability to upload experiences to the cloud and learn from the experiences of all other robots – mean that robots can now learn and grow faster than ever before. As a result, robots are going to be capable of completing new tasks. In fact, an Oxford University study found that 47 percent of all US jobs are at great risk of being done by robots in the next two decades. For instance, the car service Uber runs a research lab that is building an automated taxi-fleet and Google’s research lab, Google X has been working on a driverless car project for six years! But why would we want to replace human workers with robots? Well, robots can service more people at lower prices. That’s because, unlike humans, who are cheap to hire but costly to keep on staff, robots don’t get paid a salary or take vacations. In fact, they can work all the time. Just consider SEDASYS, a robotics system that oversees the sedation of surgery patients. Without SEDASYS, an anesthesiologist can only monitor one operation at a time, and his presence adds $2,000 to the cost of the operation. With SEDASYS, however, a single anesthesiologist can simultaneously oversee ten operations, and his efforts only add $150 per operation. However, the value produced by robots isn’t going to be equally distributed. Therefore, governments need to do something about the income people will lose. In fact, most of the savings made possible by robots will go straight to the big corporations that produce them. That means it’s up to governments to redistribute part of those savings into things like social-safety nets, education and skills training for the labor force displaced by robots. In the early 2000s, the human genome – that is, all of the information encoded within human DNA – was sequenced for the first time. The project cost $2.7 billion, but, since then, technological advances in genomics, the field of genome sequencing, have cut the cost of sequencing to around $1,000. But why is genomics important? Well, a better understanding of the human genome will mean better prevention and treatment of disease in general and cancer in particular. Cancer is the result of mutated DNA, which malfunctions, failing to stop the growth of unhealthy cells. With advances in technology, doctors will be able to find, and hopefully prevent, this growth earlier. For instance, a new blood sample test known as a liquid biopsy lets technicians identify even the smallest pieces of cancer DNA in a blood sample. This makes it possible to discover a tumor that’s 1 percent the size of those an MRI can find. This new technology will mean that 47 percent of cancers can be detected while they are still stage 1. This is a huge advance. For instance, ovarian cancers have a 95-percent cure rate when in stage 1. But the present technology tends to detect such cancers at stage 3 or 4, when chances of curing the patient are just 5 percent. New medical technology in the developing world will mean something even more essential: connecting people to the fundamentals of health care. For instance, mobile communications are now present throughout Africa, but the number of doctors is quite low, standing at just 0.2 doctors per 1,000 people in Kenya. Seeing this discrepancy, smartphone-based programs could be developed to connect patients with doctors and other specialized health-care workers who could then respond to medical questions, deliver diagnoses and check-ups and monitor the progress of treatment. In fact, EyeNetra has produced a small plastic lens that can be attached to a smartphone and, when combined with an app, diagnose vision problems and prescribe the necessary corrective lenses. This obviates the need for a long trip to an optometrist and makes expensive machines redundant. Nearly every person has the same routine before leaving the house: cell phone, wallet, keys. But pretty soon, you’ll only need two of those essential items. That’s because current methods of payment are hurting business, a fact that’s bound to change. For instance, credit-card technology is not only complicated, but it sucks up a huge percentage of retail profits. After all, most internet companies maintain profit margins of around 5 percent and about half of that gets paid out to credit card companies or service providers. For example, companies pay monthly statement fees, monthly minimum fees, gateway fees and transaction fees of between 2 and 5 percent per transaction. Seem like a lot of information? Well, MasterCard’s policy on interchange fees is over 100 pages long! Furthermore, since most countries have low access to banking systems, people tend to rely on alternative forms of payment. In fact, in most low-income countries, simply setting up a bank account is a seriously difficult task and securing a credit card is just about impossible. That’s why Kenya developed an alternative that has since spread to 45 other countries. It’s called M-Pesa and it’s a payment system that uses mobile phones. It allows anyone with a SIM card to transfer money by sending a text. And it really caught on. In fact, about 25 percent of Kenya’s GDP moves through M-Pesa. But the best part is that it works internationally, an essential feature, since approximately $40 billion per year is sent back to Africa by workers living abroad. However, such systems are just the beginning. Technology is going to push payment to even greater heights as encrypted currencies, like Bitcoin, gain more steam. Here’s how they work: Such alternative money technologies send encrypted messages that make for easier, faster payments. That kind of access means anyone can set up shop and charge for services. For instance, Airbnb and Uber are great examples of how business is becoming more distributed and local. And encrypted digital money is so safe that it can even be used to purchase a home! It used to be that parents who wanted their kids to secure a steady career would tell them to go to medical school. Today, however, being a doctor isn’t as appealing as some other professions, such as cybersecurity. Here’s why: More and more data is collected and stored every day. In fact, as soon as a kid is handed a smartphone, they begin leaving a lifelong trail of data. Indeed, there are now private corporations that specialize in data collection and maintain around 75,000 individual data points about the average American consumer! And with the Internet of Things – that is, the online network of normal objects like toasters and fridges and cars – this number is only going to spike. The problem is that once we create data, we have no say in how or by whom it is used. Not just that, but some companies who focus on targeted marketing sell extremely sensitive data. For instance, a company from Illinois sold lists of rape and domestic violence victims, as well as HIV/AIDS patients, to pharmaceutical companies at the bargain rate of just $79 per 1,000 names. So, since it’s almost impossible to control your data, you need to be clear about what data you’re making available. And that goes for individuals, companies and governments alike, because all three are prone to cyber attacks. In fact, banks, energy companies, air traffic control systems and just about every business that exchanges information depends on data technology. This reality makes such operations prime targets for criminals and enemies. Further complicating things, the internet has no borders, which means there are no clear jurisdictions that help mediate disputes between states. Naturally, all this data, and the potential for its destructive use, produces a serious demand for experts in the field of cybersecurity. OK, so now you know the future is cybersecurity, but does that mean other careers will be irrelevant? Actually, tech workers will always need the support of other professions. Big data analysis is just one part of the equation. For instance, data analytics produces insights by analyzing huge quantities of data from both the present moment and the past. The result is the streamlining of existing processes and access to information on an unprecedented scale. Just take the combination of satellite-gathered weather information with ground-based sensors that measure water and air quality, nitrogen levels and other environmental conditions. This pairing enables one to find the exact right mixture of fertilizer, water and customized seeds to plant every square meter of soil. Such precision agriculture will help farmers grow more food while emitting less pollution, which is our best option for solving world hunger. It’s also essential, however, that big-data technology and cheaper sensors team up with expert knowledge in each field – and that’s where other professionals come in. Here’s why: To apply technology most successfully it’s essential for someone to be on the ground with the requisite expertise in the field. For instance, Pasture Meter is a technique of precision agriculture that originated in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand. It employs advanced sensor technology to take 200 measurements a second, determining how much grass exists in a given field and how the cattle can be best distributed. So, while it’s unlikely that anybody in Silicon Valley would think that watching grass grow could be a profitable business, the farmers of New Zealand, home to twice as many cattle as people, had an inside perspective. In fact, in part due to Pasture Meter, New Zealand’s beef sales to China have climbed by nearly 487 percent in just one year. They’re even outselling their much larger neighbor, Australia. So, big data could mean major improvements for the industries of tomorrow. But what can be done to ensure that these improvements are actually made? Fostering an open society. That means physical openness, like strong infrastructure, but also virtual openness, like a rapid and uncensored internet, as well as economical openness, like reduced tariffs on trade. For instance, in 2000, Estonia declared access to the internet a human right. As a result of their widespread use of the internet, strong infrastructure and limited regulations on all types of services, they’ve earned themselves the nickname e-Estonia. In fact, the country even offers e-citizenship to foreigners, providing them equal civil rights and making it easy to conduct business with the country from across the globe. An open society also means encouraging innovation by giving more authority and money to young people with big ideas. Born in the digital age, the young people of today are often more open to new ideas and take greater innovative risks. For instance, in many traditional cultures like Japan, it takes decades for young people to reach the level of authority they need to fund their ideas. This hinders innovation. After all, it’s no coincidence that Google, Facebook, Oracle, Microsoft and loads of other information-technology giants were founded by entrepreneurs in their twenties. But not only young people need to be empowered; women do, too. In fact, giving women more power is not merely a matter of ethics; it’s good economics as well. Countries that suppress women’s rights are, in essence, depriving themselves of half their workforce. For instance, during the reconstruction following Rwanda’s horrific 1994 genocide, gender equality became central. The reforms resulted in women being able to register as landowners, which increased registrations by 20 percent and decreased the number of impoverished women by 20 percent. Furthermore, between 2001 and 2013, the country’s GDP rose by eight percent per year! As a result, Rwanda is currently the only country in the world with a female majority in its parliament. The key message in this book: The importance of data has grown considerably, and the way we use it will have a major impact on the future of the economy and society. Big-data analytics spurs innovation. However, it will also significantly change the job market and the security of our everyday lives. Actionable advice: Have a “data talk” with your kids.  These days, it’s essential for children to be educated about data, privacy and online security. So, it’s important to sit down with your kids and explain how their online actions today may have affect their lives tomorrow. While it’s impossible to control everything your children do – on- or offline – you can help them learn the risks associated with putting their data out there and teach them to make wise decisions on their own.

Womack, Daniel T. Jones and Daniel Roos","summary":"“The car in front is a Toyota.” Do you remember this famous ad slogan from the 1990s? For decades Japanese car manufacturer Toyota has maintained its solid reputation for innovation and quality. The company’s cars sell well worldwide, being valued for both their efficiency and reliability.  A cornerstone of its successful global business is Toyota’s legendary production system, called TPS – more commonly known as lean production. In fact, this production method became so successful that it has since been adopted in other industries, such as design, programming and start-up management. These blinks give you the inside scoop on how lean production came to be and explain in detail how this system helped skyrocket Toyota to global success.  In these blinks, you’ll also learn why Toyota constantly (and purposefully) nearly runs out of stock; why every Toyota employee can stop a production line; and why many car companies prefer to ignore mistakes than fix them. The automobile industry has grown tremendously since the early days of the “horseless carriage,” first patented by Karl Benz in 1886.  There’s good reason the automobile industry is often called the “industry of industries.” In 2014 alone, some 90 million cars and commercial vehicles were produced. The automobile industry as a whole represents the world’s largest manufacturing activity. Let’s look at how this came to be.  In its early days, the auto industry was defined by craft production, meaning that highly skilled engineers and manufacturers tailored each individual car to a customer’s taste. This was slow and expensive, thus few people could afford cars – and only some 1,000 vehicles were produced yearly.  Only luxury cars are produced via craft production today. In general, the industry has moved to mass production. Inspired by Henry Ford, this change came about at the end of the twentieth century.  Henry Ford simply sought to produce more cars in less time. He realized he could achieve this by designing cars with the same, interchangeable parts and producing the parts separately, instead of working on a whole car at once.  The development of the assembly line further accelerated the manufacturing process. An early assembly line was a moving belt with workers stationed at different spots along it; each worker performed one or two simple tasks, over and over again. These basic tasks didn’t require highly specialized skills, and in fact, many assembly-line workers were immigrants who spoke little English.  The automatization of the production process meant that cars were no longer customized (or were customized very little), but instead offered a great advantage: any person could drive or even repair them, just by following a standard 150-page manual! With the innovation of mass production, a flood of cheaply produced American cars were sold worldwide. By the early 1930s, some 32 million vehicles were in use globally, and 90 percent of those were American.  Most of these vehicles were made by three leading US companies, known as the Big Three: Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. Henry Ford’s assembly-line process dominated the automobile industry for about 50 years, but this gradually changed as European companies began to compete; Germany founded Volkswagen, France Renault and Italy Fiat. As the European companies made inroads, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors began to lose their leadership positions – and even the assembly-line production process grew outdated. The problem was that mass production followed strict rules and offered little reward to workers who performed the line’s boring, repetitive tasks. As you might expect, employment turnover was high.  An assembly line was also practically unstoppable, as each process depended on the next, and time was always tight. So if a worker found a problem, he might not report it, as it was simpler to just send the defective part on down the line.  Moreover, an assembly-line manager’s performance was measured by the number of cars the line produced, so workers were essentially incentivized to ignore flaws to meet overall quotas. Mistakes were caught and repaired – in a space called the rework area – once a car had come off the assembly line. Sometimes an entire vehicle would have be taken apart and rebuilt, a costly and tedious process that caused delays. With so many moving parts to examine, even rework area employees couldn’t catch every problem, and many defective cars were sold as a result. Mass production as a process waxed and waned with companies in the United States and Europe, but it never really took hold in Japan. This was partly because demand in the Japanese automobile market was more diverse. In the United States and Europe, a majority of the market sought cheaper cars; yet in Japan, the market was broader, with more particular demands.  Politicians wanted luxury cars, farmers and entrepreneurs needed small trucks and goods sellers wanted larger trucks for transporting wares. People who lived in crowded cities wanted smaller cars that would use less oil. Thus, the one-size-fits-all vehicles produced in the West weren’t practical for the Japanese market.  Nonetheless, between 1925 and 1936, America’s Big Three dominated the Japanese market, producing some 200,000 vehicles yearly. (Japanese companies produced about 12,000.)  But the foreign influence was intentionally limited. In 1936, the Japanese government passed the Automobile Manufacturing Industry Law, which pushed American firms and their mass production techniques out of the Japanese market.  The process of mass production also wasn’t suited to the makeup of the Japanese workforce. Unlike the United States and Europe, Japan didn’t have an immigrant or “guest worker” labor class, and thus companies struggled to find low-income workers willing to do the boring, repetitive tasks required by assembly line production.  Japanese employment in general was based on long-term contracts, another barrier to the success of assembly-line manufacturing. In the hierarchical Japanese workforce, if an employee quit his job and joined another company, he had to start over at the bottom of the career ladder, even if he had accrued 20 years of experience elsewhere.  Thus once an employee started with a company, he preferred to stick with it, which left little flexibility in the workforce for the demands of assembly-line manufacturing.  In 1937, the Toyoda family founded the Toyota Motor Company. Concerned that the family name sounded too traditional (it means “abundant rice field” in Japanese), they exchanged the “d” for a “t” to create Toyota. Success didn’t come easy; by the end of the 1940s Toyota already had laid off a large portion of its workforce. But things changed when two Toyota engineers, Taichii Ohno and Eiji Toyoda, paid a visit to the Ford Rouge Factory in Michigan. Ohno and Toyoda studied Ford’s mass production techniques to see if they could make use of them back home. They soon realized that Ford’s process wasn’t ideally suited for the Japanese market, as it couldn’t produce a wide enough variety of vehicles. They also found some inefficiencies, places where both time and resources were lost.  So Ohno and Toyoda came up with what they thought was a better process for manufacturing cars, calling it the Toyota Production System, or TPS.  TPS was essentially based on the values of what we today call lean production: continuous improvement (in Japanese, kaizen) and a respect for customers and employees.  The Japanese idea of kaizen holds that processes are never perfect, and can always be improved. This concept clashes with the assembly line process, which values continuous production above all else.  In TPS, production is halted each and every time an error is identified; the system is then reexamined and refined. This is part of the reason that Toyota cars, even today, are renowned for their safety.  Importantly, TPS doesn’t just concern itself with customers’ well-being but also ensures the company respects its employees and business partners, too.  Toyota also offers on-the-job development programs to help employees climb the company’s career ladder. Such programs build workforce loyalty and help lift everyone up in the long run. Toyota’s lean principles remain influential across the globe, even today, and not just in the automobile industry. What is it that makes this process so successful? Lean production works well largely because it’s aimed at eliminating mistakes. Assembly lines, on the other hand, are focused on production output, so mistakes are easily overlooked.  Perfection is the goal for lean production. An ideal lean-production process doesn’t produce any flaws, leave excess stock or impose constraints on innovation.  Realistically, no lean-production system has ever reached complete perfection and none probably ever will, but such systems generate much better long-term results.  The lean principle of reducing waste, for example, has enabled Toyota to spend more working hours focusing on innovation. The company keeps each of its car models in production for an average of four years; in contrast, Western companies produce a car model for an average of ten years.  Lean principles also utilize the best features of both craft production and mass production.  Lean automobile production focuses on a buyer’s demands, just like craft production. The production process is based on what a customer wants, which reduces costs and prevents overproduction. Toyota is always readjusting its market goals. The company keeps track of customers and their income levels, family size and driving preferences. Then it tailors its production output to customers’ specific needs. Yet mass production methods can’t do this. Such systems produce as many cars as possible, and sometimes, there aren’t enough customers to buy them.  In the 1980s, the lean-production system finally triumphed and Japanese manufacturers overtook their American counterparts. Toyota is still the largest car manufacturer in the world today. With mass production, workers are little more than cogs in the machine. Their only responsibility is to perform the same simple tasks, over and over. That’s not how Toyota works. The company highly values the welfare of its employees. That’s why two of the company’s core values relate to employee happiness: teamwork and personal respect.  Toyota employees are guaranteed a lifetime of valuable employment. Salaries and bonuses increase with employee experience and company profitability. Workers also have access to Toyota's extensive facilities, such as housing and recreational areas.  Toyota ensures that its employees’ professional development never stops, from their first day at work (usually around age 18) until retirement. Employees are encouraged to improve their skills and given access to training, seminars and lectures.  This system benefits both sides: employees have greater job satisfaction, and the company has more knowledgeable and motivated workers.  The system also allows Toyota to give employees more responsibility. Employees are placed in teams and led by a team leader, and are tasked with overseeing parts of the production line.  The whole team works together to make the process more efficient, instead of a leader simply barking orders to subordinates. So if one team attaches car wheels, the team can freely experiment until it finds the most effective way. The leader helps to coordinate, rather than command.  If a team comes up with a larger-scale idea for improving a process (like a new way of repairing wheels, for example) it can share its ideas with company engineers in quality circles. What’s more efficient: Rushing haphazardly to finish your work or working more carefully, correcting mistakes as you go? Toyota executives would choose the second option.  In the lean-production process, workers keep an eye out for problems and investigate the roots of errors when they are brought to light. Production is paused when a mistake is found, and the power to pause production isn’t limited to managers or supervisors; any team member can do it.  Once a mistake is identified, it is analyzed so a team can prevent the error from happening again. This process is guided by The 5 Whys. If an employee notices a loose wheel, for example, he should ask, “Why is this wheel loose?” Perhaps the answer might be that it’s missing a bolt. So the next question should be, “Why is the bolt missing?” Maybe the bolt is missing because the assembly team wasn’t given the correct number of bolts. Thus the next question: “Why wasn’t the assembly team given the right supplies?” Here, perhaps the wrong supplies were ordered. Now the team should ask, “Why did that happen?” This series leads the team to the root cause: maybe the instructions for placing orders are out of date. Once the problem is solved, the production process can be resumed.  The 5 Whys approach ensures the quality of a final product, and also makes the overall process more efficient in the long run. When a team eliminates the root of a mistake, the mistake is less likely to reoccur in the future. Thanks to this process, Toyota’s cars have fewer defects than any other cars in the world.  When Toyota first started with its process, the production line was stopped often. Yet with time, the process worked out most of its kinks and became smoother and more efficient. Today, Toyota’s lines almost never have to be stopped and its plants have virtually no rework areas.  While Toyota’s own production process is based on lean principles, how does this affect its supply chain? A lean supply chain is based on the kanban system, which aims to produce only the exact amount of products that customers want. This means that car models and other products need to be constantly evolving to suit changing customer needs.  The kanban system also means that companies need to keep supply stocks low. If the company has a large inventory of wheels for Model X, for example, the wheels become useless when the company shifts to Model Z.  The kanban system utilizes a delivery system called just in time, meaning that supplies are only ordered and received just before they’re needed. So Toyota plants don’t keep a stash of car seats, for example. A plant will contact a supplier five hours before a car is ready for its seats, to make sure the plant only orders the exact quantity it needs.  Because of this Toyota has little waste, but it also means it doesn’t have much of a safety net if it or its suppliers are hit with an unexpected delay, like a natural disaster or a labor strike. If faced with such a situation, the company deals with it in two ways: First, Toyota makes sure its assembly plants are flexible, so team leaders can switch stations and cover for absent workers if necessary. Second, the company design each plant to serve more than one market. If there’s a big change in market demand, a variety of plants can be mobilized to address it.  All in all, Toyota is expert at identifying potential threats to its supply chain and developing strategies for any problems that arise. The key message in this book: Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile industry with the invention of the assembly line, but nonetheless his process was inefficient and flawed. Since mass-production systems weren’t suited to the Japanese labor market, Japanese auto manufacturer Toyota developed its own system to improve upon Ford’s early innovation. This “lean production” system was so effective that it eventually spread to other industries. Lean production is one of the reasons Toyota still leads the global automobile market, even today.

Often seen as an unskilled work, waiters and anyone else working in customer service are in fact using an essential skill we don’t often think about: managing feelings. But this emotional labor implies more than simply keeping one’s cool, not getting upset or holding back an untimely snicker in everyday situations; it is a matter of actively invoking feelings, understanding your own feelings and those of the people around you, as well as the societal rules that affect them. Let’s take a closer look at how this works and why it has so often been overlooked. In these blinks, you’ll find out how feelings signal what is hidden within us; why women do more emotional labor than men; and how feelings can be a bit like money. From baristas to flight attendants to supermarket cashiers, we expect service with a smile from workers across many industries. But as anyone who’s worked in a customer-facing job knows, faking a friendly attitude all day long is difficult, to say the least. And yet, it’s one of those job requirements that’s so ubiquitous, employers rarely think to name it. Sociologists studying the world of work, on the other hand, call this emotional labor. Emotional labor is when we consciously manage our feelings to ensure they’re appropriate for a particular commercial or social setting. The work done by flight attendants is a powerful example of emotional labor. During their training, flight attendants are taught to smile “genuinely,” emphasizing that this outward display of a good mood can’t appear forced. Attendants must be warm and cheerful when serving food and drinks to passengers. A charming “How are you doing today?” is part of the service, too. Small talk and smiles might seem trivial, but when they aren’t there, we notice. Without the emotional work that flight attendants put in, many passengers would consider their service inadequate. Another profession where emotional labor plays a central role is, of course, acting. On stage, an actor demonstrates his talent by creating the illusion of experiencing emotions that aren’t his own, that he has perhaps never even felt. However, there’s a crucial difference between the emotional labor of actors and flight attendants: while theater involves emotional labor in the pursuit of art, the flight industry’s emotional labor policies are engineered by corporations that, above all, want to make a profit. When you feel sad, excited or bored, your emotions don’t just reflect your current mood – they’re also powerful signals that reveal what the people and things in our lives mean to us. Let’s illustrate this with an example. Say, for instance, a university student agrees to host a party with an old friend from high school. Soon, though, they find themselves dreading the thought of it. Why? Because, deep down, they just don’t want to be associated with their old friend anymore. So, the student decides to cancel the party the day before. She knows it’s a selfish move but, for some reason, doesn’t feel that guilty about it. She mostly just feels relief, which is a signal that the friendship wasn’t so important in her life anyway. This disconnect between how we feel and how we know we should feel shows that there are rules for which emotions we should have, and when. When we feel guilty about our emotions, it’s because our feelings go against what we’ve been taught to feel. This also happens when we find ourselves feeling too much or too little. Imagine you’re seeing off your boyfriend at the airport before he flies to India for a month. He’s tearfully saying goodbye to you, while you’re trying to force yourself to show an appropriate amount of sadness to match his. This might be difficult if you actually feel excited at the prospect of your newfound alone time! In these situations, there’s a good reason why we force ourselves to create the illusion of feeling emotions that we don’t. We know that if we don’t display the appropriate emotion, we could be scolded or shunned by the other person. Comments like “You should be grateful, considering all I’ve done for you,” or “Aren’t you excited about this party?” reflect these kinds of sentiments. Emotional labor and social rules regarding feelings play central roles in our lives. But feelings are also subject to another factor – interpersonal exchange.  Have you ever done a favor for a friend and felt like they should have shown a little more gratitude? In our society, feelings are often exchanged as gifts or forms of payments. Let’s explore this with another example. Say a new intern needs help with a task and seeks advice from a more experienced colleague. Afterward, the intern might “pay” for the expert’s time and wisdom with a comment like “Thanks so much Sarah! I really appreciate it; I know how busy you are right now.” By doing this, he acknowledges that he isn’t really “worth” the expert’s time, and compensates for this by giving them an ego boost. In the end, both parties profit from an exchange like this. But exchange rates fluctuate. If the expert constantly spends time helping out the intern, her own work may suffer. She’ll need more time to catch up, and the help and advice she shares will become more and more expensive – a flattering comment just won’t cut it anymore. The intern, as a result, feels pressure to make his feeling-gifts more extreme, whether this means taking the blame for a mistake made by the expert, or feeling compelled to keep a friendly demeanor even when the expert abuses him verbally. Ultimately, those in power receive more emotional rewards. For those with little power, on the other hand, emotional labor is an unavoidable aspect of their lives. Strangely enough, those on the receiving end of such flattering behavior often believe that it’s simply a part of their employees’ personality. But this isn’t true – it’s all just part of the exchange. Think back to your childhood. Which of your parents took more responsibility for things like organizing your playdates, purchasing gifts and remembering friends’ and family members’ birthdays? In most cases, the answer is our mother. How come? In terms of power, status and independent access to money, women are generally less well off. For example, statistics from 1980 show that around 50 percent of American men received an annual salary over $15,000 – as opposed to only 6 percent of women. While the situation has of course improved since then, inequality still exists between men and women. Since women find it more difficult to obtain independent financial status, their ability to manage feelings becomes a financial asset. For instance, women often find themselves straining to remain pleasant and friendly while handling their repressed aggression. To demonstrate this, researchers at UCLA conducted a study that surveyed whether people deliberately used emotions to get what that they wanted. They found that 45 percent of women did this, as opposed to just 20 percent of men. One woman put it this way: “I pout, frown and say something to make the other person feel bad, such as ‘You don’t love me, you don’t care what happens to me.’ I’m not the type to come right out with what I want; I’ll usually hint around.” In day-to-day life, women find themselves doing far more interpersonal labor than men. This labor includes things like listening patiently and enthusiastically, giving advice and generally nurturing others. Many see these activities as just another part of being a woman. But the reality is that women need to do these things in order to make up for their inherent disadvantage when it comes to power and status. This is shown in workplaces, where emotionally laborious jobs cover half of the jobs done by women, but only a quarter of those done by men. So far, we’ve looked at the way in which women do more emotional labor than men. But what are the effects of such an imbalance on the women doing this additional labor? First of all, women find that their opinions are more quickly ignored or rejected than men’s. One reason for this is that the feelings that women carefully manage are taken to be involuntary or uncontrollable – think of the way good actors don’t seem like they’re acting at all. Generally, in situations when people fail to manage their emotions, women are taken less seriously than men. For instance, when a woman loses her temper, others are likely to think that she is being illogical or unreasonable. On the other hand, when a man loses his temper, it is often seen as an expression of a strong, rational belief. We can see this clearly in the credence that doctors give their patients depending on their gender. One study found that doctors are more likely to take men’s claims seriously than women’s. When patients of both genders complained of back or chest pain, headaches and fatigue, more medical service was given to men than women. This shows how women are generally less likely to be taken seriously. Women also face the problem of having to balance emotional labor with wielding authority. In many jobs, women are expected to do emotional labor to make customers feel good – but they’re also expected to uphold certain rules and guidelines. These two expectations can conflict with each other. For instance, airplane passengers are required to follow a number of strict rules; it is the flight attendant’s job to uphold these rules, as well as to interact on an emotional level with passengers. But women have a harder time enforcing these rules, because passengers take them less seriously as a result of the emotional labor they perform. The key message in this book: Although emotional labor is a central aspect of many of our jobs, it often goes unacknowledged. This is a problem for women in particular, who, due to traditional gender roles and power dynamics, are expected to perform more emotional labor. By learning about the various forms of emotional labor that exist, we can get better at recognizing the role it plays in our everyday lives.  Actionable Advice: Ask yourself who you’re complaining to. The next time you’re frustrated with a delayed bus or a lousy product, take a step back and think about who you’re complaining to. Ever notice that it’s usually the women in our lives who are on the receiving end of our frustrated rants? Consider the emotional labor you’re putting them through and remember that they’re expected to deal with far more of it than men. Got feedback?

Are you wondering why, in any organization you care to look at, managers and bureaucrats are multiplying left, right and center? If you are, then rest assured. You’re not paranoid; you’re just living through the managerial revolution. Join us as we discover why society and the economy are changing so drastically, as seen through the prescient eyes of James Burnham during World War Two. Discover why capitalism is in a downward spiral, and whether communism has a hope of replacing it as our economic structure. As power passes from the hands of one ruling class to another, get to know the individuals truly driving society, and those who are disproportionately benefiting from everything it produces. In an unpredictable world riven with conflict, the insights in these blinks into capitalism, socialism and mechanisms of social dominance are just as relevant now as they were when first published in 1941. Read on to discover what Russian history can teach us about the world of tomorrow; why all your assumptions about capitalism are wrong; and how the changing role of managers in business and government is transforming society. At the time when the author was writing, the dawn of a new era seemed inevitable. Society seemed to be transitioning from one type to another – from a capitalist society to a managerial one. But before we can understand what this new world would look like, we must take a close look at capitalism. Since the end of the Middle Ages, capitalism has been the dominant political and economic structure in both the United States and much of Europe. But what are the defining features of a capitalist society? The first important characteristic of capitalism relates to production. In a capitalist society, each of the produced goods, whether their purpose is to feed or entertain us, is viewed as a commodity. This means that everything has a monetary value or price. From houses to gold to a person’s labor – everything in a capitalist society is looked at from the point of view of its monetary exchange value rather than its ability to satisfy any actual need. Secondly, under capitalism, money plays a crucial second function in the economy, separate from its role as a medium of exchange. Namely, money is used as capital. In a capitalist society, money can be transformed into machines, raw materials and labor, which can make products. These products are then sold, thereby retranslating the initial capital into money again. In other words, under capitalism, money makes money. Another defining feature of capitalist society is that the production of goods is carried out for profit. For example, what determines whether a shoe factory can continue to produce shoes is not whether local children are going barefoot, but whether the shoes can be sold at a profit on the market. Finally, under capitalism, people can be broadly separated into two social classes. One class is composed of the individuals who own the instruments of production, such as factories, machines and railroads, and who hire others to operate these means of production. These individuals are known as capitalists and their ownership of the instruments of production, as well as their ability to give themselves a bigger share of the resulting products, makes them the ruling class. The second class of citizens in a capitalist society are usually referred to as the proletariat or the workers. These are the people who sell their labor to the owners, do not own any of the instruments of production themselves, and who typically receive a smaller, unequal share of the products. You probably see all these aspects of capitalism in society today, but will they still be around tomorrow? When the author was writing in 1941, the Second World War was raging, and mass unemployment had been on the rise in the United States and Western Europe for several years. It was a time of unbelievable change and upheaval. Yet, despite these enormous challenges, many people steadfastly believed that the capitalist system would survive intact. But this belief in the continuation of capitalist society was based on two assumptions, both of which are wrong. The first assumption is that society has always had a capitalist structure and thus always will. But in fact, society has only been capitalist for a tiny period of history. The organization of society along capitalist lines only began in the fourteenth century, and it wasn’t until much later that capitalism started to dominate. The second assumption is that capitalism has some essential association with our intrinsic “human nature.” But this is also a fallacy. In the course of history, human nature has adapted itself to numerous types of society, and many of these different scenarios have endured for a lot longer than capitalism has so far. On the contrary, there were sound reasons to think that capitalism would soon falter. At the time the author was writing, unemployment within the capitalist nations was skyrocketing. Significantly, continuous mass unemployment has been seen before in history. In fact, it’s often occurred as a particular type of social organization is about to end. For instance, mass unemployment existed among the poor during the final years of Classical Athens, among urban workers in the Roman Empire, and at the close of the Middle Ages, when serfs were banished from the land en masse to make way for the first capitalists. Mass unemployment signals that a particular type of social organization has broken down and that it can no longer provide its citizens with socially useful roles. Furthermore, such a society doesn’t have the resources to support these unemployed masses. Consequently, the unemployed linger on the edge of society like a stone around its neck, while also serving as a perpetual irritant and dangerous reservoir of force that could clash with society at large. Given the false assumptions surrounding people’s belief that capitalism will continue, and the very real evidence from history that suggest it won’t – it seems highly likely that a big societal change is on the cards. But what sort of change? For some people, a communist society with egalitarian principles sounds like a utopian dream. For others, communism, with its ban on private property, sounds like a nightmare. But one thing unites many experts at both ends of the political spectrum: a belief that, for better or worse, capitalism is about to lose its grip on Western society, and communism will take its crown. But are they right? Communism refers to a society which is classless and fully democratic in nature. In contrast to capitalism, private ownership of the instruments of production is strictly forbidden.   Despite this, communism is highly unlikely to spread to England, France or the United States any time soon. Why? Because a quick look at the only supposedly communist regime in the world tells us just how difficult it is to implement this type of social structure. For instance, despite the fact that the Soviets had indeed abolished all private property rights, and all of its means of production were in the hands of the state, this did not bring about a classless society. On the contrary, the Russian state’s seizure of private property and rejection of capitalism actually made Russian society more class-bound than ever before. For instance, an article by Leon Trotsky in 1939, based on statistics published in the Soviet press, found that the top 11 percent of the Soviet population received roughly 50 percent of the national income. Ironically, this wealth disparity was more extreme than in the United States, where the top 10 percent of the population took 35 percent of the national income. Additionally, Russia’s experiment in communism has shown that full democracy and freedom for all citizens, which is also a hallmark of a proper communist society, is not easy to achieve. In the early days of the Russian revolution, there was a measure of freedom and democracy: workers were given the right to form trade unions, and factors such as discrimination within the educational system and fancy uniforms were eliminated. In later years, however, every aspect of freedom and democracy was expunged from Russian society. Political opposition parties were banned, institutions and organizations were wholly without rights, and outward marks of class distinction, such as uniforms, were once more on show. The abject failure of Russia’s revolution just goes to show that a true communist society, rather than being just around the corner, is almost impossible to implement in practice. So if, from the author’s perspective, the modern world wasn’t heading for communism, and capitalism seemed to be in its death throes, just what new society were we transitioning to? So if the modern world was not heading for a communist regime, and capitalism seemed unlikely to remain the dominant social structure, what would the future look like according to the author in 1941? The answer seemed clear: the transition that was about to happen was from a capitalist society to a managerial one. Those in charge of making decisions about how the means of production were used – the managers – would gain most. In other words, the world seemed on the cusp of a managerial revolution. The author asserts that after this transition period, a new stratum known as managers would achieve social dominance and take over from the capitalists as the ruling class in society. Furthermore, this transition would take place worldwide and was already underway to a greater or lesser extent in different countries. The economic framework by which the managers would become socially dominant would be based upon the state’s ownership of the major instruments of production, such as factories and railroads. Importantly, within this framework, individuals would not have private property rights over these instruments of production. At this point, you may wonder how, within this economic framework, the existence of a ruling class would be possible. Doesn’t this framework sound suspiciously like the beginning of the classless communist society? Not so fast. It's important to remember that a ruling class simply means a group of people who, due to socio-economic relations, exercise a high degree of control over access to the instruments of production. This ruling group also gives themselves preferential treatment in the distribution of the products of these instruments. In other words, they get a greater share of the national income. In a managerial society, the managers would exercise control over the instruments of production and gain preference in the distribution of the products not directly, through property rights vested in them as individuals, but indirectly, through their control of the state. Importantly, this control would not come about through deliberate actions or a coup. Rather, it would simply be the case that, as the state began to own and control more and more of the instruments of production, the people who already “managed” the day-to-day running of the state, i.e., bureaucrats, would become the de facto controllers of the instruments of production. And, in practice if not in theory, control is as good as ownership. Therefore, those bureaucrats who managed the running of the state would increasingly become the ruling class. Now we arrive at a crucial question: who are these managers, this new ruling class in the making? Well, in simple terms, the managers are simply those who manage the instruments of production. It seems obvious that in a capitalist society, it’s the capitalists who manage the instruments of production. Otherwise, how could they continue as the ruling class, a status which hinges on having control over the instruments of production? The simple answer to this question is that they could not. In the decades running up to the 1940s, the de facto management of the instruments of production had increasingly been removed from the capitalists and given to a new class of managers. Many different names are given to this new class. You may recognize them as production managers, operating executives, superintendents, or administrative engineers. More broadly, the term “manager” in this context refers to those who, at the point when the author was writing, were already managing the actual process of production, whether that production was individual, corporate or governmental in nature. Although the existence of managers is nothing new, and industry has always required them, they seemed to assume much greater economic dominance mid-century. For instance, in previous times, the typical capitalist was his own manager. He was the individual entrepreneur who owned the whole factory, coal mine or steamship company, and he actively managed his own enterprise. But, significantly, the first half of the twentieth century saw the growth of large-scale public corporations and huge technological advances within modern industry that made management more complex than ever. These changes virtually eliminated the smaller, capitalist-manager types of enterprise. Instead, armies of managers were required for the daily running of most big industries and businesses. Also, as companies were becoming larger, many were no longer owned by individual capitalists with absolute power, but by large numbers of individual shareholders, which diluted the ability of the owners to take decisive action against the managers. And in organizations where the owners are weak, it’s the managers who hold all the cards. Crucially, it was not just in the field of private enterprise that this new managerial class would take control of society and become the new ruling class. In fact, the social dominance of managers who worked for the state would be even more absolute than that of the private industry managers. More worrying still, the government was already being run by this new ruling class. Except, in a governmental context, they were not known as managers. You probably know them as bureaucrats. Under capitalism, governments don’t seek to enter into the economy themselves. However, in all the nations of the world, this traditional, limited role of government was being abandoned in the first half of the twentieth century. Although Russia was the most extreme example of this, the same change was happening in the United States, albeit at a slower pace. Namely, government took control of vital sections of the economy from the postal service and transportation to ship-building and housing, ash and garbage removal and health care – all of which were now becoming fields of government enterprise. In this way, the capitalists were losing power, because every section of the economy that the government took over and began to run as a state enterprise was another opportunity lost by the capitalists – both in terms of profit and potential control of the means of production. Also, just consider that the bureaucracy of the American federal government in 1941 included over a million people. That’s double the number of the early 1930s! Furthermore, if we include the employees of state, county and municipal governments, the army, navy, courts, prison and the recipients of all types of relief, we find that already in the United States, half or more of the entire population was in some way dependent upon government for its means of living. And who was presiding over this huge behemoth of government enterprise? You guessed it – the managers. The day-to-day running of this huge state was in the hands of the men of the innumerable government bureaus, commissions and agencies. These men (and they largely were men), and their equivalents in private industry, seemed to be the ascendant ruling class in the modern world. And when the state would eventually take control of all aspects of industry, the managers’ power would become absolute. The key message in these blinks: Capitalism, our current social structure, is on the way out, thanks to factors such as continuous mass unemployment. Although many believe that communism is the only alternative, it's more likely that a managerial society will flourish in capitalism’s place – a society defined by state control of industry, a lack of private property rights, and a ruling class consisting of those who manage, rather than own, the means of production.

No? Well, if you’ve ever had a Chicken McNugget, or a hamburger in your staff cafeteria, it turns out you probably have! Today, Tyson Foods is the biggest meat company in the US; in 2011 they raised 2.1 billion chickens, and slaughtered 7.2 million cows and 20.5 million pigs. They produced about a fifth of all meat consumed in the United States. So why don’t you know much about them? The company isn’t very vocal about its business practices and, as a result, few know how they have risen to the top of their industry. These blinks change that; they show you the reasons behind the company’s growth, and highlight the fact that while it might have brought cheap prices to consumers, it has spelled disaster for farmers. In these blinks, you’ll find out why Tyson foods force their farmers to take part in a tournament; what chickenization is; and why Barack Obama’s plans to reform the meat industry have failed. What’s the best way for a company to increase its profits without actually having to improve its product? One business might start by improving its marketing campaign, while another could streamline processes in order to reduce redundancy. For a huge company, however, these small-time solutions simply won’t cut it; it would need something much grander. For Tyson Foods, this grand idea was vertical integration, a process by which a company takes control of all the independent businesses that work with it. In Tyson’s case, companies from throughout the meat supply chain, such as farmers, feed producers, slaughterhouses and distributors, were placed under the company’s tight grip. This doesn’t necessarily mean that Tyson owns each of these partners. Rather, they are simply under Tyson’s control by virtue of their contractual relationships: among other things, they have to comply with Tyson’s strategy and prices, as well as work with other Tyson companies. The big advantages of vertical integration are that it helps mitigate competition and unify strategy. When a single company controls the entire supply chain, it’s extremely difficult for a competitor to enter the market. Where will competing companies find farmers if Tyson controls them all? Where will they find people to butcher and process the meat? In all likelihood, they won’t. Furthermore, when you control the entire production process, you can force people to work toward your own strategic goals. With the competition vanquished, farmers, butchers and processors simply have nowhere to go if they oppose Tyson’s practices. For example, Tyson favors quantity over quality in its production, preferring mass-produced meat over higher quality alternatives. To this end, Tyson has forced its farmers to provide cattle with Zilmax, a drug that makes them grow faster. Farmers either agree to this practice, or get cut out of the business. For Tyson, this strategy is incredibly profitable – for its suppliers, it isn’t at all. In 2010 alone, Tyson Foods sold $28.43 billion worth of meat, earning $780 million in profits. Until as recently as the first decades of the 20th century, the basic model for American farming was the small family farm. The huge, centralized industrial farms that dominate the market today were practically unheard of. When the Great Depression hit, everything changed. Like everyone else, many farmers suffered immensely during the Depression. Markets dried up, and many farmers faced bankruptcy. They needed a savior, but who? Enter Tyson Foods. In order to build their chicken empire, Tyson needed the support of the farmers. At the time, chicken was not a very popular choice when it came to meat, and the chicken market was tiny. Tyson wanted to change this, but faced a major obstacle: Chicken is an unreliable meat. It easily loses mass in transport, and can easily go bad. To help solve this problem, Tyson began implementing its model of vertical integration by buying a food mill, chicken hatcheries and slaughterhouses. But it still needed farmers. Luckily for the company, the Great Depression left many farmers desperate for work. Instead of buying out their farms, Tyson came up with a different strategy: “Work for us, do as we say and you will earn a steady paycheck. Your financial troubles will all be over.” Many farmers jumped at the chance to earn a living once again, and allowed themselves to come under Tyson’s control. To sweeten the deal, Tyson also offered many farmers loans to purchase new equipment. For Tyson, the benefit was threefold: new machines would ramp up productivity, competitors would be driven out and the farmers would be indebted to the company. But this was only the beginning. So what was Tyson’s plan after putting their system of vertical integration into place? Would it use its newfound efficiency to refine its product? Or would it go for growth? It went for the latter, and did so with a passion. The company established a new official policy: expand or expire. But expanding is easier said than done, and Tyson faced many difficulties along the way. First and foremost, it needed to grow the market for chicken. By the 1970s, chicken was becoming an increasingly popular choice of meat, but it was still a small player in the booming fast-food industry. In response, Tyson chief Don Tyson spent 14 years pressuring McDonald's to include chicken on its menu. He finally succeeded when McDonald's started selling the chicken nugget, a product designed by Tyson to be cheap, long-lasting and easy to eat. With fast food on board, chicken became increasingly ubiquitous. In 1969, the average American ate an average of only 39 pounds of chicken each year; by 1995, that amount was 70 pounds. But another roadblock Tyson faced was the need for constant expansion, especially in order to supply the huge orders from companies like McDonald's and Walmart, all while keeping costs at a minimum. Tyson’s solution was standardization: all their suppliers would use the same feed, and Tyson would standardize and rationalize their production processes. Every bit of the chicken was to be used, including parts that would never be sold as chicken in a supermarket. Think “chicken tenders,” a breaded chicken “product” made up of otherwise unusable cuts and sold to Burger King. Even the chickens themselves became standardized. With its 1994 purchase of chicken breeding company Cobb-Vantress, Tyson gained exclusive ownership of a breed of chicken that not only grew faster, but could be slaughtered younger. Consider that in 1925 it took 15 weeks to raise a chicken to 2.2 pounds; by 1990, it only took about four weeks! So far, we’ve seen how vertical integration allowed Tyson Foods to dominate the chicken market, employing both industrialization and standardization. But if control over subsidiary businesses was so important to Tyson, why didn’t it simply buy them all? Many Tyson farms are still “owned” by individual farmers. Why? The primary reason Tyson chooses to control farmers with contractual agreements rather than by simply purchasing their farms is because non-ownership mitigates risks and costs. Early on in Tyson’s ascendence, it realized that chicken farming was the riskiest area of its business. Farming is under constant threat of price swings that could eat into profit margins. And, of course, animals don’t always grow the way you want them to! Some die on the farm, and others remain too small to become profitable. So, instead of taking on these risks itself, Tyson left farmers with ownership of their own farms, thus leaving them responsible for the risks and costs. Yet, despite the fact that they still own their farms, farmers have virtually no control over how they manage them. Tyson exerts almost total control over the feed farmers use with their livestock, the medicines they give to them and the weight each chicken must reach before slaughter. Even the chickens don’t belong to the farmers; they’re owned by Tyson. Tyson forces contracts upon its farmers that give them little leeway in terms of how the farmers price their products. The contracts enable Tyson to set the price they’ll pay for each chicken, and this price is subject to change at Tyson’s discretion, leaving farmers completely powerless. For instance, if a farmer has higher utility costs than expected, they can’t adjust the price of their goods accordingly, and might even end up losing money for each bird. Despite all this, the farmers can’t speak out against Tyson, because the company controls the entire industry; if one farmer complains, there are hundreds more ready to take her place. What do you think of when you hear the word “tournament”? Perhaps regally clad knights jousting at a Renaissance fair? Or a giant sporting arena where athletes compete for prizes? Whatever comes to mind, chances are that a tournament is somehow fun or exciting. For Tyson Foods’ farmers, however, the word “tournament” has a much more ominous meaning. Tyson uses a tournament system with its farmers, allowing the company to constantly push down the price it pays its farmers for chicken. For each of its farms, Tyson collects a huge amount of efficiency-related data. This data is then analyzed, and the most efficient farms earn a slightly higher price for their chickens. So, higher efficiency is rewarded – seems fair, right? Well, things aren’t quite so simple. For starters, farms are measured against each other without taking into account key factors like modernization, size or available capital. In this system, huge industrial farms compete with tiny, old-fashioned ones. The data review itself is conducted in secret; only afterwards do farmers discover their respective rankings, making it difficult for them to plan for the future. Farmers can’t accurately budget for the following year because they have no idea what sort of ranking they’ll earn next time, and thus don’t know how much they’ll earn for each chicken. Finally, farmers aren’t allowed to compare prices and results with each other. The results themselves are the “confidential and proprietary information of Tyson Foods, Inc.,” meaning that they can’t be discussed. As such, unionization and collaboration among farmers is almost impossible. Tyson is the real winner of this tournament: farmers compete in a race to the bottom, and as they battle to become the most efficient, the price of chicken continues to plummet. So far, you’ve seen how Tyson Foods climbed to the top of the food chain in the chicken market. The following blinks will examine its ascent to become the largest meat company in the US. As you’ve learned, Tyson Foods made great strides in bringing efficiency to the chicken business. In fact, their methods were so effective that they earned their own name: chickenization. Specifically, chickenization describes how other meat production industries followed the example of the chicken industry: larger production, industrialization, vertical integration and the concentration of power in the hands of a few companies. It comes as no surprise that one of the first companies to attempt this shift was Tyson Foods. In an attempt to break into other meat markets, Tyson tried to implement its chicken production methods within the hog farming industry. In the early 1990s, the hog industry was in deep crisis. The rising power of the chicken industry meant that pork and beef consumption were in decline. Chicken was simply more affordable. The answer was simple: take the farming strategy that worked with chicken and apply it to hog farming in order to cut costs and increase profits. So, Tyson bought up hog slaughterhouses, contracted hog farmers and began the industrialization of hog farming. However, they faced a number of obstacles, one of which was a 1938 governmental regulation that placed limits on meat production in order to keep prices high and farms profitable. Tyson and its competitors had long been lobbying to have this law overturned. Luckily for them, in 1994, the Republican Party regained a majority in the US Congress, and that meant deregulation. Soon after, the Freedom to Farm Act was passed, which removed any barriers to production. The newly industrialized meat business was thus able to begin a campaign of massive overproduction. Tyson’s prospects in the hog market seemed limitless, but it still couldn’t break through. Its more established competitors, especially Smithfield Foods, grew much faster, and quickly claimed market dominance. Tyson simply couldn’t compete. Unaccustomed to following a market leader, Tyson largely withdrew from the hog business. With this defeat, their expansion seemed to come to an end – but it was only a temporary setback! With Smithfield’s dominance in the hog industry, Tyson had hit a wall. But there was still one area where they could expand: the beef industry. In the 1990s, the big player in the US beef market was Iowa Beef Processors (IBP). The company was enormous, much larger and far more profitable than Tyson. Yet, it was also in a period of transition. In an attempt to take the company off the stock market and return it to private ownership, a group of IBP managers had launched an attempt to buy out shareholders. When news of this attempted buyout broke, IBP’s rivals made bids of their own. Smithfield, for instance, made a bid, as did Tyson. But Tyson was a much smaller company, and didn’t seem to have the capital to actually buy out its rival. To give you an idea of just how far behind Tyson was, consider that the presumed selling price for IBP was in billions of dollars. Tyson’s profits were below $300 million. But Tyson’s new leader, Johnny Tyson, was determined to force the sale through. In the end, against the advice of his father and majority shareholder, Don Tyson, he took out loans amounting to $1.4 billion in order to purchase IBP for $4.2 billion. With this purchase, Tyson became the dominant power in the meat industry. In fact, about five percent of the average American’s grocery bill would go straight to the one company. But wait! Wouldn’t this kind of market domination violate the government’s antitrust laws? Not according to regulators. They felt that, as IBP and Tyson were in “separate” industries (chicken versus cattle) and as there were still other large competitors in their field, the buyout didn’t constitute a monopoly. Thus, Tyson was free to become the largest meat company in the world. Over the course of the previous blinks, you’ve seen how Tyson Foods and its competitors have effectively come to control the entire meat industry. With vertical integration strategies, they can dominate whole markets, forcing their subsidiaries to accept their offers or simply go out of business. But what about the farmers who refuse to deal with the leviathan of the meat industry? How difficult is it to remain independent? As you might have guessed, it’s incredibly difficult to both stay independent and turn a profit. The problem is that there is hardly any market for independent meat. The major companies in the chicken, beef and pork markets only work with farmers that have signed contracts with them. Farmers who refuse to sign have almost no one left to sell to. In fact, in the beef industry, there are only four companies left who will buy meat from independent farmers. Usually there is only one buyer that can use its advantageous position to set prices. Further complicating matters is the fact that the price of meat is on the decline. Industrialization and modernization in the meat industry, combined with practices like the tournament method, constantly drive down the price of meat. For an independent farmer, the chances of actually making a profit decline along with it. Faced with these grim circumstances, it’s not surprising that most farmers sign the contract handed to them by the likes of Tyson Foods. Although you might lose the control over your product, a fixed-price contract at least means an opportunity to earn an income, no matter how paltry. But was there no concerted attempt to work against such extreme concentration of power within the meat industry? Our final blinks will look at the efforts made by both governments and producers to distribute power more evenly, along with their miserable results. The last few blinks have outlined nothing short of the takeover of an entire industry by a few companies. Surely it is exactly these sorts of situations that antitrust laws were designed to prevent – so where was the US government during all of this? Antitrust laws are generally designed to protect producers and customers. Yet, whereas farmers were hurt by turbulent times in the meat industry, customers saw nothing but advantages. From about 1950 through to the early 21st century, the price of beef, pork and chicken was on the decline. This was largely as a result of industrialization in meat production. The rise of the big firms, it was argued, was beneficial for consumers, who now pay less for their meat. Despite this reasoning, some initiatives did take shape to work against chickenization and vertical integration. One early move against these practices happened in Iowa in the mid-1990s. Iowa had an anti-monopoly law in place that prevented meatpackers from owning the animals they processed. Smithfield had ignored this law when it implemented vertical integration strategies in the state. A lawsuit was brought against Smithfield, but it was actually quite difficult to prove the company’s guilt. To dodge this attack on their production methods, Smithfield simply transferred ownership of the animals to a single person. Nevertheless, this initial resistance did encourage people to act against vertical integration in a broader sense. In total, 16 states joined Iowa in an effort to regulate vertical integration in the meat industry, and even the ruling Clinton administration took a stand at the behest of consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Yet, it all came to nothing. Clinton shifted his priorities once pressure from Nader subsided, and the momentum in all 16 states gradually died away. Only Iowa made any concrete progress with regulation over the tournament system; to this day it remains the only state to do so. Still, there was hope. Barack Obama had listened to the farmers that helped him win the Iowa caucus, and eventually the presidency. Changes in agriculture were on his agenda. When President Obama took office in 2009, he brought with him a zeal for reform. He promised to change the way that health care, immigration and even agriculture were run. As part of this reform, Obama brought in Tom Vilsack as Secretary of Agriculture. Vilsack, an Iowan, took the agreement made in his home state – one that limited the power companies exercised through the tournament system – and hoped to use it as a model for reform throughout the country. For the first time ever, someone high up in antitrust regulation was prepared to closely scrutinize vertical integration in the meat industry and take steps to regulate it. Not surprisingly, Tyson and its ilk fought hard against any attempt at reform. Fighting regulation was especially important to them, because at the time, the meat industry was facing one of its biggest crises in decades. Government subsidies for biofuels had pushed corn prices up, and the price of corn-based feed rose with it. The price of meat climbed as a result, hurting sales and causing the first drop in per capita chicken consumption since World War II. Facing declining profits and a reformist administration, the industry went all out in an effort to preserve their advantageous position. In total, the industry spent $5.94 million in lobbying in 2010, with Tyson alone contributing $2.59 million. They pressured Congress with the argument that the industrial farming system was too complex and efficient to change. The Tea Party movement backed them up, arguing that the Agriculture Department was acting outside of its jurisdiction. They even organized their own “grassroots” movement of farmers against these new regulations. All their hard work eventually paid off. Faced with a mountain of pressure from the big meat industry, the government backed down. Government and consumer advocates couldn’t overcome the wealth and organizing power of this enormous corporate interest. Today, Tyson Foods and a few other companies remain as powerful as ever. The key message in this book: Meat today isn’t produced on Old McDonald’s farm. Rather, it’s produced by highly industrialized farms that are all controlled by a few corporate giants. Within only a few decades, these corporations have completely reshaped rural America – and have gone virtually unnoticed.  Suggested further reading: Eating Animals by Jonathan Safran Foer Eating Animals offers a comprehensive view of the modern meat industry and demonstrates how the entire production process has been so completely perverted that it is unrecognizable as farming anymore. The book explains the moral and environmental costs incurred to achieve today‘s incredibly low meat prices. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!
