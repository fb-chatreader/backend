[{"title":"Venture Deals","author":"Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson","summary":"Each year countless start-ups spring into life all across the globe, and in today’s Information Age, many are innovative, internet driven enterprises. The opportunities for success in the tech world are enormous, and the potential for profits is almost limitless. Yet, the risks are just as huge: most start-ups fail, meaning the time spent on an unsuccessful launch is time and resources squandered. One of the biggest reasons for this failure is their inability to secure sufficient funding. For most start-ups, the traditional means of securing cash – such as bank loans – are simply out of reach. These blinks will show you how to bypass this hurdle altogether by raising venture funding. In these blinks, you’ll learn all the tricks you need to find the right investor for your business, convince him that investing in your company is the right decision and get the best deal in the process. After reading these blinks, you’ll know that a good lawyer isn’t necessarily the most thorough; why it’s always better to listen first and talk second; and how knowing an investor’s vacation schedule can land you a better deal. Imagine that you’ve finally started putting your great business idea into action; you’ve founded your company and have a motivated team behind you. So what’s missing? Right, you need money to have your breakthrough. But money doesn’t grow on trees. Where on earth are you going to find it? Many start-ups look to venture capital to find the money they need for success. When entrepreneurs raise venture capital, they receive an influx of cash from an investor, called a venture capitalist (VC), in exchange for shares (and thus control) over the their companies. While venture capital is a fairly uncommon funding strategy, for innovative start-ups with risky ideas it can be the most effective: Start-ups lack the long operational history necessary to raise funds on credit, e.g., from a bank loan. Venture capital, in contrast, doesn’t require a company to be established, and therefore is perfect for start-ups. Even some of today’s largest, most successful companies had humble beginnings that were jump-started by venture capital. Google, for example, got its first venture capital injection of $100,000 in 2000, two years after its founding. One year later it attracted another $25 million investment. It was this huge investment that allowed Google to quickly expand to the point that it now has its own venture capital arm to invest in other new firms. However, venture capital becomes complicated when it involves different people with different goals. Because venture capital is often raised with several financing rounds, companies have an opportunity to get multiple cash injections, but it comes at a cost: It’s quite common for companies to be financed by multiple investors, which in turn means dealing with multiple shareholders, their interests and influence. Of course, they don’t all share the same goals. For example, one shareholder might want to make a quick buck, and thus push for risky strategies and then sell his shares, whereas others play it safe and push for long-term gains. Imagine you are trying to get a venture deal: how many parties do you think are involved? A venture deal involves more than just the entrepreneur and VC. In fact, once all the lawyers, mentors and so on have been accounted for, there could easily be six or more people at the negotiating table. Still, no matter how many people are involved, entrepreneurs should always focus their attention on the investors (the VCs). Investors must take the wishes of the company for which they work into consideration. Thus, when dealing with investors, it’s essential to know where they are positioned within the hierarchy of their venture capital firm. For instance, managing directors and general partners are at the top of the career ladder, while analysts are on the very first rung. The higher up the ladder an investor is positioned, the more power he or she has to make decisions and the more likely their interest will be genuine. So, if an associate or analyst shows interest in your firm, it’s not necessarily cause for celebration. They scout out hundreds of potential investments every day; it’s merely part of their job description. You want to bypass them to reach the general partners, as they’re the ones with the power. Focusing your attention on the investor also helps you to simplify communication. This will be of great benefit to your company in the long-term, as efficient communication will save you the hassle of misunderstandings, divergent topics and delays. This doesn’t mean that you should neglect the other parties involved. Quite the contrary! Be sure to take the time to demonstrate your commitment to them by checking in and making sure that the lead investor actually represents their interests as well. Obviously, keeping the overview about all involved parties isn’t easy, but it’s nonetheless necessary. However, dealing with investors and lawyers is only one part of venture deals. More crucial is preparing the deal itself. If you want to make the most out of your relationship with venture capital, you’ll need to understand how it works. Venture capital funds are complicated networks of investors, managing firms and companies, and the relationships among them are not always easy to understand. However, there are two insights into the structure of venture capital that are helpful for all entrepreneurs: First, VCs, just like entrepreneurs also have to get their funds from somewhere. These funds come from various investors – limited partners – such as banks or government funds. Venture capitalists earn a small percentage managing the investments of limited partners, but earn a larger percentage when they return with a profit. It’s therefore crucial to understand that VCs don’t have free rein; they have to act with respect to the interests of their limited partners. This insight will become important when you’re courting investors. For example, VCs often try to maximize their profit opportunity by spreading their investments across many different start-ups, thus casting a wide net and mitigating losses. However, this strategy doesn’t give entrepreneurs the focus they need, and they’d be better suited to look for other investors. Second, VCs manage money based on strict time periods. They often get new money from their limited partners every three to five years, but can keep investing in companies which belong to their portfolio for a longer period. They are, however, likely to run out of money at the end of the financing period. That means that the further along a VC is in his financing round, the riskier it is for an entrepreneur to trust that investor, as he might be unable to further invest in the company. To avoid this situation, be sure to ask the investor when she made her last investment or when she expects to receive new funding. If she struggles to answer these questions, then she’s probably not the most reliable. Today’s investment world is full of intricacies, meaning that a simple handshake is no longer enough to ensure that everyone understands and adheres to an agreement. Nowadays, everything is recorded in term sheets, more or less standardized documents that summarize the financial agreements between the VC and entrepreneur. The most important components of term sheets are the ones that involve money. Here, entrepreneurs must be aware of investors’ tricks and pay close attention to detail if they don’t want to end up losing a significant share of future returns. Often investors aren’t crystal clear when it comes to financing, which can lead to misunderstandings that disadvantage the entrepreneur. For instance, VCs and entrepreneurs often think about valuation in different terms: if a VC offers a $5 million investment on a valuation of a $20 million postmoney company, he expects that his $5 million will buy 25 percent of that company. Entrepreneurs, however, consider this offer in terms of premoney: to them, the $5 million dollar investment is included in the valuation, meaning it would buy 20 percent of a $25 million company. Even worse, investors sometimes try to pull out of investment promises when times are tough. Entrepreneurs should implement a pay-to-play strategy, which ties committed ownership of the business to committed investments. The second key component of term sheets concerns control, that is to say, the investor’s influence on the company’s decision-making. While most investors have less than 50-percent ownership of a firm, they remain a major part of the decision-making process by becoming part of the board of directors. The board makes all decisions, and consequently being on the board signifies great influence, especially when investors have a veto right. A balanced board of directors would consist of two founders/CEOs, two VCs without absolute veto power and one outside board member, for example, an expert who doesn’t work for the company directly. Now that you know how venture deals work, our following blinks will look into the methods successful companies use to raise venture capital. Before you take your great business to VCs in hopes of getting funding, you should first prepare a few things to avoid potential disaster: Most obviously, make sure that you’ve prepared all your materials and presentations in a clear and compelling way. Most investors will ask for a short description of your company, an executive summary (a one- to three-page description of your company and strategy) and a presentation that offers a more in-depth view of the business. All these form the investor’s first impression of your company, and it’s therefore absolutely crucial that they are well thought out and professional. And while VCs don’t often request detailed business plans and financial models, you should nonetheless prepare them before approaching investors along with other detailed information about your company, such as employment agreements. This way, if an investor does want to see them, you’ll save both yourself and your potential investors lots of time and nerves. In addition, it’s vital that you know which specific VCs could be the right ones for venture. Luckily, today most investors have websites, blogs and sometimes even use social media. This makes it much easier for entrepreneurs to find out who else these investors are funding, what kind of businesses they are interested in and about their personal interests. You can use this information to both find the right investor and customize your approach toward him. For example, if you know in advance that an investor already owns a share of a company similar to yours and likes baseball, you’ll be better positioned to engage him both professionally and personally. The best way, however, to find a good investor is to ask for recommendations from your entrepreneur friends. Since they’ve already gone through the entire process, they can offer you the kinds of candid insights that investors won’t necessarily broadcast on their websites. You’re at the negotiating table with your investor, hammering out the details to your big break into the business world. You’re quite happy with the results so far, but your lawyer gets stuck on a trivial detail and starts behaving rudely. You begin to panic – not only because his rude behavior is embarrassing, but also because your aspirations seem to be going up in flames before your very eyes! Obviously, you don’t have a good lawyer! A good lawyer will understand how to arrange and close an investment deal as well as how to keep the focus on the most important issues concerning money and control. Venture capitalists often outclass entrepreneurs in terms of negotiating and business experience, and hiring a lawyer is the way to compensate for this lack of competence. You and your lawyer must understand each other and focus on the same issues if you want to be a successful team. Nothing is worse than having a lawyer who won’t listen to you. Be sure you’re the one setting the agenda, and make sure he is supporting instead of working against you. For instance, an inexperienced lawyer might misplace his focus on trivial details like patent rights, when the real focus needs to be on ownership. These kinds of hurdles mean that negotiations will last forever, and that means lost time, money and energy. To find a good lawyer whose style you’re comfortable with, ask other entrepreneurs about their experiences. Having already witnessed the lawyer’s negotiating style, fellow entrepreneurs are valuable sources of information. A good lawyer doesn’t necessarily have high rates or even work for a well-known firm. For a start-up, your money is better spent hiring a lawyer from a small, specialized company. Despite the many prejudices against lawyers and the arduous task of finding the perfect one, you’ll thank yourself for your hard work, knowing that you are well-represented by a lawyer who takes your interests seriously. Imagine that you’re a young start-up approaching an experienced investor. As you enter her office, you feel nervous that you’ll make a mistake and lose her interest. After all, why should she listen to you anyway? If you follow these steps, then you can rest assured that she'll listen and that you’ll get what you want! First, know what you really want. Make sure that you can clearly articulate the things that really matter to you – and these should definitely include the questions about the amount of money that will be invested as well as control of the business. Don’t get stuck in the details. A few compromises are just part of the game, but be sure that you know exactly what you want when it comes to money and influence. Moreover, set your own limits and know when to walk away from the negotiating table. If you, for example, don’t want to give away more than 50 percent of your company’s shares, then you should under no circumstance do so, no matter how much pressure the investor lays on you. Second, knowing the VC’s targets and limitations helps you to develop a more nuanced strategy. Whereas one of the greatest advantages for entrepreneurs is their singular focus (specifically, building up their companies), investors have to juggle a number of considerations, some of them personal. This can be advantageous for young entrepreneurs who are dealing with experienced investors. Take this case for example, in which a start-up team was negotiating its term sheet with an investor whom they knew to be a mere two hours away from starting his vacation. Wanting to start his vacation on time, the investor was forced to come to a decision quickly, whereas the team had all the time in the world to prepare for the negotiation. However, this doesn’t mean you should trick your investors. These early negotiations are the foundation for long-lasting business relations, so both parties should ensure a positive outcome for everyone. We negotiate every day – with our friends, family, significant others and even our coworkers. But often, we don’t think about how these decisions are actually made. However, when it comes to business negotiations, you don’t have the luxury of being so laid back. Here are a few rules for when you’re sitting across from a potential investor at the negotiating table: Transparency is key. Not only will it foster win-win-situations; it also guarantees a long-term relationship. If you hope to get the upper hand during negotiations through conniving and shrewdly concealing information, then you’re going to be terribly disappointed in the outcome. Inevitably, your investor will discover your dishonesty, which means that you either won’t get the funding now or won’t get it later as a result of a ruined reputation. Study your negotiating partners in order to recognize and respond to their styles. For example, if you know that a potential venture capitalist will want to discuss every detail and let you lose your focus, you can anticipate this by preparing a list of the things that really matter to you and concentrate on them. Let him explore these trivial details, but don’t waste your energy there if you don’t want to. Discuss the possibility of investing with multiple potential investors. You can gain the upper hand by piquing the interest of several investors and letting them know there’s competition. Investor A, for example, wants to get the deal and offers better terms than he thinks Investor B could offer. In all likelihood, you’ll get a better deal this way than if you bargain with only one investor. However, you should never divulge the names of competing investors or the term sheets they’ve drafted. Doing so could allow them to collaborate and force you into a bad deal. As an entrepreneur, there’s a lot riding on the outcome of your negotiations with potential investors. Here are a few tips that will help you avoid some of the most common blunders: If you don’t know what to do or say, then wait for them to act first. In fact, in the finance world, it’s better to react than to act! When you enter negotiations, no one knows exactly what the other wants, and it’s better to let the person on the other side of the table reveal her hand first. For example, as an entrepreneur, you should never present an investor with a term sheet. Always let him be the first to draft it. It’s possible that the investor might offer you something better than you might have realistically offered yourself, so let him play his hand first. The same applies to negotiations: if you’re at a loss for words, wait and listen. An opportunity will present itself. In addition, don’t get on anyone’s nerves! If a VC says “no,” then you should accept her decision and move on. Don’t take it personally – a refusal just means that she isn’t the right one for your company. So, don’t send follow-up emails or ask for a referral. Just continue your search for the right investor. Always tailor your emails to specific investors, and don’t waste their time. For instance, if an investor says she will only invest in companies in which she gains at least 30 percent control, then she won’t even look at your idea if you offer her less. So, if you aren’t happy with her conditions, then don’t even bother her. It won’t get you anywhere and can even harm your reputation, because it appears as if you didn’t do your research. Despite these measures, it’s still easy to make mistakes. The best precautionary measure is having a solid team behind you. Not only will the team support you, but investors also look to invest in teams specifically, because of the joint effort’s higher profit potential and motivation. The key message in this book: If you want to secure funding for your start-up, then you’ll need to know what your options are and how to make the most of them. When it comes to raising venture capital, that means understanding the interests of investors and assembling the right team to support you at the negotiating table.

Cohen and John Kador","summary":"If you want to sail around the world, you better make sure you’ve got the right people with you in your boat. If you want to start a company, the strategy is much the same. Every start-up needs to find an investor, but finding a good one can be tricky. Many investors are just looking for a quick return on an investment, and have little to bring to the table beyond cash. What a smart entrepreneur should be looking for is an angel investor. Although many angel investors are not as flush as billionaire Bill Gates, they are instead motivated by making dreams come true for hard-working start-ups all over the world. Do you have a dream that needs a financial boost? Then these blinks will help you find your own angel investor! In these blinks, you’ll learn why an investor is like a spouse; why you should learn to take “no” for an answer; and how a start-up founder got an angel investor to wear his underwear. Most people consider starting their own business at some point in their life, be it mowing lawns or starting a multimillion-dollar business. But no matter what the idea, they all have one thing in common: Start-ups need capital to get started. For most entrepreneurs, this means finding an investor. And if they’re lucky, they’ll find an angel investor. An angel investor funds start-ups with her own capital in return for partial ownership of the project. Such a person typically possesses assets valued at over $1 million, has an annual income above $200,000 or a joint income exceeding $300,000. Considering these requirements, only three percent of Americans qualify as angel investors! Angels differ from regular investors in that they offer more than just money to a project. While it’s certainly true that angel investors write checks, they also contribute to your business by investing their time and sharing their experience and valuable connections. Typically, angel investors have invested in many enterprises, and in doing so, have acquired tons of experience. They can share with you their insights and potentially save you from early mistakes. Angel investors also tend to gather together. Finding one who is truly committed to you and your  business idea means he could introduce you to other potential investors as well. Unfortunately, the primary goal of many entrepreneurs is securing funds as quickly as possible. In their haste, they often strike a deal with the first investor that comes their way. Remember that your relationship with your investor is a long-term commitment. Think of your investor like your spouse: you’ll be together for a long time and you’ll also share assets. Because of this, you need to find someone who won’t jump ship when things turn sour. You need someone who will stand by you and your business, through thick or thin. In other words: you need an angel investor! But how exactly do you find an angel? The following blinks will reveal how. Successful entrepreneurs have no patience for people who are shy. You have to get out there and talk to people, inspiring them to believe in your business as passionately as you already do. And you have to try even harder to make an angel investor believe, as they’ve heard it all before! Angel investors don’t fall from the sky, despite their whimsical name. You have to approach them, and do so in a way that speaks to them on a personal level. To do this, you’ll need to be prepared. Do some research about your potential investor and learn at the very least some basic facts. What have they been investing in? What are they looking for in potential investment opportunities? Don’t ever come across as unprepared, or even worse, uninterested in your own project or simply lazy. In approaching angel investors, you’ll want to get as personal as possible. Find things that you have in common, such as friends or hobbies, and use these shared experiences as leverage. Your goal in approaching an investor should be to hook them quickly. You should assume that every pitch is an all-in gambit. You either excite them right away or they never want to hear from you again. One great way to do this is to develop a concise elevator pitch for your first meeting. In essence, this is a short version of your pitch, designed to immediately grab their attention. Your pitch should be shorter than 150 words and last less than 30 seconds, but it should also mention the specific problem that your product solves. Before an angel investor is willing to jump out of a plane with you at 30,000 feet, she’ll want to know first if you’ve brought along a parachute. She’ll also want to know exactly how it works. The same goes for your business proposition. An angel investor won’t pull out her checkbook unless you can clearly demonstrate how your business is going to work. As “on the spot” as you might feel, you’ll need to provide investors with a lot of information about your business, otherwise they won’t be convinced that your start-up is worth their time or money. Put yourself in their shoes. Would you hand over your own hard-earned cash to someone whose business idea is thin or underdeveloped? If an entrepreneur’s idea was to “make nice tables,” would you invest? Probably not. That is, unless he can elaborate on how he intends to get ahead of the competition and how he’ll convince customers that his tables are the best in the world. Indeed, investing is a risky business. Very few start-ups actually turn a profit, and angel investors understand that a large percentage of their investments will be lost. But although they can’t eliminate all risks, they can try to minimize it by getting as much information as possible. One way investors gather information is by asking you due diligence questions, which aim to uncover any potential liabilities within your company. Be prepared to offer information ranging from pending patents to recent power struggles between team members. Most serious investors will ask these questions, but it would be even better if you started the conversation yourself! The simple fact that your start-up has issues won’t ruin your investment possibilities. In fact, every start-up has issues. Being upfront about these issues will prove that you are honest, and will convince angel investors of your integrity. You did everything by the book: you gave your pitch and was honest in presenting your strengths and weaknesses. Yet in the end, when you asked whether your investor was in, you received a flat “no.” What do you do now? First, learn to appreciate a quick “no.” Doing so will save you both time and hassle. Also accept that not everyone will want to invest in your business. It’s inevitable that you’ll hear the word “no” at some point, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Many investors don’t give a clear “no” right away, as they are either unsure what to do, want to keep their options open or simply don’t want to cause a scene. In any case, ambivalence won’t help you as it forces you to spend time pitching to someone who simply isn’t interested. You won’t ever want to find yourself in this state of limbo. Thus, you should press for a clear “yes” or “no,” and accept both possibilities with equal grace. While you will likely find another investor, you’ll never make back lost time, so try to push for expedience. If you’re lucky, sometimes a “no” can be a positive thing, too. Some investors will take the time to explain why they’ve rejected your proposal. Listen carefully to the feedback and think about how you can improve your pitch in the future. For example, an investor might tell you that your product price is too high, and that she won’t invest in your company because doing so could cause problems in her capital structure. Knowing this, you could make adjustments to your business plan to reduce your price and make your proposal more viable for the next potential investor. Don’t be afraid to ask for feedback! This will wake your potential investor’s instinct to help and might lead to some meaningful insights. So far we’ve described how to approach an angel investor. The following blinks will reveal how to get one playing for your team. When a start-up team pitches to an angel investor, you often have little to work with but your business plan and your own personalities. Thus you’ll need to make the best out of both, and that means proving that you and your team has the right kind of personalities! In essence, angels invest in your promises, and making your promise believable means convincing them of your integrity. As you already know, investing is a risky business. No matter how much market research you’ve conducted, in the end it all comes down to how much trust the investor is willing to put in you. You need to make it your goal to convince the angel investor of your integrity, beyond any doubt. An important part of demonstrating integrity is simply being honest about who you are. Be authentic – don’t try to talk like you’re from Silicon Valley if you’re from New Jersey. They don’t care about where you’re from or how you speak. They want to know that they can trust you! But trust alone isn’t enough. An investor can believe in your idea and your integrity without actually believing you have the skills to implement your idea. In other words, investors need to see that you are an entrepreneur to the bone. It’s important to demonstrate that your team has had entrepreneurial experience – even if it ended badly – as it shows that you’ve already acquired some management skills. Finally, you’ll have to demonstrate that your team can actually work as a team. Teams are the backbone of start-up ventures. Their ability to share responsibilities and work with each other can mean the success or failure of the start-up. When deciding whether to invest, the author himself looks for teammanship, a broad term that describes when a founding team is united by the same vision, whereby each member gives their all to achieve shared goals and resolve conflicts. Impressing an angel investor requires you to find the right balance between dreaming big and having your feet planted firmly on the ground. Behind every start-up is a set of beliefs that motivates the creation of a product or service. Wanting to make money is an important part of entrepreneurship, of course, but there should be something deeper guiding you through – your own little piece of truth, the way you intend to change the world. By demonstrating your belief in your enterprise, you show a potential investor that your idea has substance and that you’ll work tirelessly to bring it to life. However, a plan too big might make you sound like just a dreamer if you don’t back up your vision with a strong execution plan. Indeed, angel investors will want you to show them exactly how you intend to make your vision come true. Don’t ignore details like profit margins or managing bank loans. While such things aren’t as exciting as contemplating your vision, they are necessary in bringing your vision to life. Tom Patterson, the founder of Tommy John, thought that men’s underwear as a clothing segment was extremely underdeveloped in comparison to women’s underwear. He was determined to bring innovation to this field by developing an undershirt that didn’t bunch up or come untucked. Patterson had a vision to be sure, but he also didn’t ignore the facts and figures of the competitive clothing market. When he approached investor group The New York Angels in September 2011, the author – now an avid Tommy John wearer – was so impressed by Patterson’s understanding of the financial side of the business that he decided to invest. A year later, Tommy John revenue had risen from $1.5 million to $5 million. One of the best ways to excite an investor is to show that you’re thinking about an exit plan. There are two exit strategies for start-ups: being bought by a bigger company or going public (although going public is exceedingly rare for young companies). Having an exit strategy means that you’ve already found a target company that would potentially be interested in purchasing your start-up, and that you’ve created the conditions necessary for the acquisition to take place, such as having transparent and organized financial records. For an investor, an exit strategy is one of the primary motivators for why she would want to invest in your start-up in the first place! An angel investor often owns equity in return for her investment. Consequently, virtually the only way for an investor to actually make money is if your company is purchased at some point. Investors, just like entrepreneurs, are in the game to make money. Thus it’s natural for them to want a clear exit strategy from the start as proof that you’re taking their interests into account as well. It’s true that most start-ups end up folding and that consequently, most investments don’t turn a huge profit. However, the pursuit of a profit is nonetheless an investor’s only logical incentive to invest – no matter how much they believe in your vision – and you shouldn’t dismiss it. For a founder, the start-up is like a baby that they’ve brought into the world and through which they hope to change the world for the better. But for an investor, even if she takes an active role in shaping the project through advice and consulting, the start-up simply isn’t hers. So in the end, every investor is investing with the hope of cashing out. You should show the investor that you understand this and that you’re working to make this possible! The key message in this book: Angel investors don’t just write checks – they also can provide start-ups with powerful insights, experience and networking opportunities. Grabbing their attention means approaching them on a personal level and building a company that takes investors’ interests into account.  Actionable advice: Be specific about what the money is for.  When you’re pitching to an angel investor, get specific about how the money she’ll give you will be used. Is it for employee salaries? Research and development? Or something else entirely? Not only will this demonstrate that you’ve got business sense, but it will also help the investor feel the difference she’s making. After all, no one wants to give you money to pay your bank loan!

In these blinks, you’ll discover: why Nike’s “Just Do It” is one of the most successful taglines of all times, why Red Bull’s founder actively encouraged rumors that his company’s drink was dangerous, and why Starbucks is about more than just coffee. Everyone recognizes contemporary brand superstars, like Apple, Nike and Zappos. So how did these brands become universally recognized household names? Many people might believe that brand-building is just a matter of experimentation, good timing and sheer luck. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Great brands achieve their iconic status when a company understands its brand and how it should influence the everyday running of the business. A brand is much more than just the impression people have of your company and your product. A brand is the personality of your business, and therefore should shine through everything your company does. Successful brands understand that people don’t just buy products based on a rational analysis of price and quality, but instead consider the feelings and values they associate with a brand. Having a coffee at Starbucks, for example, is not just about getting your morning caffeine fix. It’s also about the store’s sensory experience – the music, the furniture or the employees’ smiles – that you notice every time you walk through the front door. But great brands also enjoy other benefits. One is that a company can enjoy higher profit margins. A study by the strategy consultancy Vivaldi Partners showed that customers are willing to pay higher prices for brand-name products than for other products. Another benefit is that companies with a strong brand tend to have an easier time aligning their organization to a set of values. This is because a brand can be used like a strategic compass, guiding the company at large as to how it should build its corporate culture, design processes and craft marketing campaigns. This is why Starbucks would never compromise the customer’s in-store experience, for example, by buying cheaper furniture. Even though the company could save costs in the short-term, such a decision would not be in line with the company’s brand. Many people think that the only function of a brand is advertising and marketing. In fact, a brand is just as important for the people inside a company: if you align your corporate culture with your brand’s values, this can help employees better work together toward a common goal. This alignment also amplifies the power of a brand toward the customer. Imagine your brand is a source of light that shines on your prospective customers. Now imagine your business and its stakeholders like suppliers, and sales representatives are those who connect the brand and the customer. If these people aren’t properly aligned with the brand’s values, they will block or distort the light coming from the brand, decreasing its efficacy. To prevent this from happening, you need to fix any gaps or inconsistencies between your company’s brand values and your organization. This means you have to educate every stakeholder about what your brand is and why it’s important. Each person must also understand how their actions impact the brand, and how they can accurately represent the brand and enhance its value through their everyday work. One way to do this is through brand toolboxes and brand engagement sessions. A brand toolbox is a simple item that helps employees understand and apply brand values everyday. It could, for example, take the form of a deck of cards or a little book, with references and anecdotes that relate your company’s core values. Brand engagement sessions are meant to help employees understand and identify how brand values influence every part of the business. Starbucks, for example, held a brand engagement session where managers participated in a walk-through presentation that followed the journey of a coffee bean from farm to cup, explaining how the company’s brand affected every step. At first glance, a slogan like “Just Do It” seems ineffective – it doesn’t even mention the company’s name, Nike, nor the products the brand represents. So how on earth did this phrase become one of the best-known brand slogans of all time? Successful branding is about emotions, not products. It’s about creating an emotional connection between the brand and the customer. As Scott Bedbury, Nike’s one-time marketing chief, wrote, \"‘Just Do It’ was not about sneakers, it was about values. It was not about products, it was about brand ethos.” The “Just Do It” campaign featured both professional and amateur athletes talking about their emotions and accomplishments without mentioning Nike, and afterward, the tagline was displayed. The campaign evoked such a powerful emotional response that people started writing to Nike about how they too “just did it,” such as quitting a miserable job, started working out or ended an unhealthy relationship. So how can you best connect with your customers on an emotional level? One great way is through empathic research, in which you ask customers questions like, “How do you feel when buying the product?” and “What need is satisfied when you buy and/or use the product?” This helps you get as close as possible to the private lives of your customers. One example of the power of empathetic research can be seen in the plight of Pampers, Europe’s best-selling disposable diaper brand in 1998. Although Pampers’ product was a market leader in keeping babies’ bottoms dry, sales were still in steady decline. After exploring empathic research, the company discovered that actually, young mothers cared more about things like how soundly their babies slept than about whether their diaper was dry. In response, Pampers developed diapers that were specifically designed to help infants sleep more comfortably, and sales soon picked up. Some people think that a key part of building a great brand is being trendy, meaning following current trends. But in fact, following trends can be a risky endeavor, because trends change quickly, and trying to adapt your brand to each change can compromise its integrity. When you follow a trend set by a competitor, you’re actually putting yourself in a comparative position, where consumers see you as a follower, not a leader. Your products will be perceived as similar to your competitors’ products, but with a modifying “-er”: that is, bigger, cheaper, faster and so on. This is not how you want your company, your product or your brand to be perceived. Consider the car company Hyundai. Its positioning in customers’ minds is something along the lines of “just as good as Lexus, but cheaper.” Therefore Hyundai is seen as a mere copycat, not a brand that constantly innovates new products. In this comparison, it’s Lexus that has the emotional advantage, and that alone can make a big difference. So instead of following trends, you should create your own. One way to do this is by challenging existing trends: questioning the status quo and commonly accepted dogmas that dominate your industry. As an example, let’s look at fast food chain Chipotle. The company challenged the notion that to be competitive in the fast food industry, you have to constantly cut prices, expand your menu selections and hire cheap labor. Instead, Chipotle did exactly the opposite: it uses expensive, high-quality ingredients to entice customers, and pays its staff higher salaries. The result? Although its food offerings are pricier than those of competitor Taco Bell, Chipotle has been a huge success. Another way to create your own trend is to anticipate and take advantage of a cultural movement. Starbucks anticipated that American society as a whole was headed in a direction where people would start to feel increasingly isolated. Therefore, the company designed its stores to be a “third place” between home and work, where people would feel comfortable spending time. Just as blindly following the latest trends can be dangerous for your brand, so can chasing customers indiscriminately. Sure, it might increase profits in the short term, but trying to appeal to everyone risks compromising your brand’s integrity. Great brands don’t chase after every customer but rather focus their energy on core customers. How can you do the same? Start by understanding who your customers are, what they need and what kind of brand you want to be for them. This can be achieved through a needs-based segmentation of potential customers. First, you target your core, meaning your ideal potential customers. Then you segment their day and analyze during what times the needs relevant to your product are at their strongest. Out of these needs, you pick the ones that best correspond to your brand identity and focus your marketing on those needs. As an example, consider a snack manufacturer that used a needs-based segmentation to understand what kind of snacks people wanted for what reason at what time of the day. It discovered that one need in the morning was to “pump up for the day,” so this was when people wanted an energetic and healthy snack. It just so happened this fit perfectly with the brand’s main values, “being healthy and fun,” so the next product campaign revolved around the slogan, “pump up.” Another reason why you shouldn’t try to please everyone is that it results in a boring brand, and you’ll still have detractors no matter what you do. Brands with personality and integrity, on the other hand, will always attract loyal customers and stakeholders. An example of a divisive brand is energy drink company Red Bull. Though the company is today very successful, at the outset there were rumors that Red Bull was a dangerous drug. Interestingly, the founder of the company actually set up a website to encourage the spread of these rumors. The reason? It was equally important to the founder that teachers hated his brand as it was that students loved it. Besides being a slave to the latest trends and chasing after customers indiscriminately, there’s a third mistake that brands can make: focusing too intently on growth. To meet shareholder demands, most CEOs are under constant pressure to introduce new products, diversify services and expand the business. But pushing for growth at the expense of brand integrity can often result in the demise of even a great brand. One example of this is the experience of Krispy Kreme, a doughnut company that in the 1990s appeared to be the next big thing. The company served delicious, fresh doughnuts at its stores that were meticulously designed to tempt all five senses. To meet shareholders’ growth expectations and to make a quick profit, Krispy Kreme started selling its doughnuts at places like gas stations and grocery stores as well. This not only compromised the quality of the product, but more importantly, ruined consumers’ experience of the brand. Sales and profits plummeted, and the perception of the brand was almost destroyed. So how can you avoid this same fate? Whenever you face difficult strategic or moral decisions, look to your core ideology: the original intent of your company's founders. The ideology comprises the values, goals and traits that you’ve promised to your customers will never be compromised. Brand-focused companies should only pursue growth and change that is in line with their core ideology. In his bestseller Good to Great, author Jim Collins writes that for truly great brands, the challenge isn’t to find growth opportunities but to decide which ones to pursue. Sometimes a company will be tempted by “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunities, but even then, the company must have the discipline and character to say no, if the opportunity isn’t in line with its core ideology. Remember Krispy Kreme: the company didn’t understand how vital the in-store experience was for its brand and started chasing short-term profits, thereby almost killing its brand. One of the challenges of building a great brand lies in getting your entire company to present a united front to the customer. Big companies may have several departments that deal with customers, and yet the brand must be fully and uniformly integrated into all of them. To achieve this, you need to do two things: First, you need to know all the customer touchpoints where your company interacts with customers. These could be things like packaging, marketing, sales channels, customer support and so forth. The customer experience is based on interactions at those touchpoints, and nothing destroys an otherwise pleasant brand experience like a grumpy customer-support person or a broken website. Of course, the most important touchpoint with the biggest impact is your product. Second, you need to align every touchpoint to your brand values, and then monitor how employees at each touchpoint are living up to these values and how the customer experiences them. The importance of keeping an eye on your touchpoints can be seen in the experiences of REI, an American sports gear retailer. The company discovered that its prices and product information varied greatly between their online and offline stores. Luckily, it reacted quickly and patched up inconsistencies, preventing further damage to its brand. So how can you best design the experience that you want your customers to have at these touchpoints? Think about the details – they are crucial to forming a connection between your brand and your customers. As an example, consider Apple. Thanks to guidance from Mike Markkula, an early investor, Steve Jobs understood that design factors such as product packaging, the feel of a product and even its smell are very important. Taken together, the experience is a kind of theater, a moment that is to be carefully orchestrated to create the perfect customer experience. So far we’ve talked a lot about how building a strong brand is good for a company. But actually it can also be good for the world: “doing good” is a key factor in branding. In 2012, an influential article by branding experts John Gerzema and David Roth proclaimed that as a society, we’re now entering a new era where corporate reputation and brand are becoming the same thing. This means that unlike before, companies can no longer rely solely on hard factors such as innovation, quality and price to form their reputation. Instead, soft factors such as trustworthiness and a sense of responsibility toward people and the environment have become the deciding factors for customers when choosing brands. One study on the matter showed that 73 percent of buyers would switch their current brand to a competing one if the latter supported a good cause. But make sure your company’s charity is generous and doesn’t seem calculated. Otherwise, your actions won’t be perceived as truly “doing good,” and consumers might think you’re merely engaging in greenwashing: reaping profits at any cost with one hand while being superficially charitable with the other. This is especially true if you contribute to random environmental or societal projects in the hope that your actions will distract consumers from the damage your business is responsible for. As an example, consider if oil company BP announced that it was launching a charity project to save 1,000 acres of rainforest. Would you consider BP an environmentally conscious brand, thanks to their efforts? Probably not. Instead, you should make your main goal to create shared value for both your company’s brand and the outside world. To achieve this, only support projects that are relevant to your industry, your community and/or your target group of customers. These projects should also mirror your brand’s ideology. An example would be the “Create Jobs for USA” program undertaken by Starbucks, where the company provided financing for struggling local businesses. This project aligned perfectly with the brand’s socially oriented culture. In an earlier blink, we mentioned that a strong brand can function as a guiding compass for your entire organization, influencing everyday decisions. For this to happen, you need to operationalize your brand strategy, and this requires implementing two brand-building core competences across your entire company. First, you should distribute information regarding your brand and brand strategy to everyone in your organization, and make sure every employee keeps themselves updated on brand information. Make it clear that your brand is your business, not just some little facet of it. This is such a high-priority issue that you should require compliance from employees, for example by holding pop quizzes on brand values. Or you could also reward those employees who demonstrate brand values particularly well. You should also regularly plan activities in which employees learn about and experience the company’s brand values. The brand toolboxes and brand engagement sessions described in an earlier blink are examples of such activities. Second, you need to implement projects that aim at aligning the whole organization with your long-term brand strategy. An example of such a strategy would be the importance of design at Apple, which was internalized by the entire company. These projects must be managed by leaders and evangelists who represent the brand values in your company. They are also in charge of breaking down any barriers to absorbing brand values, such as rigid organizational silos. At Apple, this function was performed by Steve Jobs himself, who was obsessed with design. Now you know that a brand is not only a marketing method but also an invaluable tool for streamlining your organization and making tough strategic decisions. The key message in this book: A brand is more than a mere marketing tool – it’s a guiding compass for a company’s organization and strategy. Strong brands can attract lots of customers, but companies have to be careful to uphold their brand’s integrity and not just chase after trends, growth or every customer segment. Actionable advice: Let your brand shine through your work. You may feel that your company’s brand has little or no impact on your work, but have you ever really tried to let it show? Next time you’re at work, try to think about the brand you’re working for and what impact your work has on it. Ask yourself: Is my work strengthening the brand, is it aligned with the brand’s goals? Also, remember to think about how the customer sees your work: will they know which brand you’re working for? If you put branding front and center in your job, you may well find that your work will become more purposeful and enjoyable.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

It’s a question we’ve all been asking since the 2008 financial crash. Few people are better placed to answer it than Jim Paul, a city trader who went from hero to zero after losing everything by doubling down on a poor investment decision. It’s often said that pride comes before a fall. But the most important lessons are those we learn when we pick ourselves back up. Paul began his journey back to the top by analyzing his previous behavior and asking himself what psychological factors had shaped his decision-making. These blinks examine the lessons Paul learned along the way. You’ll learn why traders make bad choices, the real key to success in turbulent markets and how to make rational – not emotional – investment decisions. In these blinks, you’ll also find out why understanding loss – not making money – is key to success; how following the crowd can lead us astray; and the difference between financial gambling and sound investment strategies. Jim Paul always wanted one thing in life – to make money, as much of it as he could. Decades later, he was on top of the world and had just made $248,000 in a single day. He’d reached the top young and was brimming with self-confidence. Paul landed a job in futures trading and was soon known to everyone on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. An imposing six foot three, he had a big voice and wasn’t afraid to bark out orders. That’s when things started to go wrong. His unshakable self-belief would prove fatal. Paul was interested in the soybean oil market. Supplies were running low, but demand was buoyant. Prices would rise. Anticipating a spike in the market, Paul bought up positions – a commitment to buy at a later date. Sure that he’d read the market correctly, he exceeded the limits on positions set by the Chicago Board of Trade. Paul’s conviction was so great that he managed to persuade his customers, friends and even his office assistant to get on board with his plan. Why wouldn’t they want to be part of it? They were all going to be rich! Then the market started to turn. Paul didn’t budge. Things had been looking good for months. Now there was political instability and the threat of grain sanctions. Bad weather damaged bean crops. Soybean prices began to dip, and Paul’s losses started to mount. For months, he lost $20,000 every day. Both his clients and other traders had already jumped ship, but Paul remained convinced. He knew the market would turn and they’d regret their decision. The writing was on the wall, but Paul was so confident of his skill as a trader that he couldn’t see what was happening. He was about to lose everything. The end finally came when his manager fired him and seized his assets. By that point, he’d already lost $800,000, half of it borrowed from friends. So why did Paul stick to his decision when all the evidence was pointing the other way? We all love the idea of a shortcut to fame and fortune. Head to your local bookstore, and chances are you’ll find plenty of advice on how to get rich. But it’s hard to know who to trust with so many people out there giving tips. So who do you listen to? Sadly, there isn’t a single trick for getting rich. The gurus of the business world are full of sound advice. Unfortunately, much of what they say is contradictory. Ian Templeton, one of the most successful investors of the twentieth century, tells you to “diversify your investments.” Sounds sensible, right? But along comes Warren Buffett with a net worth of $100 billion and tells you the exact opposite. “Concentrate your investments,” he suggests. That’s pretty confusing. Take a look at any of the books out there telling you how to invest, trade and make a fortune, and you’ll know that the greatest multi-millionaire investors don’t agree on much. So what do they see eye to eye on? There’s one bit of vital advice: Don’t lose money! Warren Buffett has two solid rules when it comes to investing. The first? Never lose money. The second: Never forget rule number one. He’s not the only one. Wall Street legend Bernard Baruch’s top tip was to “learn how to take losses quickly and cleanly.” Jim Rogers built a fortune of $300 million. His nugget of wisdom? Don’t lose money. These investors followed their own paths to the top. Getting rich is personal. What they all had in common was that they knew how to minimize their losses. When Paul set about rebuilding his empire, he realized that his future success depended on internalizing this lesson. How should loss be understood? What’s the best way of processing it? Most importantly, how can losses be avoided – or at least minimized? In the following blinks, we’ll take a look at what Paul learned. “Loss” is an unpleasant word. It reminds some of us of departed family members or friends. Even when we’re just reminded of a ball game or a bet, the term has negative connotations. The same psychological reaction affects the behavior of market traders. But there’s nothing inherently wrong with loss. Think of a greengrocer. He knows that one or two apples out of a hundred will be rotten. That’s a loss, sure, but he accepts it as a fact of life and doesn’t get too upset about it. Business is like that. You sometimes lose. The problem is that people often take it personally when they lose in the markets. They feel they did something wrong and have trouble accepting and controlling their losses. We all hate making mistakes. That makes it easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. Emotions can cloud our judgments and make matters worse. Take the soybean market. Your analysis tells you that prices will rise so you decide to buy. But then they start to fall. You’ve lost $100,000, and your investment is looking shaky. What do you do? A coldly rational thinker will tell you that your analysis was flawed and that the best tactic is to cut your losses. Walk away and take the hit just like the greengrocer when he finds a rotten apple. Traders, however, don’t always follow cold logic. They’re humans like the rest of us! They make emotional decisions and take it personally. Where does that leave them? They can say, “I’ve made a mistake and lost $100,000 because of it.” Or they can double down on their original decision and say, “the market is wrong, and I’m right, it’s just a matter of time before it turns around.” Admitting mistakes is never easy. That’s why traders ignore the evidence and wait for the market to shift. The danger is that it often won’t. And when that happens, an acceptable loss quickly snowballs into something much more serious. Imagine playing heads or tails and betting on the outcome. You toss a coin six times and get a straight run of heads. How’s the coin going to come up on the seventh toss? It has to be tails, right? Even though it might seem like a statistical inevitability, it simply isn’t true. It’s logical fallacies like this which make it so inevitable that we’ll make bad calls about the likelihood of different outcomes. Logic tells us that there’s a fifty–fifty chance of heads every round and that no single throw has any bearing on the next. But we’re not creatures of pure logic. We want to see patterns where none exist. Traders do this all the time. Say you’ve invested in lumber, but it’s having a bad run. The price dips one day, then again the next, and again the day after that... Reason tells you to reevaluate your investment. But basic human psychology isn’t like that. “If you just hold out a bit longer,” it whispers, “the market is sure to turn.” At that point, you’re not using reason to assess the market – you’re gambling. Irrationality of this kind is risky enough when it comes to discrete events. It’s even more hazardous when it comes to continuous events. A discrete event is a one-off. Like a horse race or a game of blackjack, it has a predefined beginning and end. You might regret betting on the wrong horse or card, but your losses are fixed. You play once and you lose once. But what if you were betting on a horse race that stopped and restarted every 100 meters? Your horse is bringing up the rear after the first hundred meters, but number nine now looks like a good bet. You swap horses, and the race resumes. Imagine it continues in the same way, and new bets are placed after every section of the race. You can play – and lose – again and again. Because you can now keep betting indefinitely, the risk of accumulating ever-larger losses is much higher. Markets are a bit like a horse race without a finish line. Our psychological make-up predisposes us to make bad calls in a situation where the opportunity to place new bets is unlimited. No wonder traders sometimes keep racking up losses until they face a disastrous wipeout! If you’ve ever watched a game of soccer, you’ll have seen supporters in the stands bellowing at the referee and the opposite team’s players. It doesn’t change a thing, and few of us would ever dream of behaving in the same way in another setting. So what’s so special about a soccer match? We feel powerful and uninhibited in a crowd, and that’s an infectious feeling. We copy each other when we’re part of a crowd, and we enjoy seeing our actions mirrored by others. It’s a form of affirmation. That’s why a chant or a Mexican wave spreads like wildfire through the stands of a stadium. But because it’s contagious, crowd behavior can also be dangerous. That’s especially true when it’s fear that’s animating the crowd. We’re much more likely to take our cue from others when we’re motivated by a fear of missing out on something. If we’re scared of losing money or think there’s an opportunity to make it, we’re more likely to follow the crowd. Traders know this better than most – many of their worst decisions are the result of a crowd mentality! A classic example of this is the Dutch tulip mania of the seventeenth century. Traders in the Netherlands were obsessed with tulips, and the price of bulbs skyrocketed. Soon enough, a single bulb was worth as much as the average person earned in a decade. This was crowd behavior in its purest form. People bought tulips because everyone else was doing the same thing. The bubble burst, and investors were wiped out. Hindsight is twenty–twenty. “Why on earth did I put so much money into tulips?” many must have thought after the frenzy had subsided. “Tulips aren’t worth that much!” But as we also know from soccer matches, it’s hard to remain calm and collected when the crowd is going wild. Emotions take control when you’re in the moment and following the lead of those around you. You don’t have to be part of a physical crowd to be affected in this way. The crowd is also a state of mind. We’re part of it every time we make a snap decision on the back of a bit of advice we heard or an article we read about the latest investment craze. The investment-banking firm Morgan Stanley enjoyed a great run of success throughout the 1980s and 1990s. What was their secret? In a word, planning. Morgan Stanley was known in the business for its forensic attention to detail. Both best- and worst-case scenarios were included in its scrupulous planning process. There were occasional complaints that this slowed the firm down. But as one of the firm’s traders put it, “we don’t make mistakes.” The reason for this painstaking planning was simple. A good plan reduces the likelihood of emotions taking over the decision-making process later on. To prevent that, it’s vital that you ask yourself the big questions before you invest. What sort of investments will you be making – long-term or short-term? What rules will you set to guide your decisions? Will you be the sort of trader who waits for timber prices to hit a predetermined target before buying? Or are you more likely to be the investor who offloads their soybean portfolio when bad weather has been forecast? Don’t just answer these questions in your head. It’s important to put pen to paper so that you’ll have a mission statement to refer to if things go south. A plan is a good start, but you’ll also need a trusted source of information. Solid investment decisions are based on a clear-eyed analysis of the situation rather than the hearsay of the crowd. Start with the facts, not your hunches. Whether you choose to base your analysis on recent stock-volume figures or price-to-earnings ratios, it’s important to stick to your sources if you want to avoid following Jim Paul’s example of doubling down on a bad decision despite all the evidence. As the famous psychologist Edward de Bono once observed, “a person will use his thinking to keep himself right.” So don’t rely on your thoughts or emotions — focus on the facts. A solid plan is essential, but it’s not enough. In our next blink, we’ll turn to the final building block of success. It’s hard to stop when you’re having fun in a casino. Sure, you might have lost a little money but the night is still young, the drinks are flowing and who knows – your luck might just turn. But as anyone who’s been in that situation will tell you, the easiest way to lose money is to fail to get out in time. Take Bob. He’s a trader who trusts his gut. He got a great deal on timber and snapped plenty of it up at $30. He knows it’s going to hit $50 by the end of the month. Nice work if you can get it! Then the market takes a nosedive, and timber hits $20. “Well, that’s markets for you,” Bob thinks. “I’m in it for the long haul; I’ll get my money back soon enough.” His pals on the trading floor all agree that the price will recover and Bob sticks it out. When it plummets to $10 months later, he’s forced to accept a massive loss. So what was Bob’s mistake? He racked up unnecessary additional losses because he didn’t have a fixed exit strategy. We’ve seen that markets are a lot like a horse race without a finish line. It’s up to you to turn this continuous event into a one-off. That means setting a limit on how much you’re willing to risk losing and getting out once you hit that point. You can set your threshold in different ways. You might want to peg it to a concrete figure or a performance indicator like a percentage reduction in trade volume. Or you could keep it simple and say you’ll get out by a specific date. Whatever you choose, planning your exit before you enter a market is the only surefire way of ensuring that your decisions won’t be affected by emotions, logical fallacies or the behavior of the crowd. The art of sound investment is knowing how to cut your losses and get out in time. Plan your exit before you enter the market. How much can you afford to lose? Once you’ve got a number, stick to it – it’s the only way that you’ll know you’re making reasoned decisions, not following your gut or the crowd. The key message in these blinks: Financial losses quickly spiral out of control when we make emotional decisions and don’t think clearly. Careful, rational planning sets you up for success. There are a hundred ways to get rich, but there’s one thing everyone who has made – and kept – their fortune has in common: they know how to avoid and minimize losses.  Actionable advice Analyze your decision-making process Take a moment to think about how you make your financial decisions. Do you always start out with a clear plan and guidelines to which you can refer later? Or do you sometimes make impulsive decisions or find yourself going along with the crowd? Be honest! Remember, to err is human. But once you start recognizing how emotions can get the better of logic and start dictating decision-making, you’ll have taken the first step to making better decisions.

The consequences of doing so can be dire, as was demonstrated by the author in 2005, when he purchased a Dell laptop. Disappointed with the customer service he got in response to a support request, the author posted a rant on his blog about his experience. Soon, many other dissatisfied customers started chiming in, and the blog post became highly prominent in Google searches for Dell. Steadily, Dell’s situation worsened. This kind of scenario is exactly where angry customers can do a lot of damage to a brand. Dell believed its customers should provide feedback only via Dell’s site and on Dell’s terms, but it turned out that customers were already talking among themselves elsewhere on their own terms. The author later sent an open letter of advice to Dell, telling them that losing a single customer today can have large knock-on effects, as that customer will likely go on to tell all of his or her friends about the poor experience as well.  And in today’s connected world, a single customer can have a lot of friends. This means companies no longer have any place to hide; every mistake they make is made public instantly via the Internet. Leave a customer on hold for too long? Expect to read public, angry rants about it online very soon. So if you are running a company, what can you do? The main thing is to ensure you provide excellent and fast customer service, as this can prevent and repair any damage. Talk to unhappy customers and try to understand and fix their problems. Remember, the fact that a customer bought your product indicates he wants to like it. If you solve the problem, he may well spread the word of this good service. Also, read blogs where your customers talk about your products. This way you’ll stay tuned in to what your customers think of your product without having to spend a fortune on consumer research. Next, you’ll find out about even more ways to involve your customers in your business. Ask yourself, who cares most about a company’s products? Why, the customers of course. This is why companies are increasingly trying involve their customers in the creation of their products. Companies used to believe that to have a competitive advantage, they should keep their plans totally secret. However, today it is openness and interaction with customers that creates a competitive advantage. For example, by blogging openly about their plans, a company can get valuable feedback and new ideas from their customers. The founder of Dell, Michael Dell, saw this opportunity when he said, “I'm sure there's a lot of things that I can't even imagine but our customers can imagine.” Indeed, in 2007 Dell launched IdeaStorm, a website where customers can contribute their ideas to Dell. An example of an idea that came to fruition through this site is that Dell now sells Linux computers. Similarly, almost every new service that Google offers is initially in beta form, meaning it is an experimental product that customers can test and provide feedback on, thereby helping Google to improve it. Another area where companies can benefit from interacting with customers is in marketing: happy customers willingly advertise and recommend products they like to friends. For proof, look no further than Google; it became the fastest growing company in history primarily through word of mouth, not through marketing. As you’ll find out next, word of mouth also means you’ll have to stay totally honest with your customers. Not long ago, companies used to be obsessed with secrecy regarding their products and especially regarding their mistakes. Today, neither companies nor anyone else in the public eye can afford to lie. Consider an example from the media world. In 2004, the journalist Dan Rather presented military documents critical of President George W. Bush’s military service. Bloggers suspected these documents were fake, and eventually one blogger proved it. Instead of immediately admitting the mistake, Rather chose to ignore the comment storm that arose for eleven days, and then dismissed his critics as being politically motivated. This fuelled even more criticism, as today’s post-media generation has been raised on honesty and directness, and therefore expects others to tell the truth as well. So how should companies behave in this new open and transparent world? They should be honest. If you run a company, admit your mistakes openly, as this will increase your credibility. For example, bloggers informed Reuters in 2006 that one of its photographers had doctored a photo of Beirut during Israeli bombardments. In response, Reuters removed the photo, fired the photographer and thanked the bloggers. This is the correct approach to dealing with mistakes. Of course, the other side of the coin is to ensure you do only those things that you would be willing to admit publicly. As Google’s motto says, “Don’t be evil.” For Google, this means they deliver unbiased search results and clearly indicate when they are advertising something. In today’s transparent world, whatever benefits you may get from doing something “evil” will be outweighed by the the costs when word spreads. Remember, everything you say and do can be easily found on Google. In fact, you could consider Google to be the angel on your shoulder, reminding you of how important it is to stay honest. Next, find out how you can become more prominent on Google.   The lifeblood of any website is the traffic it gets, and the most important channel to get visitors from is Google. People ask questions on Google, and from there find their way to the websites that answer them. So if you run a website, how can you generate more traffic? First of all, your site should be very informative; this way it will attract people with questions. In fact, you should try to have answers for every relevant question you can imagine. For example, people often look for things like product details and support information on manufacturers’ sites opinions and voting records on politician’s sites nutritional info on food companies’ sites To learn more about which answers you should provide on your site, look at the searches that lead people to your website. These will tell you what people are looking for. Consider the example of About.com, a content service featuring over a million helpful, focused and usually timeless articles about niche topics from car repair to thyroid disease. The service comprises 700 sites maintained by independent writers who are taught how to craft headlines, page titles and keywords so Google will find them more easily. Writers also monitor which queries visitors use so they can answer new questions preemptively. Another way to get more traffic is to make your site Google-friendly by improving your PageRank – otherwise known as drinking “Googlejuice.” It’s like a magic, virtuous-cycle-inducing elixir that sends lots of traffic to you, which increases the number of clicks, links and mentions you get, thereby pushing your PageRank even higher. So how can you make your site more Google-friendly? Make the presentation of information on your site simple and clear for both your customers and for Google’s computers, so the message cannot be obscured or misunderstood. And forget about fancy gimmicks like animations and sounds; they annoy most people, and Google won’t recognize most of it anyway. Next, you’ll find out how the Internet has completely changed the face of how media functions. The Internet has brought with it some profound changes to the media landscape. The fact that the pages of different websites can be linked to each other has changed the way media functions; it is now more collaborative, and information flows in two directions. For example, consider the author’s experiences on 9/11: He was close to the World Trade Center when the first plane hit, and could talk to survivors on site. He later used his notes to start a blog about the experience. Bloggers in Los Angeles read his work, wrote about it on their own blogs and linked to him. He in turn responded and linked back to them. This is the new structure of the media: everyone can speak their mind, and everyone can listen and chime in. These kinds of distributed conversations that happen in different places at different times have been made possible by the linking of pages and information online. The ability to link content online is also driving specialization. For example, in the age of print media journalists had to include background paragraphs in their stories to fill the reader in on what had happened so far, but today they can simply provide links to earlier articles. Also, they no longer need to have specialist reporters on niche topics like golf, as they can simply link to other sites for better and cheaper coverage. These factors allow newspapers to specialize and focus on what they’re good at. This specialization drives both more collaboration and higher quality, as people can focus on what they do well and let others “fill in the blanks” with what they do well. Companies should take note of this: focus on what you do best, and link to the rest. For example, for customers seeking product info, retailers should link to the manufacturer, and manufacturers should link to forums and blogs where other customers are already discussing their products. Find out what types of businesses are most successful online in the next blink. The rise of the Internet has allowed people and companies to collaborate and form networks in an unprecedented way. Savvy companies and individuals can take advantage of this. Founding such a network can be very profitable, because each member will contribute to the network and add value to it. Similarly, joining such a network is beneficial, since every member can benefit from this kind of collaboration. The bigger the network, the more valuable it tends to be. An example of such a network is Glam, comprising 600 independent sites covering women’s fashion, health, celebrities and so forth. It has become an extremely popular network of curated content and advertising, with over 81 million users worldwide. Sites that join Glam get prestige because the network is so selective. This translates into added traffic, because sites within the Glam network send users to other sites within the network, thus multiplying the effect. Glam then profits by selling advertisements on these sites, for which they can charge a premium because advertisers know that their ads will appear in high-quality environments. Another successful way to build an online business today is to provide a platform for others to build on. A successful platform allows users to create products, businesses, communities and networks of their own on top of that platform. A good example is Google Maps. After launching, the service was so handy to users that an old-school mindset would have dictated that Google keep it on its own site and maintain control of it. Instead, Google allowed other sites to embed Google Maps on their pages and even to create apps based on it. For example, one coder developed a new app that combined Craigslist ads and Google Maps. Google didn’t sue him for using and altering their product in an unauthorized manner; they hired him. Because businesses can use the platform so freely, they have become very invested in it, making it difficult for Microsoft or Yahoo to lure them away. Google Maps has become the standard in map services and local information. Next, find out why niche markets are on the rise. It used to be thought that the pinnacle of success for any company was to sell their product to the mass market: everyone, everywhere. But today, selling to the mass market is no longer an option.The abundance of different and customizable products on the Internet allows everyone to find the products they want instead of settling for generic ones. There is no mass market anymore; there is just an infinite number of small market niches. Therefore, you should focus your resources on serving your niche well rather than serving the masses poorly. One consequence of this is that small companies are usurping the formerly dominant position of big companies. Certainly, big companies are still alive and well: Wal-Mart is the largest company on Earth, media companies are forming huge conglomerates, and even Google itself is a behemoth among other companies. But small companies are on the rise. Consider, for example, that in 2007, small stores sold $60 billion worth of goods through eBay. While this is still peanuts compared to Wal-Mart’s $345 billion turnover, it does beat Federated, America’s largest department store chain, which sold only $26 billion worth of goods. Another example is the rise of blogs. In 2006, blogs as a whole already had a total 57 million readers, whereas only 50 million people were buying daily newspapers two years later. The reason behind the rise of small businesses is that today it is easier for a small business to succeed than it was for a large one before. You no longer need a store, an inventory, staff and advertising to be in retail; you can simply find customers on eBay, Amazon and Google. Without these costs, profits accrue quickly. Next, did you know that many companies are in the knowledge business, even if they don’t seem to be? As companies learn more and more about their customers, some savvy companies like Amazon and Google are putting that knowledge to good use. At the same time, they are minimizing the costly and complicated handling of physical products and materials. For example, did you know that Amazon is not in the business of selling goods; it’s actually in the knowledge business? In fact, Amazon’s strategy is to deliberately deal with as few physical goods as possible. They don’t own any stores or employ any sales clerks, and keep their inventory to a minimum by obtaining more merchandise as it is ordered by customers. They have no shipping infrastructure of their own, preferring to use external services where they get great rates thanks to their enormous volumes. All this creates savings, which they pass on to customers to drive even more volume. So how is Amazon in the knowledge business? They have an excellent database of what their customers buy, when they buy it and what other items they buy with it. This allows Amazon to predict what a customer might need next. Also, they are able to use millions of reviews written by customers to further fine-tune their offerings. Though Google provides a broad array of services, it too is essentially in the knowledge business. It provides not only a search engine but also email, document management and map services, along with others; and yet this is not where its profits come from. They come from targeted advertising, which is made profitable because Google knows more about us than any other organization. It has achieved this by offering many services for free and then collecting data on the users of those services. Every company should think carefully about what the true value is that they provide to their customers. It is probably not the physical products you sell, but rather what you know, how you serve or how you anticipate the needs of customers. As you’ll find out next, this could mean you can even provide your main product for free. Just a few years ago, the idea of a business being profitable while providing its services for free seemed impossible. But today, this is a common phenomenon. This is because it is entirely possible to provide the actual product or service for free while making money through advertising. A good example of this is the New York Times. In 2005, the newspaper erected a paywall on its website, asking readers to pay $50 a year to read columns and access archives. The result? Profits were never openly reported, but most likely they were dismal. In 2007, the change was reversed, and immediately more visitors flocked to the site, thereby bringing in more links and clicks and improving the site’s Google ranking. The paper could then make more money from advertising to this expanded audience. Free and low-cost services are also proliferating because they are vital for networks to thrive. This is why the fastest-growing network-based companies like Skype, eBay, Facebook, Amazon and Google charge as little as possible. They know that no-one can compete against a great free service. Craigslist is also a great example of how offering a free service can grow a network. They only charge for posting job listings, while all other listings are free. This has made it the go-to marketplace for most listings, and no competitor can undercut it since the service is already free.   The key message in this book: The rise of the Internet has profoundly changed the way business is conducted. Companies must embrace the new transparency this brings and start taking advantage of it by collaborating with their customers as well with each other. Small, nimble companies are on the rise to cater to the new, highly-fragmented market of niches. Actionable advice from the book: Consider making your company’s main product or service free Most companies still labor under the assumption that they must sell something to survive. Challenge this assumption. What if you had to give away your main product for free? What would that mean for your customers? Where could you then make money? Capture the wisdom of the crowd Today, people online are openly discussing their needs, desires and experiences about products and services. This is a valuable source of information that every company should tap into. Start reading what the crowd relevant to your business is saying. Ask them about your products, or get them to test the products. This is far better than using focus groups, because the people who are already discussing your products clearly have something to say.      ","headers":["The rise of the Internet has made good, fast customer service a necessity.","Involve your customers in making and marketing your products.","To succeed today, companies must communicate honestly and admit mistakes openly.","Make your site informative and Google-friendly to help many more people find it.","Links between web pages have changed the structure of media: they drive specialization, quality and cooperation.","The way to build a business in the Internet age is to join a network or provide a platform for others to build networks on.","The age of big companies selling to the mass market is over; small specialized companies are on the rise.","Successful companies like Amazon and Google focus on the knowledge business: how what they know can benefit their customers.","Today, many successful businesses and networks operate by providing their main services for free.","Final summary"],"category":"Entrepreneurship","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/52e8d6e2363532000c170000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"The age of the Internet has dawned, but very few companies seem to understand how profoundly it has changed the business landscape and what they must do to thrive.

It’s changed from something that made us proud to something embarrassing. We loathe hospitals and doctor visits. It’s hard to get appointments, they make us wait too long, and then we end up with exorbitant bills and a referral to see someone else. Why does it seem like nobody ever thinks of the actual patients/customers? Why can’t the whole system be simpler and more straightforward? In Where Does It Hurt?, Jonathan Bush explains how entrepreneurship can save the day. Customers and patients need people with great ideas to give them more choices than massive, monopolistic hospitals, whose day in the sun is over. After reading these blinks, you'll have learned why LASIK surgery should be the model for the whole health care system; why investors don’t invest as much in digital health care start-ups; and how simple it is to find a niche for your own health care business. Big research hospitals function almost like department stores: you go there for all your medical needs. So why aren’t there any “boutique” hospitals to compete with this model? Everyone knows that hospital visits are frustrating. Parking is difficult, service is usually bad, medical records go missing, waiting takes hours and bills are unbelievably high. Each of those problems means a market opportunity for a competitor to offer something better, at a lower cost. This happened when LASIK eye correction surgery was introduced in 1991. It was expensive and considered very risky, so it wasn’t covered by most insurance plans. People had to pay if they wanted it. So LASIK operators had to provide the best possible service at affordable prices in order to woo customers. This enabled the industry to advance – LASIK’s process now has a 95 percent satisfaction rate. This should be a model for the whole health care system: when there’s competition, customers win. The health care industry would be improved by more openness. We need more choices. People should be able to decide for themselves how much their insurance covers, instead of being forced to accept an all-inclusive plan that includes services they won’t use. What if you had the option of being covered only for big accidents, or curable serious illnesses? And for other services like dentists, you could choose the best providers? Entrepreneurs also need the freedom to develop ways of providing higher quality health care. They need more access to medical information, for instance, which is often guarded by hospitals. If people had more chances to choose smaller, entrepreneurial medical care like LASIK, they could avoid the problems associated with bigger hospitals. This, in turn, would push hospitals to improve their services and hold onto their patients (or “customers”). So how can this sort of openness improve our current system? We need a whole network of hospitals, regional clinics, medical practitioners and other health service providers. Other businesses can benefit from the health care industry’s shortcomings by offering alternatives. Traditional businesses can compete with hospitals. The author’s company, Athenahealth, is an example of this. Athenahealth takes on giant hospitals by offering affordable information services that hospitals won’t provide. This makes their services more accessible for customers. Imagine if we had a whole network of businesses like this. It would be a nightmare for big hospitals. In a market economy, prices would be more transparent and shoppers would have more choices. Hospitals would find it much harder to draw business from people who aren’t gravely ill. Some hospitals would disappear; others would specialize. If you needed a CT scan and it cost $500 at a world-class hospital, but $150 at a new imaging center in the mall, which would you choose? If someone can shop around, they’ll find better alternatives. This is already happening in some places. There’s a rapidly growing new generation of community hospitals, health-oriented start-ups and retailers. In 2010, Cerberus Capital, a private-equity firm in Massachusetts, bought a chain of six Catholic community hospitals and turned them into a for-profit business called Steward Health. Steward Health has since grown to 11 hospitals, illustrating how successful the model can be. Retailers like Walgreens are also beginning to provide medical services. They already know what consumers want, and they have access to their loyalty data. CVS has around 800 “Minute Clinics,” where shoppers can drop in to get basic medical services without an appointment. We need more diversity in health care options like this, so patients can choose what’s most appropriate for their needs and budget. When there are better services available, hospitals will have to catch up. One reason hospitals are so unpleasant and crowded is that they’re full of people who don’t need to be there. How can we prevent this? We need more primary care in our lives. “Primary care” is the basic care you get from a doctor you see regularly. Your primary doctor tends to every aspect of your health, and refers you to a specialist when necessary. The better your primary doctor knows you, the less specialists have to establish using their expensive equipment. Many people, however, go to specialists too early – they don’t visit their primary doctors enough. Rushika Fernandopulle, a leader in health care reform, met a woman who was taking 27 kinds of medicine prescribed by 11 different specialists. Four of the prescriptions were the same, and each specialist focused on only one part of her health. The woman insisted it wasn’t possible to take all 27, so she’d dip her hand into her medicine jar and ask God to guide her to choose the correct five. This could’ve been very dangerous if she’d selected four of the same kind. More primary care would prevent situations like this. We need to be healthier across the board, instead of focusing on problem areas. In other words, we need a kind of wraparound care. Fernandopulle’s work with Boeing also illustrates the necessity of wraparound care. Fernandopulle found that many Boeing employees were chronically ill, and wasting the equivalent of what the company would spend at the Ritz on hospitals. He coached them to treat their illnesses themselves, by doing things like improving their diet and monitoring their blood sugar. This made them healthier and reduced the cost for Boeing. If primary care becomes a bigger part of our lives, we won’t just respond to any illness we get – we’ll be healthier in general. So what’s the role of technology in all this? Can it help us improve the health care system? Big hospitals have massive budgets, so they can afford pretty much all the highly priced equipment they need. The market of opportunity for entrepreneurs is the “middle class” of the health care market: the companies and small health practitioners with budgets in the tens or hundreds of thousands. If you can provide that middle class with something they need and can afford, you’ll get a foothold in the industry. This kind of disruption in the market could lead to the health care revolution we need. In general, the health care industry moves slowly, and it’s resistant to changes – including technological change. In fact, only $1.4 billion was invested in health-oriented digital start-ups in 2012, compared to $2.7 trillion in other digital start-ups. How can we overcome this? Firstly, people need more access to affordable, simple apps or services that assist in health care or hospital visits – services like Beyond Lucid. Beyond Lucid allows medics and ambulance crews to send data and electronic records straight to doctors at the ER, so they can be ready for the patient with the appropriate team and technology. It’s a rather basic electronic communication link, but hospitals don’t have it yet! RegisterPatient.com is a similar service. It lets people sign up for appointments online, and fill out their forms for registration or prescription. It’s very simple, but it makes a big difference to the customers, who won’t have to spend so much time waiting at the hospital. Beyond Lucid and RegisterPatient.com illustrate how health care technology can improve our current situation. Right now, however, it needs a way into the market. How many people know their blood pressure level? Or the results of a medical test they had months ago? Medical information is vitally important, but it’s agonizingly complicated to access it from hospitals. We need our data ready at our fingertips. Patients need easy access to their medical records. Thanks to technology, health care data could be produced in much greater amounts. People will browse their test results on their phones, and link it to data from their jogging routines, diets, vitamin intake or sleep patterns. Medical data will simply be another part of our lives, and having easier access to it will have a huge effect on the industry. First, medical practices will run their businesses more effectively. They’ll be more able to optimize their resources, run smoothly and get paid when they can find information quickly. More data will also help doctors, and allow medical researchers to examine society as a whole. They’ll be able to study how people are eating and exercising, or which medicines are working for which groups of people. All in all, it will be much easier to get the right medicine, therapy and health care advice to each individual person. An interesting feature of this new medical data is that it might be produced primarily outside medical establishments. This is why companies like Google, Apple and Intel are getting involved. If we had more data to bring to our annual checkups, we wouldn’t have to rely on our memory for the details of our health. Doctors would be better equipped to serve us. Intel, for instance, now offers a health surveillance service for the elderly. It can record their pathways through the house, the strength of their voices, their sleeping and bathroom patterns. This data is stored on computers, but soon it’ll be able to alert people to early signs of disease. The key message in this book: Medical patients, as customers, need more choices. Big hospitals charge exorbitant bills and provide sub-par service, but we’re forced to use them. Entrepreneurs need the space to provide us with better alternatives. More private health care services could bring on the health care revolution we need. Actionable advice: Visit your primary doctor often. Don’t wait until you have a serious problem to seek out medical care, and don’t go straight to a specialist before seeing your regular doctor. The better your primary doctor knows your health, the more time and money you’ll save by avoiding unnecessary hospitals trips.

From the many clever inventions of Benjamin Franklin and the industrial entrepreneurs of the nineteenth century to modern day IT giants like Apple and Microsoft, the United States has always been at the forefront of entrepreneurship and innovation.  What made this possible? One thing: free market capitalism. In the United States, anyone with a vision and a willingness to work hard can capitalize on his idea and create a better society, without government and bureaucracy getting in the way.  This is changing apace, however, and the United States is beginning to lose its position as the world leader of innovation. It is not the country it once was, and unless we take action, the United States will be outdistanced by its competitors. Luckily, as these blinks will show you, there are ways to stop that from happening.  In these blinks, you’ll learn why Obama is dead wrong about inventors; why the United States needs to change back to its old patent system; and why glass blowers used to be thrown in prison. Have you ever heard of tinkerpreneurs? The term may be unfamiliar, but it’s more than likely that their ideas and work are present in several aspects of your life. Inventors that are part-tinkerers, part-entrepreneurs, tinkerpreneurs have chosen to take their inventions out of the laboratory and bring them into the commercial world to create companies, jobs and profit.  According to President Barack Obama, inventors are nothing special. They aren’t smarter than the rest of us, nor do they work harder. Public efforts such as schools, roads and bridges are all that underlie their success. But nothing could be further from the truth. In contrast to what Obama thinks, tinkerpreneurs are in fact engaged, clever and determined. They are the ones who create jobs and build companies, not merely the people who work those jobs or for those companies.  Tinkerpreneurs take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the United States to invent and invest. As makers and creators, tinkerpreneurs constitute the top one percent. They enable both progress and growth. And yet, theirs is a profession fraught with challenges. When people become inventors, what are they aspiring to? A place in history? Money? Progress for society? For tinkerpreneurs, all three of these dreams are vital, because, for them, inventing is about doing business. And business means being opportunistic.  One tinkerpreneur that exemplifies this is Tony Maglica. Born in Croatia, this aspiring inventor came to the United States with hardly anything to his name. He took up and excelled in a position as a contractor, working harder, faster and longer than the others. This earned him a reputation for skill and integrity.  During a job for a flashlight manufacturer, Maglica saw his opportunity; in response to the poor quality of existing flashlights, he created the first Maglite – a revolutionary flashlight with a bright and focusable light.  And Maglica didn’t stop there. He strove constantly to improve and expand the product. His hard work and opportunistic attitude led Maglite to become a multi-billion dollar company. But innovation also comes from looking at ideas from a different perspective. Many products wouldn’t exist today without a change in perspective that turned an invention into a commercial product. Consider air conditioning, for example.  Inventor Willis Carrier was responsible for inventing a new approach to cooling systems. Rather than cooling with ice, which caused problems due to the resulting humidity, Carrier used air in his cooling systems. He improved his products steadily, and was doing fairly well. But without Irvine Lyle, Carrier’s invention wouldn’t have had the astonishing impact that it did.  Lyle was the creative salesman who imagined growing commercial applications for Carrier’s work. These allowed factories as well as cinemas to operate in the summer heat, which resulted in a new phenomenon: summer blockbusters. Air conditioning even changed where and when people worked, allowing people to move to hotter states, such as Texas.  Air conditioning is one example of innovation succeeding brilliantly. It doesn’t always unfold that way, however. Innovation involves several risks, especially on the part of the tinkerpreneur. The world is full of party poopers, and if you’re a tinkerpreneur, you have to be prepared to fight them. The story of the Roebling family is a good example of how true tinkerpreneurs stick to their guns. John Roebling, who would go on to patent a revolutionary wire rope, came from Prussia. There, he had first-hand experience with how time-consuming and wasteful the rope-making process was. He also noticed that no procedures could be improved without government approval. The Prussian government favored conformity over creativity, so Roebling moved to the United States, where he patented and promoted his invention with great success. But soon, he met another obstacle. Instead of a rigid government, it was the hemp rope industry that felt threatened by his success. Fortunately, the detractors were no match for Roebling’s compelling invention.  His ropes were used in the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge, the world’s first railway bridge of its kind. But then, Roebling’s ropes were put to the biggest test yet: the support of the Brooklyn Bridge. Unfortunately, John Roebling was killed in an accident during construction, and the responsibility of fighting off naysayers, big businesses, technophobes and political power brokers now lay with Roebling’s son, Washington. Washington worked hard and risked a lot to defend his wire rope against its critics. In fact, he overworked himself, getting decompression sickness in the process. However, his wife Emily saw the project through to completion, ultimately showing all naysayers just how wrong they were. The Roeblings fought for their ideas, and it’s good they did too! Otherwise, we’d never have iconic landmarks such as the Brooklyn Bridge. Sometimes the innovations with the biggest impacts are the result of the simplest solutions. Take the humble crown cap, a little invention that made it possible to seal bottles safely, hygienically and cheaply.  William Painter, inventor of the crown cap, also faced critics and naysayers. To prove that his crown cap really did keep soda fresh, he shipped bottles closed with the cap to South America and back – a trip of 40 days – and celebrated their return with a tasting. Everyone agreed that the soda tasted as if it had been freshly bottled. Disposable and incredibly cost-effective, his invention became the industry standard, and the beverage industry was revolutionized.  But William Painter’s influence did not stop there. He had some of the most creative minds working for him – among them a man named King Gillette. Gillette shared Painter’s passion for invention, which sparked a deep and lasting friendship. Painter’s innovations even inspired Gillette to develop another radically simple invention: a steel razor that, just like the crown cap, was disposable. Gillette’s razors were patented in 1904. A mere five years later, they has become a household item worldwide. And he didn’t stop there. In 1910 he brought the first razor designed for women to market.  Painter and Gillette's relationship is just one example of the innovation that is brought about when tinkerpreneurs surround themselves with creative minds and gifted salespeople. As we’ve seen, invention is seldom a solitary job. Two heads are almost always better than one. Just consider Edward Libbey and Michael Owens, the team responsible for changing the way we produce glass.  Owens was an engineer; Libbey promoted and defended property rights. In an industry as cut-throat and secretive as the glass industry, Owens and Libbey wouldn’t have had success if they hadn’t had each other.  Guilds and labor unions fiercely guarded the secrets of glass production. In Venice, in the Middle Ages, glass blowers were often imprisoned on the island of Murano to ensure that their secrets didn’t leak. Owens and Libbey were determined to break through these protective forces and develop a more efficient and practical way of producing glass. And their persistence paid off. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Owens and Libbey’s machine-made bottles revolutionized the soda business.  We find another example of innovative collaboration in the story of scientist Nikola Tesla and investor George Westinghouse. Tesla worked on systems using and producing variable current electricity, or AC. Today, AC is the world standard. But without Westinghouse, this wouldn’t be the case.  Together, Tesla and Westinghouse took on their main opponent: Thomas Edison, who promoted DC systems. DC systems were ineffective, especially over long distances. But Edison had friends in high places. By combining Westinghouse’s determination and financial support with Tesla’s discoveries, the two paved their path to success.  Thanks to their resilience, the AC system prevailed, benefiting not only Westinghouse and Tesla but the whole of society. Industries such as the automotive industry would be very different today without the cheap production of electricity that Tesla and Westinghouse made possible. From their tale, it’s plain to see that innovation can be revolutionary when it succeeds. So why are certain authorities putting innovation in danger today? That’s what we’ll look at next. The United States used to be a paradise for innovation. Why? Because of the US patent system – a unique structure that boosted small-scale inventors and allowed their innovations to be used throughout the world.  Established way back in 1790, the US patent system is market-based. The underlying idea is that financial reward fuels innovation, and that therefore patent holders should be entitled to sell, license or assign patents to others for monetary gain. In return, inventors agree to public disclosure and an expiration of the patent after a limited time period.  This allowed for broad dissemination and ever-increasing numbers of innovative inventions. In the end the personal gain was supported to advance public welfare. But today, this vital system is under threat of reform.  In recent years, the US patent system made the shift from a “first to invent” to “first to sign” approach. This means that what now matters most is not who first came up with the idea but who first signed the patent papers. This small policy change has huge implications.  First off, large corporations now enjoy a huge advantage. They can allow themselves to sign more patents, even if they aren’t sure they’ll bring profit. Small inventors need money to file a patent and have to improve their innovation to see its true potential. And if they are not first to sign, they lose it all.  Unfortunately for our tinkerpreneurs, innovation and creativity are steadily weakening as a result of government regulation. A free market where every individual is allowed to earn money, work together and invent boldly is the key to a progressive society – and those are the rights that we’re being stripped of. The key message in this book: For over a century, tinkerpreneurs have combined the genius of inventors with bold opportunism to give their inventions commercial success, often revolutionizing industries while they’re at it. Collaboration and a supportive patent system has allowed tinkerpreneurs to flourish in the United States; new reforms, however, may end the tinkerpreneurial era.  Actionable advice: Who built this!?

You have an innovative idea and want to build a business around that idea. But, more importantly, you want it to succeed; you want it to defy gravity and soar toward the stars. But before an idea can pick up speed and really take flight, you first need to get it off the ground – and that’s where these blinks come into the picture. From aligning your business brainchild with your personal goals to making your plans financially viable, these blinks will make sure that your brilliant idea is ready for take-off. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to identify your strengths; why you probably shouldn’t create a website for food trucks if you don’t own a food truck; and how to speak the language of your customers. What’s the first order of business for any young entrepreneur before starting her business? Is it getting funding? Or maybe printing business cards? Actually, the first step involves going much deeper; the entrepreneur needs to investigate how her idea will support her desired lifestyle. Before turning any idea into a successful business, it’s essential that you make sure it’s aligned with your values and goals. After all, you’re going to put your time, energy and money into this project and the closer it comes to matching your personal goals and values, the more satisfied you’ll be. So, if you’re a people person, make sure that’s reflected by your business’s social environment, and be sure to create a space that will let you nurture this aspect. But how can you see to it that you’ll make decisions about your future business that will leave you satisfied? Well, you can simply try interviewing your future self. Self-examination will help you decide what type of business best suits you – and it’s easy to do: Grab a piece of paper and divide it into four sections. Then, identify the four most important parts of your life. Your categories might be, for example, Family, Career, Well-being and Money. Next, assign each of these categories to a different quadrant on the paper. Once you’ve done that, imagine yourself five years down the road and write down all the things that come to mind. For example, under the Money category, you might write, “in five years my mortgage is paid off, I’ve invested in property, have a steady income from rentals and my kids’ college funds are squared away.” If, during this process, you start to think that your idea won’t generate enough money to make this scenario realistic, set aside time right now to improve it. This way, you’ll avoid making this disappointing discovery in five years. All this talk of the future might have you itching to get to work on your business. But first, you’ll need to identify a few more personal things to ensure your idea is right for you. Is there one thing that you’re exceptionally good at? If so, you should learn to use it to your advantage! Your unique skills and characteristics give you a competitive edge, a niche from which to operate – in other words, an unfair advantage. Such an advantage is kind of like your superpower because it makes you stand out from the competition; it should thus be an integral aspect of any new idea. In fact, the mere knowledge that you’re good at something will help motivate you. For instance, imagine that you’ve been teaching yoga for 15 years and just had the idea to open your own online yoga school. Over the past decade and a half, you’ve amassed a huge amount of hands-on knowledge on different schools of yoga and a variety of techniques. Naturally, you’d want that unique knowledge to serve as the foundation for your online school. But perhaps your strengths aren’t so obvious, in which case you’ll need to identify them. One way to do so is to look at your past. By looking at your previous jobs and volunteer experience, and considering what you liked about them or didn’t, you can uncover interesting patterns about yourself. The author, for example, used to work for an architecture firm. He liked the job because he learned something new every day and got to work on something physical and tangible; after working on a project, he could actually walk through it. However, he didn’t feel that he was paid enough or acknowledged for the hard work he did. He also felt that his ideas were not heard. Looking at his past, it was clear that the ability to influence outcomes was, and continues to be, very important to him. Therefore, becoming an entrepreneur was a natural fit, as it would put him fully in charge and so play to his strengths. So, you’ve traveled into the future and back to the past. You know what you want from life and have some ideas about what you want to do; now it’s time to work on your business idea. For starters, jot down any thoughts that relate to your idea in a mind map, a useful tool for structuring your thoughts in a visual representation. You can design yours either on paper or electronically. If you prefer writing by hand, post-its make the perfect medium because you can easily move them and use different colors. Or, if you’d rather use a computer, opt for a web-based mapping tool like MindMeister that allows you to drop and move items easily. And remember, don’t overthink it! Just be sure to get all of your thoughts out in the open. After all, our brains can’t be creative while editing. For now, focus on getting your ideas flowing. The next step is to distill your idea into a single cohesive sentence that helps you pare it down to its essence. You kept your analytical brain on silent mode during the creative phase, but now it’s time to switch it back on. Start editing by organizing your mind map into different categories. Then, once you have categories, write 400 to 500 words that cover them all. This will get you into the flow of writing, and from there you can cut your first draft down to a three- to five-sentence paragraph. Be sure to cap it at that and make sure it’s easy for a potential customer or investor to understand. Finally, edit your idea into one sentence and don’t worry if it takes a few versions to find the one that’s perfect. For example, a food retailer might describe his site by saying it offers “a wide selection of organic, raw vegan foods, while providing excellent customer service and support. The site is also home to a recipe blog containing short, entertaining instructional videos on how to cook with the items available on the site.” OK, now your idea is in a shareable format, but before you launch your business, it’s essential to research how the world will respond to it. Your idea will be improved by sharing it and learning from the feedback. In fact, even casual chats at work or at home can lead to valuable feedback that can help you refine your concept. But you must also be sure to speak with potential clients. For instance, the author had the idea to build a website for people who want to run food trucks and started contacting people who already had food truck businesses. The food truck owners immediately asked him if he owned a food truck – and he would reply that he didn’t. This experience forced him to think more closely about his idea and why somebody would take his advice if he wasn’t in the business. Eventually, this reflection led him to reshape the idea entirely, branding himself as a curator of a community for food truck owners. The next step is to determine how your market currently operates and attempt to add a new dimension to it. A good tool for doing so is a market map. To make one, just create a spreadsheet with different pages for places, people and products. In the case of an online yoga school, you would start your market map by adding places like yoga studios and existing online schools. From there, write down the names of people you intend to contact from the different schools. These personal conversations can spark unique human contacts that become the basis for future cooperation. You might end up wanting to feature a certain school’s instructors in your online offer, and having a useful contact will make it a whole lot easier. Finally, when it comes to your products sheet, you should focus on the individual items you’ll offer – in this case, different styles of yoga. Conducting research can teach you a lot about your potential market, but it’s also crucial to know how to care for your clients. After all, they’re the ones who will be buying your product. To do so, you should develop an actionable customer profile, also known as a Customer P.L.A.N. This tool will help you identify how your business idea matches up with your audience; in the end, your business will do much better if you understand your customers in all of their complexity. Here’s how it works: Your customer PLAN stands for your customers’ problems, language, anecdotes and needs. To get started on yours, add a page to your spreadsheet called P.L.A.N. and make four columns, one for each of the above categories. Now, turn your attention to the first letter in your P.L.A.N., your customers’ problems – remember, if you can solve a problem, people will buy your products. Luckily, learning about your customers’ problems is easy: just get in touch with them. Start with the names you jotted down in the people section of your spreadsheet and ask them open-ended questions that will help identify potential issues. For example, you might ask questions like “what’s the most difficult thing about . . . ?” or “which part of that task is the most time consuming?” If you find people are hard to contact personally and your perseverance doesn’t pay off, try doing an online survey. In this case, a great question to ask is “what do you find most challenging about . . . ?” Once you’ve identified your customers’ problems, it’s time to move on their language. After all, understanding the way your customers speak will open up new doors to your target audience. A solid strategy here is to analyze your customers’ frustrations through the lens of language. For instance, make note of certain words they use to describe their struggles, goals and aspirations. And remember, speaking like your customers will build trust faster and make them more likely to respond positively to future advertising. You’ve now got half your PLAN ready to go. Next up, you’ll learn about the two final ingredients. Now that you know how to identify the problems your audience faces and the language they use, it’s time to consider the anecdotes that will help you stay connected to real people. Here’s how: Anecdotes are stories, usually short, funny or interesting ones, and you should always encourage your customers to share them. These little bits of information will help you tailor your idea to your customers’ experience. Take this anecdote: For the first time in his life, Nick went fly fishing and shared his awesome adventure online. After traveling for a couple of hours, he finally reached the fishing area and, upon arriving, he stopped at the bait shop to ask for fishing spot recommendations. Someone at the shop offered to guide him and led him to a good spot. When they started fishing, Nick was really enjoying the scenery but was having a hard time casting. A more experienced fly fisher noticed Nick’s difficulty and offered him a few pointers, after which Nick drastically improved. So, if you’re designing a product for beginner fishermen, listening to such a story would be a great way to relate to a potential customer. You can learn about their struggles, understand them better and make a product that helps solve these issues. And finally, identifying your customers’ needs will help you fully satisfy them with your future product. But what exactly is a need? Essentially, a need is an aspect of a customer’s life that doesn’t work – and your job is to offer a solution. For example, while researching fly fishing, the author found that fishermen often complain of not being able to tie flies quickly. By talking to customers, he discovered that they absolutely hated losing opportunities to catch other fish. In the process, he identified two needs: improved fly tying techniques and simplified access to flies. Once he’d done so, he was ready to come up with ideas to fulfill both those needs. You’ve done your market research and created a customer P.L.A.N. You’re almost there! But before moving forward, remember to validate your idea – financially, that is. You can start by performing initial testing of the commitment your product or service triggers among potential investors and customers. There are a several ways to do this. For one, you can try advertising platforms like Google AdWords, Facebook, Twitter or any other website that your target audience visits. These sites will compound real statistics, including the number of clicks your ads generate, that will give you a sense of the initial interest in your idea. Another way to validate your concept is to write guest blog posts on an open forum or group related to your idea. This works well because if you offer interesting content without asking anything in return, you’ll add value to the platform and grab people’s attention. Over time, you can begin presenting your product or service on one of these platforms and ask people if they’re interested in investing. A final validation strategy is called hyper-targeting, which involves identifying the percentage of the market that’s potentially interested in your solution. In other words, it works by asking your audience to identify as wanting or needing your product or service. So, if you’ve been active on an online forum or group, just pose a question like “who would be interested in . . . ?” Or, if you’ve got a website, you might ask viewers to click on a link or subscribe to a newsletter. By doing so, you’ll get a sense of how many people could be interested in your idea. And of course, you can also do this through public speaking. In this context, you can simply ask people to raise their hands if your product would solve a problem of theirs. So, measuring the commitment people have to your idea is essential – but people often won’t buy a product even though they showed interest in the idea initially. As a result, it’s necessary to do a final round of validation. First, interact with your potential customers and share your solution with them to make sure they’ll actually buy your product in the future. Here, it’s best to shoot for one-on-one interactions whether they’re in person, over the phone, through private messages or by e-mail. Regardless of the communication method you use, begin by showing interest in your customer. Then, try to focus the conversation on the product you want them to buy into. Share information about yourself and use an anecdote to help them understand why you want to serve them. But you should also remember to be honest and let the customer know that you’re interested in their feedback. In the end, receiving such feedback will let you know if a potential client likes your product and also how likely they are to buy it once it’s on the market. Then, your final validation comes when you ask for payment as a pre-order. This could be done through a link on your website or sent out through an e-mail that asks customers to buy your product in advance. When using e-mail with this strategy, wait 24 hours and, if you haven’t heard anything, send a follow-up e-mail to see if the person indeed received your message. But how many pre-orders do you need for your idea to be validated? Well, according to the communications scholar Everett Rogers, just 2.5 percent of people will invest in a new idea right away. Naturally, you want more people to buy your product as time goes by and curiosity builds, but Rogers suggests that getting 10 percent positive responses is a good indicator of success. In other words, if you contact 50 people and five of them commit financially, you’re good to go. If, however, you don’t get the 10 percent you’re looking for, ask for more feedback and keep improving your idea. The key message in this book: Plenty of people are full of good ideas, but not many of them are turned into successful businesses. The keys to doing so are market research, an understanding of your clients’ problems and a rigorous financial validation of the final idea.  Actionable Advice: Call up friends and colleagues.  If you’re having a hard time identifying your personal advantages, it can help to get in touch with some friends or colleagues.

What is it about the internet that makes this kind of success story possible? Without Their Permission explores what it is exactly that makes the internet such a dynamic and revolutionary place – ripe for entrepreneurship – and why it’s worth fighting to keep it that way. These blinks focus on the author’s own experiences in co-creating Reddit, one of the world’s most popular websites, and along the way they reveal some of the author’s hard-earned advice to entrepreneurs about the best approach to creating their start-up – from designing their product to acquiring the funding necessary to make it a reality. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how the author was able to turn Reddit into such a hugely popular and lucrative website; why success stories like the author’s are dependent on a free and open internet; how one man revolutionized the travel industry simply by trying to solve a problem for his debate team, and why a certain whale earned the name “Mr. Splashy Pants.” If you were going to found a technology-based start-up, what would you do? You’d probably begin by developing a great product and hoping that people would buy it, right? Unfortunately, it’s really difficult to persuade people to buy a product that they don’t yet know they need. In fact, it’s easier to start the whole process the other way around. Rather than starting with a product, begin by identifying a problem. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a well-known problem; in fact, people don’t always realize they even have an issue until you show them a better alternative to the status quo. For example, Adam Goldstein, co-founder and CEO of the successful travel search engine Hipmunk, realized in college that he had a problem booking flights. He was responsible for organizing all the travel for his debate team, which had a small budget for attending competitions. In order to find the cheapest flights, he had to check several flights at several airlines for several different time slots, which was an incredibly frustrating as well as time-consuming task. Once you have identified your problem, you can create your product around it. Adam Goldstein’s solution was a travel search engine that searches a number of airlines simultaneously and ranks them according to price and other factors, such as number of layovers and flight duration. In 2010 he brought his problem to Reddit co-founders Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman. They then turned his idea into a reality, gave it the name “Hipmunk,” and revolutionized travel searches in the process by saving people time and money. Unsurprisingly, the product quickly took to the market; people realized the Hipmunk’s advantages even if they hadn’t thought of travel searches as a problem, and were thankful for the simplification. Are you a perfectionist who spends long hours trying to work out every single possible kink in his product? You are not alone: many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of spending too much time trying to perfect their products. But this is a fool’s errand! Simply put, you will never “perfect” your product, so the time spent unnecessarily trying to reach perfection is essentially time wasted. Not only that, but most users aren’t bothered by tiny errors, making “perfection” even less of a priority. Instead, you should bring your product to market as soon as it’s “good enough.” Indeed, the term minimum viable product – building the simplest possible solution to a problem and then immediately launching it – has become a cliché in the start-up scene. And for good reason: it’s what you’re supposed to do! For example, the first version of the author’s own news and social networking website, Reddit, was “good enough”: a simple web page where users could submit links and see them listed on the front page based on their popularity. And it was later sold for millions of dollars. After you’ve created a “good enough” product, you can later use customer feedback to fine-tune it. In fact, observing how users interact with your product will tell you all you need to know about where and how you should improve it. When we look back to the first version of Reddit, we see it was quite simple. As time progressed, however, the founders refined their service by introducing a voting system to add a new dimension to their link rating system, as well as adding various sub-pages for special content categories. The lesson to draw from this is that it’s best to start small and build from there. Take a step back from the idea of perfection and focus on the real work that needs to happen in order get your solution out there. The number one reason why start-ups fail is lack of cash. Of course there are many other possible reasons why start-ups could collapse, such as poor strategy, bad leadership, or products that don’t connect with the market, but often it simply boils down to running out of money. This makes sense, since you need cash to run your business; you’ve got to pay your employees, cover logistics, find the rent for your office at the end of the month and so on. Once the well runs dry, you’re finished. So securing funding is absolutely essential. Luckily, while you won’t be finding any money trees in your backyard, there are many sources of cash available to you. One source of funding is venture capital firms. For example, the author and Steve Huffman got their funding for Reddit from Y Combinator, a seed-stage venture capital firm. This kind of company offers nascent start-ups cash and guidance in exchange for part of the start-up’s equity. Of course, they don’t just give out money to everybody. Instead, they carefully consider your concept and business plan, and only start writing checks if they think they will earn back a profit later. For example, before they had the idea for Reddit, the author and Huffman were rejected by Y Combinator for an earlier idea. In order to receive funding, they had to change their concept to what would later become Reddit. Angel investing is another source of funding. This is when one affluent individual (instead of a company) funds your project in exchange for equity. Some of these individuals can be found on the social network Angellist, where start-ups can create profiles to attract the interest – and dollars – of wealthy investors. Unfortunately, actually procuring funding can be complicated and frustrating, and rejection is common. Nevertheless, it’s crucial for your start-up, so don’t give up! Have you ever heard of the lone wolf who made his fortune in business without any help? Probably not. Success is a group effort, and connections – both in the business or out of it – play a huge role in your success. Indeed, every encounter in the business world can become a worthwhile connection. So it’s important when you’re attending events like conferences that, instead of dreading hours of boring talks, you see them as opportunities to connect with people who can help you later on. Moreover, making connections like these can help you develop social currency. Like any currency, social currency is something you can earn and spend: you earn it by doing people favors, and spend it by asking for them. For example, you could earn social currency by mentioning a connection’s newly founded start-up to a journalist who wants to write about a related topic. This small act doesn’t cost you much time, and makes those people more likely to help you out in your own time of need – for example, when you need media attention for your product. Furthermore, these connections can influence the success of your business in ways that had never crossed your mind. For example, when the author met Rachel Metz, a reporter for Wired, he hoped she would publish an article about Reddit so that it would gain some publicity. The good news: when they met over lunch, they really hit it off. The bad news: Metz decided not to write about Reddit because she felt that it would be unprofessional, as she and the author had become friends. Luckily, however, Metz mentioned Reddit to her editor, who then referred it to her business connections at Condé Nast, a mass-media company who would later purchase Reddit and make the author very rich. After reading so much about web-based start-ups, you might be wondering why anyone would place so much focus on the internet over other communication media, like print or TV. What is it that makes the internet so special? In essence, the internet harnesses the power of the many: one person alone is fairly meek, but a large group of people with the same agenda has the power to enact meaningful change. For example, there are lots of animal lovers and animal rights activists out there who want to make a difference, but what would happen if a single person stood in front of a slaughterhouse with a placard? Probably nothing. But what would happen if it were 300 people instead of one? That’s why people join forces in organizations like PETA and Greenpeace. That’s the great thing about the internet: it connects people with the same agenda – sometimes even by accident! For example, Greenpeace once started a campaign to raise online awareness of their effort to stop Japanese humpback whaling expeditions by tracking a whale on its migration. In order to generate interest within their own small online community, they took a poll to see what they should name the whale. A few of the options were deeply meaningful, such as “Kaimana,” which means “divine power of the ocean” in Polynesian. Also on that fateful list, however, was the name “Mr. Splashy Pants.” Somehow this poll ended up on Reddit, drawing in a much larger crowd than the usual Greenpeace crew. Due largely to the votes by Reddit users, “Mr. Splashy Pants” won! Greenpeace had inadvertently created a much broader community that wanted to protect a specific humpback whale named Mr. Splashy Pants. This untraditional yet large community added so much publicity to Greenpeace’s cause that it had enough weight to actually alter the Japanese government’s whale hunting plans. In fact, they called off their whaling expedition. Support doesn’t always come from single firms or individuals. Communities can also combine their budgets in order to support a shared cause, such as a charity. Sometimes the best way for charities to reach their target communities is via the internet. For example, Charles Best, a social studies teacher in the Bronx, had to spend $500 of his own money just to keep his classroom adequately stocked with school supplies, an experience that many other US school teachers shared. To offset this burden on teachers, he started a web-based program called DonorsChoose.org, where users donate small amounts of money to school projects of their choosing. His site utilizes a strategy called crowdfunding, through which a project is funded with the help of small donations made by many people. Crowdfunding has distinct advantages over other traditional donation models. For example, Charles Best’s crowdfunded program is especially transparent, as individuals themselves, rather than an organization, allocate funds where they choose. Whether they donate $10 or $10,000, they actually know precisely where their money goes and what it is used for. In addition, organizations like DonorsChoose.org are not as bureaucratic, and can therefore forgo a large portion of the administrative overhead that plagues larger, traditional charities. In order to get donations, teachers or students simply upload a description of their project to DonorsChoose.org at virtually no cost and for very little effort. Then, once the donations are gathered, an employee at DonorsChoose.org simply purchases the needed items, such as computers or microscopes, and gives them directly to the teacher, thus keeping overhead costs to a minimum. Furthermore, donors have the option to allocate 100 percent of their donation to the project or put 15 percent of it toward covering the costs of DonorsChoose.org, thus offsetting their expenses. DonorsChoose.org serves as a great lesson for internet start-ups: using their system, they continued to secure more donations every year even during the financial crisis, when most donors and school systems had to tighten their belts. Wouldn't it be nice if the people with the best ideas always found their way into the spotlight? Sadly, it doesn’t quite work that way. In traditional media like television, big production firms wield all the power. A perfect example of this can be found in Zach Anner, a young comedian with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair. A few years ago, he participated in a competition to win his own talk show on the Oprah Winfrey Network. His unusual appearance and unique humor quickly earned him a large fanbase, and as a result, he was one of two winners given his very own show. Sadly, after only four episodes, his show ceased production due partly to disagreements with the production company over content. Anner and the production company had different ideas for the show, and the production company had all the bargaining power. However, video viewing platforms like YouTube can empower small content creators by giving them both a place to launch their content and find an audience, thus emancipating them from big production companies. Anner, for example, ended up putting his videos on YouTube, and in doing so has the freedom to create the content he wants to produce. In addition, YouTube contributors can gain a larger audience whenever people “thumbs up” their videos due to YouTube’s rating system. So not only does everybody who wants to make their content available to the public retain 100 percent creative control, but those with real talent also will actually attract an audience. These days there are many talented YouTubers who continue to attract a growing audience in a way that is only possible because of the internet and the transformation of media. People are no longer limited to TV and movies – they can also find a huge variety of unique independent and commercial media on platforms like YouTube. So what actually makes the internet so dynamic and revolutionary? It’s because it’s a free and completely democratic space. Now, can you imagine what would happen if that freedom were somehow constrained? The internet has, in fact, faced the threat of censorship by law. For example, in 2011 a bill called the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was introduced to US legislature, touted as a solution to internet piracy and as a means to protect intellectual property rights. However, it would have significantly limited online First Amendment Rights and paved the way for unprecedented internet censorship by enabling private parties to shut down websites without prior notification or a judicial hearing. Fortunately, this attempt at internet censorship was thwarted. Since SOPA threatened the open, uncensored internet that made the author’s livelihood possible, he joined forces with a group of internet experts in a lobbying blitz to stop the bill from being passed. The author believed that SOPA would not only make success stories like his own – in which he started a business with less money than it takes to buy a new Ford Focus and ultimately became a millionaire – impossible, but would also harm innovation and slow economic growth. And it wasn’t just these internet experts taking up the fight against SOPA. The news spread throughout the internet, and thousands of people organized protest actions against it, such as the Internet Blackout Day on January 18, 2012, where several important websites including Wikipedia and Google made their sites unavailable. Due to these massive protests, SOPA lost many of its supporters and ultimately didn’t make it through Congress. And it’s no surprise either: according to the author, a free and open internet is one of the most important political issues of our times, and well worth fighting for. The key message in this book: The internet has provided individuals and groups, from charities to start-ups, with unprecedented exposure to an audience, meaning that anyone with the right attitude and solutions-oriented strategy can create a successful organization. This, however, can only be possible if the internet remains free and open.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Eisner with Aaron Cohen","summary":"When successful business leaders are portrayed in the media, there is often a sense that their journey to the top was a one-man struggle against society, a David versus Goliath story. This narrow focus on the individual hides an important truth about success. Just like the old saying that behind every great man there is a woman, so it is that behind every successful business there is a partnership. The simple truth is that, without a reliable partner who can complement and support you, building a great business can be very difficult. So, what makes a great partnership? As these blinks will show you, all partnerships are unique – but successful ones have a lot in common. Without mutual respect, integrity and trust, no partnership can truly take off. In these blinks, you’ll learn why constant support is so important in a partnership; why humility is the ultimate goal; and why lovers make great business partners. Frank Wells and Michael Eisner had a great partnership at the Walt Disney Company: Eisner was the wild and creative CEO, while Wells, the president, kept the company grounded. Their secret was that nobody could get between them. They had an unspoken pact that they'd always trust each other and stick together. This, combined with the fact that they genuinely liked each other, made their relationship very strong. Wells and Eisner shared all their news. They always compared notes from their phone calls and visited each other’s offices at least 20 times a day. They also shared their frustrations, which made them easier to bear. Wells also provided Eisner with a lot of support, demonstrating an important skill that's often overlooked: he was always Eisner's greatest cheerleader, enthusiastically promoting his ideas. It was exactly this kind of passionate drive that became a crucial factor in their success. Wells was ready to do anything to help Eisner secure a deal. Once, when Wells was negotiating about the film Dirty Harry with Clint Eastwood at Warner Brothers, he agreed to play tennis with Eastwood to settle a dispute. Wells was concerned with success, not the spotlight, and because he had enjoyed a lot of success in his life, he was very confident. He didn't feel threatened by Eisner and was happy to accept the number two position in the company. In fact, when Disney wanted Wells and Eisner to be joint CEOs, Wells willingly gave way to Eisner when the latter said he'd prefer to be the sole CEO. This kind of humility is vital in good partnerships, because it eliminates any competition. Wells even carried a note from a fortune cookie in his wallet for 30 years that read, “Humility is the final achievement.” His son found it after his death. A partner who's supportive, passionate and humble is a great asset. When partners can engage with each other without any underlying competitiveness, they can focus on creating success in their company. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have had a strong, intellectual bond for almost their entire lives. Munger is the greatest skeptic to Buffet’s ambitious ideas, responding to them in one of three ways: “That's a dumb idea,” “That's one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard” or “You're out of your mind and I'm going to have you committed.” Berkshire Hathaway, their company, bases its decisions on Buffett's reactions to Munger's criticism. They apply these criticisms to decide if they should move forward with an idea or let it go. Sometimes Buffet will go ahead with an idea even if Munger disagrees with it, but in those cases Munger will also commit to the idea, because he's committed to Buffett as a partner. Munger has also taught Buffett a lot of important lessons: he's the one who introduced Buffett and the rest of the company to the buy strong and hold strategy, whereby Berkshire Hathaway buys well-run companies and holds onto their stocks in the long run. There isn't any competition between Buffett and Munger, either. Despite Munger’s exuberant personality and the fact that he is a dominant presence in most of his roles outside of Berkshire Hathaway, he is happy working in the number two position behind Buffett at the company. This isn't only because of humility; Munger truly believes that Buffett is better at what he does than Munger would be. According to his children, Munger is a “book with legs” because of his wealth of knowledge, but Buffett is the one who can turn this knowledge into actions. The pair complement each other, and they have a lot of fun together as well. They're best friends with deep respect for each other, and although they think in similar ways, they each bring their own talents and skills to the partnership. Munger openly states that Buffett is a more capable boss; he knows that envy is counterproductive. Bill Gates jokes that he's never done anything alone in life except take exams. Over the years, he's had a number of important partnerships, and none more significant or meaningful than the one with his wife, Melinda. The couple head their own philanthropic foundation that's committed to solving problems related to global health and American education. It probably constitutes his most equal partnership too, and not just because he's married to his partner in this case; the success of their partnership also has to do with experience and maturity. Bill Gates now understands that he doesn't need to be a dominant force in order for a partnership to thrive. Bill and Melinda Gates manage the organization equally and discuss issues openly. They even read the same books when they're on holiday so they can compare their thoughts on them. If they read different books, they discuss them so much that it feels as if they’ve actually read them together. When Bill goes on trips alone, Melinda reads up on whatever he's working on so she can ask him about it when he gets back. Equal partners can also share their fears and weaknesses, and can give each other advice. When one partner always has to be the leader, it can be tough not having anyone to talk to on an equal footing. When two great minds tackle a project equally, a lot of things become easier. The partners' roles are more flexible, allowing them to shift and protect each other at difficult times. Moreover, if one partner is especially enthusiastic about a project, the other might take a more cautious position, ensuring that they get a more balanced perspective on their work. Over time, this equality strengthens a bond, as it has between Bill and Melinda Gates – by now, they know each other so well that they constantly finish each other's sentences. One person doesn't necessarily have to be in a position of power for a partnership to work. Brian Grazer and Ron Howard are completely different on the surface, but they're similar in some very important ways. Grazer is your typical smooth-talking Hollywood producer; he wears suits and knows how to charm people. Howard, on the other hand, is the child star turned award-winning director who's usually seen wearing jeans and a baseball cap. Grazer and Howard don't always see eye-to-eye, but they share the same principles and stand by each other. In fact, they agreed early on that they didn't always need to agree. It's beneficial for partners to play different roles. When they deal with lawyers and business managers, for instance, Grazer often takes charge in order to protect Howard from the harsher sides of Hollywood. Despite their differences, Grazer and Howard know what they want to accomplish together. Their partnership is also strengthened by the fact that they genuinely like each other. The pair has a long history together. When Howard switched from acting to directing, he struggled to have people take him seriously because he was only associated with his work on the TV show Happy Days. But Grazer was an ambitious young producer and recognized Howard's talent. The first films Grazer and Howard worked on together were Night Shift and Splash. Afterwards, they decided to part ways and pursue their own projects, partly because Grazer felt he wasn't getting enough recognition within the film industry. However, they eventually realized that they were more successful together, so they teamed up again and started their own production company, Imagine Films Entertainment. They decided to split the company and its earnings 50/50, even with films that they didn’t work on together, or when one of them would contribute more to a film than the other. Sometimes, Grazer even produces other directors’ films, like Ridley Scott's American Gangster. Their financial equality illustrates how much they truly share their accomplishments. It also prevents any tension from arising since they aren't keeping score of their successes or failures. Valentino Garavani, the world-famous fashion designer, developed an interest in fashion at an early age, but he owes much of his success to his partner, Giancarlo Giammetti. Their partnership was founded on love. Garavani and Giammetti met in 1960 and had a romantic relationship for 12 years. They stayed in love even after their romance ended and both began dating other men. Garavani and Giammetti spent nearly all their time together and knew each other extremely well. In order to help Garavani’s fashion designing career get off the ground, Giammetti made several sacrifices; he even stopped studying architecture to save money and prevent Garavani’s first fashion design house from going bankrupt. Giammetti has served as Garavani’s organizer since then. He helps plan shows and pick models so Garavani can focus solely on creating glamorous clothes. Garavani doesn't always acknowledge Giammetti's help, but he appreciates it much more than he lets on. The power dynamic between them also strengthens their partnership. Giammetti doesn't care about fame; he thinks Garavani deserves the glory because he's the real fashion genius. Giammetti is happy to let Garavani enjoy the spotlight, while still knowing the importance of his own contributions to their success. Giammetti also gives Garavani 51 percent of their earnings, even though he does most of the hard work. He also functions as Garavani’s gatekeeper, which entails its own power dynamic: anyone who wants to get to Garavani has to go through Giammetti first. Garavani has a sizable ego, so Giammetti’s dedication to their partnership is a true testament to their love. They're both dedicated to the same goal – Garavani’s success – and their strong partnership based on respect and understanding has brought them that success for over half a century. Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, the founders of Studio 54 dance club in New York, were best friends well before they went into business together. They were both from Brooklyn and met at university. Rubell and Schrager had very different personalities, so they contributed to the partnership in different ways. Rubell was charismatic and charming, so he effortlessly attracted attention. He was a people person who took naturally to mingling with the stars at Studio 54. Schrager, on the other hand, took care of the business side. Rubell often pushed his own ideas, while Schrager tended to be more cautious. Despite their differences, they also decided to divide everything down the middle. Rubell and Schrager had similar principles and approaches, however, and they both learned the value of integrity after doing a stint in prison for embezzling money. They were charged with tax evasion, obstruction of justice and conspiracy for failing to report $2.5 million in income from the club's receipts. During the trial, the US government offered Schrager a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying against Rubell. Schrager refused and the two went to prison together, which further strengthened their relationship. When they got out, they vowed to be honest in their business practices and started a hotel business. But just as they were beginning to enjoy success once again, Rubell died of AIDS. Schrager continued the business and it has since enjoyed great success, but he still feels that it would have been even more successful if Rubell had been working at his side. When partners have as much faith in each other as Schrager and Rubell did, they can play off each other's strengths and build something truly great. The key message in this book: Partnerships between the right pair of people can be hugely beneficial – some of us just work better when we collaborate with someone else. A good partnership won't just bring your company greater success, it can make you much happier too. After all, humans are social creatures. Actionable advice: Don't keep score. Don't compare yourself to your partner and don't stress about the details of who's doing what work. This kind of competitive behavior can be counterproductive. If you think of your partner as an equal, you can both share in all of your successes. Suggested further reading: The Partnership Charter by David Gage The Partnership Charter (2004) describes how business partners can avoid lasting damage to a business relationship by making sure to talk openly about everything. Using a tested process, business partners can put aside differences and successfully build a strong company together. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

A thoughtful, well-crafted business plan is the critical first step that sets out why your business should exist in the first place. What exactly are you making and selling? Why do you think you’ll succeed? What is the competition doing? And importantly, how much cash do you need to start? And although it may seem a straightforward task, the process of crafting a great business plan has been confounding entrepreneurs and founders for generations. Your business plan is so important, and you’ll be shopping it around to so many people, that you have to get it right. These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why no investor cares whether your accountant can sing arias; how loose lips can potentially sink your business ship; and why your business plan’s cover is almost as important as what’s inside. So you've got a great idea for a business. That's a good start, but if you want to turn your idea into a successful business, you'll need a business plan. A business plan acts as a blueprint, spelling out the important elements of your future company, like its purpose and its products, a marketing strategy and overall financial goals. A business plan is also an essential tool in raising funds and gaining support for your venture. You need to clearly state your objectives and your financial situation, however, before you sit down to write your business plan. Take some time to think about the future. What do you want to achieve? Identify clear goals so you can start working toward them. Know that if you are unclear in your goals and your strategy to achieve them, your business plan won’t be worth the paper you printed it on. You can't outline your idea for a booming business but then articulate a strategy of slow, stable growth – it just wouldn't make sense. Your team benefits from a clear business plan too, as it explains clearly what they’re all working toward. What’s more, your employees will support your company more avidly when goals are set. Financial matters too are a crucial part of any good business plan. How will you secure funding? And what sort of funding are you willing to accept? A new business has a few options when it comes to funding, such as securing bank loans, looking for money from friends and family, or seeking venture capital. It’s important that you determine which option is right for your business. Venture capitalists, for instance, often insist on making management decisions. Sometimes VCs will even put one of their members on your board of directors, with an eye to protecting their investments. Think about it: how much control are you willing to give up? You also have to consider your costs. If you raise money through a stock offer, for example, you might get a lot of cash but also you’ll deal with high commissions and fees as well as complicated paperwork. Take some time to think about the level of complexity you’d be comfortable with, before you dive in! You might think that one business plan is the same as the next, a bunch of statistics and financial forecasts. The truth, however, is that while all business plans do have common elements (like an executive summary or product description) they differ quite a bit depending on their purpose. Business plans differ because industries differ. Starting a retail business requires a different strategy than starting a management consultancy, for example. Even businesses that are similar still require different business plans. Imagine two restaurants, one which is an upscale French establishment, the other a deli focusing on business clientele. The French restaurant will spend a lot of time writing about its chefs, outlining their skills and experience. The deli, in contrast, will focus on how to maintain quality in a high-volume, high-speed business. Another important tip is to tailor your business plan to the needs of your audience, or the different people who will read it. You may have to craft several versions to do so. Bankers, for example, are more interested in financial issues than company culture. So make sure your cash-flow statements and balance sheets are professional and detailed. Bankers don’t care if you’ve got a foosball table in your company’s chill-out room! Angel investors, in contrast, tend to care more about why you’re starting your business and the emotions involved in your pitch and purpose. Your plan for this audience can be less formal yet more concise, focusing on a tight message that packs an emotional punch. And if you're looking to attract employees, you might want to craft a version that includes details on stock options and compensation. Writing a business plan isn’t like putting together a shopping list. There are risks involved, and you need to be aware of them. Confidentiality issues are a key issue. When you write your business plan, you might divulge confidential material which could potentially harm you and your business down the line. Imagine that in your business plan, you describe an innovative method for manufacturing vacuum cleaners. The people who read your plan could then disclose your secrets, even by accident. Your innovative ideas could be stolen and used by others. Avoid this by having your readers sign a nondisclosure agreement, which is a contract outlining what your reader can and cannot say about what they’ve read. Make sure your audience contractually agrees to keep your plan and ideas safe. Another common risk is a plan that could damage your business reputation. If you craft a plan that is too optimistic, and then you go on to not meet your projected goals, you might face a lack of trust in the future. Let’s say you want to start a microbrewery, and in your business plan you predict sales growth of 600 percent in your first year. An experienced investor will scoff at this, thinking you are either unprofessional or simply delusional. You certainly won’t win investors this way. Analysis paralysis is another risk in crafting a business plan. This occurs when you spend so much time analyzing and planning your business that you don't actually get anything done. Some people spend years in the planning stages, only to have a competitor swoop in and take control of the market in the meantime. So after you've thought about your goals, your audience and your risks, it's time to start writing. But how do you start, exactly? You’re at your laptop and ready to write. What do the first few pages of your business plan look like? First, you need a cover page that states your name and contact details. The next page should contain your executive summary. These few paragraphs lay out the main points of your plan. It should give your readers the gist of your whole idea, in case they don't have time to read the plan in its entirety. Essentially, if your business plan is a movie, the executive summary is the two-minute trailer. So keep your summary short, snappy and emotionally exciting – make it encourage your readers to read more. Your executive summary shouldn't be longer than two pages, as most people who read your plan won't spent more than five minutes on it anyway. So use the summary to convey urgency! As Jimmy Treybig from Tandem Computers once said, an executive summary should make a reader think, “It's going to explode, and I'd better invest now or I'm going to miss out!” You also need to be clear about financial issues from the start. As a business founder, you need cash, after all. If you're upfront about the interest rates and amount of loans you need, your potential investors will appreciate your honesty. Also, tell your future investors how you intend to use their money, as no one will give you a dime if they don’t know what you’re going to do with it. So give figures, showing how much money you’ll allocate to marketing, how much toward recruitment, and so on. After you've outlined your main points and energized your readers with your executive summary, you can move on to the next section: explaining your industry. Investment banker Peter Worrell once said, “It doesn't matter how hard you row. What matters is what boat you're in.” In other words, it doesn't matter how hard you work. If you aren't in the right industry at the right time, it will be challenging to grow your new business. This is why in your business plan, you need to describe the state of your industry for potential investors. Show them that your market is expanding, and that you have the chance to take advantage of this growth. In the early 1980s, for example, tech entrepreneurs often included the word “energy” in company names, as the energy industry was attractive to investors at the time. Today “mobile technology” or “3D printing” might have the same effect. You also need to describe your competition as well as your company's unique position in your growing industry. Differentiate yourself and show that your company will have an advantage. Let’s say you’re starting a 3D printing business. If one of your competitors prints in plastic and another in metal, you'll offer something unique if you print in organic material. Your readers need to know this, so highlight this fact prominently in your business plan. Identifying trends in your industry is also crucial. Use trustworthy market research to show the potential of your business idea. Describing your potential customer base too is important. How old are they and what do they do for a living? How much money do they make, and what is their education level? You should know the purchasing habits of your potential customers. Are they impulsive buyers or repeat customers? What other companies do they purchase from? Finally, explain why your customers will want to buy specifically from you. Make it clear that your product is suited to your potential customers’ needs and lifestyles. Mothers looking to buy prepared baby food, for example, are often motivated to find products that are not only nutritious but also safe. So in your plan, explain that your baby food is doctor-approved. Have you ever heard an investor say, “I invest in people, not in ideas?” While your products and suppliers are important, don’t forget that your people are your company's most valuable asset. Your management team brings your ideas to life. Who would you trust more, a person with a great idea and great credentials or a person with a great idea and lousy credentials? Your investors need to see that you and your staff are qualified. So don't just write about your team’s education levels and employment experiences. Outline their skills, too. List only the skills that are applicable to your business, however. While the fact that your accountant can sing opera is interesting, it’s not terribly relevant to your business. You should also list your accomplishments, such as patents or awards. If you've supervised the opening of 37 stores in three years, for instance, include details like this in your plan. If your sales manager has increased sales on average 25 percent year on year, tout this fact prominently. Clearly outline the job descriptions and roles of each of your team members, to help prevent future misunderstandings. A start-up, for example, might not be able to fill every position at the outset. A CEO might be in charge of marketing as well, at least in the early days. And if you’re writing an abbreviated plan, just include a short, catchy line about each important team member. A blurb such as, “Highly skilled backend software developer with eight years of experience,” gives a potential investor all the information she needs to know. So now you’ve got your plan on paper. Let’s look at a few ways to make your work even better. While you’re writing, you might struggle in deciding which information to include or leave out of your business plan. It's vital that your plan be detailed, but remember too that it needs to be readable. You should include documents such as advertising samples and team member resumes – important information, granted, but perhaps not relevant to all of your readers. Thus you can stick information like this in your business plan’s appendix. Too many documents can break up the flow of your plan. Remember that you’re trying to tell a clear story in just a few pages. If your plan includes too many details or distractions, it'll put people off. The appendix is there for readers who want to know more but don’t mind flipping to the back of a plan or even going online. In contrast, readers who only have a few minutes to skim through your plan don't need to bother with it. It's a good idea to keep your appendix materials either on a different website or a secure webpage of your own. Some people might be annoyed opening heavy attachments or flipping through lengthy hardcopies. Your appendix should also include several images, such as photos of your team and products. Depending on your business, it could also be advantageous to include advertising samples, factory layouts or store plans. Such files are usually too large for emails, so keep these on a website that you can then share with readers. Have you ever opened an attachment that took ten minutes to download? Lots of people (particularly potential investors) might not have the time to spare. Keep file size in mind when you craft your business plan, keeping digital copies lightweight and easily downloadable! Even if your idea is genius and your words sublime, if your report looks like it was put together by a first-grader, your readers will wonder whether you’re really a worthwhile investment. Make sure your business plan looks professional and is well-designed. Your cover page is the first thing a reader will see, so be sure it’s attractive and all information is accurate and correctly spelled. If your cover is awful, your audience might not get past the first page! If you have a compelling logo, put it on your cover page. Do you use Twitter or Instagram? Include all your contact details, such as email addresses, phone numbers and social media handles. Don’t clutter your cover, however. Only include key information and make sure all the elements are balanced and attractive so your cover grabs your reader’s attention and invites them to read. It's also a good idea to keep some hard copies of your business plan. Professionally printed hard copies are useful if a potential investor requests one; you can send one off immediately, if needed. Be sure to use high-quality white paper for printing, avoiding thinner paper, as it wrinkles or tears too easily. You should also bind your business plan, so it's easier to hold, read and pass around. Place a transparent cover sheet over your cover page, too. This will prevent it from getting dirty or damaged. Presentation is really important. Considering how much work you put into the contents of your plan, to fall short on presentation would be a shame. Make a good impression and be professional! The key message in this book: Even the most brilliant business dream won't become a reality without a well-conceived, strategic business plan. Your business plan gives you both a route to success and a way of attracting investment. So outline your goals, analyze your industry, write an engaging executive summary and assemble a stellar management team. Write a plan that'll attract the kind of investment you need! Actionable advice: Keep your business plan online. Don't waste people's time with attachments, and remember that most readers don't want to wrestle with hard copies. Keeping your business plan and appendix online allows your readers to be better able to access your information, and importantly, have a positive first experience with your future company.

Over the last few years, a few entrepreneurs have struck it big, very big. In a relatively short space of time, the people behind success stories like Dropbox, Airbnb and WhatsApp have taken an initial simple idea and made it into businesses worth billions. These blinks describe the journey that many of these tech billionaires have taken. Based on interviews with Forbes, they teach you that in the modern digital world the possibilities from simply having a good idea are endless. In these blinks you’ll discover: how one entrepreneur got into Silicon Valley through selling carpets; why the genius behind Tumblr didn’t want to run his own business; and which innovative product began life as a disposable camera strapped to an arm. If you want to be successful in life, what’s the best path to take? Here’s the conventional answer to that question: work hard at school and then find a mentor to help you along your career — which you should pursue at a slow and steady pace. Although this approach probably sounds familiar, most of today’s mega-successful young entrepreneurs — the tech-billionaires — followed a different path. For them, success was all about boldly pursuing a dream and ignoring what society expected of them. Let’s look at one example: when he was just 23-years-old, Evan Spiegel, the co-founder of Snapchat, turned down Facebook’s offer to buy his company for $3 billion. Although it’s too early to tell whether his decision was wise, we can still learn from Spiegel’s stratospheric path to success. Like many other successful entrepreneurs, Spiegel learned how to get his own way at a young age. When his high-powered lawyer parents split up, Spiegel used it to his advantage: his dad refused to buy him a BMW, so Spiegel moved in with his mother. It wasn’t long before his dad caved and bought him the car. There’s another similarity between Spiegel and his entrepreneurial peers: that he dropped out of college to pursue his startup. He and Snapchat co-founder Bobby Murphy came up with the idea for their app while they were still in college, but struggled to get the concept to take off. Although their parents pestered them to look for “proper jobs,” the duo stayed true to their dream. And finally, they received an investment from a venture capitalist. Spiegel promptly quit college (weeks ahead of graduation) and started on Snapchat day and night. And of course, you know how this story ends: Spiegel’s efforts paid off and Snapchat became one of the world’s most popular apps — so popular that Facebook offered to buy it for $3 billion. After hearing that last story, you might be wondering, “Hmmm. Was Evan Spiegel really an outsider who achieved success solely through hard-work and boldness? After all, weren’t his parents high-powered lawyers? Didn’t he go to Stanford?” Although there’s some truth to that objection, plenty of tech-billionaires come from different backgrounds. Here are two stories about mega-successful entrepreneurs who came into the tech industry as complete outsiders. First we have Pejman Nozad. Born in Iran, Nozad’s family fled to Germany when he was a boy. Later, he made a bold move to San Francisco with just $700 in his pocket. Although he didn’t speak English, he soon learned the language and found a way to survive by doing odd jobs. Eventually, without having prior experience, he started working as a salesman at a carpet store. He turned out to be a great salesman and an even better networker. Through his sparkling conversational skills and personal warmth, Nozad built up relationships with many of the businessmen and tech leaders who came to the store. And eventually, he leveraged these connections to start the investment fund Amidzad, which invested early in successful companies like Dropbox — earning over $100 million in the process. Our second story centers around Adi Tatarko, who co-owns Houzz, a home-design community worth $2 billion. Tatarko is one of the few women who achieved great success in the tech industry despite the overwhelming gender bias in Silicon Valley. (Consider that 43 percent of the 150 biggest companies in the Valley don’t have a single woman on the Board of Directors!) How did she manage to cut through the sexism? Well, it had a lot to do with sheer energy: Tatarko can work nonstop. And for motivation, she looks up to her grandmother, who worked as a designer when fashion was still a male-dominated industry. Whenever we read about the latest wildly successful tech wunderkind, we’re tempted to think, “Wow—he must be a genius to accomplish so much at his age!” Not to detract from anyone’s well-earned success, but it’s important to remember that all of these people had lots of help along the way. To that end, let’s look at the story of Tumblr. Today, the wildly successful social network is a top tech enterprise, yet, founder David Karp never planned for it to be a business. He was just happy to have the tool for his personal use. Luckily, he had a mentor. Entrepreneur Fred Seibert recognized Tumblr’s vast potential for success, and managed to persuade Karp (pretty much against his own will) to turn his product into a business. At first, Karp hated being a manager and overseeing the expansion of his company. But he persevered and Tumblr flourished. Eventually, the company’s success attracted Yahoo!, and the tech giant bought Karp’s blogging platform for $1.1 billion. So, thanks to Seibert’s advice, Karp turned his small idea into a major success. Here’s another story about mentorship in the tech world. It concerns Palmer Luckey, the creator of the Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset. It’s important to note that VR is a notoriously tricky field, and that many have tried and failed in this area — including games giant Nintendo, whose 1996 foray into VR was so disastrous that it literally gave players a headache when they used it. Nevertheless, Luckey ventured forth. And luckily, he had the help of VR pioneer Mark Bolars, who shared his trailblazing research with Luckey for free. Luckey also had the help of video game programmer John Carmack, who demoed Oculus Rift to the games industry. All this assistance paid off: Facebook eventually bought the company for $2 billion. So now that we’ve seen a few tech-billionaire origin stories, let’s delve deeper into what it takes to turn a great idea into a phenomenal success. What does it take to come up with a great idea? Surely it’s a matter of thinking long and hard about life’s great problems. Well actually, no — not at all. To be successful, you don’t have to come up with a formula for cold fusion or design a perpetual motion machine. Rather, success often lies in simplicity, in solving a small, everyday problem. This was the case for Nick Woodman. After his first business idea failed, Woodman took some time off to surf in Indonesia and Australia. When he wanted to record some of his surfing adventures, he faced a problem: how was going to take pictures while riding the waves? He came up with an incredibly simple solution and strapped a disposable camera to his wrist. When he told his friend about his DIY creation, his friend urged him to take his simple idea to the next level. Woodman eventually created a wearable camera with durable casing, so that it would be impact resistant and waterproof. This tool developed into GoPro and Woodman went on to sell $1 billion worth of cameras. Next, we have the story of Jack Dorsey. Dorsey is best known for his world-changing product, Twitter, but he also has a $1 billion stake in a payment processing company called Square. Square was inspired by a real-life problem: Dorsey’s friend, a glassblower, lost a $2,500 sale because he didn’t have the tools to process a credit card payment. Dorsey set out to find a solution, and ended up creating a very cheap smart-phone-based terminal that would allow small businesses to accept credit cards. It was a very straightforward solution, and it was also Dorsey’s second billion-dollar idea. If you want to rise to the top, you’re bound to upset a few people along the way. And tech-billionaires aren’t scared to. Consider Aaron Levie, the founder of Box, a company which allows you to share and edit files and documents on any device. Before we dive into his story, it’s important to note that for years, the computer software industry was dominated by four main companies: Microsoft, SAP, Oracle and IBM. Their dominance didn’t lead to a lot of innovation in the tech industry: Since there was so little competition, clients paid high fees for tech services and upgrades; and furthermore, the quality was often not the highest. Even today, these companies lack many adequate products for the mobile and tablet markets. For startups like Box, this presents an opportunity. The Box app allows people to share, open and edit files on any device. This kind of software has traditionally been Microsoft’s domain, but the tech giant has been slow to adapt its Office Suite for mobile. And what’s more, Box offers a free basic service without requiring users to pay for upgrades. The company’s nimble, efficient approach has proven to be a huge success: By 2013, Box had $124 million in revenues and even traditional powers were clamoring for a partnership. But for startups, success isn’t always about challenging established leaders. For companies like Airbnb, it’s about creating entirely new ways of doing business. Faced with a market completely dominated by hotels and guesthouses, founder Brian Chesky thought outside of the box and developed a whole new model for hospitality. Airbnb allows people to connect online to find private lodging while traveling. Although the company’s share of the hotel market is still small (Airbnb has $100 million of a $1 billion industry), established companies have taken note. Airbnb poses such a threat to the traditional way of doing business that the hotel industry is counting on government regulation to curb the company’s growth. In the case of any challenging, competitive venture, success is largely a matter of persistence. And the story of Dropbox founder Drew Houston epitomizes this lesson. When he was just 14 years old, Houston already knew what he wanted to do. When a teacher asked his classmates what they wanted to be when they grew up, his hand shot up: “I want to run a computer company,” he said. From that point forth, he never gave up pursuing that dream. As a high school student, Houston started working as a beta tester for an online game. The company spotted his talent and hired him as a network programmer. Later in college, Houston worked for five more tech startups. And then one day, Dropbox was born: Houston needed to pull up a few files, but realized they were on another computer. He started working on his idea right away, developing the basic technology which would allow him to synchronize files over the Internet. Five years later, Houston has a $600 million stake in his $4 billion company — and he’s made his childhood dream come true. Of course, many aspiring entrepreneurs experience failure on their path to success. This was the case for Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook and founder of Napster. Parker’s path was riddled with failure. For example, while he was president of Facebook, police found cocaine in a house that was rented under his name. Although the incident led him to resign from the social network, Parker didn’t give up. He went to Spotify, the super-successful music streaming service which was then in its early days. Parker helped secure deals with major record labels like Universal and played an instrumental role in Spotify’s social network integration. As you can see, Parker didn’t let obstacles hold him back. It’s easy to feel protective of a company you’ve started, but resisting change will get you nowhere. The most successful companies know how to be flexible and respond to what their customers want. Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, exemplifies this principle. Today, Instagram is an incredibly successful photo-sharing network, which was recently purchased by Facebook for $1 billion. But when it first started, Instagram was a very different kind of company. Systrom and his co-founder first created Instagram as a combination of Foursquare, which allows users to “check-in” their location, and a photo-sharing service. This concept fell short: the overall product was slow and cumbersome, and people didn’t respond to the check-in feature. But then, while they were vacationing in Mexico, Systrom had an idea. Why not add filters to the photography feature? These filters would allow users to add instant nostalgia or poignancy to everyday pictures. Within a month of introducing the filters, Instagram’s user base grew to one million. Facebook’s other recent purchase, WhatsApp (which was purchased in 2014 for $19 billion), is another great example of a flexible startup. Jan Koum, the brainchild behind Whatsapp, was a poor immigrant from the Ukraine. He and co-founder Brian Acton originally launched their company as an address book for the iPhone which allowed users to update their status (e.g. “at the gym,” “battery low”). Although the initial idea didn’t win over users, things changed when Joum and Acton combined the concept with Apple’s new “push notification” feature. Now every time you updated your status, all your WhatsApp contacts would get a notification about it. Remarkably, people started using the app in a completely different way than originally intended, as an instant messaging service. WhatsApp quickly changed its focus, and its user base grew to 480 million before it was acquired by Facebook in 2014. We’ve learned a lot about how tech-billionaires achieved their fortunes. And now in the final blink, we’ll look how they’ve managed to maintain their success. So now that we’ve learned about how a few tech-billionaires managed to turn simple ideas into billion-dollar companies, it’s time to find out what it takes to maintain that level of success. Because for tech wunderkinds, it’s not enough to stop at the billion-dollar valuation. This is especially true because the giant established companies — the ones which were challenged by the upstart entrepreneurs discussed in these blinks — are always trying to reclaim their market dominance. Consider Palmer Luckey’s story. (We’ve already talked about how Luckey was able to turn his design for a virtual reality device into a company, Oculus Rift, which sold to Facebook for $2 billion.) Despite his immense success, Luckey (who still runs Oculus Rift, even after the sale to Facebook) still faces a challenge in keeping his company at the top of the market. There are plenty of competitors encroaching on his turf: For one, electronic giant Sony is developing its own VR headset for its latest console, Playstation 4. Amazon is also rumored to be entering the market. The e-commerce company may be planning to create VR shopping malls. So instead of just looking at a photograph of an item, these “malls” would allow you to virtually pick up a product, look at it in detail and even try it out. Because of competitors like Amazon and Sony, for Luckey the work never stops. He must constantly seek out new ways to stay ahead of the competition. And that’s exactly why he used the money from the sale of Oculus to purchase other companies that might allow him to improve his product. Among his purchases were RakNet, an open source game networking engine (which allows people to create and share their own games), and Carbon Design Group, a product design studio. The key message: In today’s age of rapid technological innovation, there are plenty of opportunities for success. And as we can see from the stories of today’s top tech billionaires, all you need is one great idea — and the courage and the determination to bring it to fruition.

You’re not alone. With Facebook, Instagram and smartphones always with us, constantly beeping and buzzing, craving our attention, getting things done is tougher than ever. So how do you fight these distractions and find your focus again? First of all, you need to accept that you can’t do everything. Then you need to make sure that the goals you have are really yours. Then it’s time to get going. Luckily, there are some neat tips and tricks that will make it easier for you to succeed. And it doesn’t require a lot of time either. Just 18 minutes. In these blinks, you’ll learn what Gmail’s “undo send” function can teach you about life; what jelly can teach you about choice; and why you should embrace your quirks. Sometimes waking up in the morning and looking at your to-do list can be overwhelming. Finding enough time to take care of everything can be a daily struggle. But with the right plan and some focused attention you can be your most productive self. First, find your focus by pausing for a moment, reflecting on what needs to be done and finding the best and most fruitful course of action. This pause will also lead to you making fewer mistakes. Take Gmail’s “undo send” function, for example. This feature gives you five seconds to reconsider whether you might regret that email you just sent. And five seconds is all most people need to pause and realize they’ve made a mistake. Of course, it’s more productive to avoiding writing and sending that email in the first place. Our initial instincts are often emotional, and the part of our brain that controls our impulses needs those few extra seconds to take control and put us on the right path. So, before you take action, slow down and take a moment to consider and to avoid wasting time. This pause can train your mind for long term success. You can think of life in terms of a marathon: It requires constant effort and endurance. Marathon runners gain endurance by breaking their week into four days of short runs, one day of a long run and two days of rest. And just like these runners you need this rest to reflect and put things in perspective. Pausing also allows you to think in new ways, leading to new possibilities. Without that break you’ll be on constant autopilot, acting out according to your idea of how things are supposed to be. This is the kind of behavior that leads to mistakes and missed opportunities. When you pause it gives your mind the chance to calm down, see things accurately and recognize the possibilities for productivity. So take the important first step and pause. Are you so ambitious you don’t know where to start? To find the best option for you, try to organize your life and focus on the things that matter most. Ask yourself what you want to accomplish in a day, week, year or lifetime. To attain these goals, you will need direction, and the key to getting on the right path is limiting your choices and taking advantage of your strengths. It is easier to take action when there are fewer options from which to choose. A simple way to narrow your options is to focus your attention on the things you are good at and work toward those talents and strengths. This can be a formula for being strategic about the things to which you dedicate your time and energy. Use this method to focus on approximately five things that will make a difference in your life. It might be improving your social life, being a better parent or launching a new product. By devoting 95 percent of your time to these goals, you’ll be directing your time and energy in the best possible way. Focusing on your strengths doesn’t mean ignoring your weaknesses. It is actually a good idea to embrace them! For example, say that one of your weaknesses is that you look at issues in very black-and-white terms. The author’s friend turned this weakness into an advantage by working on the issue of health reform. By not getting bogged down in unproductive arguments over gray areas, he used his stance of “I am right, you are wrong,” as a source of power to move things forward and excel at his job. So, when you are looking for direction in your life and choosing what to work on for the next day or year, take into consideration your strengths and weaknesses. You’ll be on your way to getting the right things done. Have you ever considered what makes you different and unique as a disadvantage? Don’t! It is a competitive advantage to be different from the rest! Today’s marketplace is crowded and people have more options than ever from which to choose. From bars and restaurants to technological gadgets and mobile applications, it’s the ones that offer something unique and different that stand out and succeed. If you are wondering what kind of successful project to work on for the next year, focus on the ones that have that special feature and stand out from the rest. Often times these differences can lead us to pursue our passion. It’s much easier and more enjoyable to spend time on things we are passionate about. It can take a lot of time to master something or perfect a certain skill, so it’s wise to turn your attention to something about which you’re passionate. Take learning an instrument, for example. A study at the Berlin Academy of Music revealed that it takes 8,000 hours of training to become a professional violinist. Those hours will go by much more quickly if you love what you are doing. But to be successful you have to avoid the pitfalls along the way. One common pitfall is the tendency to give up after a failure or misstep. Don’t fall into this one! Instead, pick yourself up and look at a failure as a chance to learn from your mistakes and make improvements. Another pitfall involves being paralyzed by uncertainty about the future. In reality, no one knows what the future holds – even a winning lottery ticket might turn into a future disaster! It’s better to focus on the present and creating your opportunities. So, now that you know what to look for – and what to avoid – it’s time to follow the plan. To follow through on a plan, you have to spend your time wisely. And to do that you need to have a system to keep you focused and on track. Luckily, there’s a simple 18-minute ritual you can follow every day. First, put aside five minutes in the morning to go over your plan for the day. In addition to things you would like to do, create an “ignore list” of things to avoid. This will help you navigate the work day and stay on target. For example, if one of your goals is to become a better parent, today you might decide to avoid seeking the advice of other parents and instead focus on listening to your child. Scheduling is a useful tool for getting things done. And this doesn’t mean saying, “I’ll get to it tomorrow.” Studies have shown that people are more likely to accomplish a task when they set a very specific time and place. Of course, sometimes things don’t go according to plan and you’ll need to reschedule. But don’t postpone things for more than three days. Try to find time later that same day or sometime soon, and if it still doesn’t get done it might be best to let it go. The next step is to give yourself a one minute pause every hour during the day. It’s easy to get overwhelmed at some point and lose your focus. In order to stay on track, take a short pause every hour to reflect on the progress you’ve made and what lies ahead. Afterward, you’ll be refocused and reenergized. The final step is to take five minutes at the end of the day to review. This is time to think about what did and didn’t work over the course of the day. Remember, learning from mistakes as well as victories is key to long-term success. Now that you have the power of the 18-minute daily plan it’s time to be the boss of your distractions. So, even though you may have a plan in place and a daily ritual to help you stick to it, you might be asking, “What about all the daily distractions?” Defeating distraction isn’t easy, and often the hardest part of accomplishing a task is getting started. You might find that simply changing your environment will help keep you focused. It’s easy to get distracted if you’re looking at the exact same wall every single day. Simply rearranging the chairs in a conference room can help people stay sharp in meetings. Staying motivated is easier when you make accomplishing your tasks fun. Say you have a long-term project in front of you on which it’s intimidating to even get started. Try making a game out of it. Split the project up into different levels to ease the pressure and set up gradually increasing rewards for “beating” those levels. Setting clear boundaries is important for a distraction-free work zone. If you’re working from a closed office, make it clear to everyone, even your kids, that your privacy is to be respected. If you have a knock-first-before-entering policy or a set do-not-disturb time, make sure to keep it enforced or else it can run the risk of being only a suggestion. Sometimes we are our own worst distraction. Here’s a counterintuitive trick to help: distract yourself from your distractions! Often times you can resist temptations to snack or check Twitter by simply stopping and sidetracking yourself. This is similar to pausing and re-focusing yourself on the task at hand. Now that you’ve mastered your distractions, it’s time to start your plan. So here’s a final tip: Start off small, the rest will come naturally. The key message in this book: Don’t do what others are expecting or what seems necessary, do what is right for you. Look at your unique strengths, weaknesses and passions. Then plan your year and follow the ritual of 18 minutes to help you reach your goals and overcome the distractions in your way.  Actionable advice: Celebrate and use failure instead of fearing it. Did you know Iceland is the happiest place on earth? That’s because Icelanders don’t stigmatize failures. And you shouldn’t either. By accepting and learning from your mistakes you will adopt a growth mind-set which can enable you to maximize your potential. Failure is inevitable but also educational. What to read next: Four Seconds, by Peter Bregman As you’ve just discovered, all you need is 18 minutes a day to keep on track with your goals and life plans. But, as valuable as this technique may be, you may still have moments when you feel overloaded or stressed. This is totally normal – but, unfortunately, in such moments it’s easier to act on impulse than to think rationally and carefully. In Four Seconds, you’ll learn how to control yourself in these moments of stress. If you pause briefly and focus on your breath, you’ll greatly improve your ability to make the right choice, even when the pressure is on. To discover more about how to maintain your composure, including why you should treat leadership like learning to ride a bike, head over to the blinks to Four Seconds. Got feedback?

If you browse the internet for investment advice, some “experts” seem to live in that world, too (or maybe they just like fairy tales). Sadly, their investment schemes don’t work in this world. But you can become a very successful investor. And to get there, you don’t even need to study finance. This pack will tell you how to use your common sense to make a solid investment plan and compose your personal portfolio – one that matches your goals, your temperament and your situation in life. Additionally, you will learn about a few common and costly mistakes – and about the best way to keep your money safe in turbulent times. You’ll also discover why Yale’s investment strategy won’t do you any good; the benefits of neglecting your investment account; and why you’re not Marty McFly – and what that means for your portfolio. Ever toy with the idea of adopting the same investment strategy as a filthy-rich company? Even if it was risky and complicated, it worked for them. Why shouldn’t it work for you, too? Well, for a number of reasons! Institutional investors face very different conditions to individual investors like you. First of all, trading is less expensive for institutional investors. Why? Their size gives them the leverage they need to negotiate lower fees when dealing with investment platforms. Secondly, institutions employ several professionals, even full-time staff members, to manage their portfolios on a day-to-day basis. This is something that most individual investors simply can’t afford. Not all institutional investors are created equal, either. The amount of funds available differs widely, and so too do the deals they get into as a result. Take Yale University. Yale’s endowment fund enjoys hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and donations annually. All of this is managed by chief investment officer David Swensen. So far, Swensen has done a great job. With 14 percent gains every year since the mid-1990s, Swensen’s portfolio management style is widely admired, and even earned its own name: the “Yale Model.” Most institutions can’t invest on the same massive scale as Yale. And only large-scale investors, like Yale, can afford the high minimum investments required to get into the funds that are so attractive because of their low management fees. Yale is not only a large-scale investor, but also a nonprofit. Nonprofits benefit from additional advantages that other investors can’t access. As a university, Yale has a perpetual time horizon. This means that there is no time limit on when an investment pays out. This is particularly handy because it means Yale is not obliged to restrict its strategy to short-term investments. Non-profits may also be exempt from paying taxes whereas a portfolio conducted on the same level by a private investor would face significant tax burdens. In short, the investment strategies of institutional giants won’t help you out much. To succeed as an individual investor, you’ll need to find your own path. Before you set out on your journey, let’s investigate a few common mistakes that you’d be wise to avoid. While many books explain what you need to do as a successful investor, few reveal what not to do. And yet being able to avoid bad habits and silly mistakes can have a huge impact. According to financial advisor Nick Murray, investors who correct common mistakes can boost their yearly returns by 3 to 4 percent. If there’s one thing you should avoid from the outset, it’s expecting to get rich fast. Today, we’re nothing short of obsessed with discovering the key to immediate wealth. Truth is, it doesn’t exist! Anyone claiming to have the secret to instant success is either fooling themselves or attempting to fool you. Don’t pay attention to them! Another common mistake is overconfidence. Markets are incredibly difficult to predict, due to the countless variables we humans can’t control. Overconfident investors tend to forget this, and call the shots as if they know exactly how the future will pan out. For example, they might invest a lot of money into a stock that did well for a few months, and end up suffering considerable losses not long after that. Finally, resist the temptation to follow the herd. We tend to do what everyone else does because it feels safer – after all, so many people can’t all be wrong, right? Unfortunately, they can. We saw this in the real estate bubble in the mid-2000s. People bought property they couldn’t afford because everyone else was also buying more than they could afford. But the bubble burst and lives were ruined. So, do your investing career a favor and always think for yourself! Of course, knowing what to avoid isn’t everything. Success as an investor also relies on a few key characteristics. Find out if you have what it takes in the next blink! You might consider yourself fairly intelligent. But is this enough to achieve success? Depends. Despite what you might think, a high IQ isn’t the only marker of intelligence. It’s emotional intelligence that will keep you afloat. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and manage our own feelings and those that exist between people, says psychologist Daniel Goleman. In other words, we need to know how our emotions influence our actions and the people around us. But what does this have to do with investing? A great deal. An investor who feels upbeat and adventurous on a given day is likely to make reckless, potentially devastating decisions if he isn’t careful. Recognizing when your emotions are clouding your rational judgment could save you a lot of trouble! Another trait that successful investors have is the ability to stay calm and composed. Yes, even in situations where your finances are in deep trouble! But how? Well, let’s look back in time for an example. It’s the 1989 Super Bowl, and things aren’t looking great for the San Francisco 49ers: Time is running out, and the opposing team is ahead by three points. Despite this, quarterback Joe Montana keeps his cool, reassures his teammates and scores a perfect touchdown to win the game. His ability to stay composed enabled him to win four Super Bowls! Investors can take a leaf out of Montana’s book when facing market crashes or an economic crisis. Rather than panicking and selling off their assets for pennies, they’ve got to keep it together to assess the situation with a clear head and create a sustainable strategy. Last but not least, good investors are always wary. In other words, they know when they don’t know something. If they don’t know their way around a market or scheme, they stay out of it. For instance, if you wanted to invest in the Chinese stock market, you’d have to ask yourself first whether you truly understand it. If not, don’t get involved. You simply won’t be able to identify risks, like a developing bubble, until it's too late. So, if you’ve got all these traits down pat and are determined to become an investor, what’s next? Start your journey by learning about the risks you’ll face along the way. Risk is a word that gets thrown around a lot by investors. But it can mean many different things to different people. For some, risk is tied to losing money, whereas others see it as volatility. But in every case, risk is always attached to rewards, a relationship which also shapes your investment choices. To put it simply, greater risks yield greater rewards. In other words, don’t expect big payouts when you play it safe. And by the same token, be prepared for a bumpy ride if you’re hunting big rewards. Nothing is free! This is the case with different asset classes in investment. Consider the average yearly returns for stocks, bonds and cash from 1928 through to 2013 (all corrected for inflation): Stocks return 6.5 percent, bonds 1.9 percent and cash 0.5 percent. Stocks yield the highest returns, and they’re also susceptible to the greatest losses at particular times. Why are stocks so inconsistent? Well, their value is based on the dividends and other earnings they’ll yield in the future. But these are dependent on the humans running the business and the nature of the financial market. Stocks, in other words, involve a lot of risks, as reflected in their high-risk premium. Bonds earned three times less than stocks and are considered a little less risky. Why? Investors are more likely to get their returns within a fair amount of time. This, in turn, is reflected in the lower risk premium of stocks. Cash is the safest of them all, with stable annual returns and no losses. But this safety is accompanied by lower returns: With annual returns of a mere 0.5 percent (after inflation), you’d have to wait 150 years to double your investment! Now that we’ve investigated the benefits and risks of these three asset classes, you’re ready to start planning your journey. Learn how to create your personal investment roadmap in the next blink. Ever taken a personality quiz? They’re a lot of fun, and they can come in handy when you start investing! Why? Because investors need to define who they are and find the label that fits them best. Are you a trend follower, a short-term trader or a diversified asset allocator? The list goes on, and it’s your job to find one that fits your personality like a glove. Ask yourself what your core investment values are, and whether a certain style fits your behavioral habits and personal situation. Are you a risk-taker? Or do you want to hold your assets for years? With this figured out, you’ll need to create your own investment plan. And don’t underestimate the importance of this step! Every time you’re ready to make an impulsive move, a glance at your plan will keep you from acting recklessly. An investment plan helps you chose what to do each day in order to reach your long-term goals. From which kinds of stocks and bonds to combine in your portfolio, to which circumstances you plan on buying and selling in, your plan will nip unnecessary errors in the bud. This is rather like how Alabama Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban led his team to win four national championships. Rather than following every new trend in offensive and defensive ballplay, Saban makes one plan only. And his team adheres to this plan religiously. With your own tailor-made investment strategy, you’ll be able to resist the dodgy advice of self-appointed investment “gurus.” Stick to your guns and reap the benefits. Have you seen Back to the Future Part II? In this film, Marty McFly travels to the future and buys a record of sports statistics to take back to the past. Armed with the knowledge of every sports event in the “future,” he hopes to make a killing betting on the results. But, unlike Marty McFly, we have no idea what the future will hold. But we can make our bets safer by investing in a diverse range of assets. By diversifying across different asset classes and risk factors, we can prepare ourselves for the worst. If anything goes wrong in one class, our losses will level out through the gains made in the other classes. Having your portfolio spread across multiple assets might mean you miss out on extra big gains when one of your assets does well, but this is an acceptable sacrifice to make to safeguard yourself against going broke. Once you’ve allocated your assets, don’t reallocate them unless you have a very good reason to do so. Changing your thoughtfully structured portfolio spontaneously is bad news. A study by Fidelity Investments revealed that the top-performing portfolios were those the owners had forgotten about. In other words, the portfolios where nothing had been changed for years. Continuously second-guessing your portfolio decisions can create extra trading costs, tax implications and a psychological burden. If you’re certain you want to change your portfolio, you’ll need reasons more substantial than “because I was afraid that . . .” or “because I got so excited about . . .” The market fluctuates, and these fluctuations should never be a reason to change your portfolio. The key message in this book: Stay aware of your financial situation, your personality and emotional states when making investment decisions. With a simple, consistent strategy and thoughtful approach, common sense is your guide on your journey to becoming a successful investor.  Actionable advice: Put your investment plan in writing. Don’t just rely on your memory! Get your investment plan written down. It doesn’t matter how long it is – the process of writing it is crucial. Why? Because to get something on paper, you need to be specific about how you’re going to manage your portfolio. This is a central aspect of successful investing. Got feedback?

These flashy big spenders, who strove at all costs to maintain their glamorous and luxurious lifestyle, have come to epitomize the excesses of that decade. Few stories embody these traits and the general atmosphere of the 1980s as well as that of RJR Nabisco and its CEO Ross Johnson. But it’s not just a story of one company – it’s the story of how a once fairly benevolent business practice, the leveraged buyout, transformed into something much more sinister. In these blinks, you’ll find out why leveraged buyouts became so common; how Johnson rose to his prominent position; and why RJR Nabisco was such an attractive target for a hostile takeover. Have you heard the term leveraged buyout, or LBO? Well, by the 1980s, the LBO had become a dirty word, synonymous with corporate greed and the unhinged nature of Wall Street. But at its inception, the LBO was simply a way to preserve family wealth. These transactions were devised by clever lawyers who were looking for ways to help wealthy business owners skirt estate taxes and pass money onto their heirs. Not coincidentally, LBOs first came on the scene in the late 1960s, when a generation of people, some of whom had built massive business empires, were getting ready to retire. Because of the way estate taxes function, if business owners wanted to retire and pass their companies on to their heirs, they would have had to pay huge sums of money in taxes. Under these circumstances, they generally had three options: first, they could pass the company on to an heir and pay their taxes in full; second, they could sell the company, relinquishing control of it in the process; and finally, they could go public, putting the business – and its stock price – at the mercy of the market. Naturally, none of these three choices were especially appealing. So, a lawyer by the name of Jerry Kohlberg developed a solution, albeit a rather slow-moving and lengthy one. Say Mr. Big was retiring. His lawyers would found a shell company and bring in a number of investors who would take out massive loans to buy Mr. Big’s company out. Mr. Big would still keep a stake in his business, thereby maintaining some control, while the investors would have gotten the target company for a much lower price than if they acquired it at the end of a bidding war with other prospective buyers. The money for these buyouts would come from bank loans, insurance bonds and the personal funds of the investors. As a result, the investors involved only paid about ten percent of the cost, while getting 30 percent from insurance bonds and 60 percent from bank loans. In other words, the investors acquired the target company for almost nothing, while the shell company took on a massive amount of debt, the effects of which would be mostly felt by the target company. In 1982, a company called Gibson Greetings was sold for $80 million to an investment group that had paid just $1 million of the cost themselves. A year and half later, the firm went public and was resold, this time for $290 million. The primary individual investor had put down $330,000 and had turned it into $66 million; in other words, the LBO craze was in full swing. It was clear to investors how profitable this tactic was and, by 1983, ten times more LBOs were taking place compared to just four years earlier. So what prompted this frenzy? Well, there were two main factors. First, the US Internal Revenue Code played a central role by allowing deductions of interest tax, but not dividends. As a result, companies were encouraged to go into debt and pay interest, rather than operate at a profit. Second, the appearance of junk bonds, speculative investments with a high risk of default, made it possible to raise a massive sum of money in a short period. Junk bonds can be raised in a snap, transforming LBOs from slow, ambling processes into rapid-fire, aggressive takeovers. Naturally, this change raised eyebrows and LBOs were chastised just as vigorously as they were promoted. The proponents of this tactic said it made firms leaner and increased their value, which was a valid point since an LBO could transform a company. After all, the massive debt burden involved enabled investors to streamline the business without mercy, cutting costs wherever possible. However, the debt burden also fueled criticism against LBOs. Government officials warned that a leveraged takeover one day meant a bankruptcy the next. Naturally, the losers in such situations were the employees of the target companies, many of whom lost their jobs. But the original shareholders also suffered; their investment value crumbled as the company took on all the new debt. But enough about the minute details. Now that you have some background on what an LBO is, next you’ll learn about a man who was behind one of the biggest leveraged buyouts of all time. In the 1950s, a man named Ross Johnson entered the Canadian business scene at the bottom of the corporate ladder. He would go on to become a prime example of a new breed of businessman, one that eagerly moved from firm to firm, pledging allegiance to investors rather than to a company. Playing the game this way turned out to be quite lucrative, and Ross was no stranger to luxury – he was fundamentally driven by a love for travel, celebrities and the finer things in life. He never stopped seeking the thrill of buying new properties, eating at world-renowned restaurants and meeting stars. In fact, he even kept a number of celebrities on his payroll to promote his company of choice at any given time. Good examples are former American Football player Frank Gifford and famed tennis star Rod Laver. To boot, Ross also had a penchant for attending celebrity golf tournaments. But while he was soaking up the good life, Ross didn’t pay much attention to the consequences of his often nefarious business strategies. For instance, he would liquidate entire departments on a mere whim and relocate whole sectors to different cities, simply in the name of a tactical advantage. To put it differently, Ross would happily sacrifice innumerable pawns to help capture a bishop. So, how did he ascend to such power? Well, his first position was a sales job in his home country of Canada. He worked his way up the ladder and, in 1963, got a break while working at T. Eaton, an old Canadian department store, under the management of a notorious head of personnel, Tony Peskett. Peskett pushed all his followers to keep business and management in perpetual flux, constantly shaking up companies and the market alike. While critics of this approach said that such a tactic simply meant pursuing change for the sake of change, leaving behind a trail of chaos and destruction, Johnson personally benefited tremendously by adhering to it. He soon began making crafty moves and was able to climb the corporate hierarchy during the frequent shakeups. Johnson benefited from his relationship with Peskett, but it wasn’t long before he was applying his mentor’s knowledge on a much grander scale. Johnson’s big chance came in 1976 when he became the CEO of the Canadian packaged goods company, Standard Brands. Finally, he was in a position where he called the shots. In this role, Johnson was already living the high life, but his insatiable thirst for bigger and better things made him set his sights on a merger with a much larger company: Nabisco. In the end, Nabisco technically took over Standard Brands – but in practice, quite the opposite happened. Back then, Nabisco was already responsible for some of the most popular crackers and cookies in the world, Ritz and Oreo among them. Because of their incredibly successful products, by the time the 1980s Nabisco had settled into an efficient, conservative monolith of a company. Employees never worked past 5:00 p.m. and no one feared for their jobs. However, when Nabisco merged with Standard Brands, the upheaval practiced by Johnson soon clashed with the Nabisco’s established protocols. Rather than spending time in boring meetings, mired with endless presentations, the crew from Standard Brands haphazardly shot out ideas, heckling everyone around them. They even taunted Johnson, who happily encouraged this rambunctious behavior. Johnson’s approach rapidly permeated Nabisco, and the same shift would occur when the firm later merged with RJR Reynolds, one of the world’s largest tobacco companies. At the time, RJR Reynolds was one of America’s most successful cigarette brands. Its founder had introduced innovations such as the first pre-rolled cigarette, as well as a famous brand of pipe tobacco, and the company dominated the market. When the firms merged, it was because of the growth opportunities it would afford both of them. However, the flashy behavior of the Northern US company, Nabisco, immediately conflicted with the values of its Southern counterpart, RJR. For example, employees at the RJR factory had never even seen a limousine, whereas it was the preferred mode of transportation for Nabisco managers. So, Ross Johnson was famous for shaking up businesses, but a new kid on the scene would challenge his burgeoning power. His name was Henry Kravis, a Wall Street banker who was making millions through LBOs. Ross had a distinct approach and, while most other traders were closing deals in hours or days, it could take years for him to seal an LBO. Naturally, Kravis’s higher-ups at the investment bank Bear Stearns weren’t so keen on this protracted timeframe. For example, Kravis was at one point made the interim CEO of a stationery company during an LBO, prompting a furious call from his boss at Bear Stearns who wanted to know what one of his senior traders was doing at the helm of a crumbling paper company. Kravis’ vision clearly wasn’t appreciated, and he soon left the firm, along with his cousin George Roberts, to team up with the originator of LBOs, Jerry Kohlberg. Together, in 1976, the trio formed the infamous private equity company, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). It was through this firm that Kravis played a key role in changing LBOs from innocuous tax workarounds into a powerful vehicle for corporate takeovers. However, Henry and George were much more interested in cutting huge deals than Jerry was. The cousins knew that making a $100-million deal took about as much work as cutting one for $10 billion – and they weren’t about to waste their time. By 1987, all the big players in the LBO world had a pool of investor money to use for LBOs. But the Kravis cousins set their sights on an even bigger pot. By forming a massive investment fund, the pair would show everyone that they had the most power and that the biggest deals belonged to them. To accomplish this goal, coming off of a massive deal with the Chicago-based Beatrice Foods, KKR began seeking funding for a new war chest. The company even waived management fees of their fund for the first several years to bring in more investors. Pretty soon, they had pulled together $5.6 billion, twice as much money as the competition. Professionals like the Kravis cousins were largely responsible for refining LBOs – but with so much money to be made, just about everyone wanted in on the action. So, while Johnson didn’t have any need to carry out an LBO, he knew that if he didn’t, he would look back on the moment as an opportunity lost. But Johnson knew that his greed would put off any serious players from touching RJR Nabisco, KKR included. As a result, his only option was to go with an outsider in the LBO world, the investment banking company Shearson. This firm was desperate to snag their own piece of the LBO pie, and they gladly agreed to absolutely insane terms, including handing over a massive cut of the total deal to Johnson and ensuring the maintenance of certain departmental budgets and retirement packages. Naturally, such concessions would jeopardize the austerity measures on which any solid LBO rests, such as downsizing departments to repay the debt incurred through the deal. But this wasn’t the only issue; involving several LBO novices meant that the deal was handled without the discretion and ruthlessness necessary to succeed. After all, a well-executed LBO is over before anyone realizes it has begun. To ensure this, senior executives get together with investors and come up with a buyout package. Once everything is in order and they have arrived at a share price offer, the executives put the proposal to a vote of the board. At this point, the deal is already so far along that the board basically has no choice but to say yes. The management calls for a yes or no vote, and if the board says no, corporate raiders are standing by to swoop in and grab the vulnerable company simply by buying enough of its shares on the stock market. However, in the case of Johnson’s deal, a lack of experience meant that information got out before it should have, resulting in disastrous consequences. Johnson’s LBO bid was doomed to failure from the get-go. Here’s how it played out: He and Shearson intended to offer a price of $75 a share for RJR Nabisco, $4 per share higher than the company had ever sold for. After the numbers were crunched, this came out to a total price tag of $17.6 billion, double the amount that any bank had ever loaned for a takeover. In fact, it wasn’t even initially clear if there was that much money available in the world. Naturally, when the board heard about Johnson’s offer, they insisted on issuing a press statement and opening up an opportunity for other offers to come in. Frankly, the board didn’t care for Johnson or his management style and were happy to get rid of him if they could. As the news spread, offers began pouring in. A special committee was tasked with getting the best deal for shareholders, and two offers stood out: KKR offered $94 a share, and First Boston, by way of a tax loophole, was prepared to offer anywhere from $105 to $118 a share. But before these offers were made, Shearson got word that Kravis was going to throw his hat into the ring, and changed its bid to $100 a share in an attempt to outbid him. In the end, it didn’t matter; the outlandishly large offer from First Boston prompted a second round of bidding. All involved parties were asked to place another bid and First Boston was asked to show how they could come up with the funds. Both Shearson and Kohlberg Kravis increased their bids, coming out to between $108 and $109, while First Boston failed to secure the necessary financing. As a result, the battle came down to a dead heat between the two firms. The board was faced with a tough decision: acquiesce to the iron grip of KKR or hand victory to Johnson. If you were a part of Ross Johnson’s gang, you could count on leading a pretty charmed life – but other people were basically irrelevant to him. That’s why, when the LBO came before the board, it was already obvious that Ross was utterly indifferent to everyone else. In the end, the fact that he viewed each person in the company as expendable would drive the board’s decision against him. It didn’t help Johnson that his management deal became emblematic of corporate greed. All it took was a single New York Times article, which laid bare the lucrative deal Johnson’s team was aiming for, to unleash a national cascade of criticism. Of course, the board saw this media event as just one more blow to RJR Nabisco’s already tarnished reputation, and the special committee, therefore, chose KKR, which promised to put the company and its employees above all else. Just like that, Ross Johnson was done for at RJR Nabisco, and everyone, from rural workers to board members, was happy to see him go. KKR would introduce much-needed order to the company by applying their experience of acquiring companies without dismantling them. So, while the deal wasn't the pot of gold everyone had assumed it would be, it also didn’t break KKR with its sheer scale. And that wraps up the story of Ross Johnson. His legacy is one of corporate greed in excess, but he certainly had a good time along the way and held few regrets about those years. In fact, because of his talents as a salesman and his plain lack of ethics, he continued to have a thriving career throughout the 1980s in the United States. While some people’s fortunes were made or destroyed with the RJR Nabisco LBO deal, Ross simply entered semiretirement, laughing at the whole affair. He formed a consulting firm with an old friend and, while neither of them actually needed the money, they were happy to entertain themselves by doling out cheap advice to friends. The key message in this book: Leveraged buyouts began as a clever workaround for wealthy business owners to get out of paying estate taxes, but soon transformed into a vehicle for hostile corporate takeovers. The story of these deals is loaded with powerful characters and driven by distinct differences in approaches that separated the winners from the losers.   Got feedback?

Cunningham","summary":"Some personalities are so influential and awe-inspiring that it’s difficult to imagine the world without them. Investment legend Warren Buffett is that sort of personality. Having molded Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate worth more than $300 billion, from the ground up, Buffett is seen as the foundation without which the firm could not stand on its own. Yet these blinks will show that the core values that Buffett has worked so hard to instill, and the corporate culture that has resulted, are exactly what will keep Berkshire Hathaway successful even after Buffett is gone. And in exploring Buffett’s path, you will learn how you too can instill such a rock-solid culture in your own company. In these blinks, you’ll also learn how flipping burgers can actually lead to living your ultimate dream; why junior managers should make more decisions than senior managers; and who’s next in line when Berkshire founder Warren Buffett is gone. Starting from humble roots in 1965, Berkshire Hathaway has grown to become one of the world’s largest corporations. This company’s iconic leader, Warren Buffet, rocketed to fame in the 1990s as his savvy stock-picking gained him shares in top companies such as American Express, Coca-Cola and the Washington Post Company. As a corporation, Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings are vast and diversified, and its influence extends over a wide array of commercial, financial and manufacturing interests. Some of the companies it owns include: GEICO, the second most-popular car insurer in the United States; Burlington Northern Santa Fe, one of North America’s major transcontinental railroads; and MidAmerican Energy, a global energy supplier. And it’s not just through Berkshire Hathaway’s broad engagement in many different businesses that it demonstrates its ability to diversify. The company’s subsidiaries differ widely in almost every measurable category, such as acquisition price, company size and number of employees.   With such a variety of companies under one roof, a degree of homogeneity might be expected. Berkshire Hathaway’s subsidiaries do indeed share its own unique corporate culture, built on core values that serve to bring unity to such a wide-ranging portfolio. One of the company’s core values is eternality. Long-term partnerships are highly valued at Berkshire Hathaway; the firm presents itself to subsidiaries, including many family businesses, as a place where they can find a permanent home. In this way, unifying traits and commonalities are found in bonds of trust rather than in simple financial metrics. These traits when taken together create the Berkshire Hathaway culture. Berkshire Hathaway’s culture is made up of core values, which are spelled out by the individual letters in BERKSHIRE: that is, for every letter, there’s a corresponding value.   Let’s explore the acronym’s first two letters to learn the firm’s two most important values. The “B” stands for one of Berkshire Hathaway’s most essential principles: budget consciousness. Consider how the company’s stake in GEICO, a car insurer, supports its budget-conscious focus. GEICO practices budget consciousness through serious frugality and extraordinary operating efficiency. The company’s goal to keep costs at an absolute minimum isn’t merely to increase profits, however. GEICO in fact passes along most of its savings to customers as lower premiums. This policy in turn attracts more customers, and results in greater total premium volume for the company. The “E” refers to earnestness. The value of keeping promises, earnestness is a characteristic which broadly applies to all Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, particularly its insurance companies. The business philosophy of Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary National Indemnity Company (NICO) is based on earnestness at its most effective. Its philosophy stresses that while an insurance policy is merely a promise, NICO aims to offer promises of the highest quality. How does the company do this? NICO writes policies that other insurers won’t or can’t because such policies involve unusual risks for proportional premiums. In the months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, NICO wrote large-scale terrorism policies including a $1 billion policy for several international airlines and a $500 million policy for an overseas oil platform. NICO can write such policies and stick to its earnestness principle as it has made Berkshire Hathaway’s core values its own. A good reputation goes a long way, and not just in terms of maintaining a friendship. Even a company’s finances can benefit from a company’s good rep in an industry. Importantly, investing in the value of reputation – the “R” in BERKSHIRE – has paid off for Berkshire Hathaway companies. Successful furniture retailer and Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary Jordan’s Furniture earns some $950 of revenue per square foot annually, a number that’s nearly six times the industry average. The company’s secret? Jordan’s Furniture has a solid reputation based on its unique customer service. Its approach goes beyond offering a wide selection of furniture at good prices with prompt delivery to orchestrating a special experience that the company calls “shoppertainment.” At one Jordan’s store, for instance, customers can take a seat in a small theater to watch a flight simulation. At another, customers can stroll along a model of Bourbon Street in New Orleans and even tour a riverboat. These entertaining in-store concepts attract tons of interested customers and in turn generate high sales. Truly Jordan’s investment in the value of reputation has paid off! The “K” in BERKSHIRE, kinship, has also proved valuable for Berkshire subsidiaries. In striving to solidify kinship bonds, Berkshire Hathaway aims to create wealth that lasts generations, in the same way that a tight-knit family values identity and legacy. Berkshire Hathaway does business for the long-term. This makes family businesses particularly attractive for it, as they are often characterized by powerful bonds such as fairness, mutual respect and trust. And in business, this pays off. In 1995, Berkshire Hathaway was able to acquire family business RC Willey Home Furnishings for $25 million less than a rival bid. RC Willey knew that Berkshire Hathaway appreciated the strengths of family businesses and saw value in its financial position and policy of permanent relationships. Thus the benefits of its corporate culture allowed Berkshire Hathaway to seal a deal while also saving money! As an entrepreneur in the field of acquisitions, Warren Buffett showed how a small business could transform into a huge corporation. It’s no surprise that this entrepreneurial spirit still fuels Berkshire Hathaway’s company culture. Berkshire managers must be self-starters, the “S” in BERKSHIRE. Self-starters are entrepreneurs who have a vision and can run a business on their own. In fact, among Berkshire’s entrepreneurs are several recipients of the Horatio Alger Award, an honor for individuals who have achieved success often in the face of adversity. One award winner was Albert Lee Ueltschi, founder of FlightSafety International. At just 16 years old, Ueltschi opened a hamburger stand called “Little Hawk” and used the profits to fund his flying lessons. His passion for flying then inspired him to teach others how to fly. Ueltschi eventually created the world’s premier commercial pilot training school, using flight simulators to teach routine patterns and emergency drills. Since 1996, FlightSafety has been part of Berkshire Hathaway. To encourage a self-starter mentality in employees, Berkshire Hathaway practices a hands off (the “H” in BERKSHIRE) management approach. Most businesses are often organized bureaucratically, mired in committees and meetings, with multiple layers of reporting to make sure every message and decision is controlled. In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway’s management approach values decentralization and autonomy. Every subsidiary stands on its own, and only the most mission-critical decisions are made at headquarters. Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries employ more than 300,000 people, while Berkshire’s headquarters claims only two dozen employees. Some Berkshire subsidiaries also practice the 90/10 rule, in which junior managers make 90 percent of the decisions while senior managers collaborate on the rest – in particular for issues which involve unusual risk, require special skills or go beyond the expertise of junior managers. This hands-off style is exactly what makes Berkshire Hathaway attractive to self-starters. Executives appreciate that they can continue running their businesses independently yet feel secure in a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway at the same time. Over some 50 years, Berkshire Hathaway has acquired dozens of companies, and the value of each has increased over time. How has the firm managed to do this? Because the company’s subsidiaries do a lot of acquiring, and are successful at it, too. They have investor savvy, the “I” in BERKSHIRE. This means that subsidiaries keep an eye out for companies with an organizational culture that fits their own – which enables them to attract a target company without even having to make the highest bid. Moreover, many Berkshire subsidiaries replicate the firm’s approach to acquisitions by attracting companies that also stress core values, such as trust and partnership. Chemical company and Berkshire subsidiary Lubrizol has made a number of smaller acquisitions, many of which have gained it not only talented scientists and business managers who fit well with its ethical, research-driven culture but also increased research and development capabilities. You may have noticed that subsidiaries are also of a particular nature. We’ve seen so far that Berkshire Hathaway companies engage in business in the fields of energy, transport, chemicals, insurance or furniture, as just a few examples. In sum, the firm’s acquisition criteria states a preference for businesses that are easy to understand; that is, businesses that are at their essence, rudimentary – the “R” in BERKSHIRE. The logic is that such businesses have been around for a long time and are thus well-understood; what’s more, such businesses are expected to be around for many years to come, which jibes with the firm’s preference for permanence and long-term value. Such rudimentary businesses usually pose less risk than do new or seemingly exotic industries. At Berkshire Hathaway, it is more important to keep things simple and not lose money, rather than to make money by taking big risks. It’s the question on everyone’s mind: what happens to Berkshire when Warren Buffett passes away? Many people fear that losing Buffett could mean the end of Berkshire Hathaway. But keeping in mind the company’s core value of eternality – the “E” in BERKSHIRE – Buffett has developed his company’s culture and practices in a way that will see Berkshire Hathaway endure long after he is gone. Since 1993, Buffett has written a number of articles about what Berkshire should be without him, and he’s also formalized with the board a succession plan, which prescribes splitting Buffett’s job into two separate roles: management and investment. Berkshire Hathaway has since recruited investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, two men who possess the necessary skills to handle the investment line of Buffett’s job and have even surpassed Buffett’s investment performance in recent years! Buffett has ensured that his company has solid candidates for future managers waiting in the wings as well. The most important trait for a successor as manager and chief executive officer is a commitment to Berkshire Hathaway culture. Thus, as the succession plan outlines, the best candidates are insiders, or those employees who now manage Berkshire subsidiaries. The strongest candidate is Frank Ptak, chief executive officer at the Marmon Group since 2006. Ptak has over 40 years of business experience. Yet there’s no question that Buffett’s successors, whoever they may be, will certainly face challenges. An upheaval in the firm’s subsidiaries is a definite possibility. Buffett’s successors will have to vet managers carefully to avoid tense relations and ensure that only the most outstanding managers are selected, while a long tenure of executives is also maintained. Another challenge is carrying on Buffet’s unique approach to acquisitions. Typically, accountants and lawyers examine a takeover target over weeks or months. In contrast, Buffett sizes people up often in less than a minute, and a deal is reached without delay, sometimes as part of the first phone call! Of course, not everyone can do business this way! Buffett’s successors will have to find their own approach to acquisitions that fit their personal skills best. In the mid-1990s, financial analysts mulled the question whether holding company Marmon Group would fall apart after its founders, Jay and Robert Pritzker, passed away. Today the financial community is  confronting a similar question as it attempts to divine the fate of Berkshire Hathaway, considering that Warren Buffett in 2015 will turn 85 years old. The similarities between Marmon Group and Berkshire Hathaway are many. Both have pursued a variety of diverse businesses as acquisition targets; both have sought out rudimentary businesses and follow on the whole a decentralized management style. And both Marmon Group and Berkshire Hathaway were founded and developed by powerful men who left an indelible mark on their respective companies. Critics who believed that Marmon Group would collapse after the Pritzkers were proven wrong. The firm continued to thrive, acquiring more than 100 companies. And in 2008, Marmon Group became a Berkshire subsidiary, fitting right in because of shared core values. Frank Ptak, Marmon Group director since 2003, is now chief executive officer. The company continues to operate much as it did decades before, when Jay and Robert Pritzker were still in charge. Though few things are certain, we can learn much from the Marmon Group case. When Berkshire Hathaway holds true to its core values like Marmon Group did, it will be able to live on and continue to prosper, even after Buffett is gone. The key message in this book: Budget consciousness, earnestness and kinship are some of the key characteristics that give strength to business endeavors at Berkshire Hathaway, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate led by self-starters and driven by a hands-off management philosophy. By maintaining a strong reputation in many industries, encouraging savvy investing and preferring rudimentary businesses, Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren Buffett has built a legacy that will continue to prosper even when he’s gone.  Actionable advice: Build core values with your own company name. Berkshire Hathaway showed that one way to create a set of core values that your employees can remember and live by is to build them into your company’s name. Berkshire for example took each letter and assigned it a value, such as budget consciousness for “B” and earnestness for “E.” Try it yourself! In doing so, you might just discover some key principles with which your company can thrive.

From overdue library fees to parking fines, our financial mishaps can be frustrating – but they rarely cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. And as it turns out, even the world’s most eminent investors miscalculate and end up deep in the red. Whether it’s overconfidence or an underperforming economy, it turns out the people we hold to be financial wizards are still just people too. Here, Michael Batnick takes a select few investors and runs us through their worst investments. What’s more, he shows that we’re in a privileged position – by learning from the best’s mistakes, we receive the benefit of their hard-won wisdom without the cost of heavy losses. In the following blinks, you’ll learn the name of the most influential book ever written on investment; how Warren Buffett lost over $400 million; and why Mark Twain should have stuck to writing. Humans naturally seek explanations for events in the world; neat little rules and tidy formulas that package things up into clear explanations. Unfortunately, the world is far too complex for this to really work – and as the legendary investor Benjamin Graham demonstrated, this is particularly true with investment. Graham had a wildly successful financial career and authored the most influential investment book of all time: The Intelligent Investor, which was deemed “the best book on investing ever written” by the legendary Warren Buffett. But Graham’s most important act was pioneering a powerful new financial technique called value investing. And at the heart of this concept is Graham’s observation that the price of a company fluctuates more than its value. This means that the cost of a company’s shares – its price – often doesn’t reflect the company’s value, which is a combination of things like revenue, assets and future potential. So, why this difference between price and value? Well, it’s because humans set prices while businesses set values – and because humans are more fickle and emotional than businesses, price and value can vary considerably. For example, when Graham watched General Electric’s valuation plummet from $1.87 billion to $784 million in the 1930s, he noted that nothing disastrous had happened to the company’s assets, employees or revenue that year – it was simply investor optimism and pessimism driving these changes. But even Benjamin Graham couldn’t concoct a market-beating formula, and his philosophy almost ruined him during the Great Depression. After watching prices skyrocket during the 1920s, he sensed that prices and value were way out of sync. So, he decided to bet against the market, predicting prices would fall. And he was right – except he misjudged the extent of the fall. By 1930, the stock market had taken a beating. Assuming that the worst was over, Graham began to invest heavily once again. But prices kept falling, and the market wouldn’t truly bottom out until 1932; by that time, Graham’s portfolio had lost 70 percent of its value. Experiences like Graham’s prove there are no iron-clad laws in investing, and certainly no magic formula. Being aware of value is critical, but don’t be a slave to it. Cheap can always get cheaper. The famous investment maxim “buy low, sell high” has endured for a reason; it simplifies one of the most complex industries around with sound logic. But ironically, the man who coined it had an irrational appetite for risk. Jesse Livermore was born in Massachusetts in 1877. At 23, he moved to New York and secured a stockbroking job, where he made $50,000 in his first week. Things were going well, but soon Livermore made a fatal miscalculation – and it wouldn’t be his last. In 1901, Livermore shorted 1,000 shares of U.S. Steel and 1,000 shares of Santa Fe Railroad stock. In investor parlance, going short is the opposite of buying: you predict stock will decline from its current price, and aim to pocket the difference if it does. It’s a risky tactic; if shares increase in price, you’ll lose money. The price of Livermore’s shares rose. He lost around $50,000 on these two deals, his entire fortune. In fact, he was worse than broke: he owed his employers $500! But Jesse Livermore wasn’t finished yet. After working to repay his debt, Livermore returned to New York to start speculating again. The next few decades were a turbulent time, and the talented but flawed trader made and lost millions of dollars. Even so, the 1929 crash created the perfect environment for going short, which suited the naturally skeptical Livermore. Soon, he’d amassed a fortune that’d be worth $1.4 billion today. Livermore was one of the richest people in the world – but this would be his high-water mark. When the stock market reached its lowest in 1932, it had fallen to such an extreme that a corrective bounce seemed likely. In fact, days later it experienced its greatest bounce in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an important stock market index, surged 93 percent in 42 days. But there was a problem: Livermore had bet his capital on further losses. He was crushed. Days later, he decided to reverse his bets and hope stocks would rise further. They didn’t. After struggling in poverty for the next few years, Jesse Livermore committed suicide on November 29, 1940. Jesse Livermore is a go-to source for financial words of wisdom, but bankrupted himself multiple times by failing to manage his risk. So what’s the most important strategy to manage your risk? Diversification. Imagine you’ve got a nest egg tucked away. You know investing it is a risky business, but you want to give it a go anyway. You split your money between ten stocks, but soon one crashes to zero and you’ve lost 10 percent of your capital. But if you’d split your investment between 100 companies, you would’ve lost only one percent. This is diversification: a strategy the Sequoia Fund should’ve paid more attention to. One of the most successful investment firms of all time, Sequoia prefers long-term and large-scale investments. This preference for potent positions is the very opposite of diversification, but it has worked magnificently: a $10,000 investment into Sequoia in July 1970 would be worth $4 million today. But in 2010, the fund introduced shareholders to an ill-fated purchase: shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals. On April 28, 2010, Sequoia began purchasing shares in Valeant at $16. By the year’s end, the company’s price had ballooned by 70 percent. The next year was just as auspicious: Valeant gained 76 percent in the first quarter, becoming the fund’s largest holding. Things seemed rosy, but financial disaster was just around the corner. Sequoia described Valeant to its stakeholders as a company which cuts corners on research and development (R&D) but invests “heavily in its sales force.” This might sound like savvy cost-cutting, but the reality is far more crooked: Valeant skimped on R&D because its business model revolved around purchasing existing drugs and jacking up their prices. Just take Valeant’s 2013 purchase of Medicis – a company who invented a treatment for people exposed to lead poisoning. Before the acquisition, the drug cost healthcare providers $950. Overnight, the price rocketed to $27,000. Because of incidents like these, Valeant started receiving increasingly bad press. And when presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to prevent price gouging in the pharmaceutical industry, Valeant’s shares slid 31 percent. One month later, Citron Research published a report accusing Valeant of accounting fraud. Shares tumbled another 19 percent. The debacle was a disaster for Sequoia. Soon after, they sold their entire position – the fund’s biggest holding – and took a 90 percent loss. The company’s assets crashed from $9 billion to under $5 billion in the space of a few months. The lesson to take from this incident is that concentrated holdings can generate wealth quickly – and decimate it just as fast. Mark Twain is one of the great American novelists. He combined a sharp writing style with wry humor and an ability to convey great emotion. And, like many novelists, he put passion before logic in everything he did. In 1893, he wrote “when you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain.” Good advice, sure – but with such a visceral mind, it's hard to think of someone more unsuited to investing. Yet that's exactly what he pursued in his spare time. Twain was constantly searching for the “next big thing” to revolutionize our lives. In his time, he ploughed his fortune into many non-starters – but was particularly infatuated with inventors and their devices. For example, in the 1870s the author “invested” $42,000 – around $953,000 in today’s money – into a new technological process called a kaolotype. Charles Sneider, the inventor, claimed it would change the illustration and engraving industry by streamlining the process, and Twain was convinced. He put Sneider on a salary, and even funded a workshop in Manhattan without any agreement on deadlines. But the kaolotype was ineffectual, Sneider dishonest, and Twain didn’t receive a penny back from the episode. Twain’s biggest blunder was yet to come. Sore over his mounting losses and bitter toward inventors, Twain passed on a golden opportunity: the telephone. Twain was invited by his friend, General Joseph Roswell, to hear a pitch from a young inventor named Alexander Graham Bell. According to Twain, Bell gave a moving pitch filled with passion for his new product – but he still declined. Twain said he “didn’t want anything more to do with wildcat speculation.” At this, Bell even offered Twain the stock at a discount price. Twain’s reply? He didn’t want the stock at any price! The trouble was that Twain was an emotional man and got attached to his investments. When they failed, he felt aggrieved – which then clouded his rational thinking for future investments. But what if Twain had set hard limits on what he was prepared to invest before signing on the dotted line? After all, a proven way to avoid rash decisions is to decide how much you’re willing to lose before you invest. This way, logic – not fear – drives your business decisions. As a schoolkid, did you ever take a test you were sure you’d fail, only to wind up with a decent grade? If so, you probably felt pretty good about your abilities, and maybe it even encouraged you to stop studying! One possibility you probably didn’t consider, though, is that it was an unusually easy test – just like how Jerry Tsai’s plaudits probably didn’t acknowledge that the 1960s was an easy decade for investments. Jerry Tsai was managing the firm Fidelity Capital Fund before he’d turned 30. He was a character who exuded confidence; finance’s hot prospect in the 1960s and the first celebrity fund manager. His aggressive investment style involved executing many lightning-fast trades – often instinctive and perfectly timed. Most importantly, though, he was effective: from 1958 to 1965, Tsai delivered Fidelity annual gains of 296 percent. He was hailed as a hero, and left Fidelity in 1965 to start his own fund: The Manhattan Fund. And from there, Tsai’s star kept on rising. The Manhattan Fund offered 2.5 million shares in its company to financial professionals – but Tsai’s reputation had spread beyond the world of finance. Demand was ten times greater than anticipated: the Manhattan Fund issued 27 million shares in total and raised $247 million in capital. It was the biggest offering ever for an investment company. This was a time of huge economic expansion: post-war austerity was over and many early tech companies were beginning to flourish. Between 1964 and 1968, the earnings of IBM and Xerox grew by 88 and 171 percent, respectively. Tsai himself was from a generation of investors who had only known extraordinary growth and affluence. In the 1960s stocks rose exponentially, and this gave Tsai an overinflated confidence in his own ability. But the 1969-1970 price plunge was just around the corner, and when it arrived, he was caught completely flat-footed. Just take the Manhattan Fund’s investment in National Student Marketing. Tsai bought $5 million worth of shares at $143 each and watched this tumble to just $3.50 seven months later. Tsai’s machine-gun style of investment wasn’t suited to recessions and their aftermaths – the new climate rewarded patient, long-term trades. In 1969, the Manhattan fund ranked 299th out of 305 funds, and investors left in droves. Tsai was playing an unwinnable game. He overestimated his personal ability in a time of great financial growth and paid the price when rapid trading became unprofitable. Remember: a rising tide raises all boats, so it’s a mistake to assume that yours is particularly buoyant! Imagine you’re at a soccer game. To heighten the drama, you decide to place a wager on the outcome. But it’s a tough call - both teams seem equally skilled. Once you place your bet, though, you instantly feel confident about your choice. Suddenly a fan approaches you, offering to buy your bet slip – for more than you wagered. Would you do it? Well, according to several psychologists, it’s unlikely you would. In a famous paper from 1991, academics Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler described what they called the endowment effect. This hypothesis argues that we ascribe more value to things simply because we own them. But it doesn’t mean our possessions are inherently appealing – it’s just harder to give them up. This illustrates two important points: first, objective thinking melts away when we own something; second, our confidence rises once we’ve made a decision. It’s then that we fall prey to overconfidence. Just ask Warren Buffett, perhaps the most famous investor of all time. Buffett has a stellar track record. Between 1957 and 1969, the “Oracle of Omaha” managed a partnership which returned gains of 2,610 percent. In 1972, Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, purchased See’s Candy for $30 million. Since then, it’s generated $1.9 billion in pretax revenue! By 1993, Buffett had a long list of success stories. He was flying high and oozing confidence – but his biggest mistake was around the corner. That year, Berkshire purchased the Dexter Shoe Company for $433 million. Dexter was an American-based manufacturer, and it had Buffett’s total confidence. He wrote to Berkshire shareholders “Dexter, I can assure you, needs no fixing: It is one of the best-managed companies Charlie and I have seen in our business lifetimes.” The legendary investor was so enamored of his new purchase that he failed to see the winds of change blowing through the industry. Just five years later, Dexter was in freefall. The rise of manufacturing powerhouses like China and Taiwan crippled the US domestic shoe market. By 1999, Dexter’s revenue had declined 18 percent. It ended its US shoe production in 2001, and Berkshire folded the company into its other shoe firms. Buffett had been on a run of successful deals and failed to be vigilant. Even the world’s best err. A chess game between two grand masters is a remarkable thing, a master class in grace, accuracy and timing. Grand masters employ elaborate techniques, of course, and above all they orchestrate their pieces to cover vulnerabilities and force errors from the opponent. Just as it is in chess, so it is in finance. The crucial idea is that professionals in any game rarely make unforced errors – their fate is usually sealed by errors that the situation forces upon them. In contrast, the outcome in contests of novices is determined by their own, avoidable mistakes. Novices shouldn’t focus on winning points – they should focus on not losing points. But even professionals are guilty of unforced errors sometimes. Consider Stanley Druckenmiller. After a successful career running his own investment fund, Duquesne Capital Management, Druckenmiller was appointed lead portfolio manager for George Soros’ Quantum Fund in 1988. Druckenmiller thrived there: in his first four years, annual growth never dipped below 24 percent, mostly due to his strong knowledge of the world economy and foreign currencies. However, in 1999, Druckenmiller ventured outside his zone of expertise and committed a string of unforced errors. Tech stock was beginning its meteoric rise that year. Druckenmiller, however, believed that they were overvalued. He was so sure of this that he bet $200 million of Quantum’s capital on a price decline – except this didn’t happen. Instead, these expensive stocks kept getting pricier, and soon the Quantum was down 18 percent for the year. Druckenmiller, deciding he was out of touch with the market, hired two young, tech-savvy employees and went back to his forte – foreign currencies. But he couldn’t stay away from tech stocks for long. After Druckenmiller made a major investment in the euro only to see it decline in value, he watched with envy as his new employees were still raking in cash from tech stocks. Not wanting to be upstaged, he invested $600 million in the networking company VeriSign. But the tech bubble was about to burst, and Druckenmiller would be left with a half-billion-dollar sized hole in his pocket. By May 2002, VeriSign was worth just 1.5 percent of its peak value. From neglecting his areas of expertise to allowing himself to succumb to the fear of missing out, Druckenmiller illustrated the danger of unforced errors and why we should focus on stamping them out rather than casting around for our big wins. Have you ever looked at the price history of Amazon stock? If so, you’ve probably kicked yourself for not realizing this sleeping giant would change the world. After all, an initial investment of $1,000 early on would have netted you $387,000 today! But such thinking is harmful and masks the superhuman nerve that would’ve been required to hold onto your Amazon stock. It was slashed in half on three separate occasions.  And this doesn’t just happen to the financial layperson: short-term losses test the resolve of seasoned investors too, including people like Charlie Munger. Munger is best known as Warren Buffett’s long-time partner and the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. He has a formidable intellect that thrives on inverting questions and reverse engineering problems. This intelligence, along with his razor-sharp wit, have made him famous for his playful aphorisms, or “Mungerisms.” For example, “All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there.” But Munger’s genius didn’t save him from some financial nosedives. In 1974, he threw diversification to the wind and invested 61 percent of his fund into Blue Chip Stamps – a company producing loyalty tokens redeemable for consumer goods. But soon there was an economic downturn, and firms producing non-essential goods were devastated. Such a concentrated position was completely unadvisable, and this stake in Blue Chip was almost fatal: an investment of $1,000 in Charlie Munger’s company in January 1973 would have been worth just $467 in January 1975. Many investors were questioning his judgement, scrambling to cut their losses with him. But Charlie Munger wasn’t beaten yet, and neither was Blue Chip Stamps. Munger’s investment company posted gains of 73.2 percent by December 1975, and Blue Chip later purchased several companies which would become some of Berkshire’s prize assets: See’s Candies, Wesco Financial and the Buffalo Evening News. So, after a disastrous period in the mid-1970s, Munger bounced back stronger than ever. Ever since, he’s been a guiding light in one of the most successful investment companies of all time. Charlie Munger’s Blue Chip investment shows how crucial it is to exercise patience and composure when investing long-term. It’s common for portfolios to take massive hits due to external factors like the wider economy, and you must be able to insulate yourself from temporary large losses. Remember: the time not to sell your investments is in a panic after a drop in value. The key message in these blinks: Investing is a dangerous game – even for the most talented players. But by studying the greats and their greatest blunders, we can benefit from their mistakes without the million-dollar price tags. If you’re an amateur, you should focus on avoiding unforced errors rather than shooting for big wins, and if you do win, stifling overconfidence is crucial. Above all, don’t become attached to your assets: emotions like fear, anger, envy and greed are your portfolio’s worst nightmare.  Actionable advice: Exercise due diligence and don’t over-trade. If you’re new to the world of stocks and shares, you should know that making too many trades is one of the most common errors. Like a true venture capitalist, you should exhaustively research every company you plan to invest in and don’t be afraid to walk away. Warren Buffett once suggested that investors should act like they are only permitted to make 20 trades in their entire career. This way, you exercise extreme caution and keep yourself focused on high-quality trades. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

After the events of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, one would hope that governments would crack down on the excesses at the heart of global finance. Sadly, that simply has not been the case, and the injustice of this state of affairs is perfectly personified by Steve Cohen, a Wall Street investor who made billions of dollars by attaining a “black edge” over fellow investors. Cohen procured illegal, or “black,” insider information about companies’ performances in order to gain an advantage over fellow investors. To the outside world, he was miraculously lucky, always betting on the right companies at the right time. In reality, as the investigative journalist Sheelah Kolhatkar discovered, he was almost certainly utilizing an unfair advantage to surpass his rivals. In these blinks, you’ll learn how the hedge fund Cohen founded systematically used illegal insider information to manipulate stock prices; how a drug to help Alzheimer's patients made Cohen $273 million; and why, after multiple criminal proceedings, Cohen has managed to remain a free man. In 2008, in the midst of the worldwide financial crisis, US federal agents were in the process of taking down Raj Rajaratnam, a Wall Street titan, when they discovered something fascinating. Rajaratnam was illegally using inside information from companies; he traded on this information and profited from it massively. The agents were intrigued at how one name kept cropping up during interviews with Wall Street insiders: Steve Cohen. Was there an even larger case waiting to be uncovered? Rajaratnam, it turned out, was small fry – the investigation was only just getting started. So who is Steve Cohen? Let’s start from the beginning. Steve Cohen was born in 1956 and grew up in a middle-class family on Long Island, New York. From a young age, he was fascinated with finance. As a student at the famous Wharton School at the University of Philadelphia, he read the Wall Street Journal every morning and followed the stock market. He was talented too: he played poker with his fellow students and made a lot of money doing so. In 1978, fresh out of Wharton as a 21-year-old, he landed a job at Gruntal & Co., a New York brokerage firm. Even then, his skills shone through: in one afternoon, he made $4,000, a huge figure in 1978. Cohen was successful, making $5 million to $10 million a year. But it didn’t take long for the first signs of wrongdoing to appear as he faced charges of insider trading. In 1985, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, looked into Cohen’s transactions. Cohen had received inside information through a friend about an imminent takeover of electronics company RCA by General Electric. Cohen invested heavily in RCA shares and made $20 million in profits when the takeover was announced. Even though the criminal case was later dropped, it strongly indicated Cohen had a somewhat unorthodox approach to trading. Within 14 years, Cohen moved from being a lowly junior trader to a revered Wall Street personality. It would only be a matter of time before he wished to break free of Gruntal and venture out on his own. So it was that in 1992, Cohen founded his own investment firm, SAC Capital Advisors, using his own initials for the company name. It was a hedge fund that profited by investing money gathered from different individuals and institutions. Cohen began with $23 million and nine employees, and met with astronomical success. In just three years, SAC had quadrupled in size to $100 million. After that, SAC doubled each year, surpassing $1 billion in assets by 1999. Cohen’s pockets were overflowing. But just how did he manage to make so much so quickly? Cohen bet on short-term movements in stock prices. Each day, he gathered information about the market, bought large numbers of shares and then sold them when their price rose. But it eventually became more complicated than that. In fact, SAC systematically attempted to receive and trade on inside information. By the late 90s, SAC was finding it more difficult to profit from short-term trading, and Cohen sensed that things needed to be turned up a notch. Until that point, his traders were unaware of the industries or companies whose shares they were trading. In response, Cohen started to hire traders with a “fundamental edge,” that is, traders with deep knowledge, expertise or personal connections in a particular industry. SAC wanted people who knew and would reveal valuable intelligence – in other words, inside information. For instance, if a potential hire lived in the same neighborhood as an industry executive, this was a bonus. Such “coincidences” would be opportunities for making personal connections. Every possible connection was mined in a bid to build up profits. By the mid-2000s, Cohen was one of the richest men in the world. He had a personal fortune of nearly $10 billion. He allowed himself a few luxuries with this cash, and often splurged on expensive artwork. But something seemed off. SAC’s huge profits seemed just too good to be true, and there simply had to be something shady going on. It was no surprise to anyone, then, when, in 2006, SAC Capital was accused of manipulating stock prices. The first to point fingers were Biovail, a Canadian drug manufacturer, and Fairfax, a Canadian insurance company. They accused SAC of spreading false and negative reports about their performance and business practices, which in turn caused their stock prices to drop. Traders at SAC were able to make huge profits when they bet against these companies’ success. For instance, Fairfax employees claimed to have received nighttime calls from anonymous voices that whispered that Fairfax was fraudulent. Additionally, anonymous websites appeared making comparisons between Fairfax and Enron, a firm which had itself collapsed after massive fraud revelations. The accusations were all unfounded, but they were still noticed by the regulatory authorities, the SEC and the FBI. Simultaneously, at SAC, the shady culture that purposefully sought inside information continued. SAC’s approach was to bet on short-term stock-price movements, especially of the type that occur after specific events, such as companies' profit announcements. SAC managers pushed their traders to talk to their contacts and leverage them to get relevant information before any official announcements. A favored way to get valuable information was using so-called expert networks, such as Gerson Lehrman Group. These networks are designed to connect investors with company executives. Technically, in these paid-for “consultations,” the executives can't share inside information. However, they did drop valuable hints, and the information flowed back to SAC traders. Needless to say, they put this knowledge to good use. Almost 5 million people have Alzheimer’s disease in the United States alone. The disease causes severe memory loss and, unfortunately, no effective treatment has been discovered. A breakthrough in this regard could potentially result in millions of dollars in profits, so any development is sure to attract Wall Street’s attention. When two pharmaceutical companies, Elan and Wyeth, tried to develop Alzheimer's medication in the 2000s, Mathew Martoma, an SAC trader, naturally wanted to learn more. The new drug was to be called Bapineuzumab, or Bapi for short. Martoma set about building strong relations with Dr. Sidney “Sid” Gilman, who was involved in bapi's development as chair of Elan's safety monitoring committee. He had also signed a confidentiality agreement related to all aspects of bapi’s development. Nonetheless, Martoma was very persuasive. The two spent hours on the phone and before long, Martoma had pushed Gilman into discussing the confidential bapi trials. It was this information, which Gilman eventually provided to Martoma, that SAC used to great effect. Thanks to the calls, Martoma was initially very confident that bapi would be successful. Therefore, Cohen and Martoma gathered more than $700 million in Elan and Wyeth stocks. The final bapi test results were due to be released on July 28, 2008, at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease in Chicago. Gilman was to be keynote speaker and one of a tiny circle of people who knew the highly confidential results in advance. Well, theoretically at least. He had also shown them to Martoma. Martoma realized that bapi was a dud as far as investment was concerned – it was suitable only for a small number of patients. Therefore, on July 20, Martoma called Cohen and they agreed to quietly disburden themselves of stock. They even started shorting stocks, meaning that they sold stocks before the prices dropped and then repurchased the stocks at a lower price. In doing so, they held onto the stocks but also took home the difference between their initial selling price and subsequent, lower purchase price. By the time the bapi results were officially released, Elan and Wyeth share prices had plummeted, making Martoma and Cohen a cool $276 million in the process. SAC’s business model was heavily and clearly based on insider trading. Even so, in the late 2000s, insider trading was common practice at Wall Street hedge funds. Unlike closely monitored big banks, the relatively new hedge funds operated below the radar of the regulators and could get away with murder. But that was soon to change. In 2009, the FBI began to investigate SAC’s obscure business practices in secret. In particular, the FBI were searching for suspicious trades – and their key target was Cohen himself. But their strategy was to approach implicated junior SAC analysts, then push them to provide evidence against their managers. The idea was that they would gradually gather evidence about higher-ranking traders until they finally got to Cohen himself. They soon found Jonathan Hollander, a former junior analyst at SAC and just what the FBI were after. He had traded stock in Albertsons, a supermarket chain, and a friend of his had leaked information to him about an impending takeover. Hollander was the FBI’s first link, and they hoped for a clear path to Cohen from there. But they found that Cohen had created a security mechanism to protect himself. He asked his analysts to rate potential trades on a scale from zero to ten, thereby ensuring that he wasn’t himself trading directly with inside information. At about the same time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started to investigate, too. They were looking into SAC’s spectacular success when trading the Elan and Wyeth stocks just prior to the announcement of the results of the bapi trials. It was suspicious to say the least. At that critical moment, on November 19, 2010, the Wall Street Journal published an article detailing the FBI’s and SEC’s investigations. The traders had been forewarned and became very alarmed, and quickly set about destroying their hard drives. The investigation's cover had been blown. Once the Wall Street Journal had revealed what the FBI and SEC were up to, the authorities had no choice but to move quickly. Otherwise, they ran the risk of Wall Street traders destroying all evidence of insider trading before they could get to it. Just a few months later, in May 2011, US authorities had their first breakthrough, and placed Mathew Martoma and Dr. Sidney Gilman on their suspect list. The SEC had identified Gilman as the putative bapi trial results leaker months earlier, but they remained unsure who his contact at SAC was. As a result, the SEC subpoenaed Gilman’s phone records, and eventually identified a mysterious phone number. It was Martoma's, one of the portfolio managers at SAC. The investigators also discovered that Martoma had contacted Cohen shortly before SAC sold off its Elan and Wyeth shares. On top of all that, Martoma was already on the FBI’s database as being “known to the Bureau.” They were closing in. Things unraveled quickly when they started digging on Martoma. For starters, Mathew Martoma wasn’t his real name – it was Ajai Thomas. They also found that, as Thomas, he'd had to leave Harvard Law School rather suddenly. In his second year of classes, Martoma had struggled to cope with course work. In an effort to get a coveted legal clerkship, he’d actually forged the grades on his transcript. It was after this that he’d changed his name. Not long after the FBI breakthrough, their agents confronted the pair at their respective homes, detailing their suspicions of insider trading. But Cohen remained the FBI's ultimate target, and they needed the pair to cooperate – they needed their help in getting the real dirt on Cohen. When, in 2011, FBI agents pulled up in front of Mathew Martoma’s house, they had strong suspicions but no actual evidence of insider trading. In those circumstances, all they could do was ask questions and chip away at his resolve. However, a year later, that had changed. This time, when the agents arrived for the second time, they weren't there to shoot the breeze. They arrested him on the spot. However, the FBI’s initial interrogation of Dr. Sidney Gilman and Mathew Martoma didn’t proceed so well. When asked about scientific details of the bapi trials, Gilman could recall every detail. But when it came to questions about his relationship to Martoma, he stonewalled investigators and said he couldn’t recall any details. Meanwhile, Martoma pled the Fifth Amendment so as not to incriminate himself; after all, he was facing a prison sentence of up to ten years. To investigators, Martoma’s move seemed odd, as he could easily have reduced his potential sentence if he implicated Cohen – but he didn’t. Possible factors could have been that Cohen was covering Martoma’s legal costs, or that Martoma feared retribution if he crossed Cohen. In August 2012, Gilman finally agreed to cooperate fully. He admitted that he had given Martoma inside information about the bapi test results. With that confession, the FBI had enough evidence to arrest Martoma. But they still couldn’t press charges on Cohen and SAC. Cohen, though, was aware of the danger. And so, in the spring of 2013, SAC agreed to fork out a record fine of over $600 million to settle the cases of insider trading. After all, from Cohen’s perspective, it made sense to settle before the situation worsened. And there was still the risk that Martoma would testify against him. All the legal issues would simply dissolve, he thought, if he wrote a check. But it wasn’t over yet. The SEC was still keen to charge Cohen himself. Finally, there was another development in the case. The SEC got their hands on an email that potentially connected Cohen to another case of insider trading at SAC. In the summer of 2008, Mike Steinberg, an SAC trader, received inside information about the computer company Dell’s disappointing business figures, which weren’t yet public. Steinberg used the information to bet that Dell’s stock price would drop, and when it did, he netted a cool $1.4 million. It was an email that Steinberg had sent to Cohen about this information that the SEC now had in its possession. Therefore, to settle this additional case, SAC agreed to pay a record fine of $1.2 billion in July 2013. The SEC’s ultimate aim was to use this information to convict Cohen of insider trading. After all, he had received Steinberg’s email and sold Dell stocks immediately afterward. However, Cohen’s lawyers were canny. They argued Cohen only read about ten percent of his 1,000 or so daily emails, and so had probably never seen the incriminating note. Because it wasn’t clear that he had acted on the email from Steinberg, convicting Cohen was difficult; it simply couldn’t be proven. At this point, since the SEC didn’t want their whole case to come crashing down, they dropped this line of inquiry. This main case was settled with SAC for another $1.2 billion. Soon after, in the fall of 2014, Mathew Martoma was sentenced to nine years in prison. He was repeatedly given the opportunity to cooperate and testify against Cohen since, in doing so, he could have reduced his sentence significantly. But he revealed nothing, and we still don't know why. Cohen, however, was himself never convicted. To rub salt into the wound, he has since made more money than ever before. In April 2014, he rebranded the tarnished SAC Capital Advisors brand as Point72 Asset Management and simply kept going. Despite their continuing investigations, US authorities have drawn a blank. Cohen walked away a very rich man indeed. In fact, in 2014, Cohen earned $2.5 billion. The key message in this book: Steve Cohen was, and remains, a gifted investor. But his investment firm, SAC Capital Advisors, was built on a business model that involved illegal insider trading. Some of Cohen’s traders were convicted of insider trading after years of investigation – but Cohen himself was never found guilty of any criminal charges. He continues to make billions of dollars and remains active in the financial sector.   Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Williams","summary":"These days, everyone from finance gurus to conceptual artists is talking about blockchain. Initially devised as a platform for Bitcoin, blockchain went unnoticed for years until technologists realized that its potential far exceeds the realm of cryptocurrencies. Now, the hype around this new technology has amounted to some philosophers calling it the next enlightenment. But what exactly is blockchain? Simply put, blockchain is a digital ledger software that is unhackable and unchangeable. Its distributed technology offers an unprecedented amount of transparency and accountability that poses a threat to traditional intermediary authorities such as banks, businesses, and even governments. If that sounds confusing, don’t worry. In this these blinks, you’ll learn how the technology works, how it’s being applied to business, finance, climate change, and the arts, and what it could mean for the future of society. In these blinks, you’ll learn why blockchains become more secure as more people join them; how blockchain could lead to a fleet of autonomous self-driving cars; and why blockchain is giving people hope for a brighter future. If you look up the definition of blockchain, you’ll learn that it’s a digital ledger, or book in which accounts or monetary transactions are recorded. If that sounds boring, look at it this way: ledgers are the foundations of civilization. Without them, we wouldn’t have been able to build cities or efficient markets. They are the means by which we do everything from keeping track of our finances and demonstrating ownership of a house to verifying our status as citizens. For hundreds of years, the world economy has been based on a ledger system called double-entry bookkeeping. These ledgers have two columns for information: debit and credit. As long as the credit and the debit for a transaction match in both the buyer’s and the seller’s books, that transaction is error-free. In order to establish trust in the system and ensure that a transaction is true and accurate, double-entry accounting requires middlemen. Brokers, bankers or other intermediaries get a fee to certify the legitimacy of transactions. However, history has shown us that this system isn’t always reliable. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, it was revealed that many large corporations, like Enron and Lehman Brothers, had effectively been keeping extra sets of books, which they used to conceal the true nature of their financial operations. For years, these companies were able to manipulate the system to launder vast amounts of money. Ever since the dawn of the Internet, many have hoped that it would bring an end to these kinds of transgressions. But until now, the Internet’s susceptibility to hackers has posed security issues when it comes to large financial transactions. However, the blockchain might change all that. The blockchain was originally created as a platform for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. By tracking every purchase or sale, the blockchain ensures that a digital coin can never be spent twice. Transactions are all online for everyone to see; all you need to join is an Internet connection. In addition to credit and debit, the blockchain has a third column in its digital ledger: verification. This  eliminates the need for intermediaries. Instead, trust is built into the very system. Blockchain technology is already being developed in ways which might revolutionize everything from the way that artists can certify the provenance on their work to the way we value currencies such as the U.S. dollar. It could even eliminate the possibility of tampering or lost ballots when it comes to voting. But how can be sure that this technology is so trustworthy? That’s because unlike other ledgers, the blockchain is unhackable and unalterable. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how it actually works. Picture yourself gazing up into the sky on a clear night. Beams of light link each star to the next, forming a celestial network. That’s what a blockchain looks like: a network of phones, computers and other devices, forming a supercomputer that runs the blockchain. The blockchain system is secured through the construction of linked blocks that represent information. Say you want to record the number of rubber trees in the Amazon rainforest. The data would be entered into a digital collection called a “block.” After a block reaches its capacity it’s ready to be added to the chain of linked blocks, or the “blockchain.” However, before it can be added, the new block must be approved by every node – meaning every device linked to the chain – in a process known as the protocol. That's why blockchain is called a distributed technology: everyone on the chain has equal decision-making power. There are various protocol methods, but the most common one is called “proof of work.” With proof of work, every new block comes with a complex mathematical problem, which must be solved before the block can be added to the chain. This is done by special nodes called miners that compete to solve the problem in order to win Bitcoins. Thanks to proof of work, adding blocks to the chain requires substantial computational resources, which helps prevent malicious actors from manipulating the blockchain. Part of solving the problem generates a cryptographic hash, or a code made up of a long string of numbers and letters. In addition to its own hash, each block contains a timestamp as well as the hash from the previous block, aligning it with the rest of the blockchain. You might be wondering why it’s possible to mine Bitcoins, but not to hack into the blockchain and change a block’s information – to say that someone else’s Bitcoin actually belongs to you, for instance. That’s because changing a single block’s information would render the entire chain’s hashes out of sync and automatically signal a break-in. Not only would hackers have to change the hashes for every block in the chain, but they would also have to do this for every single node, since the blockchain is copied onto every node’s device. The computing power required to achieve such a task increases exponentially with every node added to the chain. In other words, the more nodes there are on a chain, the stronger the chain becomes. Unless you’re a computer programmer, you’ll probably never come across a blockchain code. What you will see and interact with is what blockchain enables - namely, distributed applications, or “dapps.” The potential for these dapps is endless. One example is smart contracts. A smart contract is essentially an automated contract on a blockchain with terms agreed upon by both parties. Once the terms of the contract are carried out, an algorithm delivers the payment in cryptocurrency and documents the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts thus automate bureaucracy, eliminating the need for centralized authorities to verify the transaction. Many dapps already use smart contracts. On Ethereum, a public blockchain that supports smart contracts and uses a cryptocurrency called Ether, you can find dapps that use smart contracts to do things like record the origin of a work of art or time-stamp an idea you have for a film, creating an official document of your intellectual property. Other possibilities for smart contracts require only that we use our imagination. Currently, Uber uses a centralized app to connect drivers with customers and ensure payment. A blockchain dapp equivalent could use smart contracts to enable taxis to connect to customers directly, and bypass any centralized intermediary. Let’s take that one step further. Say that at some point in the near future you buy a self-driving car. Smart contracts could allow you to set the car up to run itself as a taxi 24/7.   If the car is low on gas, for instance, a smart contract between you and the car would be activated, and the car would drive itself to get its tank filled. Similarly, if the car has a flat tire, another smart contract would kick in and the car would drive itself to get the tire fixed. Eventually, your car will have earned enough money to purchase another self-driving car. The second car may then earn enough money to purchase another car all by itself. This process would continue until there was an entire fleet of autonomous taxis functioning without owners. Such a business model is called a DAO, or distributed autonomous organization. We can’t be sure right now whether such a model could be successfully realized. But the mere idea of it goes to show how blockchain offers radical potential. The hype around blockchain might sound familiar to anyone who remembers the utopian ideas surrounding the Internet in the 1990s. Although the Internet did make people more connected, it failed to bring about the egalitarian society that many had hoped for, as corporations like Facebook were quick to monopolize the network for their own growth. However, with blockchain, things may be different. That’s because distributed systems intrinsically shift accessibility and power to the masses. Think of investing. For most of history, it has been exclusive to the elite. Banking fees, credit histories, and limited access have undermined the ability of the lower classes to participate in this lucrative activity. But anyone can join a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meaning anyone can invest with them. Some even envision that cryptocurrencies will overtake the central banking system. That’s something that many people have dismissed, but since the US dollar no longer stands for a tangible asset such as gold, cryptocurrencies are really no less valid than dollars, or in fact any other currency. As more people start valuing cryptocurrencies, the vision of a future free of big banks might not be such a stretch after all. For the time being, the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and the Rockefeller Foundation are all already developing ways for blockchain technology to empower disadvantaged farmers, disenfranchised voters, and underprivileged people without banking access. Blockchain technology itself, of course, has no moral agenda. But the distributed system that it represents encourages a rethinking of hierarchies, creating a more equitable version of capitalism. In the same way that smart contracts could eliminate the need for Uber, blockchain dapps have the potential to enable other kinds of trading, like that around rented accommodation. Instead of paying fees to Airbnb as a central arbitrator, as the owner of a property you could set up a smart contract with a renter that would run the venture for you. Depending on your agreement, if guests overstayed their visit, the smart contract would either lock them out of the house or automatically charge them for a longer stay. This peer-to-peer system would mean a true sharing economy. In one episode of TV series Portlandia, the protagonists Peter and Nance interrogate their waiter about the life of the chicken they are considering ordering. Asking questions such as whether the chicken had any friends, the show pokes fun at the rising demand for transparency about where our products are coming from. In the future, you might be able to check your turkey’s journey from farm to table on your phone. Cargill, the company that owns the brand The Honeysuckle White, has already tested a blockchain dapp that lets people track exactly where their turkeys on Thanksgiving came from. This is not the only way in which blockchain is paving a way for a future of unprecedented transparency. Fura, Everledger and DeBeers are three companies devising blockchains to avert blood-diamond trafficking. With the technology, once the certification for a conflict-free diamond is entered onto the blockchain, it follows that diamond all the way up the supply chain, as its location is updated at each step. Not only would this mean that buyers could recognise and refuse blood diamonds at the point of purchase, it would also enable diamond miners to track where their stones end up, and even give them a chance to communicate with people at the top of the supply chain. In that system, the diamond miner would be just as important as the buyer at the top of the supply chain, and would have a real voice to influence how the system is run. At the same time as making transparency possible, blockchains also enable unparalleled privacy. Intimate is a dapp that enables pornography vendors and sex workers to offer their services using cryptocurrency and anonymous addresses. The dapp enables users to keep their identities private while making their reputation recognizable across the platform, making conditions for all participants safer. Up until this point, we’ve been discussing public blockchains. But some blockchains are private, invitation-only platforms. This kind of maximum privacy is essential for businesses, such as health care operators, that deal with confidential information, but it’s also being embraced by businesses in general. Computer behemoth IBM has already engaged private blockchains for major business operations using the Hyperledger Fabric framework, and other corporations are sure to follow. Still, the fact that corporations might opt out of transparency won’t affect blockchain’s utopian promise; the public chains will remain under the control of the public. As we’ve seen, blockchain has the potential to affect issues ranging from farming to investment opportunities. But here’s the catch: as of yet, blockchain networks require an extortionate amount of energy. This is especially true for the Bitcoin proof-of-work protocol. When Bitcoin was first released, you could mine coins from your desktop computer. Today, there is so much competition on the Bitcoin blockchain that it requires an assembly of computers drawing large amounts of energy. The business is so lucrative that professional bitcoin mining farms have been set up around the world. All this means that on some days the bitcoin network requires as much energy as the entire country of Denmark. That being said, for most blockchain applications, proof of work isn’t the most efficient way of authenticating new blocks for the blockchain. One example is the Ethereum blockchain. It has been experimenting with a “proof of stake” protocol, which does without mining entirely. Rather, nodes called validators place a stake or bet that they will be given the next block to validate. If they do catch the next block, they gain a financial reward. The hope is that such alternatives will reduce blockchain energy consumption levels as well as make transactions faster. Looking at the problem from another angle, there are many ways in which blockchain technology could become a tool in the quest for climate change solutions. One environmental application for blockchain is in the carbon-trading market. By turning carbon emissions into a tradable good, carbon-trading markets provide a financial incentive to offset air pollution. Beijing-based Energy Blockchain Lab, working with IBM, has already used the open-source Hyperledger blockchain to develop a new, more efficient platform for carbon asset trading in China. Another green use of blockchains could be the use of a reliable and transparent ledger to track greenhouse gas emissions. This would be essential to monitoring the progress made by nations pledged to the carbon reduction targets of the 2016 Paris Agreement. Blockchain could also be used to track endangered species, make the ultimate destination of donated funds more transparent, and certify land ownership to counter deforestation. The possibilities are endless. It’s up to us to embrace this new technology and continue to think of creative ways in which blockchain could make the world a better place. The key message in these blinks: Blockchain is so much more than Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Computer scientists are pushing this unhackable, distributed digital ledger technology to do everything from revolutionizing business to tackling climate change. While the actual uses of the technology will depend on the groups and individuals who use it, it intrinsically encourages an unprecedented degree of transparency, as well as challenging the inequalities inherent in traditional hierarchical systems.

A great job is waiting for everyone, including you – it’s the job you were born to do. You have all the right skills for it and it brings together your greatest interests. All you need to do is to find this job, but outdated career advice may be holding you back from doing so. That’s where these blinks come in. They’ll help you update your career roadmap and will tell you where to start searching.   In these blinks, you’ll also learn how to build a small business alongside your main job in just a few weeks; why you don’t need to settle for one of the jobs that are already out there; and what a 100 People Project is and how it can help your career. Some people have their entire life mapped out by the time they enter kindergarten. But for most of us, finding our life’s work takes a bit more effort, especially since career paths aren’t always straightforward and predictable. So, if you don’t know what you want to do with your life, don’t sweat it – just start experimenting. This is a good strategy because careers develop in unforeseeable ways and every job or project that grabs your attention could be a step toward your true calling. Say you follow your dream and join the circus. After a few months, you start to realize that you’re not so into cleaning up after elephants. So you transfer to the box office to sell tickets, but this new job, a bit too pleasant and a bit too clean, quickly gets boring. Done with the box office, you decide to get an office job outside the circus. Your new job is just starting to get on your nerves when you meet a client who owns a clothing line. Suddenly you realize that you were born to design circus-themed T-shirts! The point is, you don’t need to subscribe to a seemingly established career path. While some people are staunch believers in the notion that careers do follow strict scripts, these assumptions are invariably based on other people’s experiences. For instance, a common rule is that if a career opportunity comes your way, you should seize the chance because it might be your only one. In reality, abiding by such strict rules will undermine your creativity and obscure the path to your dream job. After all, just because something worked for someone else’s career doesn’t mean it will for yours. That’s why it’s important to flip the script, that is, to rewrite traditional career advice to match your needs. You might ditch the rule about jumping at your first career opportunity and write a new one that says, “If you don’t feel good about a job, pass it up.” There will always be other options. Imagine you had the chance to make one wish and you chose to win the job lottery, but it’s still up to you to specify exactly what you want. What does your ideal job entail? For starters, it should have the right mix of joy, money and flow. After all, the ideal job is one that pays you for doing work you love. If working with children is your greatest joy, second only to explaining things, then being a school teacher is perfect for you. But, of course, enjoying your work isn’t the only important factor; there’s also the issue of money. Even if you don’t want to be rich, it’s hard to enjoy your life if you’re constantly stressed about making ends meet. And finally, your ideal job should let you experience flow, a mental state in which you’re completely immersed in an activity, forget about time and do your absolute best work. All three of these ingredients are important for everyone, but the difference lies in how much of a priority each one is to any individual. So, joy, money and flow are central to determining your ideal career, but your working conditions are too. You might love the content of your work, but if your day-to-day conditions are poor you’ll just wind up stressed out and unhappy. To prevent this from happening, it’s important to determine the conditions that are right for you. For example, how important is it for you to set your own schedule? Could you be happy working a 9-to-5 job? Then consider what type of social environment suits your needs – do you want to work solo or on a team? Do you prefer working in a shared office or at home? Lastly, there’s reporting and accountability. In other words, do you prefer working autonomously or are you fine with being managed? How do you feel about your actions being monitored? Once you’ve answered all these questions, you’ll have a stronger sense of what kind of job is right for you. Now it’s just a matter of implementing a strategy that helps you attain it! Could fear be holding you back from following your dreams? If it is, you’ll benefit from boosting your confidence and taking more risks. To do so, start by listing everything that could go wrong and estimating how likely any given outcome is. You might find that many of your fears are either harmless or so improbable that there’s nothing to worry about, so you don’t have to be afraid to make your move! Next, make sure that a fear of missing out isn’t guiding your career decisions. After all, it’s a terrible basis for making decisions and will actually distract you from what matters. Say you have an interview at a company’s headquarters. Upon arriving, everyone looks tense and unhappy – but the interview goes great and they end up offering you a position. If you were desperate, you might feel compelled to accept, scared that it would be your only chance, even though the workplace environment looked downright scary. If you let your fear of missing out on this one opportunity guide your decision, it might end up making you miserable. And finally, prepare yourself for risks, make backup plans and build a safety net. How? Whenever you make a decision, consider the possible outcomes and determine what you’ll do if they come true. For example, say you want to send some bold advertising e-mails promoting your business. You can make an if-then sketch, which would go like this: If the first recipients take the bait, go out and celebrate! But if they don’t, then send a tame mailer with a printable coupon to the next prospects. Just make sure these backup plans are very specific to help you put them into place. Additionally, three general measures that make up your career insurance policy will help you control any damage if things go wrong – say, if you lose your job. First, maintain a network of supporters, that is, people who can help you build a career, find customers or get back on your feet. Second, secure an additional source of income to ensure that losing one won’t be the end of the world. And finally, always spend less than you earn to maintain a financial buffer. When hypothesizing about suitable careers, people tend to overfocus on things they’ve studied. For instance, a data scientist might only think of jobs that involve doing statistical computations. To widen your scope, make an inventory of all your skills and weaknesses. To do so, simply make two lists. One list should detail the things you do well – and that means everything, not just the skills related to your education. The second list should include everything you hate or struggle to do. This is crucial because your greatest weaknesses are unlikely to become your strongest skills. After completing these lists, you’ll get a first glimpse of the type of work you were made to do. The next step is to determine how you can make money by employing these skills to meet a demand and connect with prospective clients. And this might be simpler than you think. If the people you talk to every day are already telling you what area they need you to apply your abilities, you’re already on the right track. For example, you might find that coworkers always turn to you with relationship trouble or laptop malfunctions, which could point to an area where you can provide something that people are willing to pay for. Then, once you’ve identified this area, you’re ready to begin your 100 People Project, which works like this: Say you discover you’re great at giving weight loss advice. Your next move is to choose 100 people from your contacts list and social media, get in touch with them and offer them free 15-minute consultations. This will improve your skills while connecting you with potential clients for your future business. But remember, no matter what other talents you have, it’s essential to keep up your writing and speaking skills. After all, you’ll always need them to persuade others of yourself, your ideas and your products. Starting a new business is exciting, especially if it’s one that’s closely linked to your skills and passions. And the best part is, you can launch your dream business without quitting your day job. It’s possible to build a small business in your free time, as long as you do so systematically. In fact, loads of people who now earn their living from their passion initially built their business in their spare time as a side hustle. And just a single hour a day spent planning over the course of a few weeks is enough to launch a small business. But, naturally, you need to be careful not to waste your time. So don’t search out that one big business idea; it’s elusive and you don’t need it. Instead, answer specific questions: What kind of product or service are you going to provide? Who are your customers going to be? Which of their problems are you going to solve? What will your budget look like? How can you market your business? These questions are perfect because you can answer them in detail in your daily hour devoted to your new business. Then, once you’re done planning, you can start spending your daily hour executing your plans, one step at a time – for instance, by advertising your service on a social network. You’ll always be on the safe side if you follow this strategy. You’ll be able to rely on the income from your day job and won’t have to depend on your new business to succeed. As a result, you can experiment with your idea, learning a lot in the process while still paying your bills. And if your business does work out, it will give you a second source of income that will make you even more financially stable. That said, if you really want to quit your 9-to-5 and work on your business full time, you should do it – but only if your business is generating enough money to keep you afloat. Plenty of job-finding strategies seem like a good idea initially, but prove to be a colossal waste of time. And, truthfully, most of them are. So, if the well-worn paths don’t lead you to career success, just create your own job. After all, consider all the hours and energy you can invest in updating your LinkedIn profile or attending job fairs, only to come up empty-handed. These strategies simply aren’t very effective because thousands of smart, qualified applicants are also using the very same ones. This means lots of competitors, some of whom might be a better fit for any given position. So, a better idea is to invent the position that fits your skills perfectly and find a company that’s willing to create it. Some people even create their own titles. For instance, Tony Bacigalupo nominated himself to be the Mayor of New Work Cities, his coworking space. Just remember, this strategy is best used to search for a job within a company. But maybe you want to make a living from your creative practice. If so, just become your own manager and promoter. If you hide in your basement and paint all day, people won’t know who you are, regardless of how amazing your work is. That’s not to say you shouldn’t harness your inspiration to build a compelling body of work; but the art world has changed, and now you need to do much more than that. Writers, musicians and visual artists used to rely on a publisher, record label or patron to distribute their art, and would pay them a share for the service. But today, you can represent your own work. Start by reaching out to your fans and building an audience. Just do so through the best platform for socializing with people who appreciate your work; it might be through social media, by attending conferences or any other preferred method of putting yourself out there. And finally, it’s essential to figure out how to get paid. You might make money by selling paintings, through crowdfunding or even blog ads. Are you struggling with the question of what to do with your life? Well, if you are, it might be because you think you need to decide on a single, focused pursuit once and for all. In reality, you don’t need to pick a niche and stick with it for your whole life; instead, you can adapt your career to your changing needs and interests. After all, you never signed a contract saying you’ll do the same thing for the rest of your life. And that’s a good thing, because life is seasonal – your needs and interests will change as you do. If you’re raising a child, you might appreciate the regular schedule and steady income of a 9-to-5 job. But during other phases, you might prefer the nomadic lifestyle of a travel writer. A happy life is based on the ability to choose, but you also might want to focus on more than one skill over the course of your career. It’s not necessarily to the detriment of your career to pursue multiple interests. So how can you best transition between multiple jobs? One good way is to use workshifting, which is deliberately switching your complete attention back and forth between different projects. For instance, someone might focus on his landscaping business during the spring and summer while spending the winter months writing screenplays. Another person might work as a boxing trainer during the afternoons while offering relationship coaching in the evenings. And these combinations aren’t difficult to attain; these people have simply integrated change into their regular work schedule, allowing them to switch quickly and efficiently from one job to another. Just remember, there are lots of ways to live a fulfilling life, so find your passions and devote yourself to every one of them. The key message in this book: Finding the work you were made to do is never a straightforward journey. So, keep an open mind, use all the skills at your disposal and follow all your passions no matter where they might take you.  Actionable advice: Do something different.  The next time you make a New Year’s resolution, promise yourself that, at least once a year, you’ll break free from routine and do something different. It might be to take that yoga teacher training course you’ve always wanted to, or sell some special treat of yours at the park on a weekend. Regardless of whether it’s the beginning of a new business or not, chances are you’ll meet interesting new people, have new experiences and build your confidence – all while having lots of fun along the way.

With his low-key profile and homegrown style – he does his own taxes and wears slightly shabby suits – the “Sage of Omaha” is a beloved man, even among those who tend to have little sympathy for the super wealthy. So who is Warren Buffett? That’s what you’ll learn in these blinks. We follow Buffett from growing up in Omaha, through his early days in trading, to his years as the richest man in the world. And we get a glimpse of the unique investment sense he showed throughout his business life. In these blinks, you’ll find out that Buffett made his first stock trade as a child; what investment philosophy has influenced all of Buffett’s investments; and why Berkshire Hathaway is the company most associated with Buffett. Warren Edward Buffett was born to Howard and Leila Buffett on August 30, 1930, at a time when many families were facing an uncertain future. As a child of the Great Depression, young Warren learned the value of money. In 1932, when the Depression hit Warren’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, his father lost his job as a securities salesman for a local bank. But his dad was resourceful and soon began his own company, selling safe and reliable stocks and bonds. Earnings were meager. Indeed, they could afford so little food that Warren’s mother would often give her portion to Howard so that he would have a decent meal. These difficult times left a lasting impression on Warren Buffett, and fueled his desire for the kind of security and stability that money can buy. Even though his father’s business became successful when Warren was six, he never forgot those early Depression years. It wasn’t long before Warren’s interest in investment and entrepreneurship revealed itself. He always looked forward to visiting his father’s office, and, when Warren was ten, Howard took him on an exciting business trip to New York, where they visited the Stock Exchange. A year later, when he was eleven, Warren made his first profit by buying and selling stocks along with his sister, Doris. To afford these stocks, Warren had undertaken many entrepreneurial activities, such as roaming the local golf course to collect lost golf balls and then selling them back to the owner. At the age of 14, Warren was in charge of five separate paper routes, which had him getting up early every morning, delivering papers and collecting subscription fees. By saving every cent he made, Warren purchased 40 acres of land for $1,200. He wasn’t yet fifteen. Warren was no slouch at school, either. He graduated in the top three percent and enrolled at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, in Pennsylvania, where his love of money would only grow. With straight A’s as an undergrad, Buffett was surprised when his application for postgraduate studies was rejected by the Harvard Business School. But this rejection might have been for the best, since his professor at Columbia Business School (which accepted him) would have a massive impact on his life. That professor was economist Benjamin Graham, a pioneer in stock-market analysis with a unique approach to finding the right investments. The cornerstone of Graham’s philosophy was to avoid dealing with risky stocks altogether. He did this by determining a company’s intrinsic value and comparing it against the market value, which is the current price the stocks are being sold at. Finding a company’s intrinsic value requires diligent research. One has to add up all of its assets, including its revenue streams and future prospects. But it’s worth the work. When the intrinsic value is greater than the market value, you know you have a safe bet, and it’s only a matter of time before the price of that undervalued stock will rise to meet the market value. With this buying strategy, Graham became a legend for purchasing low-risk stocks and netting a high profit. Buffett loved Graham’s philosophy, which became the guiding force in his own practice. During and after Buffett’s time at Columbia, his relationship with Graham flourished. In Graham’s 22 years of teaching, he’d never had an A+ student. Buffett was his first. After earning his graduate degree, Buffett was eventually hired to work for Ben Graham’s Wall Street investment firm, Graham-Newman Corp. Some of his early proposals were turned down as they were considered too risky, but, in the end, Buffett became a star employee. One of his more memorable deals involved a chocolate company and realizing a way for everyone to benefit when the price of cocoa suddenly skyrocketed in 1954. A local New York chocolate maker was looking to Graham-Newman for help and Buffett saw that they could liquidate millions of pounds of cocoa and sell the beans to stockholders in their company. Based on the price of cocoa “futures,” this netted the company, and Buffett, a nice reward with every transaction. Buffet was never in love with the hustle and bustle of New York City. Furthermore, he was now a father, and he wanted to raise his kids in the peaceful environment of Omaha. Once he returned to his hometown, Buffett began forming his own investment partnership, Buffett Associates, Ltd. Within a year, he’d raised $500,000 from friends and family, all of which he put to work by flawlessly applying Graham’s theories and investing in undervalued companies that steadily paid off. In that first year, he was so successful that his initial $500,000 portfolio increased in value by 10 percent. By the end of the third year, that value had actually doubled! Remarkably, all the while, this youngster in Nebraska was outperforming the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. Finally, in 1961, Buffett took the next big step and purchased controlling interest in a company. It was the largest investment he’d made so far – a full million dollars of his partnership’s money, which he put into Dempster Mill Manufacturing, a struggling windmill company that most other investors wouldn’t go near. But Buffett knew it had solid intrinsic value, and his investment had made him chairman of the board for the company. He went to work sorting out their troubled finances. A year later, the company was on the path to profit, with $2 million worth of stock being traded at twice the price of what Buffett had initially paid. By 1963, that price was at three times its initial value and it was time for Buffett to move on, so he sold the company and earned his partners a $2.3 million profit. Incredibly, at just 35 years of age, Buffett’s 1965 portfolio had grown to be worth $22 million, and his own net worth was at nearly $4 million. In 1964, Buffett purchased controlling interest in Berkshire Hathaway, the company he is most closely associated with today. Berkshire Hathaway had started out as a textile manufacturer in 1839. But, in the early 1960s, American textile companies were losing a lot of business to the cheaper manufacturing markets in Asia and Latin America. So when Buffett began buying its stock in 1962, it was selling at only $7.60 per share. The company was in dire straits. However, when Buffett did his homework to add up its intrinsic value, he saw that the company should be trading at $16.50 per share. This made Berkshire Hathaway an amazing bargain that he couldn’t pass up, so he bought every stock he could get his hands on and, eventually, became the majority shareholder. Though it would always struggle as a textile company, it succeeded as a holding company for Buffett’s more successful companies – such as the insurance company National Indemnity Co., which he purchased in 1967 for $8.6 million. So even though textiles only earned Berkshire around $45,000 in profit per year, its holdings of National Indemnity stock earned it about $2.1 million. By 1969, Berkshire had become the main focus of his time and energy, and so he decided to dissolve the original Omaha partnership which, over the last 13 years, had increased exponentially in value – from half a million to $104 million. As chairman of the board at Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett continued to add new companies to its holding and, as a result, the price of Berkshire’s own shares went through the roof – increasing from $7.60 per share in 1962 to $95 per share in 1976! At this point Buffett was making quite a name for himself, and he was able to do something he always wanted to do – own a newspaper. In the 1970s, Berkshire became the largest outside shareholder of the Washington Post, the very newspaper Buffett had dropped on people’s doorsteps as a child. During this time, Buffett continued to pay himself his standard yearly salary of $50,000. In 1979, Buffett was still far outperforming the Dow-Jones Industrial Average; his own net worth was $140 million, and Berkshire was selling at $290 per share. As the country and the economy moved into the 1980s, Buffett’s investment philosophy began to move in a new direction, too. By the time the 1980s arrived, his longtime mentor Ben Graham had died and Buffett was no longer focusing on small, undervalued companies. He was buying big, recognizable businesses like the Washington Post and the insurance company GEICO. But though he’d outgrown Graham’s method, he still used it in principle. Rather than relying on a company’s financial assets to measure its intrinsic value, he now expanded his view to include its entire brand. His ability to make major investments, combined with the aggressive market of the 1980s, propelled Buffet to new levels of wealth. In 1980, the newly elected president Ronald Reagan made a pledge to turn the struggling economy around. To help with this, Reagan cut interest rates, which the influential economist Henry Kaufman predicted would only continue to decrease. This new environment sent people into a buying spree. With low interest rates, stocks become more attractive to buyers, and the Dow jumped 38.81 points, setting a new record high. Though none of this changed Buffett’s own patient and methodical investment philosophy, Berkshire Hathaway continued to reap the rewards. The Dow was going through the roof, and Berkshire’s stock rose right along with it. By the end of 1983, its shares were selling at $1,310 dollars. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings were now worth $1.3 billion. As for Buffett himself, over the course of four years in the 1980s, his net worth went from $140 million to $620 million. And in 1985, with the markets continuing to boom, Buffett finally made the Forbes magazine annual list of billionaires. Throughout his life, Buffett has comfortably stayed in the modest house that he purchased for $31,500 when he was 27 years old. But that’s just the beginning of the many ways Buffett defies the billionaire stereotype. To begin with, Buffett has never liked the idea of America having an elite class. Even in the early 1960s, when segregation was still widespread, Buffett defied many of his peers when he boycotted the local Rotary Club over its refusal to accept non-white members. This also led to his becoming a Democrat, even though his father had been a lifelong Republican who spent eight years as a congressman in Washington. But after his father’s death, Buffett began making frequent donations to Democratic political campaigns. And unlike many wealthy citizens, Buffett has spoken out against tax cuts for the rich – or, as he calls it, “welfare for the rich” – despite the fact that such tax cuts would benefit his own finances. Since his late 20s, Buffett has struggled to figure out what to do with his riches, since he doesn’t live a glamorous lifestyle with expensive cars, homes or clothing. Nor does he want his children to rely on his success. Instead, he has always taught them to forge their own paths in life and earn their own livings. So, in 2006, after his wife Susan passed away, he finally decided that he would donate most of it to charity. One sixth of his fortune has been divided among different Buffett family foundations, and the rest will be allocated over time to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which helps fight disease in developing nations. As of 2015, his net worth was $64 billion, which makes his commitment to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation one of history’s greatest charitable donations – a legacy he can surely be proud of. The key message in this book: With the help of his mentor, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett learned the important difference between how much a company is really worth and how much it’s selling for. An aptitude for discerning this difference, combined with a steadfast refusal to succumb to trends and a keen understanding of numbers, is what allowed Buffett to accrue a fortune exceeding $66 billion.

After all, where else could he have found out what the launch of the world’s ugliest car, a wink from a General Electric company executive, and the fall of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain have in common? These and the other events described in this book represent several major developments in US business history, the repercussions of which can still be felt today. They paved the way for things like the end of insider trading and an employee’s right to work for whomever he or she pleases. In these twelve exciting and surprising case studies, you’ll find: how Wall Street almost killed off Piggly Wiggly, why shareholder meetings of large companies are usually a complete farce, and how a misinterpreted wink landed some GE executives in court. How much can a person miss in three days? Well, if you happened to be a stock market investor who fell into a three-day coma on May 28, 1962, you might have woken up to almost no noticeable change in your investments, but you also would’ve slept straight through the chaos of the 1962 Flash Crash. This three-day turmoil neatly illustrates how bizarre the behavior of Wall Street bankers can be, and how investors are guided more by their mood than actual facts. On May 28, 1962, the mood on Wall Street was distinctly glum after six months of stock market decline. There was a lot of trading going on that morning, and the central office was running late in updating stock prices, as this was done manually. Investors panicked when they realized they could only know a stock’s true price with a time lag of some 45 minutes, by which time they assumed the true price had fallen. Consequently, they rushed to sell off their shares, which created a downward spiral in prices. Their expectations became self-fulfilling, causing a crash that annihilated $20 billion in stock value. But just as emotions triggered the crash, they also helped move along the recovery: investors considered it common knowledge that the Dow Jones Index, which measured the value of the general stock market, could not go below 500 points. So when the value came close to that limit, a buying panic broke out as everyone expected prices to go up. Three days after the crash, the market had fully recovered. After this bizarre event, everyone was searching for rational explanations. But all stock exchange officials could come up with was that the government needed to pay more attention to the prevailing “business climate,” i.e., the mood and irrational expectations, of the financial market. This inherent irrationality translates into the market’s unpredictability. In fact, the only thing that can be predicted about the market is, to quote famous banker J.P. Morgan: “It will fluctuate.” Have you ever heard of the Ford Edsel? Originally intended to be Ford’s flagship product in the late 1950s, the car not only ended up being one of the most spectacular product failures of all time but is also frequently cited as one of the ugliest cars ever made. How could a company as successful as Ford fail so dismally? For one, it completely miscalculated the market. In 1955, the American automobile market was booming. Families’ disposable income was increasing and people were becoming more interested in medium-priced cars, a segment in which Ford was weak. That’s when the company started planning the Ford Edsel. Unfortunately, by the time the Edsel was launched in 1958, the market had done a 180: an economic downturn and an abrupt change in consumer tastes had made people flock to smaller and cheaper car models. A second reason for the failure was that customers had unrealistic expectations for the car. Ford had spent $250 million on planning the Edsel, making it the company’s most expensive project up to that point – a fact that Ford promoted extensively in its marketing. This created a lot of buzz around the project, so when the Edsel was finally launched, consumers were expecting something revolutionary. However, they were disappointed to see that the Edsel was just another four-wheeled automobile after all. The third and final strike for the Edsel was its shoddy build. Since Ford had spent most of its efforts on carrying out psychological research to make the car appealing to its target group (i.e., young families with a disposable income), it neglected to fine-tune the technical side of the car. Consequently, once the product launched, customers found several faults, ranging from unreliable brakes to a jumpy acceleration. Although the Edsel might not have been a completely useless car in the end, it just couldn’t live up to its expectations. Warren Buffett is one of the richest people on the planet, and yet he admits that his tax rate is lower than his secretary’s (whose income, naturally, amounts to far less than his). Sound like a cruel joke? Well, it’s the perfect example of how unfair the US federal income tax system is. To understand how it got so bad, let’s examine the increasingly twisted development of the system since its inception. In 1913, after decades of political debate and fears that it was tantamount to socialism, the federal government began to levy an income tax. The reason was that its own income stream had run dry while its expenses were increasing. Initially, income tax rates were low and the main contributors were the richest citizens. Since then, rates have been raised continually and the application of the tax expanded to larger swathes of the population and, at the same time, more and more loopholes were created for the rich. These days, the income tax rates are generally quite high and have the greatest effect on the middle-class population. The way the tax is structured today encourages inefficiency. For example, freelancers will often stop taking on new contracts mid-way through the year just to not earn more income because, from a tax perspective, it makes more sense than earning more. What’s more, the complicated system of loopholes has made enforcing taxation a battle. The Internal Revenue Service, which collects the tax, must annually contend with an army of citizens’ tax advisers and lawyers whose speciality is circumventing the tax code. This is a colossal waste of human resources on both sides. Unfortunately though, tax reform is politically unfeasible. Multiple presidents have tried to reform the tax code into something simpler, but all have failed. The current system simply favors too many rich people with too much influence, and they don’t want to relinquish their advantages, such as capital gains being taxed less than salary income. So what’s the solution? The federal income tax system needs to be reset back to its 1913 state so we can try again. Imagine your uncle works for an oil company and he calls you up one day to tell you to invest in his company’s stock, as they’ve just struck oil and will only announce it tomorrow. Sounds like, if you bought the stock, you could end up doing time for insider trading, right? That would hold true today, but it wouldn’t necessarily have been that way before the Texas Gulf case. In 1959, a mineral company called Texas Gulf Sulphur hit the jackpot in the wilderness of Ontario, Canada. Their preliminary test drilling indicated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of copper, silver and other minerals in the ground. The people who knew about the find decided to keep quiet about it, stealthily buying shares in Texas Gulf. And as executives and other people in the know began buying shares, they instructed their relatives to do the same. When rumors spread that the company may have discovered something substantial, Texas Gulf held a press conference to actively downplay the hearsay and spread disinformation – as its own executives continued to buy shares. When the company finally announced the news about its find, the price of the shares skyrocketed and everyone who had bought the company’s stock got very wealthy. While this behavior wasn’t considered ethical, even by Wall Street standards, insider trading laws hadn’t ever been properly enforced before. This time though, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action: it charged Texas Gulf with deception and insider trading. This unprecedentedly bold step angered many investors. At the trial, the court had to decide whether or not the results of the test drilling had made the value of the find clear, and whether the company’s subsequent pessimistic press releases were deliberately misleading. In the end, the court issued a guilty verdict along with a statement that the public needs to be afforded a “reasonable opportunity to react” to any news that will affect share prices before company insiders can start trading shares. From then on, insider trading has been regulated and Wall Street has become a little cleaner. In the early 1960s, the automatic copy machine was a huge hit and the product’s developer, Xerox, suddenly became the market leader. But, within just a few years, the company experienced a huge downfall. Let’s take a look at Xerox’s rollercoaster ride in three stages. First, there was initial success against all the odds. Traditionally, people weren’t interested in copying documents because they felt like they were stealing original content. What’s more, the process was expensive, since the first copy machines would only run on specially treated paper. So when Xerox launched its first plain-paper photocopier in 1959, nobody expected a high demand for the product. The company’s founders even went so far as to discourage their friends and family from investing in the company. Yet in just six years, the company’s revenues had skyrocketed to $500 million. Second, there was sustained period of success. Xerox became so confident that it started investing heavily in philanthropy. As is fairly typical for an overnight success, the owners wanted to show their gratitude to those who had helped them and use their newly acquired position to influence society. For example, Xerox became the second-largest donor to the University of Rochester, which had originally helped develop photocopying technology. What’s more, the owners seemed to care a great deal for the United Nations. In 1964, they spent $4 million on a television campaign supporting the UN after it came under public attack by right-wing politicians. In the third stage, Xerox was forced to see how quickly success can turn into defeat. Shortly after reaching the peak of its glory in 1965, Xerox realized it was in trouble. The technological lead it had over competitors had diminished as they were producing cheaper copycat products. What’s more, new investments into research and development were ineffective, which left the company stranded. These three stages are a poignant example of the many stages a growth company can potentially go through. Luckily for Xerox, it survived the third stage and is still successful today. In late 1963, the brokerage company Ira Haupt & Co. was in trouble. It no longer had sufficient capital to trade in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and its membership had to be revoked. The reason for this predicament was that the brokerage, which traded in commodities, had made a disastrous deal. It had bought cottonseed and soybean oil to be delivered at a later point in time and used the warehouse receipts as collateral to borrow money from the bank. Unfortunately, it turned out that the receipts had been doctored and the oil did not actually exist. Ira Haupt & Co. was suddenly the victim of large-scale commercial fraud and unable pay back the massive debt. After meeting with several banks, shareholders and the NYSE, it was found that Ira Haupt & Co. needed $22.5 million to become solvent again. To make matters worse, the entire nation was in a panic: President Kennedy had just been shot and the market was declining. But instead of letting Ira Haupt & Co. go bankrupt, the NYSE did something unprecedented: they saved the brokerage. The NYSE worried that the bankruptcy of Ira Haupt & Co. in a time of national panic would cause people to quickly lose faith in their investments and send Wall Street into a crash. They felt that the nation’s welfare depended on the survival of the brokerage, so they worked with the NYSE member firms and the brokerage’s creditors to hammer out a plan for Ira Haupt & Co. to pay back its debts. The NYSE itself pledged $7.5 million, almost a third of its total reserves. Together with other lenders it managed to save Ira Haupt. It is unlikely that we’ll ever see the NYSE make such a bold move ever again, but at the time it prevented a financial crisis in the heat of national panic. These days, whenever a company is mired in a scandal, they’ll claim that nobody did anything wrong – that the true culprit is “communication problems.” For example, if a company dumps toxic waste into an aquifer, it’s not out of greed, but because “The board failed to properly communicate the new environmental strategy to the local managers.” One case where this claim was put to the test was in the late 1950s when General Electric (GE) engaged in large-scale price fixing. No fewer than 29 electronics companies colluded to fix prices of $1.75 billion worth of machinery sold, with over a half a billion dollars coming from public institutions. The fixing could typically cost the customer as much as 25 percent more than normal price. When it turned out that GE was the ringleader of the price fixers, the scandalous matter was brought before the court and a senate subcommittee. Though some managers faced fines and prison terms, no higher level executives were charged. Why not? They claimed it was all due to a communication error: middle managers had misinterpreted their instructions. Apparently, at the time, there were two types of policies accepted at GE: official ones and implied ones. If executives gave you an order with a straight face, it was an official policy you should follow. But if they winked at you as they gave an order, the interpretation was up to you. Typically you were supposed to do the exact opposite of what was said, but other times you had to guess what the executive was implying. And if you failed to deduce what was implied, you’d be the one in trouble. Because of this, even though GE had a policy that forbade discussing prices with competitors, many managers assumed it was mere window dressing. But once they landed in court for the price fixing, they realized they couldn’t blame the executives. This story shows us that executives can, indeed, use communication problems to fend off responsibility for all manner of illegalities. Unless you live in the southern or midwestern United States, chances are you’ve never heard of Piggly Wiggly. Either way, in 1917, it patented the concept of the self-service supermarket. It was the first supermarket to, for example, provide shoppers with shopping carts, put price tags on all the items and have check-out stands. Piggly Wiggly still operates today, but is relatively unknown due to the actions of its eccentric owner Clarence Saunders, who went to great lengths to fight financial speculation. In the 1920s, Piggly Wiggly was rapidly expanding throughout the United States. But when a couple of franchises in New York failed in 1923, some investors tried to take advantage of this by starting a bear raid against Piggly Wiggly. A bear raid is a strategy where investors make investments that only turn a profit if a company’s stock price falls and then do everything in their power to force the price of the stock down. In Piggly Wiggly’s case, they claimed the whole company was in trouble due to the failed New York franchises. Saunders was furious and wanted to teach Wall Street a lesson: he started an attempt to corner Piggly Wiggly’s stock, meaning he wanted to buy back the majority of it. And he almost succeeded. He announced publicly that he would buy all existing stock in Piggly Wiggly and, after borrowing heavily, managed to buy back 98 percent of the shares. This drove up the stock price from $39 to $124 per share: a catastrophe for the bear raiders, who faced enormous losses when the price rose. However, the raiders managed to convince the stock exchange to grant them an extension on paying up. Saunders’ position was not tenable due to his debts, and he eventually suffered such large losses he was forced to declare bankruptcy. If only Saunders would’ve had more influence over the stock exchange, you might be wiggling yourself through the aisles of a Piggly Wiggly instead of shopping at a big box store like Wal-Mart. When a highly influential government bureaucrat jumps over to the business world and leverages his old government connections to make money, many people are likely to accuse him of being a sell-out. But in the case of David Lilienthal, this wouldn’t be an appropriate accusation. In the 1930s, Lilienthal was a good civil servant under the reformist President Roosevelt. Then, in 1941, he was appointed chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, an entity in charge of developing and distributing cheap hydroelectric power in areas that private providers didn’t cover. Later, in 1947, he served as the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, emphasizing the importance of the peaceful civilian use of nuclear power. And, when he finally left public office In 1950, he was honest about his motivation for the move, saying he wanted to make more money so he could provide for his family and save for his own retirement. Once he entered the private sector, Lilienthal also proved himself a committed businessman. His background in energy made him well-suited for the mineral industry and, since he wanted to experience the trials of entrepreneurship, he took over the severely ailing Minerals and Chemical Corporation of America. He succeeded in bringing the company back to life from the brink of failure and earned a small fortune as a result. His new line of work also influenced his own opinions: he wrote a controversial book about why big business is important for the economy and security of the United States. His old government colleagues accused him of being a sell-out, but Lilienthal was merely highly committed to both sides of the coin. Eventually, Lilienthal decided that he wanted the best of both worlds and, in 1955, founded the Development and Resources Corporation, a consultancy that helped developing countries carry out major public works programs. This latest endeavor proves that Lilienthal really is the ideal businessman: accountable in equal measure to both shareholders and humanity. Who do you think are the most powerful people in America? In theory, it should be the stockholders. Especially given the fact that they own the largest corporations in America and these giant companies wield such great power in American society that many political scientists have suggested that the United States resembles an oligarchic feudal system more than a democracy. These major corporations are always led by a board of directors elected by the shareholders, giving the shareholders the true power. Once a year, shareholders come together for an annual meeting in order to elect the board, vote on policies and question the executives who run the company. But, far from being the dignified, serious events you might imagine, these meetings are generally a complete farce. That’s because the company’s management doesn’t really feel that the shareholders are their bosses. They make it hard for shareholders to come to meetings by holding them far away from the company’s headquarters. At the meetings, they try to to keep the shareholders from getting involved by droning on about the company’s great performance and future. This tactic works with most shareholders. The only thing that makes these meetings interesting are the professional investors who challenge the company board and management into a debate. One comic example was seen in AT&T’s 1965 shareholders’ meeting, when investor Wilma Soss berated the chairman of the board Frederick Kappel and even suggested he see a psychiatrist. Professional investors like Soss often own stock in many companies and thus want to hold them accountable for their actions. In this case, Soss was fighting to get more women on the board of directors. But trying to rouse apathetic investors is a thankless job: there is nothing more passive and compliant than a small investor who is fed dividends regularly. If shareholders only wielded their power more often, company management could not simply do as they please. If one day you were to receive a highly tempting job offer from a competitor of your current employer, you’d be able to accept it, right? Actually, your right to do so was not always so clear, and you have a research scientist named Donald Wohlgemuth to thank for setting the precedent that allows you to do as you please. In 1962, Wohlgemuth managed the space suit engineering department of the aerospace company B.F. Goodrich Company. The market for space-related products was growing fast during the race for the moon, and Goodrich was the market leader in space suits. At the time, though, the company had just lost the contract for the now famous Apollo project to its main competitor International Latex. So when Wohlgemuth received an offer from International Latex to work on the prestigious Apollo project with more responsibility and a larger salary, he accepted without delay. But when Wohlgemuth told his superiors at B.F. Goodrich that he was leaving, they feared that he would divulge the secrets he had learned about space suit production. Due to this fear and the fact that Wohlgemuth had originally signed a confidentiality agreement, B.F. Goodrich then sued Wohlgemuth. When the controversial matter went to court, two key questions of near-philosophical nature arose: If someone hasn’t ever broken an agreement or shown the intention of doing so, can action be taken against them on the assumption that they will? Should someone be prohibited from pursuing a position that would tempt them to commit a crime? In a groundbreaking decision, the judge ruled that while Wohlgemuth clearly was in a position to harm Goodrich by sharing what he knew, he could not be found guilty of it preemptively, and so was free to enter into employment with International Latex. This decision formed the precedent for similar rulings, making it a great victory for employee rights. In the 1960s, of all the currencies of the world, the British pound sterling was perhaps one of the most prestigious due to its old age and high value. So when the pound came under attack from financial speculators in 1964, central bankers around the world felt obliged to defend it. The roots of the attack go back to the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, when the major economies of the world decided to build an international monetary exchange system where all currencies were exchangeable at fixed rates. This meant that, to maintain these fixed rates, governments had to often intervene in the currency exchange market by buying or selling currencies. In 1964, Britain found itself in economic difficulties: it was running a large trade deficit. Currency speculators believed that Britain could not keep up the fixed currency exchange rates and would be forced to devalue the pound. Consequently, they started betting against the pound in the market: they wanted its value to fall. Faced not only with the threat to the prestigious pound sterling but also to the international monetary exchange system itself, a broad alliance of monetary policy makers led by the US Federal Reserve mounted a defense. They started to buy pounds to counteract the pressure to devalue the currency. Initially, it seemed as if the tactic was working, and the first waves of attacks were fended off. But the speculators were persistent, continuing their attacks for years. Finally, in 1967, the alliance could not afford to buy more pounds, and Britain was forced to devalue the currency by over 14 percent. In hindsight, the war over the valuation of the pound sterling was merely the first sign of the inherent shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system, which would come to an end just four years later in 1971. The key message in this book: In many cases, how we understand the financial market and business ethics can be traced back to key incidents in history. One man’s fight to change employers, for example, made a lasting impact on employee rights.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

But there is one major step that really represents a person’s coming of age: buying your first home. This is a hugely significant choice that will stay with you for a long time – and perhaps even the rest of your life. So it’s no wonder that buying your first house is a highly stressful decision. These blinks invite you to forget the fear of taking the plunge, offering up plenty of insightful advice for you to find the right home at the right price. In these blinks, you’ll discover how to act in cold and hot markets respectively; what the lamps in a house can tell you, before you put in an offer; and how you should behave during the first visit to a home that you’re interested in purchasing. Just about everyone has thought, at one point or another, “I’d love to own a home.” But beyond the idea of having a house that is yours alone, investing in real estate is a one-of-a-kind opportunity: it’s a chance to control a large, valuable asset by paying a small lump sum up front as a down payment. For instance, it’s common to be able to buy your first apartment for about $100,000 just by putting $15,000 on the table and taking out a loan for the remainder. Not only that, but real estate is a relatively safe investment. While property prices drop during economic downturns, they don’t plummet irreversibly like stocks can. For example, according to the S&P/Case Shiller Home Price Index, in 2013, the average appreciation in value of American homes in the time since they were purchased was 12 percent. So, it makes good financial sense to buy a home – but it also has a psychological impact. After all, if you’re a lifelong renter, you know that having a temporary living situation can prevent you from investing in nice furniture or taking the time to decorate your place. So, you leave the walls white and that smelly carpet is there to stay. But when you move into your own place, everything changes – you suddenly feel an urge to personalize every detail. Another plus of home ownership is that having no landlord means you don’t have to wait for someone else to fix your leaky pipes. You also don’t have to fear rent hikes and the threat of eviction; all that stress just falls away. But even with all those upsides, people always find excuses to avoid home ownership, and it’s important to overcome them. For instance, you might think, “I have such a good deal at my place right now.” Sure, your rent might be cheap, but buying your own home means that it will, at least eventually, belong to you. In other words, your rent might be low, but would you rather it was cheap or free? Because free is what it’ll be when you’re the owner. You’ve probably heard that when it comes to real estate, the three essential rules are: “location, location and location!” The neighborhood you choose has an impact not only on your quality of life, but also your home’s resale value. So, the easy choice is an area that suits your personality, gives you a good sense of well-being and also makes your everyday life convenient. But it’s also important to pay attention to conformity. Buyers who are attracted to a particular neighborhood tend to have a certain type of house in mind and won’t pay attention to unique homes. For example, people who are looking to buy in small-house suburban areas won’t be interested in big houses in the same area because they can’t afford them. As a result, those houses will appreciate more slowly. Once you’ve decided on the neighborhood, you’ll be faced with another big question: are new houses necessarily better? The answer is sometimes, but not always. After all, if you’re into modern design and lifestyle, or simply can’t imagine a house without an induction cooktop and light shafts, you’ll want to go for a brand new house. But remember, “new” doesn’t necessarily mean “in perfect condition.” In fact, some developers simply do shoddy work, while others don’t finish on schedule, failing to compensate their buyers and even going bankrupt before the house is finished! On the other hand, old houses have their own problems. For starters, they tend to fetch a lower price at resale than brand new homes and often come burdened with replacement costs like those for water heaters and leaky roofs. In addition, old homes are generally less energy efficient than newer ones. So, you’ll also be left paying additional costs like modernizing your windows to avoid losing heat during the colder months. And finally, the layout of older houses is usually based on the tastes of a previous era. In other words, you might not like the size of the rooms or the lack of electrical outlets. If you’re like most people, you don’t have millions of dollars lying around just waiting to be invested in real estate. But don’t worry, there are other ways to pay for your first house. The most common, a mortgage, is a loan given for the express purpose of buying real estate. In such loans, the property acts as collateral for the money. So, if you take out a loan to finance your house and fail to make the mandatory payments to the lender, they can take possession of the house to recover their investment. While that sums up the basic idea, there are actually different types of mortgages. For instance, you might be offered a mortgage with a fixed or adjustable interest rate; the difference between the two is that the rate of the latter changes over time. However, most of the significant differences between mortgages are caused by the identity of the borrowers. For example, if you earn a decent, steady salary and can prove that you pay your bills on time, you’ll qualify for a lower interest rate. Similarly, you can also receive better loan conditions by putting forward a bigger down payment – doing so proves that you’re less likely to default on your mortgage. In fact, the down payment is crucial to your greater financing strategy. For instance, a few years ago, you could still finance 100 percent of a home purchase with a mortgage. But after the recent housing meltdown, many houses plummeted in value just after their mortgages were granted; the result was huge losses for lenders. As a consequence, lenders of today tend to feel safer financing just 80 percent of the purchase and require the borrower to come up with the remaining 20 percent. So, you’ve identified a few properties you’re interested in. What’s the next step? Visit them! But before you do that, remember that when you’re looking over a house to buy, you’re being evaluated as well. The seller’s agent will search for clues about your financial status. For instance, being too well dressed or wearing lots of expensive jewelry might signal that you can definitely afford the full asking price. That’s a good reason to ditch the suit and tie and dress casually – that is, if you intend to negotiate the price. Once you’ve taken a look at the place, and if it seems promising, it’s time to start asking questions. The first important thing to ask is how long the house has been on the market; this is a key indicator of its value. After all, while it depends on the market you’re in, if the property has been on offer for longer than a few weeks, it might be overpriced, which gives you leverage in negotiations. Another important question is to determine the cost of utilities like electricity, water and gas. This is especially important if they’re unusually high and your budget is already being stretched thin. Once you’ve gotten these questions answered, you’ll want to take a more careful look around. Specifically, you want to look out for any signs of past damage, which means looking for water issues, especially in the attic and basement. For instance, if you see moisture on the walls, you might be looking at a costly repair and a struggle to get insurance coverage. Additionally, you’ll want to check out the furnace and air conditioning as they might be old and obsolete, adding another expensive repair or replacement. And finally, ask about the neighbors. This one is crucial because neighbors can’t be fixed or replaced. Take a peek next door and get a sense of their noise level and general attitude. Hypothetically speaking, if the home you’re about to move into was once a drug lab, would you want to know? Well, while such information disclosures can be helpful, you should tend to approach them skeptically. In the United States, sellers are legally obligated to let you know about any important facts concerning a property, especially ones that may negatively affect its value. However, depending on where you live, such legal disclosures will be more or less detailed. For instance, California requires sellers to let a potential buyer know about everything from a leaky roof to any deaths that occurred on the property within the previous three years! But you can’t expect the same amount and quality of information in all states. As a result, these disclosures remain an incomplete and uneven source. For this reason, independent inspectors can and should be assigned to give a place a thorough run-down. Sellers sometimes conduct expert reports on houses, but you shouldn’t trust these blindly. Such reports might be months old and might not include new problems that you can discover. You should only trust professional inspectors that you personally commission. But before you hire your own inspector, it’s a good idea to try to spot big issues yourself. If you can identify major problems, you’ll be able to get the right expert to assess the severity of the situation. Say you find a house you want to buy. You should first check to see if the roof sags; if it does, you should hire an expert roofer to determine any potential foundation issues or whether the roof simply needs replacing. Similarly, if during your initial visit you turn the faucets to their maximum and notice rust-colored water or generally low pressure, a plumber could be called in to see how old the pipes are, how likely they are to leak and whether they need to be replaced. Real estate agents are experts at making total dumps look like lovely homes. You should always be on the lookout for the traps they set. In fact, to get the maximum return on a property, sellers and their advisors will gladly give a home a quick and superficial makeover. The most common industry trick is to empty the place out and rent furniture, artwork and flowers to dress it up before you visit. It may be shocking, but these simple additions, known as staging, can increase the selling value by tens of thousands of dollars. But don’t worry, it’s easy to spot this trick by looking for rooms that have less furniture than they actually need, or if there are few functional objects and lots of decorative ones. For instance, in a laundry room you should see detergents and cleaners, not just loads of flower vases. And pay special attention to lamps. Turn them all on to see if they actually work or if they were just placed decoratively – maybe even in corners with no electrical outlets. Another common situation to walk into is one where the owner never lived in the place, but just remodeled it to sell for a profit. This is called flipping houses and it might present a situation that seems financially attractive to you. For example, the owner might have laid a new floor or installed a brand new air conditioner, which means you’ll dodge those future expenses. But since the owner never lived in the place, he might not have had a huge incentive to do great work. As such, it’s hard to know for sure that the condition of the home is as perfect as promised. In situations like this, you’ll want to bring in a real estate inspector. His job is to appraise such situations and make sure that all the permits necessary for the remodel were properly issued. After all, you don’t want to discover after closing on a house that your swimming pool was installed illegally. Do you have reservations about hiring an inspector to assess a property you’re in love with? Well, you shouldn’t – inspections are par for the course. In fact, purchase contracts often include a clause that states the buyer can pull out of the deal if he’s displeased with the findings of an inspection. That’s why most buyers set up a general inspection to get an overview of a house’s condition. There’s also a secondary inspection often required by the mortgage lender: a pest inspection. That being said, this isn’t a legal obligation. For instance, in the United States, the buyer can decide the number, type and extent of the inspections they want to order. In fact, there isn’t really a “standard” inspection. That means the price of one can vary from $200 to $600 depending on the size, sale price, age and other characteristics of the property. So, to avoid an unpleasant surprise, it’s best to specify your expectations. For example, if you want the inspector to get under the house and look at the foundation, you should confirm it beforehand and be prepared to pay an additional fee. But it’s also important to check the professional qualifications of the inspector you hire. After all, you don’t want to bring someone in that isn’t licensed to do the job you’re hiring them for. And remember, you can’t rely on your inspector to check absolutely everything. What you can do is make sure he does a thorough job. Your average house is made up of 60,000 pieces, many of which are hidden by others. So, if the seller has copies of past inspections, it’s a good idea to use them as a guide. You can bring them to the inspector and can plan on spending time with him while he looks things over. If he takes an hour and claims to have checked the whole place, he might well have rushed and missed an important detail. It often takes at least a few hours to get a truly complete overview. Assuming you’ve found a place you like, that’s within your price range and for which you’ve been pre-approved for a mortgage, you’re ready to make an offer. Naturally, the trickiest part of this is deciding on how much. To decide on this magic number, you have to strike the right balance: if you offer less than the seller expects, you’ll face rejection; if you offer too much you’ll be overpaying. So, to find a happy medium, you need to consider whether the market is hot or cold. A hot market is one that’s lively and a cold market is one that’s stalling. In a hot market it’s common to see sellers set very low prices and let potential buyers bid each other up. For instance, the San Francisco Bay Area is generally considered a hot market because of the Silicon Valley tech boom. In this market, demand is so high that buying a house means making an offer that’s well beyond asking, just to beat out the competition. On the other hand, in a cold market you can often safely offer a price that’s below asking that the seller will accept, as they’re desperate to sell the property. But the market isn’t all you should consider; the seller’s personal position is also relevant when deciding on a price. So, it’s in your interest to learn as much about her current situation as possible. For example, if the seller just inherited the house, doesn’t live in it and just wants to get rid of it, you can expect her to take a lower price. Or, if the house is an investment for its owner and rents are falling, she might also be willing to part with it at a discount. The key message of this book: If real estate isn’t your strong suit, buying your first home can seem like a scary and insurmountable task. But, as long as you do your homework, it doesn’t have to be. By gathering as much information as you can about both the property and seller, you’re sure to get the home of your dreams for the right price.  Actionable advice: Don’t rush into a deal.  Say one day, when you’re writing out your rent check, you suddenly realize that you’re throwing money away and that it makes much more sense to invest in a home. That may well be true, but your realization shouldn’t make you run out and buy the first house you can find. Realistically, you want to allow yourself six months to a year to study the market, neighborhoods and purchasing process. Just remember, the average home buyer looks at 10 to 12 houses before making a decision. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

These blinks offer a personal invitation to enter the talented mind of Charlie Munger, legendary investor and financial partner of Warren Buffett. As the vice-president of Berkshire Hathaway, Munger has done quite well as an investor – to put it mildly. These blinks give you the secrets to his success, outlining in clear detail the steps you too can take to hone your knowledge and become a smart, worldly and successful investor just like Munger. You’ll also learn why value investing is like waiting for the bus; why you should get to know the whims and worries of Mr. Market; and why “don’t just sit there, do something!“ is the wrong inspiration for an investor. Have you heard of Charlie Munger? He’s the legendary investor and financial partner of Warren Buffett, a household name when it comes to smart, successful investing. But that’s not all. Munger is also vice-president of Berkshire Hathaway, where Buffett is CEO. It should come as no surprise that Munger and Buffett have guided Berkshire Hathaway more than successfully! Berkshire Hathaway is the fifth-largest public company in the world. Its activities are broad, with interests in sectors such as insurance, finance, energy, utilities, rail freight transport, manufacturing and services. The company also is the sole owner of fast food restaurant chain Dairy Queen, clothing manufacturer Fruit of the Loom and private jet company NetJets, to name just a few. Berkshire Hathaway also holds considerable stakes in financial services firm American Express, technology giant IBM and The Coca-Cola Company. On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Berkshire Hathaway common stock is listed with the trading symbols BRK.A and BRK.B. In December 2014, a Berkshire Hathaway Class A share sold for over $220,000, the highest priced per-share trade on the NYSE. In 2015, the annual revenue of Berkshire Hathaway was $200 billion. Which begs the question: how did Berkshire Hathaway become such a success? The company’s success was built on the brilliant investing strategies and sharp minds of Munger and Buffett. For Munger, his success as an investor stems from his unwavering desire to teach himself new things. Indeed, he is the perfect example of his belief that successful investors must be learning machines. Munger and Buffett dedicate 80 percent of their working day to reading, making acquiring tons of knowledge a key part of their work. Munger says he wasn’t born a business genius but honed his investment savvy through countless hours of reading and absorbing information daily for years. Investors like Munger, Buffett, Irving Kahn and Seth Klarman all swear by one method: the Graham value investing system, invented by Benjamin Graham, an American economist and professional investor. What makes this system such a popular choice among the world’s best investors? This system is based on simplicity. The ultimate goal of the Graham value investing system is only doing things within your competence. As Buffett likes to say, investing is simple, but not easy. Rather than getting into complicated investments that you might not fully understand, accept the limits of your knowledge and focus on sure bets. Doing so will secure you far better results. In following the Graham system, Berkshire Hathaway sorts its potential investment opportunities into three baskets: In, Out and Too Tough. The In basket holds worthwhile potential investments and is the smallest basket. The Out basket contains uninteresting opportunities; the Too Tough basket holds opportunities that look great but are currently outside Berkshire’s competence. If you follow the Graham value investing system, you also focus on buying shares for less than their future earning potential. But in doing so, you need a healthy dose of patience waiting for them to appreciate. Seth Klarman likens investing to sitting at a bus stop and waiting for a bus even though you have no idea when it’ll show up. It’s your job as an investor to focus on long-term results to make the best of your investments. You have to be ready to wait until undervalued shares regain their value. You’ve also got to wait for the right moment to make a new investment. Unlike baseball, there are no strikes in investing. There’s no need to hit the ball with every pitch. Just make sure you’re ready to swing when the right ball comes along! In other words, great investing requires a realistic approach, not to mention patience and courage, too. Munger believes that just about anyone can follow Graham’s value investing system, as its guidelines are so simple and easily applied. Munger himself follows four important principles, easily adopted by any value investor. First, treat owning a share as ownership in a business. You won’t understand the value of your shares unless you truly know the company in which you are investing. Any valuation of a share must start with a valuation of the core business. Second, buy at a discount to give yourself a margin of safety. A margin of safety is the difference between the share’s current market price and its intrinsic value, that is, its future cash flow. Think of this as following cars on a highway. By maintaining a safe distance between your car and the car in front of you, you can predict or react to sudden movements more easily. Drive too close, and you could misinterpret a move and crash. The same goes for investing – rather than trying to predict future price jumps, prioritize your financial safety and buy at a bargain price. Third, always stay on the right side of the market. A Graham value investor knows how to spot mispriced assets and recognize the strange, even bipolar, behaviors of “Mr. Market,” the personification of the investing herd. Sometimes he’s depressed and sells assets at a bargain price, while other times he’s ecstatic and pays way more than he should. If you can spot them, investor mistakes such as these are golden opportunities for you. And fourth, stay rational. This is harder than it sounds. It’s your job to remain unemotional when selecting investment opportunities. Investing according to your mood is foolish and at worse, dangerous. To ensure your rational side is always in control, create a checklist that helps you divide tasks into simple blocks. This allows you to check in at every step and ensure that emotional errors aren’t lurking in your process. As Munger says, rationality is something you’ve got to foster. Putting in the effort to stay cool is worth it as you’ll avoid making senseless mistakes. It’s just not enough to have a great investment strategy; you also need to cultivate personality traits that will keep you on the path to success. To review, Munger believes patience and courage are essential traits for any great investor. The best investing opportunities come around when the market is fearful. This is important to know! The thing is, however, that predicting when the market will get jitters is impossible. All you can do is wait for a bargain to show its face, and spend the time while you wait gaining useful information about other investment opportunities. In other words, a “don’t just sit there, do something!” approach clashes with the philosophy of Graham value investing. Yet waiting can be challenging if you associate waiting with being unproductive! But moving around shares too frequently also means higher taxes, fees and expenses, so don’t let your itchy trading finger get the best of you! Be disciplined and stick to the waiting game. A Graham value investor must also be brave. Sometimes it’s hard to make a bold move when everyone else is holding their cards close to their chest. But remember, it’s market folly that creates the best investing opportunities for those who are courageous. Fight the tendency to follow the crowd and you may outperform the market. Indeed, this strategy is like playing poker. Not everyone can win a game; it’s just not possible. The same goes for investing – it’s mathematically impossible for every investor to outperform the market. You’ve got to keep an independent mind and know when to split from the pack. In this way, the worst times for other investors become the best times for Graham value investors. And finally, remember that nobody is perfect – not even Charlie Munger or Warren Buffett! We all make mistakes. But by cultivating discipline and courage, and pushing yourself to learn new things every day, you’ll always improve and your investments will thrive. The Graham value investing system isn’t the only framework Munger follows. He also channels the principles of worldly wisdom in every investing choice he makes. Worldly wisdom is a unique framework that makes use of a set of mental models, or ways of thinking, across a range of disciplines. Psychology, history, mathematics, physics, philosophy and biology – Munger believes that these all have wisdom that stems from each discipline’s unique way of seeing the world. By examining behavior through these different lenses, a savvy investor can spot similarities and patterns where other less-insightful investors won’t. So how do you cultivate interdisciplinary wisdom? Spend time learning about different fields, but not just by collecting loads of facts and information. Instead, focus on the core ideas of each discipline – why do people in each field study what they study? How do they structure knowledge? And how do they use it? These questions will help you find the wisdom in just about any social or natural science. Once you’ve done this, you’re ready to start relating these nuggets of wisdom to each other. This is what will help you make decisions as an investor. For instance, say the price of a product has recently increased, yet the company is still able to sell the product in increasing numbers. Doesn’t this event break the economic rule of supply and demand? Sure, but it also fits into a model one finds in psychology, that of a Giffen good – a product that a customer desires more when prices rise because it makes the good an exclusive or luxury item. Having worldly wisdom can bring a competitive advantage. Had a narrow-minded investor observed this price increase, he might have decided to abandon the assets tied to the product. A worldly, wise investor would recognize the product as a Giffen good, go against the crowd and stick to his investment. The key message in this book: Charlie Munger is a highly successful investor, but not because he’s tapped into some mysterious type of investing magic. By following his guidelines of continuous learning, simplicity, patience, courage and worldly wisdom, you too can boost your success in investing.  Got feedback?

A far more appropriate philosophy for the modern world would be “the customer is always first.” But what does this mean in practice?  These blinks, based on 122 simple instructions by a hugely successful real estate couple, show you why you need to focus – at all times – on the emotions, needs and desires of your clients. Instead of giving clients advice based on what you want, try basing your strategies and decisions on their wishes. It could very well give your business a new lease on life. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the authors increased their sales by advising clients not to buy from them; why customer loyalty can help carry you through a recession; and why being a success in business depends on maintaining your desire to learn. Whether you’re a high-flying consultant or a shopkeeper, you can be sure that good business comes from getting customers or clients to trust you. Of course, this is easier said than done. We all know why we should create stronger bonds with customers, but do we know how? In the end, it’s not so complicated. By focusing on the three areas of honesty, competence and caring, you’ll give your business the foundation it needs for a great customer-brand relationship. So, let’s get started with the first of them: honesty.  Honesty isn’t just about telling your clients the truth, but telling the truth even when it might go against your interests. But a little white lie never hurt anybody, did it? Well, let’s dig a little deeper into why honesty is so necessary using the example of the real estate business.  When it comes to real estate purchases, clients are making big financial and emotional decisions. They’re deciding where they and their family will live, and how much they’re willing to pay for it. It’s no wonder that clients often get overwhelmed. You might think that the best real estate agents would be those that prey on these moments of weakness, but the truth is quite the opposite. Agents who can keep their clients calm and composed with honest statements are the agents who will benefit from lasting, trusting relationships. In their real estate work, the authors met the Brown family. This family, though not very well off, were eager and determined to purchase the house being sold by the Smith family. The authors could have closed the deal with the Browns in a heartbeat; but knowing that the mortgage would cripple them financially, the authors told the families the truth and advised against the sale.  The result? Both the Smiths and the Browns became loyal clients, seeing that the authors really did have the customers’ interests at heart. And they made sure to recommend the authors to all their friends, too!  Honesty is the best policy, but it’s not the only approach you should implement when dealing with customers. The second essential aspect of putting customers first is competence. Competence simply means showing the customer that you’re an expert at what you do. But competence isn’t about working until you’re the best and stopping. In order to demonstrate competence, you have to embrace a process of continuous learning and development. To become a great real estate agent, you have to be ready to learn non-stop.  Since they were starting out as amateurs, the authors’ first real estate jobs were complete disasters. This could easily have pushed them toward a completely different career path, but they were determined not to give up.  The authors began attending conferences and seminars, often up to ten times a year. They subscribed to trade magazines and even used their commuting time to listen to educational CDs; it was this perseverance that gave them the competence to win over an army of loyal clients. Now it was time to ensure that their whole team demonstrated the same sort of competence, too.  The authors put time and effort into assembling a top-notch customer service team, where members knew their roles inside out. This way, their clients would witness competence in action at every step of the process. But what does this look like? Well, when a client comes in, they first talk to Martin. He arranges a time for Ed to visit their house and measure it. Next, Judy will stage their house and Aaron will photograph it. Donna oversees and open house and eventually when the house receives an offer, she contacts Joseph and JoAnn, the authors, to close the deal. What do salespeople think about when trying to close a deal? Their commission, surely! Well, not if they’re good salespeople. Putting the client first means, above all else, caring for the client – and not just the commission! Caring for clients doesn’t refer to maternal feelings or offering a shoulder to cry on. Though we usually define caring in terms of sympathy or empathy, caring in this case is more about understanding where the client’s interests lie.  When clients see that companies really are looking out for their interests, they’ll be more than ready to listen to the advice they receive.  A caring company might even fight to change a client’s mind if they think the client is heading down the wrong path. Think of the Brown family from the previous blink. In such cases, it’s crucial that the client knows the company puts them first; only then will clients reward companies with their trust.  In other cases, companies struggle to get to the bottom of what a client wants, because the client has irrational or embarrassing fears they wish to hide. But once they share a trusting relationship with the company, they’ll feel comfortable enough to tell all. And when things really go well, care goes both ways. Clients will care that the company performs well, and will take pride in spreading the news about them to their friends and family. Word-of-mouth advertising is incredibly powerful, and you never know when it could make a big difference for your company.  During the market crash of 2007-2008, the author’s competitors in real estate experienced a drop in commissions of up to 70 percent. But the authors’ commissions only fell around 20 percent. Why? Their loyal customer base showed that they cared about the company too, and continued to support and promote them despite tough times in the market. The economy operates in cycles – there are good times and bad times. But this doesn’t make the bad times any easier for companies. Slumps in the market can threaten to put many once-thriving enterprises out of business. But there is one way to give your company the safety net it needs: building a strong customer base. During the 2007-8 financial crisis, the real estate market in the United States collapsed. Buyers became reluctant to take out mortgages to buy homes, while sellers flooded the market and banks tried desperately to get repossessed homes off their books. In other words, the price of houses had plummeted, but nobody was buying. Real estate businesses across the United States were struggling to stay afloat. The authors, however, managed to keep their real estate business relatively stable. The reason? They consistently put their clients first. Their honesty and care for the clients and their interests allowed them to maintain strong, trusting relationships despite a collapsing market. In addition, their competence helped the authors stay on top of changing legislation, ensuring their clients received the best advice possible. It wasn’t just a trusting relationship between client and company that helped keep the authors afloat during the financial crisis; a strong team relationship also carried them through. During the crisis, many businesses chose to lay off their staff and shrink their companies.  But the authors weren’t prepared to start firing employees, as it would cause their overall competence to drop. The team showed their appreciation for this by working harder, which kept customer service at a consistently high level during the crisis. Knowing how to put your clients first is one thing – enjoying putting them first is another! In order to truly build successful customer relationships, you need the right attitude. After all, there are few things more important than finding joy in your job.  The truth is that with the right mindset, any job you do can make you feel fulfilled and, yes, happy! Rather than trying to do what you love, why not start trying to just love what you do, whatever it may be. This is itself a very useful skill, particularly when we end up doing certain jobs as a last resort.  When their children were in elementary school, the authors urgently needed work, so Joseph found a job as a housekeeper at a local hospital. While other housekeepers didn’t like their job, he took another approach and took the time to do the best possible work.  His manager told him that in 32 years, she had never seen an employee do such a good job. Such praise made this supposedly undesirable line of work feel worthwhile.  Ultimately, businesses revolve around people and their needs – and talking to and liking your clients is the only way to discover such needs. When he was new to the real estate game, Joseph used to go around his neighborhood knocking on doors, sometimes dropping by 30 to 40 neighbors each day.  As he knew little about real estate, he avoided the topic and instead asked questions about the neighbors themselves. At first, it didn’t lead to any business, but it taught him to like and care for the people around him. In the end, his caring approach paid off: within 12 years, Joseph had sold one-third of the homes he had visited. The key message in this book: Because clients are people like anyone else, success when working with clients is fundamentally based on putting their interest first. By demonstrating honesty, competence and caring, you can set your company apart from the competition, while creating support networks that will keep you afloat even in times of crisis. Actionable advice:  Honesty is the best policy! Be honest and caring with people, and you will never have to worry about what you said or did in the past, or how it will affect you in the future. At the same time, honesty will create trust in your relationships with clients and make you a sought-after professional.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Fischer","summary":"While the stock market goes up and down from year to year, it’s good to know that some of the fundamentals of investment theory have remained consistent for generations. Although Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits was published in 1956, the advice it offers on investing is just as relevant as it was when Eisenhower was U.S. president. These blinks lay out the key characteristics of what you should look for when investing in a company, and helps you determine whether you’re a high-risk investor or a conservative one. Just like a detective, a successful investor does her homework and digs deep to get all the pertinent information before putting her money on the table! After reading these blinks, you’ll know how to determine if a company stock is overvalued; why stock price doesn’t tell you whether a company is actually any good; and how to conquer doubt and not hesitate when it’s time to buy. The common perception of investing is that it is fast-paced and brutal, with investors buying and selling seemingly on a whim, seeking quick profits above all. Yet smart investing involves much more thought and planning, and is ideally focused on the long term. Smart investors don’t seek quick profits but instead looks for companies with growth potential that over time will multiply an initial investment. It isn’t easy to identify which companies offer this kind of growth potential. Indeed, many stocks are either over- or undervalued, which can make investing difficult. Smart investors look for companies with potential that are nonetheless still undervalued, as such companies can, when the time is right, grow with such rapidity that an investor can double or even triple his initial investment. Luckily, companies with growth potential can be recognized by their common characteristics. Such companies offer products and services that ideally could sustain high sales volumes for at least a few years. Companies with good growth potential also invest in research and development, to continue growing even when a current product line no longer offers opportunities for growth. The 1950s, for example, was a great time for television manufacturers. But by the middle of the decade, nearly everyone who wanted a black-and-white TV already had one. This meant that, until the color television was developed, TVs companies faced flat growth; so they had to adapt. Motorola, now known for mobile phones, used to produce televisions and radios. But management had the foresight to harness the company’s technical skills and experience to enter the two-way communication business, and continued to grow sales while other TV manufacturers’ sales flatlined. Companies with high growth potential also have a solid management team and good employee relations. Don’t invest in a company whose employees are too busy squabbling to be productive, and whose executives can’t inspire solidarity or a shared vision in the workforce. Successful investing is a lot like the work of a detective, as you need to research your topics thoroughly and analyze all available data to be effective. When considering a company’s investment potential, you’ll want to collect detailed information about the company from every possible angle. Of course, you could easily track down a trader and ask her which companies she would recommend investing in. However, there is no guarantee that she’ll give you accurate information, because traders have to protect their own interests. Instead, employ the scuttlebutt method: dig for information from every possible source. Contact vendors, customers, former employees and research scientists or executives in trade associations. You’ll be amazed at what you find, as long as you ensure that you won’t make the information public or out your informant. Contacting a few of the company’s competitors could also yield surprisingly accurate and detailed information. Once you’ve developed a profile of the company, it’s time to contact company management directly to ask them informed questions. The scuttlebutt method is accurate, yet time-consuming. To avoid wasting any time, choose the companies you wish to research very carefully. This will require you to pre-select companies that could offer the kind of growth potential you want for your investment. Start by simply talking to friends or other investors, looking at printed materials and asking yourself which companies seem promising. If you read in the newspaper, for example, that a company’s manager is resigning because of some questionable dealings, then you won’t want to waste your time on that company! Once you’ve identified a company with good long-term growth potential, is it time to buy? As mentioned earlier, stocks are often over- or undervalued, so how can you ensure that you get the most bang for your buck? Stock prices mirror the financial community’s perception of a stock’s value at the current moment, and these ratings create a vicious cycle. If the community values a stock too high, for example, then people rush to buy, based on its perceived value. The stock price then continues to climb, resulting in a price “bubble.” People don’t buy and sell with an eye toward the future. For instance, if a successful company encounters an unexpected expense, even something as benign as a research project, this can cause the investment community to downgrade future projections for the company. As a result, the company’s stock price will fall, even if the research project would drive profitability down the road. This simple realization about the stock market’s irrationality can help you earn extraordinary profits! Companies with potential to grow are often innovators, and they’ll inevitably run into bumps along the road. Consequently, the financial community will undervalue the stocks of these companies. To illustrate this, image you’ve found a widget manufacturing company with huge growth potential. At first, the hype surrounding the company causes the stock price to rise. However, a problem soon appears: the casting mold for the company’s widgets were improperly sized. Now everyone thinks the product is a flop; and the stock price falls. This presents the perfect time for you to buy in cheaply, to profit when the company ultimately fixes its problems. If you miss an opportunity like this, don’t worry, as there may be another chance to get in during the next dip. For example, the company’s stock rises after it fixes its casting mold problems, yet it announces that its sales staff has racked up unexpected costs in rolling out the product. Exasperated, the financial community bails out, thinking the company will never make it. Yet for you, it’s an opportunity to get the stock cheaply again! Doubt is natural. Inevitably, once you’ve identified a stock that you want to buy, you’ll feel the pangs of doubt that cause you to hesitate. A successful investor however has no room for doubt. Don’t hesitate once you’ve identified a company with profit potential. Often this hesitation derives from the whims of the crowd. If no one else is jumping on a stock, couldn’t that mean that it isn’t really that valuable? Yet you’ve already seen how the financial community is so often wrong about a stock’s value. Surely, it’s scary to buy when everyone else is selling! But if you truly believe a company has potential, then take a deep breath, and buy. Besides, you really don’t want to be buying what everyone else is buying. At that point, the stock will be too expensive to be a truly great investment. And if you hesitate, you may never get the same opportunity again. Resist the urge to let a stock’s price fall further to get a better deal. By doing so, you might miss a golden opportunity. That’s exactly what happened to one of the author’s acquaintances who wanted to buy 100 shares of a stock listed at 35 1/2. In an effort to save himself 50 cents, he offered only $35 per share. The share price, however, continued to rise! Had he made that extra 50-cent investment that day, he would have earned a total of $46,500 some 20 years later! Finally, once you’ve found a good investment, you should hold on to it. From a business perspective, there are only three valid reasons to sell a stock. One, you misjudged the company’s growth potential. Two, your judgment was sound, but the company conditions changed. And three, you’ve invested in a middling stock in the near-term to keep you busy while you search for an amazing investment. Any other reasons, such as making money quickly or following the crowd, can only harm you. A company with huge growth potential can never be overvalued! So far we’ve examined how to win big with high-growth company investments. Yet for some investors, a more moderate profit strategy with gradual but consistent growth is more attractive.   As a conservative investor, you want a strong company that still has the potential to grow. If you’re trying to play it safe, you shouldn’t invest in start-ups, no matter how promising they appear. Rather, keep your eye out for large, established companies that have a proven track record of profitability. For this strategy to work, however, the company still needs to have growth potential to maintain its market position. This doesn’t need to be stratospheric potential, of course. Rather, the company must simply be able to grow and develop. Otherwise it will eventually be outpaced by more agile competitors. A company that is both strong and able to grow demonstrates these four major characteristics. First, the company’s production methods are low cost, such that it can continue earning profits even when prices rise, through inflationary periods or market crashes. Second, the company is well organized and effective in its market, meaning it can actually deliver its products and services. Third, the company has an outstanding track record in research and technical development, allowing it to continue innovating and improve upon its products and services. Finally, the company needs to demonstrate financial know-how. It must be capable of allocating resources only to initiatives with profit potential, and have a good eye for warning signs that indicate it’s time to move on. If you are a conservative investor, it’s also important to examine a company’s employee base and learn more about how the company treats them. There are two main reasons for this strategy. First, a company’s growth potential is entirely dependent upon employees who put into motion the company’s strategy. Indeed, all of a company’s advantages are the direct result of work performed by its employees. To foster innovative technical development, for example, a company needs devoted, ambitious research and development teams. To ensure production methods are low cost, a company needs a bright manager who is always on the lookout for gains in efficiency. Second, how a company treats its staff can help you figure out just how productive and effective that company is overall. People don’t deliver the best results when they’re mistreated; yet companies succeed when employees are valued. By looking at a company’s human resource and management policies, you can get a better idea of how a company is run and better judge its long-term potential. Look, for example, at the way the company handles promotions. If they rarely promote from within and instead prefer to hire from outside the company, then this is a strong indication that the company isn’t grooming employees or developing potential through training. This is a red flag that the company does not handle its human resources wisely, and is therefore not the kind of company in which you would want to invest. The same applies to management’s ability to work together as a team. If a company manager seems to think he’s running a one-man show, how can he be expected to manage efficiently as the company grows? Look instead for a company that forms well-organized teams, and for managers who can effectively delegate responsibility. When evaluating a company, a conservative investor should look into the future. Not only must the company be strong today, but also it must have the means to protect its position over time. When making this evaluation, an investor should view a company’s profitability not as the sum of its returns, but rather in terms of the size of its profit margins. The bigger the better! You want to find a company that will be profitable in the long term, one that will continue growing even during challenging economic times. The reason that profitability is so important is because growth always requires monetary investment, be it for research and development, new inventory or marketing. Thus the company must ensure its future profitability to finance additional expenses to come. Profitability also gives the company a buffer when it falls on hard times; when costs rise, the company must have cash on hand to stay in business. But how can a business ensure long-term profits? In short, by being better than the competition! A company’s long-term profitability hinges upon its ability to do or create something that competitors can’t, lest the competition steal its market share. One way to ensure market dominance is through scale. In other words, a large producer can produce more than a small competitor can, and at a lower cost.   For example, a big company that produces a million pencils per month will have lower production costs per pencil than a company that can only produce 100,000 pencils monthly. Another way to ensure a company’s market position is by creating technical developments that can’t legally be copied by other companies, due to patent or copyright. You want to be sure that a company’s strategy takes into account and is prepared for the long-term development of the business. A company can be incorrectly valued based on the whims of the investment crowd. As you’ll see, a stock’s value is even more subjective than that. In fact, its value changes from person to person. Indeed, a company can be worth more for a risky investor than for a conservative one. A risky investor might value a stock higher if a company is expected to grow rapidly, but this fact doesn’t help the conservative investor. A conservative investor shouldn’t pay in terms of expectation. Instead, a conservative investor pays the real price of a stock. Essentially, the conservative investor is looking for stable, growing companies that are either currently undervalued or priced at their real value. One way to determine this is by using the price-earnings ratio. To do so, simply take a company’s stock price and divide it by the company’s earnings per share. For example, if a company is earning $1 per share, and sells its shares at $10, then its price-earnings ratio is 10/1, or ten. At its last annual report, however, if the company says it earned $1.82 per share, this brings the ratio down to 10/1.82, or five. However, higher earnings represent positive projections, which could cause a huge spike in the stock price. Imagine that the company stock now sells for $40. The ratio would be 40/1.82, or 22, far higher than it was previously. It’s up to the conservative investor to decide whether the company’s characteristics justify the market’s belief that the company will continue growing beyond its current $40 share value. While someone looking for huge short-term gains might not be bothered by a $40 share price, a conservative investor might find the price a bit too steep, considering what she knows about company management! The key message in this book: To be a successful investor, you have to be willing to dig. A company’s true value is based on so much more than its stock price alone! If you’re willing to put in the detective work, you stand to reap great rewards no matter whether you’re a conservative investor or a high-risk one.  Actionable advice: Go to your bank as an information source. If you’re having trouble finding information on a company, try contacting your bank. As long as you are open about your intentions, they can easily make an introduction for you. Be clear that you are looking for information for yourself and will treat the information with the utmost discretion.

Even when the financial sector is in turmoil, property prices always seem sure to bounce back, allowing real-estate owners to relax while other investors panic and lose their life savings. So why doesn’t everyone simply invest in property? Well, as with most things, investing in real estate isn’t as simple as it seems. There are many pitfalls, and it’s as common for a property to represent a financial drain as it is for it to lead to financial gain. This doesn’t mean that real estate can’t make you wealthy. It most certainly can. However, there are many important things to consider, both before and after you make your first investment – and that’s where these blinks come in. They’ll provide you with a wealth of real-estate wisdom from a property-owning pro who learned all his lessons in the field. You’ll also find out why you should put your office in the basement; why property owners aren’t passive; and how to make your property feel like home. You’ve probably had the thought. If only you could buy a piece of valuable property, your money problems would be solved forever. And yes, investing in commercial real estate can lead to considerable wealth – but there’s a bit more to it than buying a few apartments and awaiting the inevitable blizzard of banknotes. First and foremost, you’ve got to get a handle on a few financial concepts, the most important of which are net operating income and cash-on-cash returns. A property’s net operating income is easy to calculate. Simply take the income the property will generate for you in a year – things like the rent you’ll receive from tenants, the money generated by the laundry facilities and the fees levied on pets. Take this number and subtract the property’s yearly costs – for example, property taxes and maintenance expenses. The difference between these two numbers is the net operating income. Now that you’ve got this number, it’s time to calculate the property’s cash-on-cash returns. To do this, take the net operating income and divide it by the amount you’ve invested in the property upfront. Now multiply this number by one hundred and put a percentage sign after it. That percentage is the property’s cash-on-cash returns, and the higher it is, the better. If you want to expand your portfolio, you’ll need to focus on investments that carry little risk. And the properties that provide an instant cash flow are usually the least risky. This is why knowing these numbers is of the utmost importance. By investing in properties with large cash-on-cash returns, you’ll increase your cash flow, thus reducing the risk inherent to all investments. In the real-estate game, cash is your lifeboat. Mistakes will be made, and unforeseeable events are as inevitable as high waves on the open sea. It behooves you to have a means of staying afloat. Once, an eager young investor shared her plans with the author, Murray. She confided that, after buying her first piece of commercial real estate, she planned to say goodbye to her current job and splurge on some luxuries. She looked forward to an array of purchases: a new car, new office space and a set of elegant business cards. The author could only look askance at these plans, however, because he knew something that she didn’t: investors entering the real-estate market should do everything in their power to avoid spending money. If you’re an aspiring real-estate investor, then bootstrapping – that is, making creative use of the resources at your disposal – is your best bet. Stretch your funds as far as they will go, and put all extra cash toward new real-estate deals, not toward flashy office space and showy business cards. A bit of self-sacrifice is the name of the game. When the author purchased his first office building, for example, he selected a tiny utility closet in the basement as his personal office space. He could have taken the fanciest space available, but that wouldn’t have maximized his income. By choosing the least desirable spot, he profited from the building’s every square foot. The young investor was equally misguided in her plan to quit her job. The author, like most other successful investors, held onto his job until his real-estate business was firmly established. Indeed, for the first seven years of his real-estate career, he simultaneously worked as a teacher. He did this because, in his business’s early days, subtracting a personal salary from his earnings would have imperiled the entire enterprise. And this holds true for all young real-estate businesses. At first, you’ll probably struggle to keep the business afloat, let alone make a substantial profit from it. The author didn’t take any risks. Only when his business was bringing in $2 million every year did he finally quit his day job. There’s a myth surrounding real-estate investment. It goes something like this: once you buy a property, all you have to do is sit back, relax and watch the money pour in. This myth took shape over hundreds of years. For centuries, the nobility and landed gentry passed land from generation to generation, pocketing the money from tenants and employing people to manage their properties for them. More recently, scamsters promoting get-rich-quick schemes have perpetuated the myth that property is an investment that will generate a passive income. But here’s the thing: if you want to maximize revenue from your investment, you can’t afford to be passive. Property shouldn’t be treated as a mere asset; it should be handled like a business and managed accordingly.   So don’t make the mistake of employing an army of middlemen to handle things for you. Asset managers, portfolio managers and property managers all represent financial outlay, as does every contractor you employ. Hiring others to run your investment will only erode your income. You can avoid this revenue-devouring pitfall by managing everything yourself. Review and write leases yourself. Broker deals yourself. And personally take care of manual labor, such as snow removal and landscaping work. Cutting out the middlemen won’t only increase your revenue by decreasing your expenditure; it’ll also ensure that you are in charge of your own fate. In other words, you’ll both have more money, which you can then reinvest in your property, and you’ll have more control over your investment. Since how you handle your first commercial properties will play a pivotal role in your future success, self-management is truly in your best interest. As long as you’re determined to succeed and unwilling to compromise, you’ll be capable of feats that no property-management company could guarantee. After all, no management company, no matter how good, will ever have as much at stake as you do. Tenants are the bedrock of your real-estate business. After all, without the rent they provide, your investment would essentially be worthless. This raises two important questions: How much rent should you charge and how should you select your tenants? Well, first of all, don’t try to squeeze as much money as possible out of your tenants. It’s smarter to charge slightly below the market rate than to demand the highest rent you can.   Here’s why: overcharging often ushers in an array of undesirable consequences. For example, if potential tenants can’t afford the rent, they simply won’t rent from you – and if your building is standing vacant, you won’t be earning anything. Even if some people do choose to pay the high rent, they’ll be more likely to seek a cheaper space when their lease runs out, leaving you back where you started. Setting rent just below the market rate, however, will have the opposite effect. Your tenants will be eager to renew their leases, and their continued tenancy will reduce your marketing and turnover expenses. Furthermore, if you keep the overhead of your commercial tenants relatively low, their businesses will be likelier to flourish – which is good for you, because the more successful they are, the less likely they are to leave. Now that you’ve got a sense of how much (or should we say how little?) to charge, you should put some thought toward two more things: who you want to rent to and how compatible your new tenants are with your current ones. For instance, let’s say the majority of the people renting from you are senior citizens. They appreciate the peace and quiet of your property. Well, if an apartment opens up, you definitely shouldn’t rent it to a group of rowdy college students. Along those same lines, if one of your commercial tenants is running a toy shop, it’d certainly be unwise to rent the adjacent storefront to a marijuana dispensary. The idea is to create an environment that functions as a harmonious whole. Tenants should complement, not torment, each other. And your property should become the place they want to call home. Money doesn’t equal motivation. So before you buy your first property, take a look in the mirror and ask yourself a few questions. What will drive you to meet the highest standards? How will you stay motivated to outperform the competition? One thing is certain – succeeding in the real-estate market will demand a great deal of effort and time, as well as an unwillingness to quit. What will keep you going? Sure, money may seem like a sufficient motivator, and it’s certainly a major incentive for many investors. But the author firmly believes that, in the long term, cash will let you down. The promise of money, though enticing at first, will seem less and less grand as the years go by. And besides, the early days of running a real-estate business usually aren’t very profitable. So it’s doubly important to find a non-monetary purpose that underpins your real-estate business. Here are a few probing questions that may help you tease out your purpose: Why are you personally attracted to the real-estate industry? Do you like the idea of assisting others? Is it satisfying to think that you might be helping people find a place to work or live – that your property might improve their lives, and, by extension, the surrounding community? Now that you’ve identified the purpose behind your real-estate business, it’s time to organize your company values around it. As your real-estate business grows, your company values will become increasingly important. They’ll not only affect employee decisions and behavior; they’ll also determine your company culture and the way you do business. So it’s of the utmost importance that you establish and nurture them from day one. For instance, the author’s company values are excellence, creativity and integrity – and, when the going has gotten tough, these values kept him and his workers on track. Instead of getting bogged down or burned out, they continued to find their work meaningful and pleasurable, thanks in large part to the company’s solid set of values. The author was once tempted to sell all his properties. All of them were finally profitable, and the thought of cashing out had such appeal that he even discussed selling with an interested buyer. In the end, however, he decided against it. Why? Well, he knew that, in order to create truly lasting value, he had to stay in it for the long haul. It takes time to increase a property’s value, especially if the property itself is generating the funds being used for its improvement. Imagine you’ve decided to boost your property’s value by making its utilities more efficient. And the first steps you take are to insulate the water pipes, thus increasing their ability to retain heat, and install water reducers on the building’s showers, thus cutting water usage and costs. Now, this will save you money in the long term – fewer expenses equates to a higher net operating income – but, in the short term, it represents a financial loss, because of the expense associated with each improvement. So, if you really want your property to reach its full value potential, you’ve got to hold on to it for a while. “A while” means, as a general rule of thumb, about five years – though it could take even longer. Furthermore, if you want to convince a buyer that your property is worth a high price, you’ll have to provide proof that its financials are solid. This means showing them a track record of profitability that’s at least two years long. If you can’t do this, you’ll be unable to make a case for a high property valuation. If these arguments aren’t convincing enough, here’s another benefit of holding on to your property for a long time: it minimizes transaction costs. If you sell a property, you’ll be looking at transaction costs somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of the property’s selling price. And that’s not taking into consideration the large commission you’ll probably have to pay a real-estate broker. Also, any capital gains from the property sale are subject to taxes. Holding on to your properties will enable you to avoid all of these costs. So it’s best to sit tight and await the day when your business is so valuable that selling makes perfect financial sense. With the right amount of patience, as well as a do-it-yourself attitude and a positive vision for the future, the author succeeded in making a fortune through his real-estate investments. So, adopt the right attitude for success, roll up your sleeves and get started! The key message in these blinks: Investing in real estate can make you wealthy. But you’ve got to play it smart and follow certain principles. In order to succeed, you should treat your investment like a proper business rather than a passive investment. It’s also wise to hold on to your properties for as long as possible. Most importantly of all, always be on the lookout for ways to save money. The easiest way to do that is to personally take care of as much property-related business as you can.  Actionable advice: Add value to your property by rethinking how it’s used.  One of the best ways to increase the value of your property is to change how it’s used. For instance, a property can often be partly or entirely repurposed. Underutilized common space can be converted into leasable space. You could upgrade storage space to office space, or two one-bedroom flats could be created out of a three-bedroom flat. For instance, in 2017, the author purchased a failing hotel and successfully converted it into studio apartments. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Some say cryptoassets are the way of the future, and the time to get in is now. Others will tell you they’re a fad, and that investing in Bitcoin is just a fancy way of throwing your money out the window. So who’s right? Or maybe all this crypto-talk is Greek to you, and you’re still wondering what exactly a cryptoasset is? Either way, these blinks offer some answers, giving you a short history of Bitcoin and blockchain technology as well as some handy investment tips and cautionary advice. The future of finance is already here; the only question is how long it will take for the world to recognize it. These are certainly exciting times, but a word to the wise: the landscape of cryptoassets is changing rapidly, so be sure to take the author’s advice and do plenty of research yourself. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the mysterious origins of Bitcoin; what to watch for in a white paper; and what makes a wallet “hot.” Unless you’ve been living in a cave on an abandoned island, you’ve probably heard about Bitcoin by now. In the last few years, it’s been all over the news, as have a handful of other cryptoassets – an unprecedented digital asset class that presents some thrilling new opportunities, both for experienced and amateur investors. Here’s a narrower definition of a cryptoasset: a commodity consisting of software and an accompanying currency. OK, but what exactly determines a cryptoasset’s value? Well, the value of cryptoassets – just like the value of other commodities such as gold or oil – depends partly on market supply and demand. Unlike gold and oil, however, cryptoassets are intangible, and so it’s the value of the software (not of a physical resource) that goes up and down in tandem with the peaks and valleys of the market. Let’s take a look at Bitcoin to get a better idea of how this works. Bitcoin, like all cryptoassets, consists of software and an associated currency, “bitcoin” – and therefore, unlike other, non-cryptoassets, it doesn’t fall into a single asset class. Let’s contrast this with oil, which is classed as a consumable/transformable asset (or c/t asset) – an asset usually bought so that something else can be made from it. Well, the software component of Bitcoin works similarly as it can be used for a number of different purposes. Bitcoin, the currency, however, is similar to another asset; gold, which is classed as a store-of-value asset. Since gold is rare, beautiful and useful, people worldwide have agreed on its value. Cryptoassets function somewhat similarly – like gold, and unlike government-issued money, there is a finite amount of each cryptoasset’s currency. So plenty of people buy bitcoin without intention of trading it. Rather, they leave it alone and let it appreciate value over time, as one might do with gold or any other precious metal. Hence, the cryptocurrencies that succeed will be the ones that are both useful and work as a store of value. As mentioned at the beginning of the blink, cryptoassets are an asset class unto themselves, but the fact that they fit into multiple preexisting classes only makes them both that much more enticing – not to mention valuable – to today’s investors. Bitcoin, like all other cryptoassets, is supported by blockchain technology – a term that is more often bandied about than actually understood. So how do blockchains work? Well, a blockchain is basically a massive digital database that records how much of a particular cryptoasset is owned by whom. Unlike bank databases, however, or those of centralized governments – which typically oversee the transactions of a given population – blockchain databases are decentralized. They’re constantly updated and operated entirely by the millions of people who’re running the relevant software on their computers. Let’s say you decide to download Bitcoin’s software. What are the properties of the blockchain you’d be helping to support? First, it’s distributed – meaning, it’s public and any computer, anywhere, can access it. Second, it’s cryptographic – that is, all data is encrypted with an infallible computer-generated code. Third, it’s immutable: it’s impossible to delete anything from it since the blockchain database is continuously being synced with, and recorded on, a worldwide network of personal computers. Finally, it’s always growing. Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded and added to the blockchain database – and each addition forms a new “block.” The computers that record these transactions on the database are called miners, and whichever one adds the new block gets paid in bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, miners are in constant competition, trying to record new transactions faster than each other. Since the deletion of anything from a given blockchain requires the unanimous approval of everyone running that blockchain’s software, and since that software is often public, getting away with underhand dealings is much harder. Numbers don’t lie. And since a transaction will only go through once it’s been verified by every synced blockchain database, it’s almost impossible for a single person – or even a well-organized group of criminals – to cover up any foul play. Even if someone succeeded in illicitly transferring a bunch of bitcoin to his account, that success would be short-lived. The blockchain databases would soon fail to sync up, and his misdeed would be spotted. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptoasset, and its currency is worth the most because it was the first one on the market. But there are tons of other cryptoassets out there, and new ones are constantly being created. Bitcoin’s genesis is tinged with mystery. Bitcoin’s – and, by extension, the blockchain technology’s – inventor is said to be a man named Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Nakamoto’s identity has yet to be verified, and there are those who believe “him” to be a group of people. Adding an air of eeriness to these obscure origins, Bitcoin’s birthday is on Halloween: in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin entered the market on October 31, presenting an alternative to the financial system that had just failed. Writings credited to Nakamoto make clear that Bitcoin was intended to be decentralized (that is, under no single entity’s control) and that, instead of being based on trust, its functioning would rely on mathematical proof. After the 2008 financial crisis, a general atmosphere of anger and disillusionment gripped the world. Frustrated with the global financial system, people were enthusiastic about possible solutions – which is precisely what Bitcoin seemed to be. Thus, Bitcoin gained traction and, over the last decade, became what it is today. But the Bitcoin model isn’t the only way to do things. Other cryptoassets have forged their own paths, either serving different functions or using private blockchains. The most prominent example is Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which uses its blockchain solely for financial transactions, Ethereum uses its to distribute, and enable the collaborative creation of, open-source software. And its “native asset,” or currency, is called “ether.” The Ethereum blockchain, like Bitcoin’s, is public, however – which isn’t the case for all cryptoassets. Monero and Zcash, for example, both use private blockchains, which means that you’ve got to have special permission to access the blockchain. Generally, financial services have chosen to adopt private blockchains – Monero and Zcash are both currencies – because they both want to take advantage of blockchain technology’s efficiency and maintain privacy in their financial dealings. Have you ever considered putting money in the stock market? It’s scary – because, to the uninformed, and even to those in the know, it’s very hard to predict what will happen. One would think, therefore, that investing in cryptoassets, which are relatively young and volatile, would be extremely dicey. But it’s actually a pretty safe bet. Cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, and the blockchain technology they’re supported by, may completely transform the financial world. Just as email all but ousted snail mail, blockchain technology may topple traditional, centralized banking systems. If you missed out on the dot-com boom of the late nineties and early aughts – if you weren’t one of the people who invested in eBay or Google when they were still obscure startups – then blockchain technology might be your mulligan. As an asset, Bitcoin is still in its infancy. A single bitcoin may be pretty pricey today, but the author predicts a great deal of future price appreciation. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s volatility – that is, the fluctuations in its valuation – has diminished; it’s a stabler asset now, and though you probably won’t get the exponential returns of someone who bought ten-dollars worth of bitcoin back in 2010, you probably won’t face major losses, either. And Bitcoin should only become more popular. Currently, most mainstream businesses don’t accept bitcoins, making it inconvenient for users. But once Bitcoin gains more traction and usability increases, demand will begin to rise – and Bitcoin’s price will go up, too. In the meantime, younger cryptoassets, such as Ethereum, continue to be volatile, a state in which they’ll remain until their undergirding value and support systems prove reliable. So beware: before you make an investment, familiarize yourself with the risks. Otherwise, you won’t be taking advantage of an opportunity; you’ll simply be gambling with your money. Hold your horses! Before you withdraw your life savings and invest it all in cryptoassets, let’s take a detailed look at some of the dangers that go hand in hand with investment. Danger number one: the speculation of crowds problem. In less technical language, it’s the danger of monkey see, monkey do. This danger arises when tons of amateur speculators begin investing because they see other people doing it. None of them really knows much about the actual worth of the asset they’re investing in or has considered the rationality of their investment. They’re simply hopping on the bandwagon. This usually happens when professional speculators, who, unlike investors, aren’t interested in the true merit of a particular asset, begin buying it up. These people are simply there to make a profit, and so they try to buy when prices are low and sell when prices are high. Now, if a lot of speculators begin buying up a single cryptoasset, causing the price to rise, then other, less experienced speculators might get inspired to buy, too. If the cryptoasset then somehow fails or proves to be flawed, or if the professional speculators suddenly sell, these amateur speculators stand to lose a great deal of money. Danger number two might be referred to as the “this time it’s different” mentality. Some people will say that markets learn from their mistakes, and so, this time, there will be greater stability. Some people will say that cryptoassets are unlike anything that’s ever been seen before, and so, this time, the old rules don’t apply. On one level, these people would be right – cryptoassets are different. But that’s no reason to let common sense go by the board. Sure, it’s not easy to put a value on a cryptoasset. They’re simply too new and too unlike traditional assets. But, as will soon be revealed, there are some pretty reliable methods for determining any cryptoasset’s underlying value. So just remember: informed investors are well aware of the potentially massive benefits – both financial and otherwise – that cryptoassets have to offer. But they’re equally aware of the potential dangers of investing. Now that you’re familiar with the dangers of investing let’s explore some of the finer points of investment. When building your investment portfolio, there are two things that should be at the forefront of your mind: correlation and diversification. Investments should work together, with each asset complementing all the others. Now, you probably won’t be surprised to learn that different assets react to the market in different ways. So, for instance, stocks don’t respond to the economy in the same way as bonds. When the economy is doing well, stock prices rise and bond prices drop. Why? Well, in a booming economy, investors want to put their money to use on the stock market, not tuck it away in bonds, which are typically more secure. The degree to which any asset’s response to the market differs from that of any other asset can be described in terms of correlation. For instance, stocks and bonds have negative correlation – that is, they respond to the economic events in opposite ways. This is desirable, but not ideal. The best kind of correlation is zero correlation, when a particular kind of economic event affects one asset but none of the others, and vice versa. And this is where diversification comes in. For instance, having a portfolio made up of both stocks and bonds is an example of diversification, and it’s a wise move, since you’ll be prepared to weather both booms and busts. But there’s one more kind of correlation – positive correlation, which, in down-home terms, is the same as putting all your eggs in one basket. It’s when the same economic event affects all your assets in the same way. With cryptoassets, it’s much easier to avoid positive correlation and overall risk because it’s easier to diversify.   For instance, let’s say you’ve already got a stocks-and-bonds portfolio. You could increase diversification by adding cryptoassets, thereby protecting yourself against traditional market failures, which will probably have little effect on your cryptoassets. Either there will be no effect, because most cryptoassets are zero correlated with traditional markets, or your cryptoassets may increase in value, because people might get frustrated with the stock market and turn to cryptocurrencies. Either way, you win. Maybe you’re feeling ready to buy your first cryptoassets. It seems like the way of the future, and you have a clear enough idea of how to avoid the pitfalls of investment. Well, to buy your first cryptoassets, you’ll have to get an account on an exchange site such as Bitstamp or GDAX. At the moment, ether and bitcoin can be bought with fiat currency – that is, money with a government-assigned value, such as euros or dollars – or with (some) other cryptocurrencies. Most cryptocurrencies can’t be bought with fiat currency, because exchanges don’t want cryptocurrencies to become widely available before their stability is thoroughly established. But once you’ve bought some ether or bitcoin, you can use them to purchase any other cryptoasset. Part of what makes cryptocurrencies so useful is how quickly they can be transferred. Unlike fiat currency, which must be transferred from one bank to another, cryptocurrency is a money-over-internet-protocol (MoIP) utility and can, therefore, be sent to another computer instantly. Before you start trading, though, you should get a sense of the strength of the currency you want to buy. One way to do this is to look at the cryptoasset’s trading pair diversity, which is measured by how many fiat currencies and/or cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase that cryptoasset. The more pairs a cryptoasset has, the more robust and reliable it is – especially when it’s paired with fiat currency. To see which cryptoassets are paired with which fiat and/or cryptocurrencies, check out the website CryptoCompare. Be smart about your investment. Don’t rush in because everyone is saying, “Buy! Buy! Buy!” Take a moment, do some research and only part with your money once you’ve familiarized yourself with the market. Let’s imagine you did it – you took the plunge and bought your first cryptoasset. That’s very exciting, but what now? Where does it get stored and how do you access it? Well, that’s partially up to you. Each cryptoasset has a private key that enables you to transfer it to other people who possess their own private keys, so all that storage really involves is keeping this key safe. There are two ways to do this – one will make your cryptoasset more accessible but keep it less safe; the other will keep it safer but make it less accessible. Option number one is called a hot wallet. “Hot,” in this context, means connected to the internet. So your private key would be stored in the cloud, for example, or on a device with internet access. Option number two is cold storage, which just means storing your private key offline. You might use a pin-protected hard drive, for instance, or write down your private key on a piece of paper and store it in a fireproof safe. Both options come with pluses and minuses. If you opt for cold storage, then no one can access your assets without physically stealing your cold-storage device. This is great, because you don’t have to worry about hackers, but it makes it hard for you to quickly access your assets whenever, and from wherever, you want. But if you opt for a hot wallet, you make yourself vulnerable to hackers and cybercrime. The assets you trade on a particular exchange platform can usually be stored on that platform as well, and this benefits you because the storage is usually part hot wallet, part cold storage, with a designated third party protecting your private key. A popular storage option is Coinbase. You can choose between hot wallets and third-party-protected cold storage. But be warned: not all platforms have totally safe storage systems. Look out for the exchanges that tend to store more assets in hot wallets – these are the most likely to get hacked. Let’s imagine you’ve bought a few cryptoassets by now, but you’re still not sure how to calculate the risk that each new investment poses. If you truly want to be an innovative investor, you’ve got to do more than glance at a cryptoasset’s valuation; you must consider its white paper and decentralization edge as well. A cryptoasset’s white paper is the document that explains what it does. It should clearly lay out how it corrects problems facing other cryptoassets and describe, in detail, both how it compares to the competition and how it functions. White papers should be specific, typo-free and easy to understand. Vagueness, spelling errors and inscrutability are all red flags. A cryptoasset’s decentralization edge is basically its usefulness as a decentralized service. Take Swarm City, for example. This app runs on Ethereum and seeks to provide anyone with a chance to set up their own businesses by enabling them to pay and be paid peer to peer, without middle-man companies such as Airbnb and Uber taking a cut. There are three more things an innovative investor will consider: community, developers and issuance model. A trustworthy cryptoasset will be situated within a trusted community and backed by competent developers. In other words, the people working on it should be experienced, and the asset’s community members should be engaged, either investing in the asset or working as miners. Finally, a solid cryptoasset should have a fair issuance model. Issuance models explain native-asset distribution – that is, how much of the currency will be distributed in total – as well as how many miners and developers there will be and how much of the currency will be given to them. Keep a sharp eye out for issuance models that unduly reward miners and developers, thus giving them concentrated power over the asset. Such models are both unfair and dangerous, since other investors will be at the mercy of the whims and poor judgment of the miners/developers. Furthermore, make sure that the initial supply of the cryptoasset isn’t too high. If it is, its value will probably stay low due to market oversaturation. That’s about it. The rest – and how you choose to invest – is up to you! The key message in this book: Cryptoassets present a huge investment opportunity – the kind that’s rarely available to novice investors. But, before you jump into the deep end, you absolutely must familiarize yourself with the market and what it means to invest in cryptoassets. Read white papers and pay attention to decentralization edges; keep an eye on trading pair diversities and store your cryptoassets securely. And remember: you might lose your money. If you know the risks and do the research, cryptoassets can prove a great investment. Actionable advice: Do your homework! Before investing, you should do extensive research on new and existing assets. Put on your reading glasses and turn to the trusted sources. Bitcoinmagazine.com offers in-depth articles and is a highly regarded publication, while Coindesk.com is a great source for the latest news. If you can’t find much online information about a particular cryptoasset, steer clear of it.

If you’ve ever been on a call with a bank or telecom provider after they had implemented a round of cuts and outsourcing, you may well have spent hours on hold, only to finally speak with a service employee who has no idea how to help you. We’re all justifiably skeptical of companies who cut costs, but decreasing expenses and streamlining operations doesn’t have to mean lower quality products or services.  Every business, regardless of its size or customer base, can cut costs in an efficient manner – a way that leads to higher revenues and, crucially, excellent service. These blinks will show you exactly when and where to cut costs, providing an essential introduction to efficient operations for any business. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to oil the wheels of your capital cycle; just how much space every employee needs; and why there’s no use crying over sunk costs. What’s the best way to make maximum profits? The simplest answer is to boost revenue, which of course helps if you can make it happen. But there’s a better and more easily controlled method that’s all about managing expenses. It’s called costs leadership, and here’s how it works: For starters, you’ll need to focus on the two main types of costs: fixed and variable. Fixed costs are independent of the level of a company’s production, and include computers, desks, telephones and other equipment. But the term can also refer to less tangible costs, like rent or insurance. In fact, labor is often considered a fixed cost since it takes time and money to hire employees. Variable costs are dependent on the level of production, meaning that the more you consume, the more you pay. Examples of variable costs are raw materials, packaging and storage.  Now that you know the two main types of costs, you can start learning why intelligently managing them will produce lower-cost products, and therefore higher revenues, all while maintaining the same standards of quality. You could reduce costs by making sweeping cuts, but this will likely lower the quality of the goods or services you provide. For example, if you decide to save money by cutting your customer support team, you’re likely to be facing some very unhappy customers in the near future.  However, wisely cutting needless costs will both increase revenue and maintain quality. For instance, IKEA’s founder Ingvar Kamprad built his 235-store empire through simple cost-cutting mechanisms that left quality intact. One strategy was to sell unassembled furniture, which takes up less space and requires less time to manufacture. But how can you intelligently cut costs? Let’s look deeper at some specific strategies to reduce expenses while maintaining quality.  When entrepreneurs found a new business, they’re often prone to overexcitement and might end up spending money they don’t have. While this mistake is a common one, it can seriously cripple a business before it even gets off the ground.  So, it’s key to understand cost management from the start, and a good place to begin is with property.  Space is a major expense and a prime target for cost trimming. To get a sense of how much space is enough, keep in mind that the standard is eleven cubic meters per worker. If you’ve got more room than this, you’re likely spending too much money on it.  Another great way to cut space costs is through hotdesking, a means to maximize workstations by eliminating individual desks and having employees use whichever one is available. For instance, Stocks, a UK company that manufactures sewing machines, has a sales team of ten people working in a space designed for six. However, the office runs smoothly because the employees spend 60 percent of their time at outside appointments.  Alright, now that you’ve maximized your space, it’s time to cut other non-essential costs, and that means outsourcing – in other words, contracting out unessential tasks to other companies.  Any activity that’s not central to your business should be tested: if it costs more for you to do it internally than externally, it should be outsourced to someone else that can do it for cheaper.  While outsourcing work that’s already being done in-house can be more complicated because capital investments have already been made, it’s essential to do it nonetheless.  Say you realize you need to outsource your advertising, but just invested in new marketing design software. Although it may be difficult, it’s important to accept your sunk costs; the money you spent on the software is already gone, but you don’t have to keep wasting money by paying advertising staff. Do you know what the capital cycle is? Well, it’s essential knowledge for any company owner, because every business abides by it.  Here’s how it works: You begin with cash in hand, either your own or someone else’s. This money is then used to purchase capital assets and materials that the employees’ work transforms into finished products for sale. You pay your suppliers, are paid by your customers and hopefully have some money left over to repeat.  Why is this central to cost reduction? Because low costs require a rapid capital cycle and a focus on the old adage that time is money. For instance, the more money tied up in working capital like stock, the greater the costs going towards things like interest and storage. It’s therefore essential to limit the amount of time that you have stock in your possession.  One way to accomplish this is through a limited inventory. Take Wal-Mart, whose stock storage is two-and-a-half times less than the industry average, ensuring an efficient cycle.  But negotiations with customers and suppliers can also cut the cost of capital assets. For example, if you sell goods and services on credit, and it takes you 90 days to collect payment from a customer, you’re essentially losing out on any interest that the money would accrue. A better strategy is to set shorter payment periods while disciplining late payers with fines and threats of legal action.  On the other side of the coin, if your suppliers offer you credit, it might be tempting to take it. However, depending on the situation, it could make good business sense to pay up front in exchange for a lower total cost. And, of course, it’s essential to avoid paying late, because doing so will give you a bad name in the industry. Increased productivity is a great way to cut variable costs, but that means convincing your employees to get more done – and we all know this is no easy task. Luckily there’s a great strategy for boosting productivity, and it all relies on motivating your staff through your profit margins instead of their turnover; this gets you on the same side as your workers while increasing your own profits.  In most companies, the sales team is rewarded for sales they make. This structure causes employees to fixate on cutting deals and costs are often left unchained. A better strategy is to link commissions to company profits, thereby focusing your salesforce on saving money and improving the company’s bottom line.  For instance, Atrium, a London-based lighting company, more than doubled its profits by switching to a rewards system tied to gross profit. Their salespeople stopped slashing prices, and instead of coasting on an “anything to please the client” mentality, they invested in cutting extraneous costs and improving efficiency. But money isn’t enough. While a good salary is a major aspect of workplace satisfaction, a fat paycheck alone won’t guarantee that your employees work at optimum efficiency. In fact, job satisfaction is also the result of various cashless motivators, like the feeling of achievement you want your cost-cutting workers to feel.  But how can you accomplish this? One way is by simply taking note of the effort your employees are making. In fact, a mere “thank you” e-mail or staff dinner party following a major project can go a long way toward motivating your team without breaking the bank! Every growing business is sure to face the challenge of financing costs, and it’s essential to bring these under control before they start eating into your profits. Financing costs – that is, the cost of raising money – arise due to interest and other fees. It’s important to identify ways to actually obtain money at little or no cost. One strategy is to go to government agencies or certain businesses, like banks and newspapers, that might have an interest in particular business activities taking place in a specific area; this could lead them to contribute money or offer benefits to your company.  For instance, every year there are thousands of awards given out around the world to new or small businesses. The majority of these are based around a business plan like the HSBC’s Start-up Awards which grants up to £25,000. Another approach is to ask family and friends for money. This technique is beneficial because you avoid conforming to formalized and time-consuming procedures while also being afforded more flexible terms. However, it’s essential that you explain any and all risks to such funders because the last thing you want is for a helpful friend or family member to suffer economic hardship due to your failed financial commitments.  The third and final strategy is to negotiate with banks for more favorable terms. But to do so you need both the necessary know-how and a business plan. In the end, banks are subject to the same macroeconomic factors and pressure to turn a profit as you are, so it’s wise to seek out a bank that’s in good financial condition, as they’ll be able to offer you a better rate.  One way to do so is by reading the financial section of the newspaper and keeping in mind that the interest rates tend to be from three percent to nine percent. Naturally you should be shooting for the lower end of the range and should shop around until you get there. If catastrophe strikes your company, cutting costs is likely the first measure you’ll take. Sometimes this can mean making difficult decisions to keep your business afloat, and we all know that extreme times can call for extreme measures. One such strategy is trading debt for equity, because offloading debt can sometimes be worth an major chunk of your company. For instance, the luggage company Samsonite traded a whopping 60 percent of its shares to CVC Capital Partners, one of Europe’s largest private equity groups, in exchange for the payment of a debt worth nearly $175 million.  Another extreme measure is to relocate your business to a new country to save on taxes. For example, certain countries have very low business tax rates, like the Maldives with a tax rate of nine percent and the United Arab Emirates with one of 15 percent. Compare that to countries with some of the highest rates, like Italy where the business tax rate is 76 percent or India where it’s 86 percent.  But no matter what action you take in a crisis, firing your employees is never the smartest option; businesses with insecure staff fare far worse.  Why? Well, being fired is the main source of fear for any employee, affecting both their productivity and the quality of their work. In fact, firing people can even cause valuable employees to look for ways out of a company they view as a sinking ship. However, employees are also willing to make sacrifices that save the company money, if doing so will guarantee them a job. For instance, in June 2009, British Airways convinced 6,940 employees to take voluntary unpaid leave – a move that saved the company $16.7 million as well as the long-term jobs of those workers.  And, of course, there’s the measure of last resort: cut and run. After all, failure is just a fact of business, and in the United Kingdom alone, 400,000 businesses close their doors every year! So remember, getting out of an unprofitable business, if done well, can leave you in better shape to start another.  The key message in this book: Some people view cost-cutting as an emergency measure, but a long-term expense-reduction strategy is actually essential to boosting the profit margins of any company. Managing your costs effectively will also help you build a business that is prepared to face any crisis or difficult situation.  Actionable advice: Apply zero-base budgets. Generally the first thing a company does when drafting its annual budget is determine how much money each department will need for the year. So, if you spent $60,000 on marketing last year to produce $4 million in sales, it might seem logical to spend $90,000 this year for a sales target of $6 million.  However, zero-base budgeting doesn’t assume that last year’s money was spent intelligently and efficiently. Rather, it assumes that every year, each department of your company should start from scratch and present arguments for every dime you allocate.

We can’t live without it yet can’t seem to get any of it into our savings accounts either. Don’t worry, this isn’t a unique problem – there are many reasons why people are lousy at spending money wisely and putting it away for the future. As you’ll learn in the blinks ahead, the reason most of us struggle with money boils down to fundamental human characteristics that are difficult to avoid and the unusual concept of money itself. So don’t be too hard on yourself if you have the habit of making irrational decisions when it comes to money. We’re often driven by emotions rather than common sense, but that doesn’t mean we can’t make an effort to understand our flaws and take measures to combat them. In these blinks you’ll find out how being less misleading about their prices was a bad idea for JCPenney; the difference between mental and emotional accounting; and what a Ulysses contract is and how it can help you save money. Money is an abstract concept. What a piece of paper with some writing on it can buy you today could very well change tomorrow. Even though its value may fluctuate, there’s no doubt that you need money for just about everything it takes to get by in day-to-day life. While everyone knows money is important, that doesn’t stop us from routinely making bad spending decisions. So what gives? One reason is that when we get an urge to buy something, we rarely stop to think about what else we could be spending that money on. In economics, all the other things we could buy are known as opportunity costs, and our failure to consider these alternatives is one of the biggest financial mistakes we make. A few years ago, Ariely, one of the authors, talked to customers at a Toyota dealership and asked them what purchases they were giving up to buy a new car. What he mostly got back in return were confused looks. After explaining his question further, a lot of people said they were giving up the chance to buy a different car. Only a few made the connection that they were sacrificing opportunities such as taking vacations or treating themselves to meals in expensive restaurants. Ariely realized that for most people, considering alternatives just didn’t come naturally. Another reason behind irrational spending is an overreliance on value cues. These are external hints and signs suggesting an item’s real value. If we behaved in a perfectly rational manner, we’d determine an item’s value through opportunity costs by weighing up one purchase against another. Instead, we go the less rational route, relying on value cues and paying attention to signs that say something is “a bargain” or “a limited-time offer.” At car dealerships, the language of the salespeople is filled with these sorts of value cues, designed to get customers to buy now or miss out on a “spectacular opportunity.” While there are helpful value cues that can give you a better sense of what something’s worth, they’re often misleading, as companies routinely use deceptive practices to skew your sense of value and take your money. Think of all the different cars and houses you pass by every day: Do you know how much they cost? In many cases, value is difficult to determine simply by looking at something. Take a pair of shoes. To determine their value would require looking at many different factors, like the cost of the materials, labor, shipping costs etc. Therefore, in order to come to a conclusion, we tend to apply mental shortcuts, such as comparing one item or price to another. Comparison shopping can help us determine a relative value between similar things, but this too can be misleading. In 2012, the routine practice at popular department store chain JCPenney was to mark up the regular prices, then have coupons, discounts and sales to bring them back down to actual retail value. As a result, customers used the coupons and sales as value cues to think they were getting a special bargain. That year, Ron Johnson took over as CEO. Johnson didn’t like the misleading practice, deciding that the regular prices should be “fair and square.” He got rid of all the discounts and lowered prices to their normal retail value. Customers were not happy. After just one year of the changes, JCPenney lost $985 million and Johnson was fired. For customers, the sales and coupons were important value cues that made them feel like they were getting bargains, even if they weren’t. Without these cues, there was no sense of getting a good deal. But often we don’t need companies to deceive us with misleading sales – we’re pretty good at deceiving ourselves. In his book Mindless Eating, author Brian Wansink describes an experiment which shows how people’s appetites can have little to do with how hungry they really are. Wansink attached bowls to a table in a way that allowed him to add more soup to the bowls without participants realizing, and asked his unsuspecting test subjects to eat until they were no longer hungry. Some did just that and stopped after eating a certain amount, but others just kept on eating and eating. The experiment showed that, as long as there was food in the bowl, some participants would continue to insist they were hungry. They needed to see that empty bowl before they could decide that they were no longer hungry. Research shows that we rely on cues like this to make all kinds of decisions. Here are two interesting “what if” scenarios: What if you paid $100 for a concert ticket, but as you’re riding in a car on the way to the show, the ticket flies out the window and you lose it? If you could buy a new ticket for the same price, would you do it? Conversely, what if you lost a hundred-dollar bill out the window on your way to buy the ticket? Would you take out another $100 and still buy a ticket? We weigh up these kinds of options using mental accounting. It’s a little different for each of us as we have our own categories with their own subjective values. You may value a concert ticket worth $100 differently to a hundred-dollar bill that you’ve yet to spend. The money toward the concert ticket might be in the “already spent” category, while the bill was lost before it got assigned a category, so it can feel like it’s still waiting to be spent. This is why most people say they wouldn’t buy a new ticket but would take out more money if they hadn’t bought one yet. We can see that mental accounting can be irrational, but it can also serve a purpose. Strictly speaking, a rational mind wouldn’t treat these two scenarios differently, since they’re both costing you the same amount of money. But the world is filled with countless options on how to spend money, and so mental accounting can be a valuable time-saving tool, even if it isn’t perfect. If you want to buy a cup of coffee, you wouldn’t look at all the prices, go through all the opportunity costs, and consider every possible option for using that money, even if it might be the most rational thing to do. Instead, it’s useful to use the shortcut of mental accounting, take the money out of your “coffee account” and get on with your day. There’s another type of accounting known as emotional accounting, and this has its fair share of dangers as well. When you attach emotions to money, it can easily influence your spending decisions. For instance, if you got some money from a relative you don’t like, you might try to wash away the negative associations by donating some of it to charity – and then spend the rest frivolously once you felt better about it. In the end, if you get some extra cash, the most sensible things to do is not let your emotions get in the way and just save it. If you’ve ever tried feeding a toddler, you’ll know that language can make things a whole lot easier. Even the pickiest eater can’t resist a spoonful of mashed carrots once you tell them it’s an airplane coming in for landing. Like with the toddler in the highchair, language shapes how we perceive and experience the world around us. How would you feel, for example, about having to live with twenty percent less of your current salary? Now, what do you think about living off of 80 percent of your current salary? What’s the difference? There isn’t one, and yet, as a 1988 study in the Journal of Consumer Research showed, people are far less comfortable with the idea of spending their retirement on 20 percent less of their income than with spending it on 80 percent of their current income. The restaurant industry is very aware of how language can make their food and beverages seem more precious. When a waiter uses words like “complex and earthy notes of oak and tobacco,” they know that customers will be willing to pay $80 for a bottle of wine that they wouldn’t buy at their local grocery store for $30. The authors refer to this language as our consumption vocabulary, which is often linked in our mind to a product’s superior value, such as a wine’s “bouquet” or a quilt’s “sashing.” The word “artisan” has this effect as well – just because a fast-food chain calls their bread “artisan,” it doesn’t mean you should automatically think it’s worth more money. Another way we can add value is through the rituals we create around a product, which tend to enhance our experiences. This is another reason why a glass of wine can seem so precious; as we ritualize the pouring, the swirling, the smelling and, finally, the tasting. Each step gives the experience extra significance. Studies show that when we create rituals around consumption, we perceive the objects related to that consumption to have greater value. In 2013, researchers from the University of Minnesota and Harvard Business School asked participants to either eat a chocolate bar quickly or slowly unwrap and break it into pieces before eating. As you might guess, those who took the slow route were willing to pay more for the chocolate. It’s natural for people to be irrational about money – it’s why everyone’s so eager to find clever ways of budgeting. But all the tips and tricks in the world won’t work if you don’t have self-control. Without it, you’re bound to make bad decisions. One of the best ways to increase your self-control is to start emotionally connecting yourself to the future. You probably know that your future self would be better off if you didn’t sit in front of the TV tonight and eat a pint of ice cream. But that future person usually seems so remote and far away that you give in to temptation anyway. To help resist that temptation, UCLA’s Hal Hershfield suggests going a step further – creating an emotional connection by imagining a conversation or writing a letter to your future self. You can also picture “future-you” appreciating the benefits of your good decision – kicking back and enjoying retirement in comfort thanks to the early investments you’re making today. It also helps to think in terms of fixed dates. According to a 2005 study published in Management Science, we’re more likely to be diligent about putting aside money if we set an exact retirement date. So rather than telling yourself, “this will come in handy in 30 years,” think, “August 23, 2048.” Another way to boost your self-control is to set up Ulysses contracts. As legend has it, in order to get past the Sirens and their alluring-but-deadly songs, famed Greek hero Ulysses had his crew tie him to the mast of his ship. A Ulysses contract is a way to remove temptation by setting up a process or structure whereby a bad decision isn’t even an option. If you’re lousy with credit cards, a good Ulysses contract would be to only use prepaid debit cards. Or, if you’re spending money that should be going toward your savings, reduce the temptation by setting up an automatic deposit that takes a certain amount directly from each paycheck. In 2010, a study published in World Development showed that people who set up automated savings ended up saving 81 percent more in just twelve months! Now that you have a better understanding of why we’re so bad with money, it’s time to stop making excuses and start being more sensible. The key message in these blinks: Whether it’s basic needs like food and shelter, or luxuries like sports cars and exotic vacations, it all takes money, and it can be difficult to achieve anything if you’re constantly making bad decisions. Figuring out how to spend money wisely doesn’t come naturally, and unfortunately, money doesn’t come with an instruction manual. Instead, we’re constantly grappling with misleading value cues and struggling to understand how much things are really worth. But rather than fight against human nature, we can gain some stability by acknowledging our shortcomings and setting up systems that keep us away from our worst instincts. Actionable advice: Replace your complex budget with a simple one. An unhelpful budget can be like a bad diet that makes you obsessively measure and count every calorie. When your budget is too complicated and specific, you’ll just end up quitting in frustration. Instead, figure out how much you can comfortably spend on non-essential items and create a broad category for this called “discretionary spending.” Every week, put that amount on a prepaid debit card and you can stop worrying about overspending.

As a result of this influence, the author became a financial coach and started seeing things in a whole new light. He got out of debt and started building real, lasting wealth. These blinks are inspired by his findings on millionaires – who they are, what they believe and, most importantly, what behaviors brought them to success. They are based on a study by the author and his research team, the largest and most complete ever to be conducted on millionaires. They got in touch with more than 10,000 American millionaires to ask about their habits, their beliefs and their strategies. There are a lot of lies out there about millionaires. It’s time to set things straight, and this is what these blinks aim to do. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should never pay for a brand-name education; the secret to Michael Phelps’ Olympic success; and how to program your financial GPS. There’s a myth out there that the American dream is dead. Some even say the average American can’t get ahead these days. But this isn’t true. It’s a harmful lie that stops people from believing they can achieve their dreams. Hogan has experienced this firsthand. As a black man raised by a single parent in Kentucky, the idea of becoming a millionaire once seemed as far away to him as the stars. But he found that as long as you have an unshakeable belief that you can become a millionaire, then you can. You might encounter people who try to convince you that you won’t make it. But don’t worry – there’s a simple trick that makes these people disappear: prove them wrong. British distance runner Roger Bannister is a great example of this. In his time, the consensus was that a human being simply couldn’t run a mile in under four minutes. There were even people who thought that the strain would make a runner’s heart explode! But Bannister proved them wrong on May 6, 1954, when he ran a mile in three minutes and 59 seconds. And once Roger Bannister had shown that a sub-four-minute mile was possible, other people began to embrace the idea that they could run one too. Six weeks later, someone else even did it faster than Bannister had! Becoming a millionaire is similar. If you look around, you’ll see that others have done it, and it’s possible for you as well. After all, as CNBC Money reported in 2017, there are almost eleven million millionaires in America today! And once you add yourself to that number, don't be ashamed. Millionaires know that they’re winning financially because of hard work, and they’re proud of it. In Hogan’s study, this was made crystal clear. Millionaires believe that winning is always a good thing, not something to be ashamed of. That doesn’t mean that millionaires win every time they try something. It just means that they don’t get stopped by setbacks – they use them as motivation for their next big win! Now, let’s get motivated by doing away with some myths about who millionaires are and what they’re like in the following blinks. We’ve all heard someone say, “I bet that guy’s never done a day of work in his life.” For some reason, people like to assume that wealthy people must have been either incredibly lucky or born with a silver spoon in their mouths to get where they are. But guess what? Most millionaires don’t inherit their money. In fact, 79 percent of those the author interviewed received no inheritance whatsoever. It was hard work, sacrifice and sticking to a plan that got them where they are. Take Thomas, for example. He grew up poor, in a home riddled with alcoholism and dysfunction. Both his parents died young, and by the time he was ready to go to college, he knew that there were two things he wanted to avoid in his life – alcohol and poverty. Thomas got his PhD, but he didn’t jump into a flashy, high-paying job. Instead, he taught math for 37 years. By the time he retired, his net worth was $2.6 million. Thomas became a millionaire on his own steam – he didn't have the luck to inherit a fortune. He saved money steadily by avoiding debt, paying in cash, working extra when possible and investing wisely. People often think when someone's racked up a million or more, luck must have played a role. In reality, they just can't see the hard work behind the accomplishment. Consider the case of swimmer Michael Phelps. He’s the most successful Olympian in history and gifted with a body that’s absolutely perfect for swimming. A lot of people write his success off to luck and good genes. At his peak, though, Phelps was training for up to six hours a day, with just one day off per week. He swam almost fifty miles weekly in addition to serious weight lifting. He knew that all those genetic advantages wouldn’t amount to anything without hard work to back them up. Millionaires aren’t so different. And by assuming that a millionaire’s success is entirely based on luck, you’ll stop yourself from ever becoming one. In reality, there's enough opportunity out there for everyone – luck or no luck, inheritance or none. But you have to believe it. Every single one of the millionaires Hogan has ever spoken with certainly does. They see that opportunities are out there for them, and they have the wisdom to pick the right ones, as we’ll see in the next blink. When you think of a wealthy person, you may think of a flashy Wall Street trader making audacious deals that turn her into a millionaire overnight. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but real life isn’t like that. The idea that wealthy people make risky investments is just a myth. For example, not one of the millionaires in the author’s study mentioned investing in single stocks, and it’s clear to see why – the risk is just too great. When you buy a single stock, you’re putting all of your eggs in one basket. If that stock fails, you can kiss your hard-earned money goodbye. Then there are cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and the like get a lot of press they days. They’re hot, new and they have the potential to make people wildly rich. But cryptocurrencies are literally made-up currency. They’re untested, completely unregulated and no one is accountable for them. They’re 100% risky – the kind of thing most millionaires avoid like the plague. What about the other end of the spectrum? Well, there are low-risk investments like certificates of deposit and bonds. They’re generally very safe bets, but they also tend to be pretty low-reward as a result. Most millionaires don’t buy these – they avoid both the high- and low-risk extremes. In fact, 79 percent of millionaires say that their paths to wealth was very predictable – an employer-sponsored retirement plan. And what did they invest in most often through those plans? Growth stock mutual funds, which balance a reasonable, diversified risk with a good potential for growth. Which brings us to another myth – that millionaires are all about getting rich quick. The truth is, millionaires are in it for the long haul; 95 percent of millionaires took more than ten years to get to where they are today. Most hadn’t earned their first million until they were 49. The whole notion of getting rich quick is just a fantasy, one that takes people’s focus away from proven methods of wealth creation. Even Hogan remembers getting seduced by the promise of quick wealth back in the 1990s. Convinced by a friend’s impressive fast returns, he sunk his money into a single stock – AOL. He soon found out just how risky this was, ending up $25,000 poorer before he finally came to his senses and cut his losses. To get into the millionaire club, you need a prestigious education and a high-status job, right? Well, there’s a kernel of truth in that. But only a kernel. It’s definitely true that most millionaires have a college education. 88 percent of the millionaires in the author’s study have a bachelor’s degree, while a further survey shows that only 33 percent of the general population does. By every measure, a college education is a valuable thing – according to Georgetown University, those with a bachelor’s degree make 74 percent more over the course of their lives than people who only have a high school diploma. But that doesn’t mean that education needs to be a brand-name one. Ask the millionaires – 62 percent of them got their degrees from a public state school. There’s nothing wrong with private schools, of course. They can be a good option for people who can afford them. But a year at the average private school ends up costing about $45,370 in total, according to CNN Money. State schools, on the other hand, are about $20,090. That means that you end up paying twice as much to go to a brand-name school for the same degree. What’s more, many people turn to student loans so that they can attend a private school, one of the worst mistakes you can possibly make. This can’t be overstated – stay away from student loans! They can ruin your life, taking away your ability to save and build interest in those crucial early years of your career. 68 percent of millionaires didn’t take out a penny in student loans, whereas 49 percent of the general population does. Millionaires understood the importance of staying debt-free in their college years so they can start saving money at the start of their careers. These careers, by the way, do not necessarily involve high-paying jobs. That’s another myth about millionaires. In fact, the household income of 30 percent of them has never reached six figures per year. And only about a third of them have made $100,000 a year on average. So, what is it that millionaires do? The top three professions are engineer, accountant and teacher. It turns out that most millionaires are normal people with normal jobs. What sets them apart is their behavior, not their yearly salaries. It seems like the US is filled with crises these days. From the financial crisis to the opioid epidemic, they’re everywhere you look. But no one is talking about the crisis of responsibility that’s plaguing the US today. The sad truth is, most people just don’t take responsibility for managing their finances. Take retirement savings, for example. Hogan’s research team found that while 56 percent of Americans were worried about retirement, few people were actually preparing for it. Half of the baby boomers polled didn’t even have $10,000 saved. And 80 percent of millennials wished they were investing more toward retirement and building a nest egg – but they weren’t actually doing it. So, what’s stopping them? After all, they’re responsible for investing their money. No one else can do it for them. Millionaires understand this. They understand that they are responsible for what happens to them – 97 percent, in fact, say that they alone are in charge of their destinies. They also know that once you’ve taken responsibility for your finances, you can really start your journey toward becoming a millionaire. Just like figuring out a trip on GPS, you start with where you are and where you want to go. Financially, where you are is determined by your net worth. That’s simply everything you own, minus your debts. You need to calculate it precisely before you can have any idea of how you’re doing. Try using a net worth calculator online – there’s even one on the author’s website. Once you have a number in hand, you’ve got that little dot on the map that tells you exactly where you are. Once you know where you are, it’s time to figure out where you want to go. Ask yourself – and your spouse, if you’re married - what exactly you’d like retirement to look like. Where do you want to live? What kind of car do you want to drive? Try to paint a crystal-clear picture. Then it’s time to get down to brass tacks. How much money, exactly, will you need to make your vision a reality? You’ll need to figure out how much to save up, and also how much to put away every month right now to hit that number. Get started today – no one is going to do it for you. How can you spot a millionaire? After all, most millionaires live unassuming lives and wear blue jeans just like the rest of us. Here’s a tip – look at people’s behavior. The millionaires are the ones who do things with intentionality. Intentionality is the difference between deciding and sliding. If you’re sliding through life, you’re not in control. You’re just drifting along without a plan, and at retirement age, you’ll probably realize you don’t have a cent in savings. Deciding, on the other hand, is about being in control and making conscious choices. Take millionaire couple Frank and Alice, who the author spoke to during his study of millionaires. Frank’s father and grandfather were frugal, hard-working German immigrants. They couldn’t imagine living beyond their means or incurring debt, and the example they set for Frank when he was a boy has guided him throughout his life. That means that when he worked on Wall Street, he was intentionally choosing to educate himself about investment and building wealth, rather than spending money on shiny new things. Today, Frank and Alice have a net worth of $6 million, and they got there the old-fashioned way – deciding to spend less than they made and saving for the future, rather than sliding into pricey New York shops. They’re in good company, too. Hogan’s study showed that 94 percent of millionaires keep their expenses lower than their incomes, and 95 percent make saving for big expenses a priority. And how do millionaires manage this financial discipline? It’s simple – they live on a budget. Now, budgets often get a bad name. To a lot of people, they just sound like a financial cage. But a budget isn’t a cage. It’s a tool that allows you to take control of your money. With a budget, you can stretch your hard-earned money further and make it do big things. Also, a budget brings clarity to your finances. It does away with any mystery, shining a bright light on just exactly where every one of your dollars is going. And once you’re aware, you can make better choices. Are you spending more than you need to on groceries every month? Adjust your budget, and you’ve suddenly got extra money in your hands. Finally, a budget puts your money to work – you can give every dollar a job. Take that extra money away from groceries and direct it toward something really important, like giving, saving, investing and eliminating debt. One thing about millionaires is that when they say they’ll do something, they do it. In fact, 97 percent of millionaires reported almost always achieving the goals they set for themselves. Anyone can learn to set goals, and being SMART about it means you’ll actually achieve them. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-sensitive. Specific means that goals need to be high-definition. Specifically, they must be detailed, clear and unambiguous. If you’ve taken the time to craft your specific vision for retirement, this will come into play here. Measurable goals are achieved by hitting clear milestones or metrics, like defining a specific amount that you’ll be setting aside every month. Having these checkpoints means that you’ll know with complete certainty whether or not you’re achieving your goals. Achievable goals are realistic ones. Nothing is impossible, but keeping your goals realistic means that you’ll actually be able to accomplish them! Relevant is the opposite of “random.” You can’t plan to save and take regular vacations and pursue an advanced degree all at the same time. Your major goals should be cohesive, leading specifically toward the life you’re aiming for. Time-Sensitive means having deadlines. If you’re focused on planning for retirement, for example, you should know at exactly what age you want that to happen. Be ambitious with your deadlines – you might be surprised at how hard you’re able to work with a little time pressure applied! Once you’ve gotten SMART, commit to your goals by writing them down. This gives you accountability, and also makes it more likely that you’ll achieve your aims – 42 percent more likely, according to a study by psychology professor Dr. Gail Matthews. Ideally, goals should be a mix of short- and long-term. Short-term goals, like saving for a nice vacation, can be the wins that keep you on track. Long-term goals are the big life-changers. The biggest of these will probably be paying off your house. Once you do so, you transform it from debt liability to 100 percent asset. Now, doing this isn’t easy, by any means. But every year you don’t is a year that you make the bank rich instead of yourself. Imagine paying your mortgage off ten years early. Then, the money you would have put into your mortgage payments has ten more years to make you rich! That’s because you harness the power of compound interest, which we’ll look at closely in the next blink. It’s hard to be patient. Who isn’t tempted by short-term rewards? But millionaires forgo these distractions, building wealth through patience and consistency. And when it comes to consistency, there’s nothing better than the magic of compound interest. There’s even a quote – which many attribute to Albert Einstein – that calls it the most powerful force in the universe! Let’s say you put $1,000 into an investment and find that it’s grown to $1,100 a year later. If you keep the money where it is, then that extra $100 will start accruing interest as well. That’s interest earning interest! And that just snowballs over time, if you’re willing to be patient. But what long-term investment options can you really trust? Hogan’s study proves that the majority of millionaires make their money through the old-school company plan or 401(k). Here’s how you take full advantage of these. Let’s assume that you’re planning on investing the recommended 15 percent of your income toward retirement. The first step is to check to see if your company offers a match on your 401(k). If it does, invest in your 401(k) up to whatever the match amount is – if it’s 5 percent, invest 5 percent. Remember, this is free money, so you want to take advantage of it. Next, put as much as you can into a Roth IRA, which works similarly to a 401(k) but gives you more investment options. Talk to an investment advisor to make this happen. This is worth it because a Roth is an amazing investment tool, one that will grow your nest egg tax-free. You should know, though, that there’s an income limit for Roth IRAs. If you find out that you make more than the current limit, then the best thing is just to invest the entire 15 percent in your 401(k). There’s also a contribution limit to the Roth IRA – once you’ve hit it, then put whatever’s left of your 15 percent in the 401(k). Don’t forget – that 15 percent is just a starting point. Once your mortgage is paid off, you’ll have some extra income, which you should then put toward your 401(k), too. Then, stay true to the plans that you've created to lead you to your ideal life and add the magic ingredient – time. It won’t happen overnight, but slowly, steadily, you too will achieve millionaire status. The key message in these blinks: Millionaires aren’t some rarified class of people. They weren’t born into money and privilege. Instead, they’re regular people who set goals early on in life and were willing to put in the hard work and sacrifice to make those goals happen. Becoming a millionaire is the American dream, and it’s far from dead. In fact, regular people make it happen every day. Actionable advice: Enlist an investment professional. Nobody would go to court and act as their own lawyer, right? Well, you shouldn’t go it alone when building wealth, either. Seek out investment professionals on the internet. The author’s website is one resource for this. Once you’ve got a shortlist, take some time to interview each one. Ask questions about their experience, certifications, philosophy and fees. Finding the right fit will be well worth your time – after all, it’s your wealth. And your life. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

To say that everyone wants it would be to point out the painfully obvious. But too often it can seem like a distant dream. In reality, though, the desire to have enough money to lead a comfortable life – and enough to see you through retirement – is fulfillable. It’s also probably a lot easier to achieve than you think. In this book-in-blinks, we’ve boiled From Here to Financial Happiness’s 77 chapters down to their essentials. You’ll learn what it takes to set you on the path to not just earning more, but making yourself secure as you do so. It might seem overwhelming, but break down the task into its components and it really isn’t so scary. In this book-in-blinks you’ll learn why regularly using credit cards might not be so bad; how much to set aside for retirement; and why you can blame your impulse purchases on your ancestors.  You don’t have to be a financial advisor to know that no two earners are the same. That means that financial advice is never universally true. However, there are some simple rules that apply to everyone, and it’s these general principles you should follow – if you aren’t already doing so, that is! Before we get down to business, let’s cover one of the basics: compound interest. There’s a good reason saving money makes sense: the amount will rapidly increase thanks to a phenomenon known as compounding. So, say you have savings of $1000 earning 6 percent interest every year. Without compounding, you’d only receive $60 interest every year. You’d only get up to a paltry $2800 after thirty years. But thanks to compounding, the interest you earn each year gets added to the base savings amount. It’s from this new amount that your next year’s interest is then calculated. That means that, after 30 years of compounding, you’d end up with $5,743 rather than only $2,800. The lesson here is clear. Start saving and start earning that interest as soon as possible. It really is worth it. Now that’s out the way, let's turn to those simple rules for healthier finances. If you’re an employee, the first thing to do is to make sure your employer’s retirement savings plan is working for you. Typically, for every dollar you contribute to your retirement plan, your employer will give 50 cents, for up to 6 percent of your salary. So if you contribute the full 6 percent of your salary to the retirement plan, your employer’s contribution will knock that up to 9 percent. Over time, that starts to add up. The second basic rule is never to carry debt on your credit card. That’s because credit card companies often charge up to 20 percent interest on unpaid balances. It might seem obvious, but it’s an easy thing to forget. Pay off your card, otherwise, you’ll be quite literally throwing money away. We’re off to a good start, but now let’s move to the next blink, where we’ll examine even better reasons for saving money. If there’s one thing that keeps people from sleeping at night, it’s sure to be financial worries. And that’s understandable – living from paycheck to paycheck is a recipe for stress. That’s why it’s critical that you try your hardest to set up an emergency fund. Ideally, you should have enough in an emergency fund to cover three to six months of average living expenses. Be sure, also, to keep this money out of easy reach – preferably in a savings account or in the form of very safe investments. The main reason for having a fund such as this is so that you have something to fall back on in case you lose your job. In contrast, if your car or washing machine were to break down, you’d most likely be able to scrape that money together from somewhere. But losing your job is different – losing your major source of income means that you’ll need something to see you through while you look for new employment. You also need to bear in mind that, if your line of work is quite specialized, you’re going to need longer to find a job that fits your specific skill set; simply put, an executive is going to need more time for the job hunt than a waiter. That means you’re going to need a larger emergency fund to see you through.  Thankfully, it’s not that complicated to create an emergency fund. You just need to follow a few basic rules. First off, look at your monthly living costs and work out how big you’ll need your emergency fund to be. Then, apply for a high-yield savings account. Finally, set up your checking account so that it pays an automatic contribution to your new savings account every month. Keep this going until you hit your goal. This method is the easiest way to get your emergency fund growing and ensures that you won’t be spending your liquid assets on too many luxuries like theatre tickets or fancy clothes. The other thing to consider is which expenses you should immediately cut out if you hit hard times. Cutting out restaurants is an obvious solution, but you might even need to consider moving to a cheaper apartment if financial issues seem likely to go on for a while. If we lived our lives meticulously evaluating every decision along the way, making decisions at all would quickly become utterly exhausting. That’s why humans have evolved to operate and react instinctively to the world around them on a day-to-day basis. That’s all well and good, but unfortunately some of our ingrained instincts aren’t such great news for our wallets. Just consider one habit that’s been passed down in our genes. To fully utilize resources, our nomadic ancestors had to forage for food and supplies whenever they had the opportunity. This was necessary for survival in an environment where food and shelter were hard to come by. But we’re still evolutionarily conditioned to do the same, and it’s those same instincts that lead us to overindulge. In a similar vein, our deeply lodged survival instincts mean that we have also come to overvalue hard work as a positive attribute. That’s because our ancestors had to expend huge quantities of energy on hunting and foraging, making them believe in a direct relationship between effort and success.  Now, working hard is, of course, generally a good thing. But if the result is thoughtless over-enthusiasm, then we risk making poor investments. There are plenty of people, for example, who’ve started their own business without proper planning and backing, only for it to end in disaster. So it’s a good idea to counter those misplaced evolutionary impulses that lead to inadequate planning by checking that your finances are in good shape on a regular basis. To do this, you have to first calculate your fixed monthly expenses. This includes things like rent, a mortgage and utilities. These costs should not exceed 50 percent of your total income before taxes. After that, add up your fixed expenses, your monthly tax contributions and the amount you’re setting aside to save each month. As a rule of thumb, at least 12 percent of your income should be going toward your retirement. Now, subtract that combined overall total from your pretax income. What’s left is what you can use for hobbies, vacation and the like. It’s up to you! If you started in on this book-in-blinks hoping to discover a secret to becoming an overnight millionaire, you’re going to be sorely disappointed. The thing is, there is no secret to financial success – it’s nothing more than developing a good set of habits. You just have to learn and implement those habits. An essential component to maintaining sound finances is frugality. You have to keep your expenses low. This can mean anything from getting a less expensive internet package to ditching your gas-guzzling car. But you have to begin somewhere. In addition to this, you have to curb your spending on unnecessary items. These are luxuries that you may not benefit from in the long-term. So there’s no need for a designer couch when a secondhand one will do. And, as for that new hobby you’ve started, maybe it’s better to wait before splurging on that oh-so-essential surfing gear. Money often gets wasted on impulse buys, so think good and hard about what you’re doing before you indulge. There’s also another good reason to be frugal. Odd though it may seem, thriftiness can improve your health. That’s because poor spending habits are often linked to things that are bad for us. These include gambling and drugs such as alcohol, coffee or cigarettes. All of these are addictive in their own way. Now, take a moment to pause, and think about your guilty pleasures and their monetary repercussions. If you often eat more than is healthy, calculate the amount it costs you each day to indulge. And consider the fact that when it comes to smoking, you’re basically burning your money away each day. Sit down and do the math: how much goes out on these unhealthy habits over the course of a year? Once you face the fact that you’re throwing away thousands of dollars each year on unhealthy habits, you might have the incentive you need to finally quit. To an outsider, insurance and insurance policies can seem incomprehensible and confounding. It sometimes comes across as a lot of administrative and technical jargon. But at heart, insurance is both practical and pretty simple. It’s just a way to pool risk. Policyholders contribute money to a pool. This means that if one of the holders gets unlucky, the costs of the misfortune are borne collectively from that pool. However, not all insurance policies are necessary.  If you're a 40-year old professional with a spouse and children, life insurance is a sound idea. If you die early, your family will undoubtedly benefit from any insurance payout and may be able to live a more comfortable life. But once you’ve hit retirement age and your kids are all grown up, paying into a life insurance scheme makes no sense. This model of assessment applies to all your insurance decisions. There are many different types of insurance out there, and very few that are actually applicable to you. For instance, if you’re a young professional, you shouldn’t go without disability insurance. In the event of accident or illness, who’s going to pay the bills when you can’t work? Social Security support takes a lot of work to apply for, and you might be waiting months for that first payment to come through. Short-term or long-term disability insurance is, therefore, worth having. However, your employer may already be paying for your insurance disability costs. In that case, it’s totally unnecessary to buy your own additional disability insurance. Equally, if you’re close to retiring and have upwards of $1 million in your savings account, you can probably do without disability insurance. In those circumstances, should you become disabled, you'll have enough to cover the extra costs of disability without putting your finances under too much strain. Just remember that each case is individual, and you’ll have to judge it for yourself. Think of a purchase that symbolizes career success and what will likely come to mind is an expensive and luxurious car. Sure, it’s a status symbol, but for many the experience of driving a first-class vehicle is simply a lot of fun. As a result, it’s all too easy to overspend on them! For decades, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking how American families spend their money, and their data illustrates this point: A whopping 16 percent of the average American family’s budget goes to transportation - which, in the US, usually means cars. That spending lags in second place, notably, behind housing, which makes up an average of 33 percent of a family’s expenses. Spending too much on driving is clearly a risk. But it’s relatively simple to work out if you’re overdoing it. First off, work out the annual cost of your car. Add up what you spend on it, whether that’s paying for it in installments, gas, insurance, repairs or registration. You should now compare that total with what you make each year. If more than 15 percent of your budget goes toward costs associated with your car, then you’re definitely overspending. And, of course, if you’re throwing away money on your vehicle, that means less is going toward more important items – like your savings. So, what should you do if you’re over that 15 percent threshold? Thankfully, there are some simple enough solutions. First off, take care when the time comes to replace your current vehicle. New cars are expensive, but their value depreciates rapidly during the first two or three years. If you buy a slightly older secondhand car, you can sometimes snag yourself a pretty good deal. It just takes some patience. The further advantage of owning a second-hand vehicle that isn’t worth nearly as much as a new one is that your insurance costs won’t be as high. With that said, don’t switch cars too often, even if the new one runs cheaper: you’ll still have to dish up the cash for sales taxes and new registration fees. Ideally, then, you should be on the lookout for a second-hand vehicle that’s about three years old and has fewer than 30,000 miles on the clock. If you ask anyone about the best methods of increasing wealth, they’ll most likely suggest you look for solid investment opportunities. High-yield savings accounts for retirement are often what spring to mind. But investing isn’t the only way of securing your wealth. To keep your finances healthy, you have to think about how you handle your cash on an everyday basis. First off, take advantage of the rewards that some credit cards offer. When you spend money, use them. Lots of cards give you cash back once you’ve reached a certain threshold. Others reward you with travel points. Needless to say, don’t fall into the trap of spending more just for the points! Another thing to keep an eye on is your checking account. These are low interest, so there’s no point leaving a ton of money in there. Have enough there to cover your daily costs, but anything above that needs to be dispatched into a savings account. There’s a double benefit to transferring that excess checking account money: you’ll both be earning interest on it and less likely to spend it. A savings account is a great start, but that earned interest soon gets eaten away by taxes; a savings account will make you richer, but not significantly so. If you really want your money to work for you, you’ll have to buy some company stock. This simply means that you become a partial owner of a business, as you own a stake in it. But buying stocks is really only an option if you already have robust savings, like a healthy pension and emergency fund. Simply put, if you’re the kind of person who gets into financial difficulties, then you might need to sell off your stocks in a rush. And if you do that at a point when the company is experiencing a slump, you’re going to lose a lot of money overall. However, if you’re able to support yourself and still buy company stock on the side, then it’s certainly worth it. Stocks can have relatively high returns and, if done right, you’ll be increasing your wealth before you know it. Usually, when people get to thinking about money, their thoughts head to the next big thing. That could be putting a down-payment on a house, buying a car or setting up a college fund for the kids. But your first financial priority should actually be about what comes last. At the end of your professional life comes retirement. The reason for that is plain: retirement isn’t optional – not like buying a house! Almost everyone is going to retire, and the gap between retirement and death can be very many years indeed. So there’s no reason to put off saving for retirement. If you wait too long, you’ll need to put aside an awful lot towards your retirement fund for it to function as it should. If you wait as long as your late thirties or early forties, we’re talking around 20 percent of your monthly earnings. And that’s a lot of financial stress. It doesn’t matter if you have student debt, and it makes no difference if you want to save money for a property investment – what comes first should be your retirement plan. Start by paying at least 12 percent of your pretax income toward your plan every month. If that means cutting costs elsewhere, those we looked at earlier, you’ll just have to do that. But of course, saving for your retirement is only one part of the equation. You have to work out what you’ll actually do during that time. It might sound great to be a retiree who goes to the beach or lounges in the sun. But after only a few weeks, that kind of life can get pretty dull. It can even lead to depression. So plot out ahead of time which hobbies you’d really like to get involved in when you’ve got more time on your hands. Ideally, these should be activities that you lose yourself in, where time just flows. So, for, example, if you think playing an instrument might be what you need in retirement, you should start practicing now. By the time you retire, you’ll be proficient enough to enjoy it fully. It will feel like a constructive use of your time and, more than this, you’ll have less chance of getting frustrated by learning an entirely new skill at an advanced age.  So now you've got the lowdown. You now know how to increase your financial happiness, how to plan ahead and how to put aside what you need for your savings. Whether it's an emergency fund or planning for major expenses, you know how to approach the challenge and keep yourself financially happy. The key message in these blinks: The secret to financial happiness is simple, but it isn’t always easy to put into practice. At its most basic, it’s about saving your money – whether by reducing your expenses or putting a set amount into a high-yield account every month. Thankfully, you can achieve this. By reducing your fixed costs, such as your car expenses, giving some thought to your insurance policies and living frugally, you can soon start to amass a healthy stash of money. If you’re then savvy about managing your cash, and invest extra wealth in stock, you can put your money to work for you. Done right, you’ll have not just enough for a comfortable life but enough to last you through retirement, too. Actionable advice: Automate your monthly payments.  Set up your e-banking account so that payments for rent, insurance and all regular bills are automated. Automatic transfers force you to be realistic about your finances, but they also ensure you don’t fall behind on your credit card payments, which would negatively affect your credit score.  Got feedback?

And consider this: that was also the dream of children a generation ago – to meet a favorite Disney character at a theme park. How has one company managed to do this? How has Disney managed to stay at the heart of Western culture for well over half a century? The answer lies, partly, in the amazing way they train their staff at Disney University. In this special place, Disney employees are taught all they will ever need to know about treating customers like VIPs. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to do that, too. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why Disney managers held crucial meetings in Cinderella’s Castle; why great customer service is a mixture of art and science; and why you can’t buy alcohol at Disneyland Tokyo, but can at Disneyland Paris. The employees are the most important part of any business, especially in a customer-focused industry. You can't achieve success without a well-trained, motivated and happy staff. So keep your workforce happy by providing them with values, not just physical goods. Most companies fail here because they assume they can motivate their employees solely with pay or bonuses or little perks. They don't realize they need to share the company's values with them, too. If your employees don't care about your company's values, they won't be interested in its progress or stakeholders. They'll only be concerned with their own material needs. Disney strives to avoid this. They carefully promote the company's philosophy at Disney University, where staff (or cast members, in Disney terms) is trained. The cast members come to share the company's values, so they feel a much deeper connection to it. You also need to keep your employees happy. The best way to do this is to ensure that the management stays in close contact with them. The management should know immediately if the employees encounter any problems. Van France, the founder of Disney University, used to take walks through the institution to see how the cast members were doing. During one of his walks, he noticed a problem with the orientation program for newly hired members: the company and its parks had expanded so quickly that trainees were struggling under the old orientation program, which had become too small. It was out of date. So France developed a new orientation program that was more suited to the needs of the company and its trainees. The management should always be aware of the organization's inner workings, and seek out ways to make work more efficient and enjoyable. Is building a successful business a science or an art? Well, it's really a combination of both. Your organization's “scientific side” is about its infrastructure and physical products. For Disney, that means building and maintaining the parks and attractions. Disney's success largely depends on the layout of their parks, and on their quality, cleanliness and exciting rides. But great infrastructure and well-engineered roller coasters aren't enough on their own. That's where Disney's artistic side comes in! A business's artistic side is what gives it that special touch that sets it apart. The staff holds the key to the business's “art.” After all, it's up to the staff to make the customer’s experience special, and that’s what makes all the difference at Disneyland. Disney approaches this challenge and maintains their artistry in several ways. First, they teach the staff the interpersonal skills they need to have positive interactions with customers. Children tend to be very excited about visiting Disneyland because they get to meet their heroes, like Snow White or Donald Duck; clearly, the cast members who play those characters have a lot to live up to. They need extensive training. Cast members who play Disney characters also have to adapt to being surrounded by an audience at all times, and they need to know how to interact with guests of all ages. Disney performers also need a lot of technical skill. The guests should feel like they're walking through a fairy tale when they're in a park, so Disney wants their actors to seem like living film characters. The actor playing Snow White has to know how her every movement ought to look. She literally has to transform into the character. You can probably name a few companies that once dominated their market but eventually fell into bankruptcy. Nokia, Kodak, Blockbuster – each suffered this fate. Why? Companies often collapse when they fail to keep up with changes. They cling to the business practices that once made them successful, even when those practices no longer work. A company can also fail if it changes too quickly, however. If it abandons strategies that work and adopts new ones that don't, the company risks destroying itself. So how do you find the balance between changing and staying the same? Here's Disney's key: keep one foot in the past and one in the future. Naturally, Disney keeps up with the latest in animation, and its parks are highly advanced. But no company values its history more than Disney. When Walt Disney died, for example, the company knew they had to keep his spirit alive. So they organized a new program to uphold the Disney tradition, where newly hired cast members could learn about the company. They learned how it got its start and what made it so great in the first place. Preserving the past and moving into the future are equally important, but they're both useless without another critical tool: feedback! You'll never be successful if you don't receive ongoing feedback from the people working with you. When a Disney executive visited one of these tradition programs - called Disney Traditions - he noticed a flaw. The first questions the newly hired members asked were about work schedules, salary and what their costumes looked like. The tradition program, however, taught them first about the company. So the executive changed the order of the program. When new employees got their personal information first, they were much more engaged in learning about the company, because they saw themselves as a part of it. Language is what sets humans apart from other living creatures, but businesses often fail to cash in on its potential. They fall back on boring jargon, like “dynamism,” “energizing” or “going the extra mile.” Those words aren't engaging! If you want to use really great business language, you need to step it up! Use a trick called the language of success to make your customers and employees feel more valued. That means using unique language that sets your company apart from all the others. Small changes make a difference: Disney uses its own special names for various parts of the company. Employees are cast members and customers are guests. Disney parks don't have “crowds” – they have an audience. These terms might sound odd, but they really do change the way the employees and customers feel; Disney's unique language immerses them in the magic of the Disney environment. Disney adapted these terms to suit the branches of their company that speak different languages as well. If you want your company to succeed globally, you have to take the time and care to make sure that it resonates with people of different cultures. For example Disney parks in different countries have different rules. When Disney opened Tokyo Disneyland, they maintained the drinking rules that are enforced in the US: no alcohol anywhere in the park. Japanese people responded well to this and many wrote letters to Disney thanking them for it. One housewife wrote that her husband wouldn't have spent time with her and their children if the park had sold sake. The alcohol rule didn't go over well in France, however. The French press criticized Disney for their insensitivity to French culture, so wine is now allowed at the park in Paris. Running a company is a bit like being married. There are always ups and downs, and times when you just want to give up. It's not possible for a business to avoid these difficult times. So what do you do when they hit? Even a company as strong and well structured as Disney faces problems. In 1971, for example, Roy Disney, the company's inspirational leader, died a mere two months after Walt Disney World was opened. His death was very hard on the cast members, as many of them had been close to him. Understandably, the cast was generally demoralized and struggled to focus on their work or perform with smiling faces. When you reach a tough period like this, the best thing to do is have everyone come together and work it out as a group. Don't give up! Gather your team and have everyone share their ideas on how to make the situation better. Try to get something positive out of it. When Roy Disney died, the managers held emergency meetings in the tower of Cinderella's Castle. They discussed the issue and collected feedback from everyone on the team, and eventually came up with some ideas for reinvigorating the company and its employees, like improving the staff training and HR department. In the end, the company only became stronger. And there's another reason that running a business is like being married: one of the keys to a successful marriage is to not think of yourself all the time. Instead, think about what you have to give. In business, this means you shouldn't focus only on money and profit. You also have to help your staff have fun! Walt Disney understood this well. His motto was “Work hard, play hard,” and he was always ready to plan fun events for his staff and let them enjoy themselves. The key message in this book: A company's character and strength depends on its staff. Disney understands this well. They give their employees more than just a good salary; they include them in the Disney magic by sharing their values and making them understand the legacy they're a part of. Disney holds onto traditions and looks for new ideas, and they work together through difficult times. Even if your organization isn't as big as Disney, you can still incorporate many of their successful ideas. Actionable advice: Have fun! Van France, the man responsible for Disney's unique training process, once said, “The business we’re in, if we can’t have fun, how could we expect the public to have fun?” So help your staff enjoy themselves! They won't just feel better; they'll be more productive workers, too.

Kotlikoff, Philip Moeller and Paul Solman","summary":"What do you think of when you hear the words “social security”? Most of us will be thinking of poor retirees, struggling to live on tiny state pensions. We think that if we want to be comfortable in our old age, we must invest in the stock market, or buy bonds. Anything to avoid surviving on social security. And yet, this view is completely wrong. When we get close to the age of retirement, social security will be worth far more to us than our savings or investments, if we play it right! But how do you pull that off? These blinks will show you why multiple divorces will help you when it comes to retirement age; why, if you can, you should wait as long as possible before claiming; and just how many conditions there are in the social security rule book. If you look back a hundred years in many countries, reaching old age meant economic strife, because people who were forced into retirement lost their incomes and struggled to survive. Those who didn’t have family or friends to support them were faced with frightening prospects, even starvation. So why don’t we experience this problem any more? Because of two little words: social security. At present, social security has expanded into a massive enterprise. In 2014 it paid over $812 billion in benefits while accommodating 180,000 visitors for consultations and 450,000 phone calls daily. But isn’t social security just for poor people? Absolutely not, it’s for every tax-paying citizen who invested in it and everyone who is entitled to should reap its benefits. Why? Because income from social security is safe. You could lose your home to a mortgage default, your investments could plummet in value, but social security is guaranteed to retain value. For instance, over the two decades between 1991 and 2011, the average US investor actually incurred a net loss after accounting for costs and inflation. But over the same period, social security grew – it’s designed to increase with inflation. So social security is a safe investment, but there’s a problem. It can be confusing and people often find themselves perplexed as to what they’re entitled to. For example, the social security system abides by 2,728 core rules. For married couples alone, the formula for calculating the benefit of each spouse consists of ten complicated mathematical functions! Not just that, but social security staff aren’t exactly the most helpful. In fact, they can only provide you information, never advice. So how can you be certain to get what you’re entitled to? Social security is best understood from the bottom up and that means learning the basic terms and calculations of the system. For instance, while you can file for social security at age 62, your Full Retirement Age – or FRA – when your benefits are the highest, depends on when you were born. Since most people retiring today were born between 1943 and 1954, they have an FRA of 66. But you don’t have to take social security upon reaching your FRA. You can keep working until 70. In fact, for every year after your FRA that you don’t accept social security you’ll accrue a Delayed Retirement Credit, or DRC, of eight percent interest! Now, who’s eligible for social security? Anyone who worked a social security-covered job for 40 quarters of a year in total. If you meet this requirement you can collect benefits not just for yourself, but for your spouse or dependants too. The amount you receive is based on the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings, or AIME, the average of your 35 highest annual incomes adjusted for inflation. But for years that you weren’t covered by social security your income will be considered $0. Therefore, the more years you work a social security-covered job, the better. For example, a person earning $50,000 a year for 40 years is better off than one earning $100,000 for 20 years. Because the first person’s data amounts to earning $50,000 a year for 35 years while the second’s amounts to earning $100,000 a year for 20 years and $0 for 15 years. So, you’ve reached FRA and you start collecting social security. You’ll receive what’s called the Primary Insurance Amount, or PIA, a figure based on a system wherein the more you earn, the progressively less you get in social security. For instance, for the first $826 of wages that your AIME marks, you’ll receive 90 percent back in social security, for anything between $826 and $4,980 you’ll get 32 percent and for anything higher you’ll get 15 percent. Did you know that your social security eligibility changes depending on how many times you were married? Many people don’t. But even if you were never married it’s key to understand some general guidelines. The first rule to maximizing your social security is patience, because the longer you wait, the more you’ll collect. For instance, any benefits you claim before reaching your FRA will be reduced. But it’s not just benefits from your work that you’re trying to maximize, spousal benefits are 43 percent higher at FRA than when collected at age 62, and benefits taken by surviving relatives are 40 percent higher at FRA than at age 60. However, there are limits. Neither of these benefits increase further between your FRA and age 70. The only additional money you accrue during this time is a result of your rising retirement benefit. The second rule is to take all available benefits. These could be from your spouse and even your ex-spouse. But first it’s key to know what you’re eligible for. For example, to receive spousal benefits you must have been married for at least one year, while for ex-spouse benefits you’re required to have been married for ten years. And remember, it doesn’t matter whether you were married a decade ago as long as you meet the requirements. A simple jog of your memory could unearth a gold mine! Finally, rule number three is to get the timing right. Why? Because you can’t collect two benefits at once. Therefore, good timing is essential to reaping certain benefits while letting others grow. For instance, if your spousal benefit exceeds your own, you’re only entitled to that from your spouse. For this reason it’s often a good idea to collect your spousal benefit upon reaching your FRA, while leaving your own benefit to grow bigger. But don’t jump the gun – filing for any benefits before reaching FRA requires you to take all that are available to you. So be sure to wait for that magic age! Have you planned for the future? Are you going to settle down and get married? While most of us make decisions like this based on love, it might be in your best interests to consider how life decisions can affect your social security benefits. For example, spousal benefits can be a major source of income if you handle them correctly. In fact, a spousal benefit can amount to as much as half what your partner would receive upon reaching FRA. It doesn’t even matter if they filed for benefits earlier as long as you wait for FRA to collect. Here’s how it works. To get spousal benefits your spouse must first file for social security, which as you now know is best done upon reaching FRA. Once your spouse files they can suspend collection of their social security, thereby letting it accrue value and allowing you and your dependants to enjoy what you’re entitled to. However, life isn’t always so simple and sometimes you need to take retirement before reaching FRA. This is especially true when your spouse needs the money in advance of their retirement age. But this doesn’t mean settling for a considerably smaller benefit, as long as you use the stop–start strategy. How? Start by claiming your benefits early; you’ll receive a smaller amount but when you do reach FRA you can suspend your collection. This will let your benefits appreciate a few final years of interest before you reach 70. Unfortunately, despite the various combinations of benefits for spouses and dependents, like children or disabled relatives, there is a limit. It’s called the Family Maximum Benefit or FMA, a collection amount which, once passed, results in reductions to your various sources of social security until you collect less than the FMA threshold once more. Say you’ve been married for almost ten years and decide you want a divorce. While some things just aren’t meant to be, if you wait the few extra months to reach that magic decade you’ll be thanking yourself for years to come. But that’s just one way your marriage choices can affect your social security. Actually, social security might even incentivize you to get divorced. For instance, when married couples claim benefits, only one is entitled to spousal benefits. However, divorced couples who were married for at least ten years can both claim spousal benefits. Not just that, but claiming your ex-spouse benefit does not require your ex-spouse to file for social security as your current one would have to. As long as you’ve been divorced for more than two years, your ex-spouse only needs to turn 62 for you to cash in. However, to get the most you’ll need to know how much your ex earns. Unfortunately, if you’re not on good terms with them it will probably be hard to get the accurate information you need and you can’t rely on the social security companies because, due to privacy regulations, they’re barred from divulging this information. But divorce and marriage can affect your social security in other ways. For example, every time you remarry you lose the benefits you’re entitled by your previous marriages. However, if you get divorced again you’re once again eligible for all ex-spousal benefits. So remember, if you want to claim ex-spousal benefits, divorce is the only option. That is, until you reach age 60, at which point your current marriage no longer affects the benefits of your prior ones. Another thing to keep in mind is the importance of survivor benefits, to which you’re entitled after nine months of marriage. The amount you can collect is based on the PIA of your deceased spouse. So make sure you get the benefits that ten million surviving spouses did in 2013! Hang in there, you’ve nearly mastered social security. There are just a few more details you’ll need to receive maximum benefits. One such detail relates to the circumstances around same-sex marriages. For instance, if the marriage was officiated in a state where same-sex marriage is legal, but the social security filing made in a state where it’s not, the benefits will be put on hold. In fact, unless the status of gay marriage in that state changes, it will be turned down entirely. So, to ensure you collect the social security benefits you are entitled to via your same-sex partner, it’s essential to file in a state that has legalized same-sex marriage (although thanks to the Supreme Court decision of June 2015, this may have changed!). But even if you receive benefits you may be required to pay taxes. For example, in cases where your combined income, meaning your non-social-security income plus any tax-exempt interests, such as you would get from government securities, plus half your social security benefits, totals over $25,000 per year, or $32,000 for joint filers, you’re required to pay federal income taxes. The rules get even more complicated if you had non-covered income, meaning income that did not pay into social security. For example, for work done in or for foreign countries. In such cases, even if you have worked enough to be eligible for social security, it is likely that you’ll not receive a high amount if you also have a pension or other benefits from a non-covered role. This is because of the Windfall Elimination Provision, a rule that results in decreased social security for people with non-social-security pensions who didn’t work covered jobs for at least 30 years. But having these kinds of non-social-security pensions also limits what your spouse is entitled to. For this reason, it’s essential to be cautious about non-covered earnings and pensions to Get What’s Yours! The key message in this book: Social security is an important source of income for retired Americans and essential to ensuring that you spend your last years in peace. But to make sure you reap the full benefits you’re entitled to you’ll need to take a professional and well-timed approach.  Actionable advice: Don’t gamble your retirement. Some people think it’s wise to take their social security benefits early and invest them, assuming that the reduced payments they receive will be easily replaced by their appreciating stocks and bonds. But the fact is, the average investor loses often and you don’t have the time to spare. So keep your money in social security where it’s safe.

But this kind of thinking is misguided. Given that benefits like Social Security and retirement pensions are imperiled, it has never been more important for young people to start investing in their future financial security. Got feedback?

If you’re in your twenties or thirties today, you have the unique opportunity to choose for yourself. No one is going to force you to settle down and become all serious. But there are a few things you need to deal with as an adult, and one of them is handling your personal finances. Maybe you just graduated and need to pay back your student loan? Or perhaps you’ve realized that your life could become more convenient if you had an online bank account? Or you’ve started wondering how to fulfill your dreams, like buying your first car or financing a cruise in the Caribbean? No matter what your financial situation might be, these blinks will guide you, and you’ll discover that taking charge of your money is much easier than you might think. You’ll also find out how to save thousands of dollars in insurance costs; why paying back credit card debt is a spectacular investment; and how one single sticker can tell you whether your money is safe with your bank. You don’t have to be a Wall Street trader to know that the global economy has been a bit dicey lately, but that doesn’t mean your finances can’t be in order. In fact, it’s never too soon to start planning your financial life, and it’s really not as hard as you might think. Here’s how you can get started. First, determine how much money you’ll need to fulfill your dreams. Maybe your goal is to shed all your credit card debt or buy a new car, but whatever it is, if you’re going to realize your dream, you’ll need to know how much it’s going to cost. For instance, say you want to buy a new $30,000 car. Sellers tend to require a down payment of about 10–20 percent, meaning you’ll need between $3,000 and $6,000 in the bank to bring your new baby home. Once you’ve figured out the dollar value of your dream, you need to start saving toward it. But to save money you first need to know how you spend money. Start by looking at your normal expenses. This is best done by keeping a diary for a month and writing down the details of all your expenses. Eventually, your spending habits will be clear and you’ll know what you need to change to free up some money to save. For example, maybe you buy a lot more books than you actually read or are overpaying for cable. Once you’ve worked out your spending, you’ll be amazed at how much potential for saving there is, even if you currently feel like you’re barely making ends meet. Now that you know how to start saving, it’s time to explore a financial topic that many people find more intimidating: debt. Are you in debt? If you are, you might be one of those people that just pays the minimum amount necessary every month and tries to avoid thinking about it the rest of the time. If that’s the case, you might want to rethink your strategy. In fact, all credit card debt should be paid off as soon as possible, because it costs a fortune! For instance, say, like many people, you have $3,500 of credit card debt at an interest rate of 17 percent. Since you don’t have much money, you’ve been skating by, paying the minimum amount required. The trouble is that at this rate you won’t pay off your debt until age 65! And by then, you will have paid a whopping $11,162 in total – $7,662 of which is pure interest. So, credit card debt is expensive and you should get rid of it as soon as you can. But if you’re in more serious debt and struggling to pay your bills, you should speak with your lenders. While it might be scary, a conversation with the bank is exactly what’s called for. After all, they have an interest in making it possible for you to pay back your loan, and they’ll likely be more flexible than you think. They may agree to reduced monthly payments or a lower interest rate. If you’re not up to doing this on your own, you can even hire a credit counselor, preferably a non-profit one. Both the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies and the National Foundation for Consumer Credit will help borrowers negotiate with lenders. You might also find help from unions in your area. But regardless of how you do it, if there’s any way you can pay off your debt, you should make it a top priority. Next, we’ll explore how to go about doing just that. Besides talking to your lenders, there are also three other principles you should keep in mind to effectively manage your debt. First, if you have any savings at all, the best way to invest them is by paying down your debt. This should be a no-brainer since you already know how expensive credit card debt is, and the same goes for car loans. If you compare the returns you can expect from investing in stocks to the interest rate of your debt, the better investment is obvious. If your car loan comes with an interest rate of 17 percent, you’d have to find a stock that would promise a return of at least that much to make it a better investment than paying off the car loan – and good luck doing that. In other words, your debt likely costs you more than most investments can produce. Another strategy is to transfer loans with high interest rates to loans with lower rates. Such a transfer is typically known as refinancing and, for obvious reasons, it’s often a good idea. By refinancing you’ll get a lower interest rate – say 8 percent instead of 18 percent – and will, therefore, reduce the cost of your loan. So, if you’ve got a car loan or some credit card debt that you can’t pay off right away, just apply for a low-rate credit card. This will allow you to pay off your previous creditor with a new loan that demands a lower interest rate than the original. And finally, always pay your debts on time, because stalling is never a good idea. How come? Well, in this day and age, it’s not difficult for lenders, landlords or employers to peer into your credit history. And if you have late payments, they’ll protect themselves by demanding higher interest rates or denying you opportunities, so it’s better to be seen as a reliable debtor. But debt isn’t everything, and next up is an exploration of the world of banks and how to choose the right one. Many people choose a bank just because it’s local or because their parents use it. But these aren’t exactly the wisest criteria. Instead, you should first make sure that the bank insures your money. In the United States, most banks are covered by what’s called federal deposit insurance, which protects your money – generally up to $100,000 – if the bank goes bust. This is guaranteed by a governmental agency known as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC. So, when choosing a bank, be sure to look for the stickers that denote FDIC certification or just go to the FDIC website and check if your account is covered and what the limit of the coverage is. You should also look for banks that offer online banking and have nearby ATMs. That’s because these tools are essential for managing your finances. After all, online banking lets you easily manage your money whenever you want, but it also helps you keep tabs on all your account activity. It’s important to check your transactions every week to determine how much you can spend, but also to spot any errors. Say your paycheck of $500 was deposited into your empty account yesterday, but your insurance company accidently charged you $800 instead of $400, and now you’re $300 in the red. If you don’t bother to check your transactions, you might never discover this. Another thing to keep tabs on when choosing a bank is the distribution of its ATMs. That’s because you can withdraw money from your bank’s ATMs for free. So, if you choose a bank that has lots of ATMs, you can save money by avoiding fees. But maybe you don’t want to just plant your money in a bank account and would rather invest it to get a positive return. Well, investment advice is right around the corner. If you only follow one rule for your investments, it should be “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”! This simple guideline can go a long way, and it’s easy to diversify your investments by putting your money in a mutual fund. A mutual fund is basically a pool of money to which thousands of people contribute. That money is then invested in different securities, like stocks and bonds. Investing in such a fund is highly beneficial because even small investments will be thoroughly diversified. This is important because investing all your money in just a couple of companies could mean losing everything if they fail. But with a mutual fund, the money is spread across many stocks, meaning that if one plummets, you still have all the others to prop you up. So, mutual funds are a good choice, and you can buy shares in them in all kinds of places like brokerage firms, banks and mutual fund companies. But the last option is the best. That’s because mutual fund companies are firms that specialize in selling such funds, and they usually offer some great perks. If you invest in a mutual fund through a brokerage firm or bank, you’ll often pay steep fees and find yourself held to high minimum investment requirements. With mutual fund companies, on the other hand, you’ll pay low fees and won’t have to invest very much if you don’t want to. Not just that, but if you stick with one mutual fund company, you’ll get a monthly overview of all your investments, making it easy to move your money between different funds. OK, now that you’re squared away on savings, debt and investments, let’s move on to the often tricky field of insurance. Most people pay way too much for insurance. To avoid being one of them, you need to do a bit of research on insurance providers. That’s because different insurers can charge very different premiums for identical policies. One study found that a young man could buy identical car insurance policies with premiums ranging from $808 to $3,441! So how can you best shop around for insurance? For starters, specialist websites will compare the databases of insurance companies for you. They’ll then provide you with a free list of cheap policies. Buying a policy suggested by one of these sites won’t cost you any more than buying one from an insurance agent. You might also choose to talk with a couple of agents. After all, since they tend to work on commission, they’ll be eager to make a deal and can be flexible with premiums and options. But finding a cheap policy isn’t the only important consideration. It’s also key to know how much coverage you need. Otherwise, you might end up paying for unnecessary insurance. So, while you might think it’s a good idea to buy lots of small, seemingly cheap insurance policies – just to be safe – this isn’t necessarily a good idea. That’s because you might end up paying a lot of money for coverage you already have. For instance, say you’re on vacation and decide to rent a car. You might spend $10 a day for collision insurance without realizing that you’re already covered by your credit card or your own car insurance, which happens to extend to rentals. This is why it’s always worth mapping out your current coverage before buying new insurance. The key message in this book: Seize control of your personal finances in your twenties and thirties. Save for your future goals by paying off all the debt you can, making diverse investments and choosing the right bank and insurance for your needs.  Actionable advice: Do some ATM research! You probably don’t pay to use your own bank’s ATMs but might well be charged a fee for using those of other banks. It could cost you as much as $3 per transaction, and since banks aren’t too keen on explicitly informing customers about these fees, it’s essential to do the research yourself. Just imagine the hundreds of dollars you could save every year simply by favoring your own bank’s ATMs! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

And, despite aiming for the stars, do you still tend to get caught up in answering emails and checking off tedious to-dos? Then you’re probably like most people: an average performer, stuck in the hamster wheel of life. Luckily, these blinks demonstrate why this needn’t be the case forever. In fact, a new body of research shows that the highest performing people in this world aren’t born with an extraordinary ability to achieve, and neither does their success stem from some specific kind of personality. Instead, the key to long-term success lies in certain habits – and with the help of just six of them, identified through research on high performance, you’ll be well on your way to extraordinary achievements. You’ll see why seeking clarity, generating energy, raising necessity, increasing productivity, developing influence, and demonstrating courage will help you perform your way to the stars. You’ll also learn what CEOs and professional athletes have in common; why you’d benefit from having your mother depend on your success; and how to understand and tame the seductions of email. Have you ever met someone who makes it all look so easy? Maybe she’s earned multiple degrees while working two jobs, all without breaking a sweat. Or maybe he’s the kind of guy with a Midas touch, and every project he tackles turns into a smashing success. Chances are they’re what’s known as a high performer. The author, Brendon Burchard, has conducted one of the biggest studies on high performance in history, examining people from over 190 countries to understand exactly how they achieve their long-term success. He concluded that gender, race, age and personality traits have very little to do with high performance. What really matters are certain key habits, like keeping yourself physically fit. In other words, it’s not who you are, but rather what you do that’s important. The author also discovered that these habits didn’t form by accident. High performers took them on deliberately. Now, don’t confuse these habits with “life hacks” or some simple, magical changes that take zero effort to implement. High performers outperform their peers because they consciously and consistently practice these habits. Another common trait is their confidence in being able to master even difficult tasks, like big new projects at work or learning new languages. Again, this isn’t an inherent trait; it’s an earned confidence achieved through diligent practice. This is good news for you, as it means you too can gain this confidence through practice. With continued practice, you’ll gain more knowledge, master more skills, and your confidence will grow, making it easier to keep learning and growing. This loop of continual growth and self-improvement is the hallmark of high performance. So far, so good, right? Now, without further ado, let’s look at those habits. When was the last time you asked yourself the big questions, such as, how do I want to be remembered? Or, what do I want to do with my life? Many will only think about these questions on their birthday or New Year’s Eve. But high performers ask these questions all the time; it’s a habit the author calls seeking clarity, and it keeps them goal oriented. It also gives them a strong purpose, direction and focus in everything they do, since they know precisely how their actions are helping them reach their goals. Conversely, when you lack clarity, you can end up sulking, mired in negative emotions. Clarity comprises four fields that you need to work on to improve: First is the self and knowing exactly what kind of person you want to become. High performers are focused on becoming the best version of themselves and being remembered this way. This could mean, for instance, being kind, attentive and humble. Once you determine the self you want to be, the question becomes: Have you behaved this way so far and if not, what do you need to change? Second is the social sphere and being aware and intentional about your interactions with others. High performers don’t have an autopilot for socializing. If there’s a lunch date, meeting or party coming up, the question becomes: How can I shape this meeting in a positive way? The third is the field of skills and knowing precisely which talents need to be developed. High performers will focus on a primary profession or field of interest and work on giving themselves time to practice while avoiding all distractions. If you want to be a great writer, this would mean setting aside time to write, not just learn about writing, and then getting feedback to learn what needs improving. The fourth field is service and finding a way to give back to others. High performers excel at working on behalf of others and not just themselves. Doing so helps motivate them while also endowing them with a passionate drive and granting meaning to their work. The question to ask here would be: Who needs me? If you were to list the habits you imagine a successful CEO might have, you might think of efficient scheduling and the ability to keep distractions to a minimum. But you might not think of exercise. People often associate CEOs with mental fitness, but research shows that they’re also physically fit, and their energy levels tend to be similar to those of professional athletes. The author calls the second habit generating energy, and it’s key to maintaining a high performance level. Neuroscientists have found that regular exercise increases the production of new neurons in the areas of your brain that are related to learning and memory. Exercise also improves mood and reduces stress, all of which adds up to greatly enhanced leadership performance. But everyone knows that exercise is good for you, right? High performers stand out because they make routine exercise a habit and stick to it, while underperformers are great at coming up with excuses to avoid working out. As for generating mental energy, this is achieved by having a positive outlook on life. Data shows high performers are more cheerful and positive than their peers, even though their personal and professional lives are no less difficult and troubled. They continually and intentionally focus on the good while avoiding getting mired in negative thinking. And the research suggests that this positive thinking directly relates to high performers leading happier emotional lives and having more mental energy. To get yourself into the habit of positive thinking, take a moment each morning to ask yourself what you have to look forward to in the day ahead. Maybe you’re meeting an old friend for lunch or celebrating a coworker’s birthday. Keep in mind that this isn’t just about staying in a good mood: Neuroscientists believe that anticipating positive events releases as much dopamine – the hormone associated with happiness – as experiencing the event itself. In this way, having a positive outlook is a very powerful tool since you get twice the joy – both in anticipation of the event and again when it actually happens! Let’s imagine two runners about to start a race, waiting for the starting pistol to go off. Both have a similar track record, and each has put in the same amount of training. But there’s one difference: one racer is thinking about the personal glory of winning, while the other is thinking, “I have to win this for my mother.” Who’s going to win? Probably, the latter. That’s because raising the stakes improves performance. The author calls this third habit raising necessity. High performers will bring an extra urgency to the work they’re doing, usually in the form of an outside obligation that is added to their own internal desires. This provides them with more motivation and increases their likelihood of success. Underperformers, on the other hand, will rely solely on their own desire to succeed. This makes their success a preferable outcome, but not a necessary one. So, to put this into practice, you first need to set a high standard for yourself. Remember, you want to master your craft, so don’t settle for simple and easily achievable goals. Now, you’ll also want to attach your personal goal to an external obligation so that a positive outcome will also benefit someone else in your life. If your local charity will gain exposure and a massive windfall of donations as a result of your project’s success, you’ll likely work twice as hard to ensure it comes together. Another high-performer habit for raising the stakes is simply to share your goal with a lot of people. Outside expectations are created, and the act of voicing your goal out loud can increase its importance. No one wants to fail publicly, so the more people you tell, the more committed you’ll feel. When the author set a goal to create an online video course on personal development, he not only told his friends and family about it, he also invited them to be the first to try it out and offer feedback. So his closest social circle was both aware and looking forward to him completing this project, and these expectations all-but guaranteed that Burchard would meet his deadline. It’s terrible to always feel busy and run down, yet still not getting enough done. This is a clear sign that there’s an imbalance between the energy you’re spending and the results you’re seeing. This brings us to the fourth habit of high performance: increasing productivity, which you can do by learning how to separate the important work from the unimportant work. This way, you only spend energy on the tasks that really matter. It’s common for underperformers to pay a lot of attention to small tasks that make them feel productive in the short run but add up to very little in the long run. One of the main offenders is email, on which people spend an average of 28 percent of their working week. This is because the simple act of answering an email can give you a reassuring feeling of accomplishment, even though it’s likely distracting you from more important work. Another important aspect of productivity is timing. Data shows that underperformers are over three times more likely to fall into a false deadline trap, which means that they set a deadline that’s not strictly enforced. Knowing that the due date is preferable, not a must, you won’t feel any motivation to meet it. In short, you’ll be unproductive. But high performers are great at planning, which means creating clear and challenging deadlines and goals. Having a visible finish line ahead of you is a great way to maintain focus, fight distraction and keep your energy levels up, and data shows that a person with a clear and challenging goal will always outperform someone with no strict deadline. Big projects that are carried out over long periods of time can be especially challenging, especially when it comes to staying focused and keeping the momentum going. In these cases, you’ll find it helpful to break the long-term goals down into subgoals of four or five small steps that will get you to that finish line. This way you can stay focused and move forward, even when there are months or years still to go. There’s a popular notion that it’s “lonely at the top,” meaning that once you reach the highest rung of the professional ladder, there will be no one around with whom to share your achievement. But this isn’t the case for high performers, as the research shows them to be quite capable of establishing meaningful and lasting connections with their peers. High performers are appreciative and giving people who aren’t afraid to also challenge those they work with and expect the same from others. In 2016, the American Psychological Association's Work and Well-Being Survey revealed that only half of the workers in the United States feel valued and recognized by their superiors. High-performing managers wouldn’t stand for this. In his study, Burchard found high performers routinely praising and cheering on their staff. They’re also more likely to notice and appreciate good work. High performers were found to have a giving mind-set – the fifth habit. They’re well aware of the struggles and desires of others and use that knowledge to provide people with what they need. They also know that their staff need the trust and freedom to make their own decisions. Having this power is a great motivator, and high performers are both aware and respectful of this. Being perceptive and aware of what people need to grow allows high performers to assign the right tasks to the right people so they can reach the next level. And when a high performer needs something themselves, they don’t hesitate to ask for a favor. This is something underperformers often resist for fear of being judged or rejected, even though statistics show that the average person will get a positive response three times more often than they expect. In fact, fears of being harshly judged by our peers are generally overestimated. The truth is, most people are too busy to spend time thinking about you, so relax! Are you the kind of person who prefers to be left alone in their comfort zone? If so, how much pressure does it take for you to break out? For high performers, risk-taking isn’t unusual at all. In fact, demonstrating courage is the sixth and final habit of high performers, and it goes hand-in-hand with gaining a positive perspective on challenging situations. Again, attitudes like these aren’t inherent personality traits; they’re characteristics that high-performing individuals have practiced and worked at over time. They recognize that taking bold action involves a higher risk of failing – that’s why these moves are considered bold! But high performers have learned how to overcome their fear and take action. With practice, you too can make bold decisions. And just like high performers, you can even come to enjoy the thrill of taking risks. Making a risky move is like any other learned skill – it gets easier the more you do it, so all you need to do is start taking those leaps. Like parachuting, the first time is always filled with panic and dread, but after each jump, it gradually becomes a little easier and less stressful. Most people will avoid any kind of struggle, but being extraordinary and reaching your goals means learning how to greet challenges with a smile. It’s all about having the right perspective, and rather than complaining about life being difficult, higher performers will see each new challenge as an opportunity to grow. One of the commonest bold acts is being open and honest about one’s true ambitions. This is another behavior that many will avoid due to unwanted judgment or ridicule. While the average person prefers to work toward their dreams in silence, high performers don’t hold back despite being fully aware that someone might call them “delusional,” “unrealistic” or even “crazy.” For them, it’s all part of life’s precious struggle. So don’t waste another day. Now’s the time to open yourself up to the world and all the good and bad it has to offer. By being open, you’ll find that there are a lot of people out there just waiting to help turn your dreams into reality. The key message in this book: High performers are not born extraordinary; they grow through steady and persistent practice that involves a conscious attempt to master certain habits. They are highly aware of the purpose of their work, stay energetic, use external motivators, know how to increase productivity through careful planning, regularly connect and give to those around and take bold risks. Actionable advice: Seek clarity in your social interactions. Don’t just enter a social interaction on autopilot. Ask yourself beforehand: How can I be a good person in the upcoming situation? What will the other person expect? What kind of mood and energy do I want to create, and how can I act to achieve that outcome? Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

In addition, you’ll learn why a higher credit score can lead to a greater chance of a default; why abolishing the gold standard helped people get out of debt; and why the dot-com bubble wasn’t nearly as severe as the Great Recession.

From 2000 to 2007, US household debt essentially doubled in size, reaching $14 trillion. Likewise, the ratio of debt owed to income earned also jumped to an unprecedented level, from 1.4 to 2.1. Similarly, household debt was also the key factor during the Great Depression. In the 1920s, the ratio of consumer debt to income more than doubled, while urban mortgage debt tripled. These large debt loads cause severe consumer spending cuts, and intensify the harsh effects of a subsequent recession. In fact, there’s a clear correlation between the amount of household debt before a recession and the amount of spending cuts observed during the downturn. This was borne out by multiple studies showing that across Europe and Asia, increases in household debt in the decade leading up to the recession correlated to declines in spending after 2007. For example, Ireland and Denmark both had greater jumps in household debt than the United States, and also more severe cuts in household spending. Thus we can predict the severity of a recession by looking at data about consumer debt, and gauging likely cuts in consumer spending. As we’ll see, these household debt increases are devastating to the economy, because without these elevated levels of debt, banking-crisis recessions are unexceptional. In fact, banking-crisis recessions with low levels of private debt are similar to normal recessions. The desire to own a home drove many into serious debt in the early 2000s – ultimately creating a housing bubble. This bubble disproportionately affected the poorest borrowers for two reasons. First, interest payments flow from the poor to the rich: If you buy a house using a loan from the bank, you’re the junior claim on the mortgage; the bank is the senior claim. Any losses in house prices are absorbed first by junior claims on the mortgage; only further losses affect the senior claims lender. The second reason those with less are disproportionately affected? For most borrowers, the majority of their equity is tied into their home. So when housing prices drop, their equity drops along with it. So those who borrow the most also lose the most. Meanwhile, the rich borrow less, have less debt and consequently suffer less as a result of economic downturns. Before the recession, the poorest fifth of the US population had 80 percent debt to 20 percent assets. By comparison, the richest fifth had ten percent debt and 90 percent assets. And these startling debt-to-asset ratios are only the beginning: Borrowers are hit even harder by negative equity and foreclosures. By 2011, nearly 25 percent of all mortgaged properties had a negative equity, meaning these homes were worth less than their initial value. So if the owners wanted to sell, they would owe the difference to their lender. Foreclosure is another harmful consequence of the housing bubble. When homeowners default on payments, the banks can foreclose the property and sell it at discounted levels. Foreclosures have a profoundly harmful effect on the economy, because they tend to push down all housing prices. For example, a foreclosure will reduce the price of other homes in the neighborhood, even if they carry no debt. During the recession, there were three times more foreclosures than in 2001 (the previous peak). In fact, foreclosures were so common that together with short sales, they made up 40 percent of total house sales. When homeowners see their net worth collapse, they sharply cut spending. As we’ll see in later blinks, this affects jobs across the entire economy. The degree of these spending cuts depends on individual indebtedness: Borrowers with a heavy debt tend to react strongly to shocks to the value of their assets. So when their house’s value drops, their buying habits will change in response. For example, in California’s Central Valley, the effects of the Great Recession were stark: Households saw their net worth reduced by half due to tumbling housing prices in 2007. By 2008, spending on cars had fallen by 35 percent. And then by 2009, overall spending was down by 30 percent. By contrast, those without much debt didn’t see a significant decline in net worth, so they continued spending at pre-recession levels. But eventually, reduced consumer demand from the indebted households led to nationwide job losses, which impacted the entire economy. How does this work? Well, it’s easy to see why lower consumer spending in areas hit by a collapse in housing prices would lead to the loss of nontradable jobs – those dependant on local spending, like retailers and restaurants. But these weren’t the only kinds of jobs that were affected. So were tradable jobs – jobs related to the production of consumer goods, like cars and electronics. In fact, there was a massive drop in these jobs nationwide, even in areas that didn’t experience a significant debt-driven downturn. For example, Iowa didn’t have a housing bubble. In fact, its debt levels were far lower than the national average. The state even increased spending during the recession. Despite this, tradable jobs fell by ten percent, because indebted households nationwide had less disposable income to spend. Are you trying to figure out what role the financial services industry played in the Great Recession? Well, read on to find out. As we’ve seen, declining housing prices had a devastating effect on the economy. But what caused the housing bubble? One major factor: Mortgages were given to households with low credit scores and declining income growth. Astonishingly, in low credit-score neighborhoods, borrowers with lower income growth received more mortgage credit than those with higher income growth. In fact, between 2002 and 2005, mortgage application denial rates in low credit-score neighborhoods declined from 42 percent to 30 percent. Accordingly, the number of mortgages in those areas grew by 30 percent each year. By comparison, in neighborhoods with high credit scores, there was only a tiny decline in denial rates, and the number of mortgages grew by just 11 percent annually. Housing prices soared due to this expansion of credit, creating a bubble. And although some believe this occurred because lenders irrationally thought they’d be safe to take on borrowers with bad credit if prices magically continued to rise, this wasn’t the case. As we know by looking at housing supply in various cities, prices rose due to debt, and not the other way around. We can see this clearly when we compare cities with an elastic housing supply, like Indianapolis (which is flat, spacious and can expand with housing demand), to those with an inelastic supply, like San Francisco (which has a terrain that restricts new housing developments). When lenders started giving mortgages to people in low credit-score zip codes living in elastic cities, demand for housing went up. But more houses could be built, so prices didn’t spike. On the other hand, in inelastic cities, supply couldn’t keep up with demand. House prices in high credit-score zip codes increased by 50 percent. And crucially, low credit-score housing prices saw a much steeper house price increase, up by 100 percent. So ultimately, the housing bubble was fueled by zealous lending to borrowers who had little chance of paying off their new debts. Why didn’t anyone notice that these high-risk mortgages were so dangerous before they collapsed and brought down the economy? It’s partly because they were pooled together with other mortgages, so their risks were thought to be offset by safer investments. The history of this financial practice goes back to the 1970s, when the US government began buying mortgages from local banks, combining them and then selling investors a cut of the pooled interest and principal payments – what’s called mortgage backed securities (MBS). These mortgages had to satisfy strict criteria (for example, the borrower had to have a high credit score) in order to be accepted. But in the 1990s, mortgages that didn’t conform to these criteria found a home with private-label MBS, which used a structure called tranching. These mortgage pools had multiple layers, from a super-safe senior tranche to lower, high-risk layers. This complex system of tranches misled some investors, who were overly optimistic about the level of risk associated with the precarious underlying mortgages. Ultimately, private-label MBS led to lowered lending standards. For example, in order to be accepted into one of these mortgage pools, the borrower’s credit score had to be above 620. However, borrowers with credit scores just above this cut-off defaulted more often than those just below it. Furthermore, borrowers with credit scores just below 620 (those holding mortgages that weren’t pooled as securities) were less likely to default. Two factors explain the divergent default rates which occurred among borrowers with similar credit scores. First, these private mortgage pools didn’t require any proof of income. On the other hand, when banks kept a mortgage instead of securitizing it, they were much more careful to check income. The second reason for these divergent default rates? Ten percent of loans in private-label MBS were misclassified as owner-occupier, even though they were actually investor-owned. Owner-occupied mortgages are viewed as less risky and are therefore more likely to attract investors. This practice highlights the level of fraud used to fool investors into thinking that they were buying super-safe securities. So, now that you understand what led to the Great Recession of 2007, read on to find out what we can do to avoid similar economic collapses in the future. When the Great Recession first reared its head, the US government used taxpayer money to protect banks, so that they could carry on lending money. Bailouts were supposed to improve the economy, but they didn’t work. To understand why banks were in trouble, it’s worth remembering that loans are assets to a bank. So when indebted households began defaulting around 2006, bank assets suffered. In autumn 2008, the cost of financing at banks shot up, which meant that loans to businesses were in high demand. The borrowing and lending system that powers so much of our economy was in distress, and it only improved after the Fed intervened to supply funding. But by early 2009, the government had pumped huge amounts of equity into large financial institutions, thus protecting shareholders and creditors, and ultimately allowing banks to continue lending. But bank loans to business continued falling in late 2008, despite the government bailout – indicating a massive drop in demand for bank loans. So though banks were no longer in trouble, the economy still suffered. So, what was going wrong? Well, as we learned in previous blinks, it all comes down to collapsed consumer spending. This was reflected in attitudes toward the downturn: One study asked small business for their biggest concern during the financial crisis. Just five percent cited bank financing or interest rates; on the other hand, concerns about poor sales were at 35 percent, up from ten percent before the recession. Compare this to what happened when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, leading to a $5 trillion drop in stock prices. This seems like a huge sum, but ultimately, the consequences for the entire economy weren’t nearly as bad as what happened during the Great Recession. Why is that? Well, owners of these hyped stocks tended to come from wealthy households with little debt. And in fact, spending across the economy actually increased between 2000 and 2002, despite the stock collapse. What should we do to improve the economy after a debt-driven downturn? Today, the Federal Reserve can try to stimulate spending by lowering interest rates, but it can’t control the amount of currency in circulation and it also can’t force inflation. And although government spending can improve economic vitality – every dollar of defense spending leads to $1.50 of economic output – it’s financed by taxpayers, hurting the very people who need that money for consumer spending. Instead of fighting recessions by stimulating inflation or engaging in public spending, governments should restructure and forgive debt, which would benefit both debtors and creditors. Debt-driven recessions not only arise due to debt, but also lead to deflation and wage decreases – a vicious circle which makes it harder for consumers to pay back debt, thus extending the lifetime of a recession. This approach has a historical precedent: During the Great Depression, creditors could demand repayment of loans in gold. Then the United States left the gold standard, the dollar lost value and the gold standard repayment clause was abolished. Since debtors could repay with newly devalued dollars, the policy was, in effect, a huge debt forgiveness program. In our time, the best solution to high levels of housing debt may be mortgage cram downs. Borrowers who can’t pay their mortgage could arrange new payment plans with lower interest and lower overall balancing, ultimately ensuring that they were no longer in negative equity. To see how this works, imagine you’re about to default on your loan. The bank repossesses your house and resells it at a steep discount. But instead, you could negotiate a cram down: declare bankruptcy, keep the house and pay back a smaller amount. And ultimately, the bank wouldn’t lose as much money through the highly reduced prices associated with foreclosure. Ultimately, this approach would motivate you to keep up your payments, and the bank to maintain high standards – while still forgiving some of the debt. How can we reform our financial system to prevent the next severe recession? One proposal for avoiding debt-driven recessions is for shared responsibility mortgages (SRMs), which are more like equity than debt. Under this system, the lender protects the borrower if the home price drops, while the borrower agrees to share five percent of capital gains on the house. So if house prices rise, the interest payments remain constant, like standard mortgages. However, if the house prices drop, the total mortgage payments would fall in line with a local house price index, allowing the borrower to keep up with payments (thus avoiding default), while still maintaining equity in the house. And then, even if someone had trouble paying their mortgage, they could still sell their equity – allowing them to move somewhere cheaper and avoid a foreclosure. In addition to preventing foreclosures, SRMs would also lead to less negative equity and (if housing prices fall) less decline in net worth among low-income households. And by tying mortgage payments to the local house price index, SRMs also encourage more household spending, preventing job losses across the economy. In addition, one of the biggest advantages of a world with SRMs is that they would produce billions of dollars in spending due to more stable housing prices and higher consumer spending – with absolutely no increase in government expenditures. How does this work, exactly? Well, for example, higher consumer spending in 2006 would have prevented the economy from losing at least one million jobs, according to the authors’ calculations. Each job saved adds even more to overall spending, due to the spending multiplier. When we factor the spending multiplier into our SRM calculation, total job losses in 2006 could have been reduced by up to four million – ultimately preventing a recession. The key message in this book: Recessions are usually preceded by a huge build-up of consumer debt and then a large drop in household spending, leading to job losses across the entire economy. During the Great Recession, banks fueled the housing bubble by giving mortgages to borrowers who couldn’t afford them, and complex financial instruments hid dangerous lending practices and fraudulent activity.

After years of hard work, rising early and coming home late, your time is your own – and you deserve it. Although retirement sounds like a long-term vacation, being retired isn’t as easy as you might think. Retirement requires careful preparation. You’ll need to adjust your spending, take care of your health and plan your free time wisely. These blinks will show you how to best prepare for retirement. You’ll learn about different retirement plans, ways to ensure your financial well-being and different paths toward starting a new life. Importantly, you’ll discover how to make retirement a wonderful time. In these blinks, you’ll also learn what America’s best retirement plan looks like; why working as long as you can before retirement does pay; and what the number four has to do with perfect retirement planning. Yesterday, you were an active member of the workforce. Today, you’re retired. What will be your first step in this new phase of life? Many people feel lost at the start of retirement. Fortunately, you can make sure you’re not this type of retiree by planning ahead. Retirement is challenging, as it’s a leap into the unknown. After all, what's the first thing you say when you introduce yourself to a new person? You share your profession: “I'm a lawyer,” or “I'm a teacher.” As a society, we often define people by job. Going into retirement can then feel as if you’ve lost your social identity. Plenty of people lie in bed all day when they first retire. While this might sound like a vacation, even vacations get boring if you're not doing anything. Planning your days is crucial. There are five retirement stages. Let's go over each to ensure your retirement will be successful. First, there's preretirement. During this stage you slowly disengage yourself from daily work. You start imagining what your life will look like when you retire. Second, there’s the honeymoon or your first taste of freedom. As a newly minted retiree, you now get to spend as much time as you like on leisure activities, such as fishing, painting, reading or playing with your grandchildren. Next comes disenchantment. In this stage, the days may start to feel long, and you might start missing your daily routine at work. You overcome disenchantment by entering the fourth stage, reorientation. Here you refocus on the things that matter most to you and start adjusting to your new financial situation. Once you've reoriented, you reach the fifth stage: stability. Stability is about settling in and enjoying the new rhythm of your life. It's important to take care of your health during your retirement. You never know when doctor bills might start to add up, so make sure you have adequate insurance. If you want to receive the best coverage for the best price, however, you need to understand how health insurance works. In the United States, your age plays the biggest role in determining your coverage. Americans over 65 have Medicare – a national insurance program – available to them, if they meet Social Security requirements, which stipulate that an individual needs to have worked at least 40 quarters. Medicare ensures that those who qualify are covered for the rest of their lives. It's more complicated for people under 65, as there is no federal health safety net. People under the retirement age usually have health insurance provided by an employer. Don't worry about losing your coverage if you're out of a job, however. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often called Obamacare, makes health insurance affordable for everyone and forbids companies from refusing coverage if an applicant has a preexisting medical condition. Of course, you should aim to be healthy before you retire. Try to keep treatment costs down, too. Take advantage of preventive services, such as mammograms, cancer screenings or colonoscopies, as the ACA makes most of these services free. Remember: the cheapest medical care is treatment that you don't have to pay for at all! Don't be afraid to discuss price with your doctor, either. Compare treatment costs and let your health provider know if you've found a better deal. If you're not comfortable negotiating, now is the time to learn! Finally, try to stay away from expensive hospital emergency rooms. Chain stores such as CVS and Walgreens offer walk-in clinics that can address most minor ailments. These clinics offer flu shots, too. Your regular salary ends when retirement starts. That means it's time to start managing your budget! Organizing your spending is a core part of retiring well. You can't expect to be rescued by stock market gains or a winning lottery ticket if you burn through your savings early. So try to rightsize your life as early as possible, by finding a balance in which your annual budget matches your cost of living. Many people make the mistake of going into retirement thinking, “I've saved $250,000. That should be enough!” But numbers mean nothing if you live beyond your means. You need to calculate what you can afford to spend, considering retirement revenue and expenses, and then set out a detailed spending plan. Let's look at the details of how to build a spending plan. Start by going through bank statements and checkbooks to get a clear understanding of your spending habits. Next, cut out all work-related expenses. You’ll no longer be buying suits or spending piles of cash on commuting, for example. Then factor in the money you’ll start to receive as a pensioner: your pension, real estate revenue, Social Security, annuities and so on. Don't forget to add income from financial assets. If you have $100,000 in savings or investments, for example, you'll probably earn something like four percent interest on those accounts. Once you've compared revenue and expenses, you'll see how much you have left to spend. Only then can you figure out if you need to curtail your lifestyle. If you find you need to live on a much tighter budget, for example, you might have to make big changes, like selling your home and moving into an apartment. It's still possible to receive an income after you've retired, as the US federal program Social Security pays retirement benefits to qualified individuals. Social Security retirement benefits are the best available retirement plan in the United States. These benefits provide lifelong income which is immune to inflation. Your Social Security payments can also be claimed by your spouse when you pass away. The best part about Social Security benefits is that they are risk-free. It's a level of security of which a stock market investor could only dream! Social Security benefits are easy to qualify for, too: you have to be over the age of 62 and have worked for at least ten years. Your Social Security retirement benefits grow every year you don’t collect, so be strategic when you decide it’s time to claim your checks. The earlier you do so, the lower your payments will be. You can claim retirement benefits as soon as you're 62, but your monthly checks will be 33 percent higher if you wait until you're 66. And if you wait until you are 70 years old, your checks will be 76 percent higher. See, the wait makes a big difference! Some people have to claim benefits earlier, of course. Yet if you can, think twice before you decide to collect. Ask yourself: Is there any way I can get by for another three or four years? You might have left a job, but could you work part-time, for example? You could consider covering bills with savings, too. It might make you insecure to live off your savings for a while, but doing so could make what you claim from Social Security much higher down the line. Traditional pensions aren't popular these days, as most people prefer to collect benefits as a lump sum. Let's look closer at the differences in pension options. Pension plans offer two ways to receive benefits. One is through fixed monthly payments. You'll never stop receiving payments, even if you live to be 120 years old! The downside of fixed monthly payments is inflation. Your benefits don't change with the rate of inflation, so a rising cost of living, for example, will slowly chip away at that fixed amount. You can also receive pension benefits as a lump sum, and then store your money in a bank account. The downside in doing so is that you have to personally invest your money to make it grow, putting it in stocks or bonds. Yet if you invest, you also take on risk; you could jeopardize your retirement savings if you bet on the wrong stocks! As you weigh these two options, base your final choice on the state of your health and your skills as an investor. If you're risk-averse and healthy, decide for a traditional pension paid out in monthly installments. There's no need to risk your entire pension if you don't want to become an investment banker! You might want to seek guidance from a financial advisor, but be careful: many are scam artists. Moreover, if you're in good health, you might enjoy a long retirement. If you're a talented investor, however, go for the lump sum. Monthly payments are probably too little for you if you know your way around money and want to take on investment risk. Receiving a final paycheck is painful. It's especially tough when you don't know when the next check might arrive. There's another way to receive additional money once you’ve retired, however. Insurance companies offer financial products called annuities. Annuities are basically pension plans with regular payments, adjusted for inflation, that you “purchase.” You can buy annuities through insurance agents, financial advisors or banks. Imagine a retired man who is 65 years old. If he buys an annuity worth $100,000 at current rates, he would receive a $556 monthly payment for the rest of his life. The older you are when you purchase an annuity, the higher the monthly payment. If you purchase an annuity when you're 70, for example, at current rates you would receive a monthly check worth $642. Annuities aren't risk-free, however. Be aware of the sucker factor. Imagine this man instead dies a year after he purchased an annuity for himself alone. In this case, the insurance company wouldn't pay out his annuity to his relatives. It is this sort of situation that allows insurance companies to meet payment obligations for people who live longer than average. While annuities carry some risk, they're still a good retirement savings option. Imagine the same man invests his $100,000 in stocks instead. If the man earned $333 monthly, for example, this would constitute a stable investment return. Yet it would still be less than an annuity would pay. So if you factor in the stress of managing stocks and the potential risk of losing everything, annuities are an attractive possibility for managing your money during retirement. Ask retirees what they wish they had done differently, and most will answer, “I wish I’d saved more money.” But it's never too late to start saving if you use a retirement plan! Retirement plans are a great option for soon-to-be pensioners. Employment-based retirement plans are simple to understand. A certain amount of money is automatically deducted from each paycheck and set aside, usually invested in mutual funds. Employees contribute an average of 8.8 percent of their salary from their mid-50s to mid-60s. For employees age 65 or older, it's 10.1 percent. The best part of a retirement plan is that it may allow you to set money aside that is tax-deferred – or depending on the plan, even tax-free! The type of retirement plan for which you're eligible depends on where you work, but conditions are roughly the same across the United States. And it doesn't matter if you're about to retire and haven't yet started saving: it's never too late! Yet you might be thinking, “What's the point of saving money I'll need in a couple of years?” Remember you won’t withdraw all your cash from your plan at once. A big chunk will stay in your account and will keep growing, with a tax break! That means you can earn a lot in the last few years of your career. It can even make your savings plan profitable. The amount you can contribute to your plan is capped, however. In 2016, you could save a maximum of $18,000 a year, plus an extra $6,000 for contributors over the age of 50. How much money can you take out each year without running out? That can seem tricky, but the four percent rule can help you. Financial advisor Bill Bengen came up with the four percent rule 25 years ago, and it's been the golden rule of financial planning ever since. According to the four percent rule, you can withdraw four percent of your total savings each year of your retirement. If you stick to this percentage, your savings should last at least 30 years. Let's say you start with $100,000, which means you can withdraw $4,000 for your first year of retirement. If inflation runs at three percent the following year, you can withdraw $4,000 along with an additional $120 (three percent of $4,000). The third year, you can withdraw $4,120 and another $124 for inflation, and so on over the next years. It's still important to invest your money or generate income from interest. Research on the four percent rule has shown that it's wise to invest half your money in government bonds, with maturities of four to ten years. Invest the other half of your savings in blue chip stocks – stocks in well-established, highly profitable companies that come with little risk, such as Boeing or General Electric. If you don't feel comfortable placing half your savings in stocks, then lower your yearly withdrawal rate. All in all, it's up to you to balance your risks and expenses. Retirement is supposed to be relaxing and enjoyable. So make sure you get the most out of it by planning in advance. It's never too early to start thinking about your retirement! The key message in this book: Retirement can be the best time of your life, or it can be frightening and stressful. It all depends on how well you plan ahead. Sort out health care needs, assess how much investment risk you want to take on and find a pension plan that works for you. It's never too early to start preparing! Actionable advice: Plan your free time, too! Retirement is supposed to be about leisure, so make lists of the activities you’d like to explore. Are you interested in art? Languages? Technology?

Sadly, professional women still experience challenges that their male counterparts don’t. While men are praised for taking risks and asserting themselves, women are held to a different standard. They’re rewarded for being nice and helping others – qualities associated with supporting roles, rather than leadership roles. Many women have adapted to these challenges by developing bad habits in an effort to prove their worth. By understanding and identifying your own unconscious learned behaviors, you can eliminate the unhelpful traits that are holding you back at work. In these blinks, you’ll learn why becoming an expert can be a bad career move; how unfair expectations follow women from school to the workplace; and that taking up more than one chair is a clever career move. Several years ago, one of the authors, Sally Helgesen, decided to interview successful professional women. Her aim was to find out what these women saw in the behavior of their younger colleagues that could be holding them back. The verdict was unanimous – the younger women all struggled with the word “I.” Reluctance to take credit for personal achievements is a common problem among professional women. When the author discussed the topic with women with senior positions in accounting, consulting and law, they all agreed that younger female employees in their firm were conscientious, consistent and delivered work of a very high standard. It was even noted that they often worked harder than their male counterparts. Their weakness didn’t lie in the quality of the work – it lay in their discomfort with drawing attention to their successes and taking credit for their accomplishments. For instance, they would underplay their own role in a team’s success, preferring to spread credit around than to acknowledge their hard work in front of senior colleagues. This is a problem that the author has observed in the numerous workshops she’s conducted with diverse groups of professional women, and it’s evident in nearly every industry at every level in the workplace hierarchy. Although seen as polite, being overly modest is more likely to harm a woman’s career than advance it. Over the course of their careers, both the authors have observed how men tend to distrust women who are self-deprecating about their achievements, considering them inauthentic. If a woman demonstrates this tendency in a management role, she also risks diminishing the accomplishments of the team she leads. As a manager, any failure to claim credit on behalf of the people she represents is a failure to acknowledge their hard work. By not recognizing the efforts of her team, she will end up demoralizing and being resented by her staff. Nobody’s perfect. So why do so many people still strive for perfection? Why do they feel the need to be pleasant, thoughtful and make others feel good at all times? Such behavior is known as the “disease to please,” and it’s particularly common among women. Women have been conditioned to please everyone around them, both at home and in public, while men are not taught to put others first. It’s a form of socialization that starts in childhood. Research has found that, from a young age, girls are more likely to receive praise from parents and teachers for deferring to others. They’re encouraged to be obedient, helpful and agreeable. Simply, they are more likely than boys to be rewarded for being pleasant. And this doesn’t end once they leave home or school. Working environments foster this need to please in women. For instance, businesses often employ women in entry- and mid-level roles with a focus on assisting others – roles in which their success depends on their ability to fulfill the needs of others, where being assertive is not seen as an asset. While often sold as a positive attribute, an excessive desire to please others holds women back. Women who have a need to please fear letting people down. They fear making others unhappy, even temporarily. For instance, many professional women feel unable to say no to jobs or tasks others ask them to take on, even though undertaking these activities won’t bring them any benefit. Why? Because they know it will displease the asker. This mindset robs women of their capacity to exercise authority, as they’re too scared of upsetting others by doing so. This is particularly unhelpful for women in positions of leadership, where their performance is evaluated according to their ability to assert authority. Even further down the career ladder, women in non-leadership positions are held back by the pleasing disease. So, if you want to be successful, don’t let your desire to please others get in the way of your ability to be direct and decisive. What’s the surest strategy for success? You might think it has something to do with putting in extra hours to master all facets of your job. But in reality, developing expertise within your current role won’t help you progress. In fact, it will keep you on the lower rungs of the career ladder. It’s common for female professionals to feel the need to go above and beyond to be taken seriously at work. If you’re a woman working in a traditionally male-dominated industry, chances are from the moment you arrived you felt under pressure to prove your competence. Perhaps a male colleague was reluctant to have a woman on his team and you tried to gain his respect by becoming a super contributor. Many women have internalized this attitude – the fear that they don’t really deserve to be in their position – and see developing excessive expertise as a means to prove they’re worthy. For instance, one professional woman working in software development reported that previous sexist comments led her to focus excessively on detail, rather than the big picture when she landed her first position. Keen to prove that she deserved her job, she concentrated on outperforming on any assignment she was given and made a name for herself as the team’s most reliable hard-grafter. However, if you have your eyes on promotion, developing so much expertise isn’t a good way to position yourself for a step up. Why? Because spending so much time and effort on small details leaves you with less time to nurture your workplace relationships. For instance, the aforementioned software engineer found that, as she progressed in her career, the ability to forge meaningful connections with the company’s clients was viewed as a far more valuable skill than the ability to keep her head down and churn out perfect engineering work at her desk. Furthermore, as a professional woman, you need to show that you’re the perfect fit for the role you aspire to, not for the role you’re currently in. If you become an expert in your current role, your boss will come to see you as indispensable and make an effort to keep you where you are. Several years ago, the author attended a board meeting of a national women’s group. As the board members arrived, she observed how the men in the room who were already seated made no attempt to move when newcomers entered looking for a place to sit. The women, on the other hand, responded to each newcomer by moving to take up less space around the table. Why, she asked herself, were the women trying to make themselves smaller? Unconsciously, women tend to minimize their presence and make themselves physically smaller in professional environments. This can be seen in the way they cross their legs, press their arms to the sides of their bodies, and keep their belongings close and neatly arranged. In contrast, men spread out as far as possible. They put their arms over the seats next to them, sit with their legs spread and their belongings scattered about. A woman’s tendency to minimize herself doesn’t just manifest itself physically but verbally, too. A study by Harvard Business School discovered that women are more likely to use phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as, “This might not be important, but…” Such verbal and physical minimizing behaviors can hold women back. Neuroscientists have conducted research that found that by drawing our limbs towards us and shrinking ourselves, we undermine any attempt to communicate power and authority. Making ourselves smaller is a submissive behavior. Just think of how a dog tucks its tail under when submitting to a more dominant dog. Further research shows that business leaders and others in positions of power interpret such signs of uncertainty as a lack of commitment. You can see how, without thinking, you may be projecting a timid, uncommitted image at work. Counter this by actively taking up space and not being afraid to say what you mean. Do you ever find yourself dwelling on past mistakes? Do you find it hard to move on mentally, even though an event is behind you? Maybe you’re constantly mulling over what went wrong, what you could have done differently or imagining how things might have been. If these thought patterns sound familiar, there’s a high chance you’re a woman. Routinely dwelling on mistakes and regrets is known as rumination, and it’s a classic female tendency. While both sexes are equally likely to fixate on negative events in their past, men tend to deal with these thoughts by blaming others for perceived failures and excusing themselves from responsibility. By turning their regret outward, men express this feeling as anger. According to research, this is the emotion men are most comfortable expressing. Women, on the other hand, are much more likely to blame themselves for mistakes. Psychological research suggests that women are more likely to believe they are at fault for anything that goes wrong and stress over minor errors. When regret is directed inward, it becomes rumination. Excessive rumination can lead to devastating psychological consequences and is counterproductive for work. This has been demonstrated by psychological research, which identified chronic rumination as a direct cause of depression. In other words, thinking too much about past regrets can make you seriously depressed in the present. And this behavior can also hold you back when it comes to taking action to overcome whatever it was that led you to ruminate in the first place. When you’re so busy mulling things over, it drains the mental energy you need to think about actual solutions to your problems. So, when you find yourself dwelling on regrets, remember that analysis equals paralysis. Stop blaming yourself and just let go of the past. Are you a self-proclaimed perfectionist? We sell this as a positive attribute, but striving for perfection can be the very opposite. Julie Johnson is an executive professional coach. One of the most common problems she sees in clients is the struggle to overcome perfectionism. After all, perfection is an unrealistic goal. When you inevitably fail to achieve it, you can’t help but feel stressed and disappointed in yourself. Another of Johnson’s significant findings is that – in her experience – perfectionism is an especially female problem, which has roots in childhood. From the moment of birth, gender expectations are imposed on children, and these expectations make women far more likely than men to grow up believing they must be perfect to be of value. Just think about how different sexes are rewarded. Girls are praised for obedience and academic achievement, whereas boys are given freedom. A “naughty boy” is seen as charming and entertaining, but girls who break the rules are penalized. For instance, at school, girls are much more likely than boys to be punished for aggressive behavior and acting out. In order to gain approval, girls are encouraged to do everything by the book, to avoid making mistakes and to be extra diligent. That’s where the female quest for perfection begins. Even as adults in the workplace, women are subject to society’s expectation that they should be perfect. This has devastating consequences for their careers. There is even research to back this up. Carlos Marin, a successful executive coach, has analyzed coaching data along with the results of numerous psychology surveys done by professionals. He found that men at the executive level were more likely to be rewarded for behavior that displayed a willingness to take risks. In contrast, female executives were rewarded for their precision and accuracy. Fear of making even small mistakes holds women back from taking risks. Unfortunately, taking risks is necessary to reach CEO level, as it’s this quality that allows a business to grow and evolve. Women are effectively creating their own glass ceiling by being perfectionists. If women are to rise through the ranks, they must ditch the heavy burden of perfection that’s been placed on them by society. In order to rise to the top of their chosen profession, women must stop attempting to be perfect, quit trying to please everyone all the time and stop dwelling on their past mistakes. By developing the confidence to take up more physical space, making the right social connections at work and owning their own accomplishments, women can meet their full potentials.  Actionable advice: Talk less to get ahead. It's proven that women tend to talk more than men do. In fact, research has found that the average woman speaks 20,000 words per day, whereas men speak just 7,000. While the female gift of gab is highly useful for building close relationships, it can be a hindrance in a male-dominated or corporate workplace. In these contexts, the typical male qualities of succinctness and concision are associated with authority and professionalism. Therefore, to excel in these environments, women should practice paring their communications down to the minimum and considering in advance the precise message they want to get across. Got feedback?

We’re usually told it’s some combination of hard work, original ideas and single-mindedly pursuing your goals. That amounts to a pretty flattering portrait of today’s top capitalists, but it’s well wide of the mark in most cases.  For every creative genius like Steve Jobs, there are a hundred self-starters who broke every rule in the business playbook. Instead of creating their own dazzling products, they copied their rivals and put their own twist on already successful ideas. Rather than blazing their own trail through the market, they chose the path of least resistance and let others do the hard work. Sound unfair? Well, who cares? It works!  That’s the credo of Nathan Latka, a multimillionaire who started out with just a little more than a hundred bucks in his bank account. Along the way, he realized that you don’t have to follow other people’s rules – in fact, bucking conventional ideas is pretty much mandatory if you want to make it big.  In these blinks, we’ll explore his recipe for success and find out why multitasking is better than sticking to one core skill;  how to outsource basic tasks and free up time for more valuable activities; and  how to get the most out of your existing assets. You’ve heard it a thousand times: your best chance of success is to pick a single career path, knuckle down and stick to it. It’s an age-old philosophy as dear to parents as it is to professors. And here’s the thing: it’s not far off the mark if you want to be a hardworking neurosurgeon. But what if you don’t?  Well, if you want to make money without working endless hours, you’ll need to rebel against that rule. Sticking to a single career path means putting all your eggs in one basket. If things don’t work out or you get fed up, you’ll be left without a backup plan. But even if you do make it, you’ll always be vulnerable to competition. After all, there’s always a chance an even better neurosurgeon, banker or entrepreneur will come along and snag your clients.  So here’s the alternative: avoid specializing in one narrow field, and guarantee your financial success by cultivating multiple sources of revenue. That has a couple of advantages. First off, you’ve always got something to fall back on if your venture fails. When you spread your bets, you’re much less likely to go broke. Secondly and more importantly, multiple income streams mean you can multiply your overall revenue.  Consider the author. He launched his podcast, Top Entrepreneurs, in 2016. That’s a nice little earner. Sponsors pay to have their content hosted on the show, and the more listeners he has, the more they’re willing to fork out. But it isn’t his only source of income. He also has a business called Top Inbox, a tool that allows Gmail users to add special features to their accounts, like scheduling already-written emails to be sent out at a later date.  Placing pop-ups on the Top Inbox user interface exposes even more internet users to his sponsors’ websites. It’s a win-win situation: they love the extra exposure, and the author can charge more for hosting their content on his podcast. His current going rate for an advertising slot on his podcast? $160,000! Copying others has a bad rep. We’re told that its unethical and that it’s a badge of honor to only start your own business once you’ve had a brilliantly original idea of your own. That’s the second rule you’ll need to break if you want to be a successful capitalist.  There are no two ways about it: the most successful companies out there copy their competitors all the time. They always have and they always will. It’s the unspoken truth known to all top entrepreneurs. The trick is to be subtle about it. Companies don’t just rip each other off – they take someone else’s idea and give it a little tweak, like applying it to an adjacent industry.  Take Wealthfront, an investment management company that uses the latest software to manage its clients’ assets. It was the first firm in the financial sector to introduce a policy that rewards existing customers for helping bring in new clients. If their recommendations bring a new punter through the door, they receive financial management services to the value of $10,000. This was a new concept in Wealthfront’s field, but it wasn’t CEO Andy Rachleff’s own idea. As he was the first to admit, he’d pinched it from the file-hosting service Dropbox, which was offering users extra digital storage space if they referred their friends to the company.  But you don’t have to be a massive company to apply this strategy. In fact, it works just as well for small businesses. The place to start is identifying the patterns that make your competitors successful. One way of doing it is to use online marketplaces like Etsy and check out what rival firms are up to. Let’s take a look at how that works.  Say you want to produce a bestselling women’s T-shirt. If you spend enough time checking out the competition, you’ll get a pretty good idea of what kind of motifs sell best. Today, shirts with images of cats, coffee and wine do well. Yoga poses are another trope folks can’t get enough of. Once you’ve identified a promising concept, you can take a look at the most popular style. That’s usually white lettering or imagery on a black background.  Voila, you have your small-business idea: T-shirts featuring a cat holding a yoga pose while slurping a glass of wine! All you need to do now is find a cheap way of getting them designed and printed, and then you’re ready for business. Lots of people are obsessed with goals. That’s understandable – after all, few things are as satisfying as working through a challenge and savoring the taste of that hard-won promotion or tropical vacation. But here’s the problem: goal-setting can become a trap. If you want to become a successful entrepreneur, that’s another rule you’ll have to break.  That’s because success is ultimately about systems rather than individual goals. Let’s jump in with a definition: a system is basically any procedure that helps you automate your work output. Take the author. Back in 2010, he’d just started his first company – Heyo. The idea? Selling customized Facebook fan pages, which he was building himself for $700 a pop.  Initially, his model was goal-oriented: he wanted to sell a certain number of fan pages every month. But he soon changed his approach. After giving his system some thought, the author started developing software that allowed users to build their own customized fan pages. It took a while before that system was up and running, but after a couple of years, he’d transformed his business. Now, customers were paying up to $300 per month to use his software and doing the hard work themselves, giving his bottom line a massive boost!  That’s a great example of the advantages of outsourcing routine work – the first step to building your own system. So say you’re spending a good chunk of your day doing standardized tasks like sending emails to potential podcast guests. There’s a pretty good chance you can outsource that kind of work.  How? Well, let’s stick with our example. The first thing you’ll want to do is document the task as precisely as possible. Write down your login details, the people you’ll be reaching out to and a step-by-step guide to the task at hand. This is your “system.”  Now all you’ll have to do is head to your nearest Starbucks and give five people a $5 gift card if they successfully implement your routine task. If they manage it without any issues, you know you’ve created a simple and efficient system. And that means you’re ready to hire someone to do that work for you! All right, we’ve taken a look at a couple of rules you’ll have to break if you want to launch yourself on the path to success. In this blink, we’ll explore a rule you should be following.  To get to that, let’s start by thinking back to the nineteenth-century Gold Rush. Workers from around the world rushed to hotspots in search of the precious metal. But while they were sifting streams and dynamiting rocky outcrops, another group was getting rich: the folks selling miners supplies like jeans and pickaxes. And that’s our rule in a nutshell: sell pickaxes to goldminers.  What this comes down to is making money by assisting already successful industries. Take the fresh food delivery business. The industry is booming, and companies like ThriveMarket, HelloFresh and Blue Apron are making huge amounts of money. But they all share a logistical problem: coordinating between their delivery personnel and customers.  That’s where Onfleet comes in. In 2012, the start-up launched a piece of software designed to help companies in the industry manage their delivery systems. By 2016, Onfleet had picked up hundreds of customers, including HelloFresh, and hit $2.1 million in revenue. Sometimes the path of least resistance is the surest way of making money! But how do you apply that principle to your business? Here’s where you’ll need to master a couple of simple tricks. First off: sell a product that’s compatible with an already popular item. Some of the most sought-after items on Amazon, for example, are various types of iPhone cases. Their makers identified a hugely successful product and made a spin-off. The results speak for themselves.  That also works in services. Take business apps like those made by GetFeedback, a software company that helps companies gather survey data from their customers. Like the iPhone-case makers, its business model piggybacks off already-established businesses. If you wanted to get in on the action, you could create a consultancy that helps companies interpret their survey data and develop corresponding business strategies. Follow the tips and tricks we’ve explored in the previous blinks, and you’ll be well on your way to building a successful business. That, however, takes a while. So what do you do in the meantime when you’re low on cash? Well, you’ll want to keep your expenses as low as possible. But don’t worry – that doesn’t mean you’ll have scrimp and save.  The alternative is to take a leaf out of the book of the already wealthy and make the most out of your existing assets. The author, for example, recently moved into a house he’s bought in Austin, Texas. He paid 3 percent of the $425,000 asking price up front. The monthly mortgage payment and taxes come to $2,700. Since he is away on business trips for around 20 days every month, he decided to rent out his property on Airbnb. That brings in around $3,500 per month. Not only does he live rent-free during the time he does spend in his house; he also makes between $500 to $600 per month!  Property isn’t the only asset you can make money on, though – cars are also effective money-spinners. When you get down to it, you’re probably not getting as much value out of your vehicle as you could. That’s hardly surprising: if you’re anything like most folks, your car spends most of the day idling in a parking lot. And if you commute to work on the train, it’s just sitting around for even longer every day.  So here’s the alternative: rent out your car when you’re not using it yourself. Your best bet is to check out local car-sharing websites like Turo, HyreCar or GetAround. Depending on your own needs, you can rent it out by the hour or for full days. Whichever model you choose, that should bring in a couple of hundred dollars each month! Making money isn’t all there is to wealth – you also need to be savvy about how you spend your money. That’s something well-known to the New Rich: people who’ve become wealthy over a short period of time. Their secret? They know how to live luxuriously without spending a ton of cash. In this blink, we’ll take a look at how they afford their jet-set lifestyle without breaking the bank.  Nothing says luxury quite like flying round the world in business class. But here’s the thing: it doesn’t have to cost loads of money. In fact, if you make use of specialized companies, your travel bill will be close to nothing. Take it from the author, a man who travelled first class for 45 days on the cheap.  How? Simple: he collected air miles. If you pay for all your business expenses on a credit card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, you’ll quickly rack up a ton of air miles. Once you’ve collected your points, head over to Flightfox. That’s a specialized service that helps you figure out the best way of using your bonus. The author, for instance, paid Flightfox just $50 and in return got a set of first-class tickets for a 45-day trip starting in Austin and ending in Bangkok for just $120!  But here’s the best news of all: sometimes, you don’t have to pay anything to travel in style. That might sound too good to be true, but it’s actually relatively straightforward. If your flight is delayed or cancelled, you can sue the airline. That’s easy as pie when you use services like ClaimCompass and AirHelp.  They specialize in filing claims against travel companies who’ve provided subpar services – a complicated process most individuals just don’t have the time or resources for. All you need to do is submit a copy of your boarding pass and fill out a short form. In many cases, you’ll receive a payout of up to $400. That’s a great reason to get excited, rather than frustrated, the next time you flight is delayed! Buying a company sounds pretty daunting, right? Well, sure, you shouldn’t take it lightly – but don’t let that put you off. In fact, you’d be surprised how simple the basic principles of acquiring a firm are.  Let’s start with the first bit of advice: if you’re in the market for a company, go digital. Here’s why: digital companies are usually a much more straightforward investment. That comes down to a couple of points. First off, they can be built up and run without office space. That means you’ll be saving a ton of money on rent and insurance, giving you much more financial leeway and flexibility.  Secondly, digital companies can be run by employing freelancers rather than standard employees. That again saves you a ton of cash. Even better: with platforms like Toptal.com, it’s easy to find the right freelancers for the jobs you need doing.  Finally, digital ventures are usually built around a pretty simple business model. That’s important when it comes to meeting potential customers. After all, you want them to grasp the idea behind your service right away. And if they can see how your business is going to help them, they’re much more likely to bite.  The other thing you’ll want to look out for is a company that serves as a distribution channel. Everyone wants to buy the next Google, a behemoth that dominates its sector of the market. But companies like that are extremely rare and difficult to buy. That means your best bet is a business that serves as a distribution channel for a giant like Google.  That’s why the author bought Mail2Cloud, a Google Chrome extension that helps users manage their Gmail accounts. It was a good investment choice: no other company offered a similar service, and it was highly rated by its existing customers. After buying it and renaming it Top Inbox, it’s become one of the author’s most successful ventures. People usually assume the author makes his money through his digital companies and his podcast. That’s not entirely wide of the mark, but it’s not where he makes the bulk of his cash. What really brings in the big bucks for him is the way he multiplies these revenue sources. So how can you follow his path to success? Let’s find out!  The first thing you’ll need to do is ask your customers a simple question: what products are they buying that are similar to yours? So if your product is software that helps folks fill in their tax returns, you’d want to find out what other tax management software they’re using.  Once you know the answer to that question, you have a couple of options. First off, you can try to buy up the competing company, thus giving you a monopoly over both your own service and those of a competing or complementary service. Alternatively, you could make a deal with your rival and collaborate. Finally, you could copy their product and add it to the package of services you sell.  Another great way of multiplying your income is to cap your customer numbers. That might sound counterintuitive, but there’s a sound reason to limit your client base: you can shift your attention from constantly trying to expand to persuading your existing customers to pay more.  Consider the author’s company GetLatka, a business that provides venture capitalists with valuable information about companies. The target audience is a small but select group of investors. By capping the number of clients the author works with to just 50 people, he can give them VIP treatment while creating a huge waiting list.  If a couple of customers leave when he raises his prices, he always has other potential clients on standby eager to get in on the action, even if that means paying the new price. That means the author can continually ratchet up his prices while also providing the best possible services to his clients.  And that just shows that getting rich isn’t as hard as you might think. All it takes is a willingness to break the rules, defy conventional wisdom and take a leaf out of the book of today’s most successful entrepreneurs! The key message in these blinks: If you want to be rich and successful, you need to start breaking the rules. Contrary to what lots of people say, there’s nothing wrong with copying successful products and becoming a jack of all trades. Add in a streamlined service that outsources humdrum tasks to others, and you’re set – all you have to do now is wait as your business takes root. In the meantime, you can keep your head above water by getting the most out of your existing assets and saving money on travel. Put all that together, and you have the makings of a luxurious life of plenty!  Actionable advice: Find investment opportunities on the street.  Investing in a company is a tricky process. After all, if you’re not already an industry insider, you just don’t know what to look out for. So here’s an alternative: follow your nose and trust your gut. One of the author’s most successful investments is a hostel in Austin, Texas. He loved the atmosphere and the motivated owners so much he just knew he had to get behind the venture. That’s a great example of one of the canniest investment strategies out there: looking around and seeing who’s building companies that look destined for success.  Got feedback?

If channels like these are your only window into the outside world, it’s perhaps not surprising that you’d think a trip abroad will inevitably involve an encounter with a xenophobic murderer or a deadly tsunami. But consider this simple fact: The author has been constantly traveling around the world for the past ten years. He has never once encountered violence, or even a person who expressed a strong dislike of him for being American. Here’s the truth: we fear visiting foreign lands because we fear the unknown. Let’s face it, your local news isn’t going to report about the good things happening in faraway lands. Indeed, a 2010 study by the Pew Research Center found that just 10.5 percent of the news in the United States deals with international affairs. So what does make headlines? Well, all the scary stuff, from terrorist attacks to horrible disasters with high death tolls. But in Kepnes’s experience, people are more or less the same no matter where you are in the world. There’s always some risk, of course – but it doesn’t necessarily go up when you go abroad. Whether you’re in New York City, Los Angeles, Brazil, London or Beijing, there is always the possibility that you could get mugged or assaulted. The second myth to debunk is that there’s an age limit to travel. In Poland, Kepnes met a globetrotting 65-year-old man who was touring Europe before heading to India. Far from being isolated or lonely, he was chatting up younger travelers, making friends and sharing his life stories. The fact of the matter is, there are plenty of these people. In fact, there are countless couples and families with children who travel where they please, sometimes for several months at a time or even for a full year. So don’t let any misconceived excuses get in the way. It’s time to pack your bags and enjoy the world’s many wonders! Concerns about age and danger aside, the main thing preventing people from traveling is the assumption that it’s too expensive. This is a shame, because this is just one more myth that is needlessly holding people back from enjoying exciting new destinations. Here’s a quick exercise you can do to prove just how affordable traveling is. Grab a pen and paper and write down all your recurring basic expenses, such as rent, car costs, gas and electric bills and so forth. Next, add up your routine monthly spending on food and shopping, including groceries, clothes, restaurants and daily cups of coffee. If you’re not sure about these costs, take a few weeks to closely track your spending. Once you have your total amount of bills and expenses for the month, multiply it by twelve to get your yearly spending amount. Now, like the title of the book suggests, it’s possible to travel comfortably on a budget of $50 a day. That adds up to $1,500 a month, which is $18,250 a year. This is why it’s simply wrong to assume that travel is too expensive – because whatever amount you came up with for your yearly personal expenses, chances are it’s more than $50 a day. So all you have to do is save up some travel money. And, as luck would have it, that’s pretty easy to do. Unless you’re a risk taker, or you plan on working while you travel, you’ll be making things easier for yourself by saving up money before departure. Now, saving up $18,000 may seem like a tall order, but it’s completely doable. Some simple tips are to cut back on or forego the nonessentials, like dining out, drinking booze and partying. At the very least, you can stick to home-brewed coffee. But a real money saver is to reduce your monthly rent by getting some roommates. Remember, even a studio apartment can be fit for two with an added partition. Or rent out your entire apartment for a year and become your parent’s roommate. If you’re willing to get creative and minimalist, there’s no end to the money you can save. So how exactly can you travel the world on $50 a day? Whether you’re planning on a weekend in Paris or a yearlong tour of the globe, the first step is getting some good plane tickets. One of the best deals are what’s known as Round the World (RTW) tickets. These cost-saving tickets are offered by multiple, cooperating airlines. For example, American Airlines doesn’t fly to every destination on the globe. So to cover as many destinations as possible, they’ll team up with other companies. Two of the bigger and more popular airline alliances are Star Alliance and Oneworld. So how can an RTW ticket benefit you, exactly? Well, you can travel around the world. Star Alliance offers RTW tickets on which you can travel 29,000 to 39,000 miles, making up to 15 stops. Keep in mind that you have to start and end at the same destination, while also moving in more or less the same direction. You can travel backward, as long as you stay within the same continent. So, if you start in Japan and travel east to New York City, your next stop could be to travel west to Los Angeles, but you couldn’t travel back over an ocean you’ve already crossed, like going from Japan to the United States and then to Korea. Another way to cut costs is to be flexible about your travel times and destinations. In fact, the more willing you are to make last-minute decisions about your travel times and destinations, the cheaper it will be. Here’s another general rule to keep in mind: midweek flights and early morning or late night departures are cheaper, while weekends and holidays will always cost more. Since plane fares vary in unpredictable ways, your best bet is to remain flexible so that you can pounce when a great deal becomes available. A suitcase on wheels is fine for casually rolling into a big city hotel during a business trip. But if you really want to travel with ease and be ready for some authentic, adventurous sightseeing, you need to have a good backpack on your shoulders. So what are the qualities of the ideal, functional backpack? First of all, make sure the material is at least semi-waterproof, or keep a tarp handy so you can cover your backpack if you’re ever caught in a downpour. If it’s not waterproof, at least make sure it’s a quick-dry material in case it does get wet. Next, make sure that every compartment has two zippers that can be locked together when traveling. This will ensure that thieves won’t take anything out and smugglers won’t sneak anything in. Just be sure that those locks are TSA-friendly so they can be opened by security without being broken. Finally, get a backpack with plenty of compartments. You don’t want to be digging through one big section of your bag every time you need something. So get an intelligently designed bag that allows you to both easily access items you’ll frequently need and separate stuff you’ll need at different times of the day. You’ll also want to make sure you have a backpack that is the right size for you. The best way to be sure about this is to know what you want to take ahead of time so that you can weigh it and see how much space it takes up. Most shops selling outdoor gear will let you test out backpacks that are weighed down with your requested amount. They’ll also have a range of sizes, from 43 liters to 110 liters, so you can choose what suits your body size and cargo size. Let’s say you hope to travel with 50 pounds worth of stuff. If you go to the shop and test this out, you might find that it’s in fact way too heavy. Obviously, it’s better to know this ahead of time so you can rethink your packing! Of course, traveling on a $50-a-day budget means you won’t be spending your time in luxury hotels and eating at expensive restaurants. So if you have any lingering dreams of decadence, it’s best to get rid of them now, or else the money you’ve saved won’t last you very long. In order to stay on budget and make your money last, you’ll want to have a system of keeping close track of your spending. When you’re traveling to new destinations, you’ll be surrounded by any number of tempting attractions that can quickly empty your wallet if you’re not careful. So you need to set a budget and be smart about it. Set money aside for different categories, like accommodation, transportation and food, and try to stick to it. This money can be stretched rather far by staying with friendly locals whenever possible and walking to sights rather than taking taxis or public transportation. Now, this doesn’t mean being so stingy that you miss out on the great experiences travel has to offer. If you’re in an esteemed culinary destination like France, for example, you shouldn’t forego a meal in a fine bistro or brasserie. To make sure you have enough money to enjoy the best of what your destination has to offer, you should use a journal to keep close track of your expenses. This way, if you splurge on an expensive meal, you can make some adjustments in the days ahead to make sure the budget evens out. Another cost-cutting tip is to use member-driven hospitality-service platforms. One of the easiest and most substantial ways to save money is to avoid the exorbitant costs of hotels. And with a number of different hospitality services on the internet these days, it’s never been easier to find cheap alternatives. One of the more popular platforms is CouchSurfing, which has millions of users and hundreds of thousands of active hosts in over 70,000 cities around the world. It’s free to sign up for a membership on CouchSurfing. And, since travelers rate the hosts, you can get a good sense of where the nearest friendly, comfortable and available room might be. Other hospitality service sites that you may find useful are Servas International and Hospitality Club. Enjoying the local cuisine is one of the great joys of traveling. But if you’re going to travel on a budget, it’s usually best to pretend that fancy restaurants don’t exist and cook at home, while saving takeout and dining out for special occasions. Stocking up on groceries for the week ahead shouldn’t cost you more than $50 to $80. On the other hand, just one visit to a restaurant can set you back more than $20. In other words, eating at home rather than dining out will reduce your food expenses by up to 70 percent. Since food costs can really add up quickly when you’re traveling, it’s worth finding ways to cook for yourself, even during a short trip. Luckily, most guest apartments and hostels come equipped with a kitchen fully stocked with pots, pans and everything else you need to prepare a simple meal. If you do find yourself at a hotel with nothing but a tiny fridge, you can always make yourself a tasty sandwich. But don’t think this means you can’t enjoy the local cuisine. Visiting the local markets and grocery stores is one of the best ways to sample regional food. If you’re not sure what to get, take a peek at what your fellow shoppers are purchasing. Another helpful tip is to be on the lookout for money-saving lunch specials. All around the world, but especially in Europe, restaurants will offer a special lunch menu that is substantially cheaper than the dinner menu. In Barcelona, for example, there is an abundance of great seafood restaurants along the coastline. But having a dinner at one of these places can easily set you back $50 or more. Yet you’ll likely find these same places offering a lunch special that will provide you with a memorable meal for around $20. Now, you’re not going to find a website listing all of the local lunch specials, but if you ask the tourist office or the person at the front desk of your hostel, you’ll probably get a good recommendation. But what if you want to visit an expensive country, such as Australia, where a single cup of coffee costs over $4 Australian, the equivalent of three US dollars? How are you supposed to manage that on just $50 per day? Well, by keeping a few handy tips in mind, you can still enjoy the land down under without breaking the bank. First of all, there’s the option of house-sitting. Since Australia is quite a distance from most other countries, Australians tend to take longer vacations to compensate for the investment of time and money that travel entails. This creates a strong demand for house sitters, who can live rent free as long as they care for the vacationer’s home, pets and plants. For more details, you can check out the popular site Aussie Housesitters at aussiehousesitters.com.au. If you’re open to some slightly more strenuous work, you can go the WWOOFing route, which involves doing volunteer work on organic farms or ranches in exchange for bed and board. The name comes from the World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, or WWOOF, which oversees the program. Since Australia has large expanses of wilderness and agricultural land, there’s a large demand for workers to pick fruit and plant seedlings. It’s also a great way to save money and meet people. Now, while eating out is typically a costly expenditure anywhere you go, this is particularly the case in Australia. There is great food culture in Australia, as they tend to work with fresh and healthy ingredients. But it isn’t cheap – with the average meal setting you back at least $25. Because of the high cost of food, your weekly groceries will run you about $80, but this is still the cheaper way to go, so you’ll definitely want to cook at home, using the kitchen in your apartment or hostel. Camping is also a popular and cost-efficient way to vacation in Australia, but be sure to get yourself some cooking gear. If you don’t, all the money saved by avoiding hotels will be quickly spent on food. There is one cheap food item to be found in the Australian markets that’s worth trying. Since kangaroos are as common in Australia as cows are in the United States and Europe, you’ll find cheap kangaroo meat at many shops around the nation. Australia is more expensive than the average destination, but there are plenty of places where your money will go a long way. One of them is Southeast Asia. Many people throughout this area have an average salary of around $1,000, so life is cheap and you can live quite well on $50 a day. Good accommodations are particularly cheap to come by in Southeast Asia. But, of course, not all countries are the same. People in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are a bit wealthier, so things there are more pricey, while the least expensive countries are Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. In some rural areas, a simple single room with a fan and access to a shared restroom can cost as little as $2. You’ll generally find these as part of a small guesthouse owned by a local family. While very minimalistic, the rooms are nonetheless clean and offered by friendly people. If you prefer to stay in the touristy areas, basic accommodation in these parts will still be cheap at around $10. Plus, this will sometimes include air conditioning and a tap with warm water. As for more luxurious accommodations, with TV and a king-size bed, this will cost you around $15 or $20. In Singapore and the other more expensive cities of Southeast Asia, the cost of living is rising as the economy is on the upswing in the area. So, if you decide to go there, you might want to stay in a place with a communal kitchen in order to stay on budget. However, throughout Southeast Asia, the food won’t set you back too much. If you’re looking for Western food here, it can be quite pricey, but the local cuisine shouldn’t cost you more than $10 a day. A big reason for this is the popular, tasty and cheap street food you’ll find being cooked in stalls throughout the cities and towns. This is where locals buy the majority of their snacks, lunches and takeaway meals. Local marketplaces are also a good bet for cheap, delicious food. You’ll find pad thai, spicy soups, spring rolls, fried noodles and other local specialties, as well as fresh juices and meats and vegetables you can cook at home when the budget is tight. So enough with the excuses. There’s a big world out there just waiting for you to explore and enjoy. The key message in these blinks: Traveling the world is not as dangerous or as expensive as you may think. You just have to let go of your need for luxurious accommodations and be willing to embrace your adventurous spirit. There are a number of ways that any traveler can easily cut costs. Chances are, you can travel the world and spend less money on a day-to-day basis than you are currently spending at home. Actionable advice: Get a travel credit card. These handy credit cards give you travel points every time you use them. This means you’ll eventually be able to fly at a very reasonable price, if not for free. These cards don’t charge any extra fees for overseas purchases, so if you’re planning to travel regularly, they are a sensible thing to have. Got feedback?

This catchy song should be your new mantra. Why? Because hustling will give you an edge and help you break away from the boring, mundane work life that’s dragging you down. To hustle is to make the small tweaks that will propel you into a new and better life. In these blinks, we will look at what that entails. You’ll learn to think like a hustler and discover actionable tips on how to get where you want to be in life. In these blinks, you’ll learn how half of Americans under 30 view the American dream; what the three M’s are and why you need them; and how POP is not just an email protocol. Are you one of those people who considers her job to be perfect and wouldn’t change a thing about it? Well, the majority of folks don’t fit that description. In fact, many people feel that their daily working life amounts to no less than a daunting, repetitive slog. Just take a Gallup poll which found that around 90 percent of the world’s workers don’t feel emotionally connected to their jobs. While the majority of people want to move away from this lifestyle, doing so is nearly impossible because of the way society is structured. After all, people end up in these jobs by following a very specific and common path. They go to college, maybe even graduate school, because they are told that’s the only way to land the kind of career they are expected to want. But education is expensive. Outstanding student loans in America rose to a staggering $516 billion in 2007. By 2015, that number had climbed to $1.2 trillion! This travesty means that the average college graduate owes over $30,000 in student loans. For graduate students, that number easily climbs to six figures. For most people, going to college means loading up on debt. Simultaneously, salaries have dropped and technology, paired with globalization, has meant an overall decline in the number of jobs. And who knows when people who are lucky enough to have jobs will be hit by the next major crisis and put out of work? In this frightening climate, people take jobs to pay off their debt and cover their bills rather than fulfill their dreams. Just take a 2015 study, in which researchers asked 18- to 29-year-olds if they thought the American Dream was dead or alive. While 49 percent answered “alive,” 48 percent said “dead.” But what other option is there other than doing these unfulfilling jobs? Well, that’s exactly what we’ll explore in the blinks that follow. By now it’s probably clear that lots of people are unfulfilled in their work lives and don’t see any way to break out of the pattern they’re in. However, there is an escape route: hustling. Hustling is an approach to life that’s designed to get you money, meaning and momentum. While some people might assume this means taking advantage of others, that’s absolutely not the case. Contrary to popular belief, hustling is not about stepping on the toes of other people, stealing, conning, or anything like that. It’s about forging ahead despite obstacles and difficulties. In other words, to hustle is to pursue your dreams. But if you’re an artist, do you really even need money? Well, historically, some artists haven’t. These creative practitioners claim to do their work solely for the sake of art, and, for a few, money is even repellent. Just take the copywriter and cartoonist, Hugh MacLeod. He says that artists inevitably compromise their art when they’re offered money for it. That being said, you need money to sustain your hustle, and if you can’t sustain your hustle, you can’t make your art. After all, if you don’t have the money to pursue your dreams, you won’t find meaning in your work or build the momentum to sustain your passion. The truth is, lots of artists were only able to pursue their work, and thereby create meaning and momentum, by turning a profit. Picasso is a great example. If it wasn’t for his financial success, he would have stopped making the paintings that both fulfilled him and captivated audiences for generations to come. Picasso even said that an artist must succeed enough to sustain his art. Money, whether people like it or not, is key. Do you own your dream? It may seem like an odd question, but most people are merely renting theirs. In other words, they’re playing by the rules of the rigged system and closing their eyes to what truly brings them joy. Such an outlook means accepting the dreams doled out by the system and never having ownership over your own. It means doing the job you don’t like and telling yourself it’s a great opportunity. So how are you going to achieve your dreams? To reach your goals, you need to hustle, even if it means taking a gamble. Hustling is all about risk-taking; it’s about setting out on a journey that might afford you new opportunities, change and even the fulfillment of your dreams. Just take the electrical engineer Ernesto and his wife, a nurse named Luci. In their native Cuba, businesses are burdened by an overbearing government bureaucracy that siphons away people’s hard-earned money. Ernesto often thought of starting a business but wanted to do it beyond the reach of the government, which would mean serious risks, even jail time, if he were caught. While it was a tough decision, he finally decided to start off doing small projects for friends and acquaintances, which slowly grew into a bigger business. By the end of his career he’d earned a handsome chunk of money and, while the hazards were real, it was all worth it in the end. His family had enough to take care of their basic needs and even afford a nice car. Breaking out of the convenience of a sheltered life – even one that’s monotonous and unfulfilling – can be tough. But to snag your dream while you still can and make truly life-altering changes, you’ll need to push yourself into territory that’s somewhat painful and uncomfortable. However, you only need to takes small steps at a time. What if you dream of being a star public speaker but you’re terrified of appearing in front of crowds. Instead of talking to a massive crowd straightaway, start giving short speeches every night at the dinner table. Doing so might be uncomfortable, but this discomfort is actually good. It’s a small dose of discomfort that you can overcome, improving in the process. Then, when your dinnertime speeches are a piece of cake, make them longer, or speak to more people. Slowly but surely you can broaden your experience until you’re living your dream. And remember, such momentum can bring luck. When you push through and persevere, luck becomes more likely. So, while you might feel like giving up, whether on a job, a book, or a personal project you’re invested in, persisting will pay off in the end. When famous director Francis Ford Coppola was filming Apocalypse Now, practically everything went wrong. There was bad weather on the set, the schedule kept getting pushed back and the costs were getting out of hand. Not just that, but Coppola was in constant conflict with his actors, who were regularly drunk or stoned. He wanted nothing more than to quit, but he didn’t. He persevered instead and, all of a sudden, luck started to come his way. The weather cleared up, the actors gave powerful performances and, by the end of it, they had produced a film that won multiple Academy Awards. By now you know a decent amount about hustling, but you don’t know the Three Unseen Laws: heart, head and habits. The first of these is crucial because doing something that’s close to your heart will move you to action and keep you forging ahead. You might have a feeling of joy, anger or revenge that will push you to accomplish your goals. Maybe you’re pissed off that your smartphone earbuds keep getting tangled up in your pocket and are certain there’s another way. Before you know it you’re thinking through the design for a pocket-sized box that keeps your headphones neat and tidy. Next, you must use your head to observe and benefit from things that aren’t immediately visible. Just imagine you’re the captain of a ship. You naturally need to stay abreast of the wind and waves to navigate accurately, but you also need to check the undercurrents. You might want to avoid them or you might be able to use them to arrive at your destination faster. The point is, while lots of people only see obstacles, a hustler keeps her head cool and sees opportunities wherever they might be. And finally, it’s important to make a habit of setting milestones and deadlines. After all, everyone needs closure at one point or another. Setting intermediate goals will commit you to doing a certain amount of work, and deadlines will push you to get it done. Say you want to write a book. You could set a one-week deadline for writing 10,000 words and make a daily habit of waking up at seven in the morning and writing for two hours. Once you achieve your one-week deadline you can set another one and keep moving toward your goal. Do you have a portfolio of your work? If not, you should definitely consider putting one together. After all, a Personal Opportunity Portfolio, or POP, is a great way to showcase you and your work while attracting people and companies that will help you attain your dreams. This tool, which consists of four parts, lays out exactly who you are, which is invaluable in making progress. While a resumé describes what you’ve done so far, a future employer really wants to understand where you’re going. That’s where the first part of the POP comes in: potential. If your dream is to be an online marketing manager for a cosmetics company you might try experimenting with different brands and writing up your experiences on a blog. If you can get enough traffic flowing to your site, you’ll have demonstrated the potential you have to engage in the field. The next pillar of your POP is people, which naturally is all about your network, both on and offline. A great way to expand this network is to connect others. By facilitating such connections you’ll benefit others, but you’ll also pull people into your own network. The third piece is projects. This portion of your POP should detail everything you’re currently working on, whether it’s volunteering at the Red Cross, writing your blog or pitching ideas to new acquaintances at meetups. This section presents your interests while showing your ability to do work and get results. And finally, the proof section is essential to demonstrate your credibility. After all, if you can’t back up your words with evidence, you’ll never be able to impress the right people. Anybody can say that they write compelling blog posts, but very few people can provide links, references and examples of such captivating work. Being able to do so will show that you can deliver what you say you will. The key message in this book: Hustling tends to get a bad rap but actually, it’s a positive way of persevering and shooting for your dreams. You’ll always be able to find a way to reach your deepest goals as long as you’re willing to step off the conventional path, push ahead no matter what and aim for what you truly want.  Actionable advice: Find your talents in the mirror. Many people feel pressure to excel at school, get into a good college and go on to be a respected professional. However, this conventional wisdom isn’t universally applicable, and you might want to do something completely different. To find out, take a deep look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, “what are my talents?” By taking this time to identify your true abilities, you’ll find the dream you need to guide you.

The fact is that it’s simple. It all comes from having a plan that allows you to do as little as possible. That means understanding how credit cards and retirement funds work, automating your money, and focusing on patient and smart investments. I Will Teach You To Be Rich does what it says it will. Through a down-to-earth description of the basics of investing, it discloses the investment tips that everybody should’ve been taught in school. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how to spend 20 percent of your income guilt-free without hurting your savings; what the difference is between 401(k) and Roth IRA retirement funds; and how to set up a totally hands-free investment and savings system. You’ve probably felt guilty at some stage about not saving money or maybe you think it’s too late to start. Resist those thoughts! It’s time to stop making excuses. The first thing you should know is you shouldn’t get distracted by information fed to you by the media. There’s a lot of information on finance out there, and it can be paralyzing. Plus, a great deal of this information is boring and unhelpful, like “you should cut back on those lattes,” which doesn’t take into account the actual life of a young adult. When it comes to investment advice, young people have reason to point the finger at the media and blame others who could have taught them better. But the best way for someone to change their savings outcomes is by taking responsibility for his choices. Such common excuses, like our education system doesn't teach money management, are grossly inaccurate. Many colleges do provide classes on finance, yet students don’t attend them. Fear of losing money is another popular excuse for not doing anything with it. But it's actually preferable to lose money when you’re young, because you don't have that much to lose! Then when you have more later, you'll better understand how to keep it. Bear in mind money is also drained from your account when you leave it to stagnate in banks! Yet another excuse is not being able to afford to put $100 aside a month. Really, the amount is not so important. Even $1 saved per day adds up over time. We all remember the financial crisis in 2008 when many foolishly withdrew their money from the market. A lot of these people had no diversified portfolio and bought high and sold low, a big mistake. It was easy to blame the government and banks, but most hadn’t picked up a single personal finance book to educate themselves. We need to take responsibility for our problems and start solving them. Now that you know this, how do you get rich? Understanding how to harness the power of credit cards will be your first step towards saving money and getting rich. Our most significant purchases are often made on credit, and people with good credit are able to put aside a lot of money. Credit comes in the form of loans, mortgages and credit cards and it enables you to buy big purchases when you don’t have the money for them immediately. Keep in mind two central aspects of credit: a credit report, which records your credit activity and gives potential lenders information related to this, and a credit score, a number between 300 and 850 that denotes your credit risk to lenders. If your credit score is good, you’ll be attractive to lenders, which means they can grant you better loan interest rates. What’s even better about this is that a good credit score can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest. For example, in 2009, the annual percentage rate in the USA showed that with a good credit score (750-850) on a $200,000 mortgage over 30 years, you'd pay $359,867, including interest. A bad credit score (620-639) would land you with $430,427 to pay. That’s $70,000 extra!  The most important credit vehicle is credit cards. Here’s a couple of smart tips for successful credit handling: Kill your debt: reduce spending and pay it off! Punctual debt payments account for 35 percent of your credit score, so arranging automatic credit card payments will ensure you never skip a payment. Next, it’s worth contacting your credit card company and requesting they waive your annual fees and service charges, and reduce your annual percentage rate. Surprisingly, many are willing to do so. Remember to seek out the best benefits you can from credit card companies. The author’s credit card concierge even helped him to get tickets to the LA Philharmonic when there were apparently none left! Zero fees and high interest rates are impossible, right? Actually, no! Online banks often provide the best interest rates. Their overhead costs are minimal and they don’t have to spend money on branches or marketing. Consequently, their customer service is better and they can handle lower profit margins than traditional banks. They also offer interest rates six to 10 times higher than a conventional bank. Let’s say you put away $25,000. This would give you $750 in one year at a three percent interest rate at an online bank. Contrast this with a regular bank at a rate of 0.5 percent and you would get a meagre $125. Now imagine you saved $50,000. You'd receive $1,500 at an online bank and a paltry $250 at a regular bank! Next, get the best bank accounts. The minimum should be one checking account and one savings account. You need checking accounts for frequent withdrawals and savings accounts for goals like vacations or special events. You have a few choices here: have your checking and savings account at the same bank (the lazy option); have your checking account at a local bank and a savings account at an online bank (the normal choice); or numerous checking and savings accounts, the best choice for those who aren’t scared of effort and want to optimize their accounts for different goals. Or you can keep one and a half months’ of living expenses in your checking account and put everything else into your savings account. If having numerous accounts sounds like too much, then simply opt for a no-fees checking account at a local bank and a high interest rate savings account at an online bank. Watching your pennies and putting a bit aside in your savings account is good but will only get you so far. To really make your money work for you, you should invest. Opening a 401(k) retirement fund, which many companies in the USA offer to employees, is a good place to start. To set this up, you simply need to authorize a portion of your paycheck to be automatically sent from your employer to your 401(k). Then you can sit back and let your money grow. There are some great benefits to having a 401(k), such as tax advantages because you're agreeing to invest long term, money from your employers if they agree to match your 401(k) contribution, and that it’s an investment requiring little effort. After your 401(k), you should open a Roth IRA, which is another kind of retirement account. Whereas a 401(k) is sponsored by your employer, a Roth IRA is built using your own money. It’s strongly advised that everyone should have both a 401(k) and a Roth IRA because a Roth IRA, in contrast to a 401(k), allows you to invest in whatever you want, such as individual stocks and index funds. Also, while a 401(k) uses pre-tax dollars and you get taxed when you withdraw money during your retirement, a Roth IRA uses after-tax dollars, so you don’t get taxed on your interest earned and when you withdraw funds at retirement. So, how should you start your IRA? One student had difficulty saving $1,000 to open a Roth IRA account, so she opted for a management firm (T. Rowe Price), which offered an account with no minimum starting amount, and chose to automatically contribute $50 per month. Fifty dollars per month was easier for her to commit to, and even that amount is a great start. Remember the last time you felt guilty about buying something, but bought it anyway? Next time you’ll know better after you learn how to spend consciously. Conscious spending is about reducing the amount of money you spend on things that aren’t so important to you, and spending more on things that you really care about. All you need to do is adopt a Conscious Spending Plan. Automatically save and invest a given amount per month and spend the rest on whatever you want, guilt-free. The percentage you spend on different things can be broken down into: 60 percent on fixed costs (rent, utilities, debt) 10 percent on investments (401 (k), Roth IRA) 10 percent on savings (vacations, gifts, unexpected expenses) 20 percent on guilt-free spending Conscious spending means thinking about what’s important to you. For example, the author's friend Jim moved to a smaller apartment after he got a raise. Why? His living space didn’t matter much to him, but he loved going camping, so he put his money towards that.   Next, learn to adjust your spending. You can try “the envelope system,” in which you decide how much you wish to spend on the four areas above and put that money in envelopes, so when they’re empty, there’s no more spending for that month. “Envelopes” may also be metaphoric; the author's friend opened a bank account with a debit card that acted as an envelope. Each month she loads money onto the card for socializing and when the money’s gone, she doesn’t go out. Changing from one extreme behavior takes a while, so tweak your spending rather than, for example, saving $495 a week if you were previously spending $500 a week. Choose one or two major problem areas and work on those, rather than trying to carve out 5 percent from numerous areas. Overdraft fees, for instance, can add up to over $1,000 per year. Erasing that alone will make a massive difference. Paying bills is inconvenient and annoying. If you’re not crazy about managing money, create an automated system to do it for you. Take the Conscious Spending Plan from the last blink and automate it using your bank and your own tools for tracking your spending. First, contact your bank to set up automatic transfers and payments. For example, set up automatic payments for fixed costs and automate withdrawals from your checking account to your Roth IRA. Once this is done, use the remaining money for spending and set mid-month calendar reminders to inform you if you’re exceeding your spending goals. A good idea is to also have $1,000 in your checking account as a reserve. If your spending is going according to plan, then great! If not, use the next 15 days to get back on track. Another excellent idea is to implement an Automatic Money Flow by connecting all your accounts and creating automatic transfers. The transfers can be organized in the following way: Your paycheck should fund your 401(k) and checking account, and your checking account should fund your Roth IRA, savings account, credit card, fixed costs where you can’t use a credit card (like rent), and the odd amount of spending money. Your credit card should finance other fixed costs and guilt-free spending. But how exactly can you link all your accounts? Simply automate all transfers and payments: Say you get paid on the first of the month. On the second, automatically send a portion of your paycheck to your 401(k) and all that’s left over into your checking account. On the fifth, automatically transfer money to your savings account and your Roth IRA from your checking account. On the seventh, automatically pay off your bills and your credit card. Experts are always going on about choosing stocks. But there’s a much simpler way to invest. Don’t believe the experts. Not one of them can consistently predict how funds or stocks will perform in the market over time. Much like Frederic Brochet’s 2001 study, which found that wine experts weren’t able to distinguish between wines, financial experts can’t always be trusted. This is because they can’t see the future. The reality is, no matter what they say, experts are frequently wrong. Daniel Solin, author of The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read, described some research which revealed that 47 of 50 advisory firms persistently advised investors on shares in companies right up until the date they filed for bankruptcy! Therefore, bypass expertise, and opt for the simplest path to investing. Picture an investment pyramid in which each category has an asset class. That is, stocks, bonds, and cash are at the base, index and mutual funds are in the middle, and lifecycle funds are at the top. These investments become more complicated as you move down the pyramid, so the simplest approach is through automatic lifecycle funds, also known as age-based funds. Which aspects of the pyramid you invest in shifts depending on your age. For instance, if you are a 25-year-old, Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 offers 90 percent stocks and 10 percent bonds, but if you are 55, it offers only 63 percent stocks and 37 percent bonds. As you can see, in your twenties, more of your assets are in stocks. This is because you can afford to take the risk at this age. As you get older, the balance moves accordingly and lifecycle funds make things easier by automatically adjusting for you. The great thing about lifestyle funds is that you only have to own one fund. Then you simply need to decide where to apply the fund’s investment, for example to a 401(k) or a Roth IRA. The key message in this book: Saving and investing money wisely needn’t be confined to the experts, nor does it need to be a headache. Simplify your personal finance by setting up no-fee accounts, automating savings and bill payments, and investing a little. This will allow you to stop stressing about money and sit back and let your funds grow.  Actionable advice: Be smart with unexpected gifts. The next time you receive an unexpected monetary gift or bonus, such as a payrise, save 50 percent and spend the rest in whichever way you want. This way, you won’t get used to spending more than you can afford. Don’t let people tell you how to save and spend your money. You don’t need to scrimp and save on all the “right” or “acceptable” things. Instead, pick what’s really important for you to splurge or save on. For instance, if owning a collection of limited edition sneakers is more important to you than dining out every week, scrimp on the dining and spend on the shoes!

Balkin","summary":"Capitalism is often blamed for causing many of the world’s problems. Its detractors claim that it encourages an endless hunt for higher returns, which leads to ethically problematic investments and a general disregard for humanity. At the same time, we all know money can do good in the world. Few complain when money is used for philanthropy or invested in new infrastructure or education. So what if capitalist interests could be used to benefit society? These blinks explore that possibility, and show how, in many cases, businesses and investments can help further humanity better than states and governments. You’ll also find out why people – not the capitalist system – are to blame for the 2008 financial crisis; that companies are better than states at providing services to society; and why the E6 investment model is the way to make investments good for all. No tool is inherently good or bad. Morality enters the picture when tools are put to use. For instance, an axe can save lives when it’s used to chop wood to build a fire in winter; in the hands of a murderer, however, that same axe could be a weapon. Capitalism is a tool like any other. Since human beings ultimately control the capitalist system, it’s up to us to decide whether capitalism is used for good or bad. The capitalist system works by establishing a free market that is based on empowered individuals who are free to make their own decisions. Over the past 50 years, this system has brought prosperity and made the world a better place for many. Thanks to free trade, the wealth of nations has risen, as have levels of employment and self-sustainability – all of which has improved living standards. According to a 2014 World Bank report, approximately 80 percent of poverty reduction is due to a nation’s economic growth through free trade and free markets. Free trade and free markets are also what halved global poverty between 1981 and 2005. Capitalism’s ameliorative effects have led most people to view capitalism in a positive light. In fact, a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center showed that 4.5 billion people in the world think that free-market capitalism is the best economic system. Now, you might be thinking, “What about the 2008 financial crisis? Wasn’t this the result of a broken system?” As a matter of fact, the crisis was the result of moral and societal issues. The people who made the financial decisions failed – not the system itself. The crisis stemmed from the greedy and selfish actions of bankers who favored short-term earnings over long-term benefits and disregarded what was best for their communities. In retrospect, the immoral actions of US energy company Enron foreshadowed the crisis that followed. The company collapsed into bankruptcy after they tried to hide debts by exploiting loopholes and posting false numbers. Rather than trying to provide a helpful service, the company strove to improve the stock price and earn big returns and dividends. The motives of bankers were similarly greed-driven. Rather than helping clients, they based their actions on self-interest alone. Education, health care and welfare are public services that, generally, the state offers to help its citizens. But debt has recently put these services in jeopardy. These days, governments are accruing such huge debts that they’re forced to raise taxes and cut spending in an effort to cover them. These methods, which only hurt a country’s economic growth, are called austerity measures. After the 2008 crisis, many governments imposed austerity measures, which failed to generate wealth or improve society. In some US states, raising taxes and cutting spending couldn’t even prevent the health-care system from collapsing. Governments, bogged down by bureaucracy and with limited authority, routinely have trouble meeting the needs of citizens. Taking action takes a great deal of time. Companies, on the other hand, don’t have these problems. They don’t have to pass a bill through Congress in order to take action, which allows them to deliver effective health-care, educational and environmental policies more efficiently than any government. Indeed, Walmart provides its employees with better health care than the US government provides its citizens. As of 2014, a 30-year-old smoker, earning $30,000 per year, would pay $70 a month to be covered by the Walmart plan. To be covered by an average US health-care plan, that same person would have to pay $352 a month. As for environmental policies, companies are also ahead of the curve. In 2008, Starbucks decided it would reduce water consumptions by 25 percent before 2015. There was no lobbying or amendments to be made; they simply began working toward that goal. Businesses can also benefit from being multinational, which allows them to easily allocate local resources across borders. This is how Coca-Cola is able to run effective educational programs all over the world. Whether it’s health-care, educational or environmental concerns, companies also have more financial power than governments to execute these programs. Apple, Microsoft and Google all have far bigger budgets than many nations, including the United Kingdom. True, we haven’t seen many businesses taking these actions – but there’s a new generation eager to effect positive change. Traditionally, the standard career advice has been: don’t change jobs every year; it’ll make you look unreliable and overly eager to jump ship. But today, the new generation – the millennials – has a different set of career values, and people such as start-up developers are expected to have a varied résumé. Millennials place a great deal of importance on having a career that improves and benefits society. For the baby-boomer generation, the most important career values were stability and individual prosperity. But for the millennials, who were born between 1984 and 2000, there’s a completely new set of ideals. A big reason for this shift is that millennials aren’t fooled by the classic idea of the American Dream, which suggested that if you worked hard you’d be properly rewarded. The 2008 financial crisis was proof of the hollowness of this ethos. In the traditional scenario, the millennials would be on the losing end of things. They would earn less money than the baby boomers due to seniority, and due to the aging population they would be expected to work harder and pay more taxes. So instead of focusing on money, millennials prioritize business practices that make society a better place. They also perform more volunteer services than any other age group, which is another sign that they are truly interested in philanthropy. Millennials are the leaders of tomorrow, and they will bring their own set of values to the companies they run and use the capitalist system in a way that will benefit society. When we look at the statistics, we can see how impressive millennials are demographically. By 2020, millennials will comprise 40 percent of all eligible voters in America and 75 percent of its workforce. This adds up to around 103 million millennials, which is about 36 percent of the overall US population. The sheer size of this demographic means they’ll be able to successfully push their philanthropic agenda forward through their businesses. Finance and investing have the potential to do far more than simply make savvy bankers rich. Take social impact bonds, for instance. They free up taxpayer dollars so the government can use that money to get private investors to fund social programs. For example, Nebraska has a literacy issue. Seventy-seven percent of students can read well, but only 55 percent of black children are literate. Fixing this problem would benefit society as a whole, so the government could issue social impact bonds. Now, private companies can finance a program to help marginalized children improve their reading – by, for instance, opening a new school or paying for more teachers. If the statistics improved, the private financiers would get a return on their investment in the form of tax benefits, which is money that normally would go to finance these programs. So, when a social impact bond works, everyone wins! This is also known as impact investing, and the challenge is to make these opportunities financially rewarding so that they’re attractive to investors. One way to do this is to emphasize the future benefits – for instance, the positive impact the investment may have on the lives of students. When students do well in school, they grow up to be more confident and earn more money in their careers, leading to higher profits, which creates more jobs and more tax revenue for society as a whole. Such societal payoff needs to be brought to the forefront because if the returns are not clear, investors will simply put their money toward other companies that do offer clear returns. But these companies don’t always have society’s best interests at heart. Enron, for example, offered clear returns on investment by being corrupt. This is why it’s important to consider the societal benefit of our investments; otherwise, we’ll only end up in another crisis. So a good investment is one that strikes a balance between profit and positive social impact. In the final blink, let’s take a closer look at how we can find that perfect balance. It’s not always easy to find the right investment with a positive social impact. Thankfully, there’s the 6E model to help guide the way. It takes into consideration six criteria that clearly and effectively measure the social impact of an investment. The better the score, the more value the investment carries. The first criterion is economics. This simply calculates the price of a company’s stock. Riskier investments will have a higher future stock price, and a higher return rate. The second criterion is employment. Companies with a better score will provide a greater social benefit by employing more people and creating more jobs. Apple has 12,000 employees at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, and claims to have created 60,000 jobs. Consider all the other businesses, such as restaurants, gyms and grocery stores, that have popped up around Cupertino. You can usually bet on companies that have the potential for job growth. The third criterion is empowerment. Consider how diverse a company is. Are there people of different genders, ages and ethnicities on both the employee and executive levels? According to the renowned consulting firm McKinsey, a company with a diverse board will bring higher rewards since their strategies will be better aligned with the global business world. It also makes the company more trustworthy. After all, would you believe a company that says it’s looking out for the best interests of everyone in a community if their executives are all white men? The fourth criterion is education. How strong are the company’s professional development programs? Better education leads to more skills and higher earning, all of which enables people to better care for themselves. The fifth criterion is ethics. High-scoring companies always have clear ethical guidelines for their executives. Finally, there’s the environment. Find out what the company is doing to reduce pollution. This is of great importance since it has a huge impact on society and general health worldwide. With these six factors in mind, you can see how a business – and your investment – contribute to making the world a better place. The key message in this book: Finance can be a positive force when used correctly. Impact investing, which generates profitable returns while simultaneously benefiting society, is just one way to invest ethically. Socially conscious investors should look at social bonds and closely investigate potential companies to make sure they have society's best interests at heart. Got feedback?

In the 20 years since it was founded, it has completely redefined the way we interact online and with the world, even becoming a verb along the way. But is its tapestry of big data and free access really such a great thing? And will it be able to hold on to its position of power in the future? Because, as it turns out, though it holds data on almost everyone on the planet, it doesn’t actually keep it all under proper lock and key. But if Google’s heyday is coming to a close, then what will replace it? This is where cryptocurrencies, blockchain and bitcoin come in. These blinks detail the world that Google has built and why it’s no longer tenable, before explaining how and why the cryptocosm’s focus on security is changing, and will continue to change, the world. You’ll also learn what a “Siren Server” is; why you probably shouldn’t worry about Artificial Intelligence; and who Satoshi Nakamoto is – or isn’t. Of all the information giants on the market today, it is Google that has defined our current system of the world, the set of ideas that inform a society’s technology and institutions, and shape the lives of its citizens. Let’s start with Google’s vision of knowledge, which is built around big data. Google doesn’t use traditional methods for increasing knowledge, where step-by-step progress is made by working from previous ideas. Rather, its vision is to first gather all of the information in the world in one place – the cloud – before analyzing it using sophisticated algorithms and extract new information. To enable this, Google has built an enormous database of information, a digital rendition of the real world, starting with the internet before growing to include everything from books and languages to maps and even faces through facial recognition software, which you comb through when you use Google. And since Google wants access to all information, any sort of privacy runs contrary to its model. Next is Google’s vision of value. The company makes 95 percent of its revenue through advertising; instead of paying with money to use Google, you pay with your time and attention. Of course, most people don’t want to look at adverts – which explains why the use of ad blockers increased 102 percent between 2015 and 2016 alone. Google, however, is famously subtle, placing sponsored links at the top of searches where they blend in and don’t seem so obtrusive. To manage and facilitate the online architecture that all this data and advertising requires, Google has built their own enormous data center near the town of The Dalles, Oregon. It currently houses 75,000 computer servers and handles 3.5 billion searches per day – that’s 1.5 trillion every year! These servers have enabled Google to expand with web services like Gmail and Google Docs, while simultaneously creating a new yardstick for tech companies: the more storage and processing you can offer, the better you are. But is this really the case? Jaron Lanier, widely considered to be the inventor of virtual reality, refers to these huge centers as “Siren Servers,” invoking the Greek myth where sailors are drawn to their death on the rocks by the alluring song of the Siren bird-women. Is he right to call them so? Could these very same centers, which have given Google and others apparent market dominance, be pulling them toward an early grave? In January 2017, a “secret” gathering took place in Monterey Bay, California, attended by some of the pioneers of the information age, such as Google cofounder Larry Page. Their intention was to discuss and prepare to inform the world of the developing risks in the growing field of Artificial Intelligence, or AI. But most of the attendees were actually helping develop AI in Silicon Valley – why would they want to warn people of its dangers? These Silicon Valley pioneers believe that an AI-dominated future is inevitable. If they don’t develop it, someone else will. So the most good they can do is be involved and try to keep people informed of its dangers. But are these dangers real? To find out, we first need to look into the history of mathematics. In 1930, at a conference in his hometown of Königsberg, Germany (present-day Kaliningrad, Russia) mathematician David Hilbert presented the idea that all science could eventually be reduced to mathematics in a complete system – a system with a single unifying theory that covers everything, everywhere, with no uncertainty. However, the previous day at the same conference, the much younger mathematician Kurt Gödel had demonstrated that there can be no absolutely complete logical system. Any logical system, including any mathematical one, depends on premises that simply can’t be proved within it – you always need an outside authority. This is why humans can not only discover systems, they can create them too, and this is in fact how computer programming works: you create a system by defining rules for it from the outside. For AI to be dangerous in the way that Silicon Valley believes, AI would have to be a complete system. If it were to be complete, then once it had all the data in the world – a primary objective of Google, as we have seen – it could teach itself simply from the data it gathers, without the need for human input, quickly outpacing human intelligence and gaining dominance over us. But we needn’t fear this because, as Gödel demonstrated, all logical systems are incomplete. This means that if AI really is a threat, it must be programmed that way first. It couldn’t do it entirely on its own because it would need an outside authority – namely us humans, the ones who program it. All these fears of a tyrannical AI are really only the paranoid thoughts of scientists and engineers about the consequences of their own supposedly superior intelligence. In 2013, the Guatemalan Universidad Francisco Marroquín became the first university in the Americas to allow payments with the cryptocurrency bitcoin. This forward-facing move shows how some academic institutions are embracing progress more than others. Many American universities, on the other hand, would rather focus on reactionary measures that end up halting progress instead of enabling it. Harvard University, for example, has made several resolutions in recent years to combat climate change by distancing themselves from fossil fuels. But this is too focused on teaching students how to stop things instead of how to be innovative, look forward and come up with the solutions of the future. Other universities focus on nurturing their own reputation more than education. In the 20 years that Stephen Trachtenberg was president of George Washington State University, the price of tuition more than doubled from $27,000 to almost $60,000, with apparently no improvement of education standards and Trachtenberg claiming that a degree from the university serves instead as a “trophy.” Luckily, there are some institutions fighting against these trends. Named after founder and entrepreneur Peter Thiel, the Thiel Foundation awards the Thiel Fellowship, a $100,000 grant to encourage promising students in their early 20s or younger to quit college and pursue their own unique projects, with the aim of creating businesses and entrepreneurs rather than academics. It was led for its first five years by Danielle Strachman and Mike Gibson, who in 2015 together went on to found the 1517 Fund, a similar project that invests in Thiel Fellows and other young company founders. It’s named after the year that Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses on a church door in Wittenberg, Germany, which ignited the Reformation. In October 2017, the 1517 Fund posted their own “New 95.” These put forward the message that the education system wasn’t enabling scientific breakthroughs and progress, and should therefore be rebelled against. In 2013, the Thiel Fellowship was granted to Austin Russell for his company Luminar, which builds laser-radar chips vital for self-driving cars. In 2017, Toyota announced it would be purchasing chips from Luminar for its own cars. And in 2014, the fellowship was granted to Vitalik Buterin, a college dropout who attended the secret meeting in Monterey Bay mentioned in the previous blink, to help set up the blockchain platform Ethereum. This technology – blockchain – is set to change the world. But what exactly is it? In October 2008, a mysterious character known as Satoshi Nakamoto revealed the first cryptocurrency: the bitcoin, which has since come to steadily change the world we live in. To understand bitcoin, we need to dive into an emerging online world that the author calls the cryptocosm. In the cryptocosm, personal data is decentralized from any universal and easily targetable central hub, and is instead held by every individual. Each user has two keys specific to their online account, one public and one private. Whenever you send a message to a user, it is encrypted using the public key, but in such a way that it can only be deciphered with the user’s private key, so only they could ever read it. When they encrypt a response, they use their private key again, leaving a unique digital signature that proves their identity securely without revealing any personal information. These signatures are integral to bitcoin and its blockchain technology. Roughly every ten minutes, a block is created, which logs all the information about the most recent activity of bitcoins. This includes the digital signatures relevant to every transaction of bitcoin. It also includes a time-stamp, showing exactly when the block was made. The time-stamp is created through mining. A new block can only be created once a complicated and time-consuming algorithmic problem has been solved by using the processing power of many computers from across the network. This is mining. When it’s complete and the problem is solved, a proof of work is generated, which time-stamps the block that’s just been built. And, as compensation for the mining, new bitcoins are generated. Since the time-stamp can only be created once the mining has really been done, it can’t be forged. And since creating it involves many computers, it is verified by multiple users. This makes the information in the block trustworthy and unhackable. Bitcoins get around. Every transfer and creation of one is registered in the next block created. All of these blocks are connected in a chronological chain which is unsurprisingly called a blockchain, and which is public. Each block has a unique fingerprint and leaves traces in all subsequent blocks, meaning anyone can trace a bitcoin’s trajectory all the way back to when it was first created. The fingerprints also make it near impossible to edit the information inside any one block, since you’d have to edit all the previous blocks as well. Meaning that the bitcoin ledger – the record of all its transactions – is almost completely unhackable, and every transaction is thus very secure. No wonder so many businesses are pouncing on the technology! In 2016, Australian computer scientist and businessman Craig Steven Wright came out claiming that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Some believed him, but many remained skeptical. One of these skeptics argued that it would have been much easier for Wright to prove his identity by posting “Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto” with Satoshi’s private key than to try to convince people in person instead. For this reason, it was considered unlikely that Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto. Who was this young skeptic calling out the supposed creator of bitcoin? None other than the college dropout we learned about earlier: 24-year-old Vitalik Buterin, founder of another important blockchain company: Ethereum. Ethereum launched in 2015 and is a blockchain app platform designed to securely handle and verify objects other than just cryptocurrencies, most notably smart contracts. With smart contracts, the parties involved in a transaction send their assets – be it shares, currency or anything else of value – via the blockchain. As long as all parties comply, the assets are then released and transferred on accordingly; otherwise, they’re just refunded. Just two years after Ethereum’s launch, it had enabled a wave of entrepreneurial creativity via these secure investment capabilities, sidestepping cumbersome regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission that had slowed investment in recent years. It also has its own coin on the platform, ether, which in May 2018 had a market cap close to $60 billion – already almost half that of bitcoin! It’s too early to tell if Ethereum will outrun bitcoin, but the Greek-British blockchain scholar Andreas Antonopoulos says it might end up like a rivalry between a lion and a shark, where each dominates its own domain. But Ethereum isn’t the only other blockchain enterprise flourishing in the cryptocosm. The company Blockstack, led by computer scientist Muneeb Ali, is building an entirely new network for decentralized blockchain apps. Blockstack is both a browsable network and an open-source platform for app development using blockchain technology, allowing both developers and users an easy way into the secure world of blockchains. It’s built on just two key software structures – a monolith, a blockchain software underpinning everything, and a metaverse, a visible platform where users create, surf and share as they see fit. This is just one way that the blockchain is giving security and power back to individual users. But it’s not just software that’s standing up to Google’s dominance; there’s change brewing in the hardware sector as well. In computer science, Moore’s Law dictates that the cost-effectiveness of circuits doubles every two years, while its corollary, Bell’s Law, states that every ten years, a huge drop in the price of processing power causes the development of a brand new computer architecture. It happened when the PC replaced the huge mainframes of IBM in the 70s and 80s, then more recently with Google’s cloud. Are we due for another shift soon? In Silicon Valley, it seems to be arriving in a rebirth of hardware manufacturing. Though many Valley companies are no longer building the silicon chips that gave the area its name, some such as Nvidia and their chief scientist Bill Dally still are. However, they are moving in a different direction, away from fast but energy-demanding “hot” chips to cooler and more efficient ones, enabled by the cheaper circuitry now available. Dally has long championed the capabilities of graphics processors and their parallel processing systems, where multiple functions gently yet efficiently run at once, rather than having all data moving rapidly up and down a single information highway. He believes these types of processors could be crucial in emerging fields such as sensors for self-driving cars, where life and death depends on analyzing and interpreting many different objects and events simultaneously. Google and other information giants, meanwhile, are still stuck on the task of achieving cheaper and more powerful processing power to support their massive and growing centralized servers. In fact, it seems that they’re demanding more extra power than is actually feasible in the current technological landscape. But for technologies that do not use centralized clouds, there are exciting developments happening. One is the emergence of the company Golem, built on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Describing itself as an “Airbnb for computers,” Golem rents your computer processing power when you’re not using it and pools it all into one enormous virtual-supercomputer! This creates huge processing power, allowing users to perform normally expensive processes such as computer-graphics rendering for much cheaper, and without requiring the massive and expensive hubs of Siren Servers like Google’s. And individual storage and software is kept secure by use of blockchain technology. Such shifts in technology are improving security and capability. Is there anything that could really slow down the rise of the blockchain? In the eighteenth century, the British physicist Isaac Newton established the gold standard. For almost 200 years, governments worldwide guaranteed their currencies against the value of gold, in a bid to ensure economic stability. Why gold? Well, for starters, it is the most resistant to corrosion of the precious metals, so you can be fairly sure it won’t disappear. And its value is predictable too, since its supply, through mining and excavation worldwide, increases gradually enough so as to have barely any effect on its worth. And while mining technology may improve, it’s essentially canceled out by the fact that new gold deposits are harder and harder to access. So it made for a useful standard – an unchanging touchstone against which to stabilize the volatile international economic elements of exchange rates and interest rates. But governments have since abandoned it, instead preferring to let the markets decide the value of currencies. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Nakamoto promised to change this, hoping that bitcoin could become a new and improved gold standard. Along with the first bitcoin block, Nakamoto created a mining algorithm, which makes it harder and harder to solve the algorithmic problem required to create blocks and their corollary bitcoins. In this way, he hoped to offset the improvement of computer processing power, much like the increasing inaccessibility of gold deposits offsets technological advances. He also capped the total supply of bitcoins at 21 million, with the mineable amount being halved every year. With these caveats, Satoshi hoped to create a stable and predictable supply of bitcoins over time, thus allowing it to become a new gold standard. But, according to economics blogger Mike Kendall, bitcoin can’t become a standard because it’s already a token of exchange, and a volatile one at that. Because its supply is fixed, the only way it can react to changes in demand is by wild fluctuations in its value. And this has already happened: between 2017 and 2018, bitcoin’s value ranged from $1,183 to a peak of $19,401. With this in mind, how could bitcoin act as a predictable and stable standard? Satoshi may have made amazing technological advances in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but his understanding of real-world economics may be flawed. It’s up to other cryptocurrencies to fix the remaining mistakes and continue to build the cryptocosm, thus paving a way out of the cluttered and extensive systems of Google. The key message in these blinks: Google has built a world where individual security comes second to the data storage of a centralized hub. But its dominance now seems to be reaching a tipping point. By working outside of the dominant and traditional systems, the cryptocosm along with the blockchain has laid the foundation for a completely new way of protecting individual data and conducting online business. It can potentially pull apart the cluttered and exhaustive systems of Google while enabling progress and technological change in many fields. Got feedback?

Sitting around all day doing nothing, they get fat. Curiously, the opposite is true with money. Leave it sitting around, and you’ll find that the total just gets smaller and smaller. To make that pile of dough grow, you need to exercise it, or make it work! These blinks explain exactly how you can turn a small nest egg into a mountain of cash that will let you live your life exactly how you want to. If you invest your money in the right places, then financial security will follow. And if you’re smart about it, you may never need to work ever again! In the following blinks, you’ll discover how the seasons of the year can help you strategize your investments; how much money you really need to save before you can quit your job; and why believing in yourself is the best financial advice anyone can give you. How hard is your money working for you? If you're like most people, your money probably hasn't been exercising at all. It's been sitting lazily in your bank account, growing only minutely – if at all. This needs to change. We need to make our money work hard, especially as we won't be able to rely on traditional saving methods in the future. You may imagine that growing your money is difficult. Maybe you're happy with your income, even if it's not enough to cover your retirement, because you assume you can rely on a pension or retirement fund to help you out. Unfortunately, this isn't true. Many of the world's retirement systems are failing. In the United States, a 401k retirement plan was originally invented to supplement income in old age, but for many, it's the only thing they have to rely on. Other pension plans were hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis, and those who paid into them lost a great deal. You can avoid this if you let your money work for you, by compounding. Compounding means letting your money develop year after year, by allowing interest to build up. Say you invest $100, and this generates a 10 percent profit. If you leave the investment untouched, you'll generate another 10 percent on $110 the year after, then on $121 the following year, and so on. When Benjamin Franklin died in 1790, he left $1,000 to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia. He stipulated that it had to be invested and not touched for 100 years. After that time passed, half a million was drawn from the account, and the rest was left untouched for another 100 years. By that time, the original sum had transformed into $6.5 million. So if you want to become financially secure, where do you start? The first rule of financial security is simple: add money to your savings. If you don't, your situation simply can't improve. Saving is never easy, but try not to think of it as a boring, sometimes painful pursuit. Imagine that you're adding to your freedom fund, the base on which your financial freedom will be built. Your freedom fund is like your own personal ATM, a place from which you can always withdraw funds. You won't have a lot of cash in the beginning, but you can build the amount gradually. Think of it like climbing a mountain. At first, it’s hard and you won't seem to be getting anywhere. When you reach the top, however, you'll suddenly realize why you worked so hard! Adding to your freedom fund is so vital that you need to keep doing it, even when you think you don't have enough cash to go around. You always can put a bit aside for your freedom fund. Do you really need to go out for dinner again this week? Can you order a pizza or cook for yourself instead? Make any small adjustments you can to be able to save more. And luckily, the magic of compounding ensures that the more you add, the greater the returns you'll get. Ultimately, you should aim to save 10 percent of your income, though that'll be difficult at first. Even if you can manage just 5 percent or less, however, you'll still benefit from the generated interest. Any talk of investing automatically sets off alarm bells. You may think, “What happens if I invest in the wrong thing?” or “Should I get a professional to manage my investments for me?” Financial professionals really don't know what's best for you or your money. Many people let stockbrokers manage their investment funds, but here’s an important thing to remember. Your advisor gets paid, whether you profit or not. Their job is to sell you things, whether good or bad. Other people invest in mutual funds, or combined pools of investment opportunities managed by a professional. Mutual funds often come with large fees attached, however. When you consider these fees and the average returns they earn, it's clear such funds aren't the wisest financial decisions. There is one expert you can trust: a fiduciary. Fiduciaries are professionals who are required by law to have no other interests except your own (unlike stockbrokers). This means you can actually trust their advice. You can learn to invest on your own, however, as long as you remember a couple of helpful rules. The first rule is that you have to believe in yourself. If you have a fatalistic attitude when you try something, you're bound to fail. Next, do your research. Don't fall into the trap of believing myths or blindly following what others do. Find out what you need for yourself. You can also try learning about what other successful people have done with their investments, and see if you can do the same. Finally, be cautious. Don't expect that you're going to beat the market, as very few do. Try your best, but know that there is no simple or magic path to success! How much money do you think you’ll need to feel completely free from financial stress? Do you need a couple hundred dollars, perhaps a few thousand, or even a few million? The first thing you need to remember is to be realistic. Don't try for goals you can't actually achieve. Ultimately, your goals depend on you and what you want. Here are five different goals to get you thinking about just how far you want to go. Goal one: Generate enough money from investments to cover your basic monthly bills, for things like rent, mortgage, food, energy and transport. Goal two: Generate enough to cover basic needs plus extra for fun things, like new clothes or entertainment. Goal three: Generate enough to secure your financial independence. This means living entirely on compounding interest and never having to work again. The average annual spending for an American adult is $34,688; so if you want to generate this amount each year, you need about $640,000 in your freedom fund. Goal four: Don't just get your investments to free you from work but make them improve your lifestyle. Earn even more so you can go on better holidays or eat in nicer restaurants. Goal five: Achieve absolute financial freedom. This means having enough money to do anything you want at any time! Think about these goals and determine which fits your dreams and financial aspirations. If you don't have a plan, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or get lost in the details. When you know what you're aiming for, it's much easier to get there. When you decide what amount you need in your freedom fund, you can start thinking about how you want to invest your money. When you start your journey toward financial freedom, it'll be hard at first, but don't give up! You can achieve financial freedom, as long as you keep working at it. Along your journey, you'll definitely encounter others who are saving more than you, and at times you may feel like your income isn't high enough for you to save. But don't let these things discourage you! You have to ignore that inner voice that might tell you to give up. Self-doubt isn't the only thing that might distract you. Another thing that often holds people back is short-term thinking. Many people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year, but then underestimate what they can accomplish in a decade. If you don't meet your goals for your first year, keep working – you can still catch up over time. As you keep working toward your financial freedom, keep a few tips in mind. First, speed things up by changing your life and lifestyle. Don't wait until retirement to downsize. Do it now so you can save money on mortgage payments, heating and taxes. Also, only invest when you know you'll get good returns, to ensure your compounding continues at a decent rate. A good rule to use here is to only invest when you expect returns of over five times the amount. Even if you fail to get those returns three out of five times, you'll still have earned enough. Finally, always keep trying to lessen your tax burden. The average American pays 54.25 percent of their income in taxes. Make it a goal to reduce this. So after you've saved enough in your freedom fund that you’re ready to invest, what's next?  The key to investing wisely is knowing how to diversify. You should invest in different financial products that have varying degrees of risk. There are three areas, or buckets, where you need to concentrate your investments. The first bucket is your security bucket. This is where you put investments that are the most secure, even if they aren't necessarily the most profitable. Bonds, for example, should go in this bucket. Bonds don’t offer massive returns, but are also unlikely to lose value. Next there is your growth bucket, which is for investments that are riskier. This is where you can earn big returns, but you can lose more, too. You might invest in equities, meaning stocks and shares. Many stocks beat the market average in the long run, but they may be volatile and lose value in the short term. The last bucket is your dream bucket. This is where you put some of the profits you earn from your other buckets. Your dream bucket helps improve your lifestyle. Remember: the entire point of achieving financial security is to spend your money in ways you enjoy. If you don't have a dream bucket, saving and investing is useless! So how much should you put in each bucket? Well, it depends on your attitude, how risk averse you are, the strength of your freedom fund and what you're trying to get out of life. Strive to keep everything balanced. As you earn and lose money, you'll need to keep constantly moving it around to ensure that each bucket has the optimum amount. If you want to succeed in anything, it's a good idea to learn from people who have succeeded before you.  Finance is no different. When you analyze and copy what other successful investors have done, you'll have a much better chance of reaching your goals. Ray Dalio is a good role model. He founded Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world. Dalio's investment plan is known as the All Season Allocation. It's designed to help you make money, no matter what financial conditions you're facing. The economy goes through different periods, just like the seasons of the year. All Season Allocation strategies guide you on how to make money despite the market’s changing conditions. Consider this investment mix, used by Ray Dalio: Put 7.5 percent of your assets in gold and 7.5 percent in commodities. Gold and commodities are often good investments, even during periods of high inflation. Then put 30 percent in stocks, especially during seasons of high growth in which you can earn more. Finally, put 55 percent into US bonds, which are very low-risk. Also, no matter what method you're following, get yourself insured for the bad times. Convert some of your savings into annuities, or financial contracts where an insurance company guarantees future payments in exchange for immediate payments. This will help ensure that you get a guaranteed lifetime income. When you are comfortable with All Season Allocation, and you establish your income insurance through annuities, you'll be able to reach financial freedom! The key message in this book: Anyone can reach financial freedom if they're dedicated, willing to save and ready to follow the necessary steps. So keep at it, even if your progress is slow at first. Diversify your investments, seek advice you can trust, prepare for different financial “seasons” and get yourself insured. If you work hard, you can become the master of your money and live the life you really want. Actionable advice: Don't forget your ultimate goal: spending your money the way you want. Money itself can’t bring you happiness, it's what you do with it that matters. Having lots of money in your bank account won't make you happy, but spending it the right way will. So remember that you're working to be able to spend it on experiences you enjoy, or that give your life meaning. Don't forget that saving itself isn't the point!

So devastating was the Great Depression of the 1930s that politicians were determined to act and prevent such an event from happening again. And yet the unthinkable recurred in 2008. How did we once more end up mired in a major financial crisis? Didn’t we learn our lessons from the past? Apparently not. These blinks reveal how the financial industry controls our economy. You will be taken through time from the 1920s until today, see how politics tried to tame the world of finance, why the industry’s behemoths knew how to resist and how a new crisis emerged. You’ll also learn who’s the culprit behind the credit card; why Goldman Sachs likes to move around aluminum; and how money-focused management at GM contributed to the death of 124 people.  Americans who experienced the Great Depression of the 1930s probably felt a little déjà vu about the crash of 2008. Debt, credit and economic bubbles were instrumental in both financial crises. Just as in 2008, the Great Depression followed on from mounting debt and consumer credit. Debt, like credit card use, is a financial product. The more debt is issued, the larger the financial sector grows. When the author was writing Makers and Takers, the financial sector was the same size it had been just prior to the Great Depression – a size it has not reached at any other point in history. Credit is rampant today in the United States, just as it was in 1920s America. Back then, Americans used credit to gain access to around 75 percent of major household items. Before the Great Depression and our own Great Recession, credit was used to mask the severe income inequality that resulted from declining workers’ wages and the skyrocketing profits made by stock market investors. Finally, the years leading up to the 1929 financial crash were characterized by a steadily growing economic bubble. After the fall, the bankers weren’t held accountable – sound familiar? The 1920s bubble emerged after copper prices fell, and banks such as the National City Bank of New York sold stocks in copper mines, telling their oblivious customers that they were a prudent investment. This created the bubble that eventually triggered the 1929 stock market crash. While National City chairman Charles Mitchell was subjected to public shaming in Senate hearings, he returned to Wall Street soon after. In fact, he never spent a day in prison. The same goes for the bankers responsible for our financial crisis. Richard Fuld, former head of Lehman Brothers, continues to work in the financial sector at Matrix Advisors and Legend Securities. The similarities between both financial crises might leave you wondering whether we’ve learned anything from history at all. In the next blink, we’ll investigate how the American economy managed to take us back to the 1930s in 2008. After the stock-market crash of Black Tuesday, 29 October 1929, the Glass–Steagall Act was enforced. The new legislation separated the commercial and investment activities of American banks to protect the public from their risky trading. Despite these regulations, the lines between commercial and investment banking remained blurred. It wasn’t long before bankers began to use this to their advantage again. In the late 1940s, Walter Wriston of the National City Bank of New York introduced a new product to further dissolve the boundary between investment and commercial banking – the negotiable certificate of deposit, or CD for short. CDs were a special kind of savings account with higher interest rates. They were intended to keep rich people’s money out of personal bank accounts, making it harder for tax authorities to keep tabs on them. Commercial banks have always managed bank accounts, but Wriston began selling the CDs for others to trade at a profit. Another blow to the Glass–Steagall Act (and a win for traders like Wriston) arrived in 1967 – credit cards. They were invented after consumers became disgruntled about high inflation eating away at their buying power. Credit cards helped loosen regulation surrounding the issuing of credit and rates. As commercial and investment banking continued to merge, it wasn’t just bankers who were running the show – politicians also had a role to play. After World War II, Americans came to expect more wealth. Rising inflation had stunted economic growth, and with growing demand for looser credit regulations, President Carter deregulated interest rates altogether in 1980. This allowed banks to offer whatever rates they liked to draw in funds as they created complex financial products that were nearly impossible to regulate, from variable-rate mortgages to derivatives. If someone pees in a pool, all the water becomes contaminated. The same goes for the economic system – what goes down in finance affects the waters of the entire economy. This is what happened when financial models for maximizing profit were introduced. In finance, the focus on increasing shareholder value has led businesses to prioritize short-term gains over long-term company value, cutting back costs and endangering the quality of their product in turn. General Motors, for instance, had to recall hundreds of thousands of vehicles in 2013 because of a switch failure. Engineers responsible for the switch had noticed the failure and introduced a redesign, but didn’t relabel the new part. Why? Because they feared telling those higher up the ladder about the glitch in their strict, cost-controlling organization. The public paid a high price for General Motors’ mistake: the switch has caused 124 casualties and many injuries. Shareholder interests also dictate how companies produce goods. This goes against one of the fundamental concepts of the free market, in which consumer demand dictates what products and services companies offer. Nowadays, companies across multiple sectors barely seem interested in fulfilling a customer need with a new product. They remain focused on boosting shareholder value in the short term. Consider how in 2010 a Morgan Stanley report called on the pharmaceutical industry to create value by paying shareholders and buying out companies instead of researching. This was a clear sign of the power Wall Street has over strategic decisions in the industries we depend on to help us live – and sometimes even to save our lives. Imagine asking a friend for a dollar. They agree, but only on the condition that you pay them back two dollars later. Bad deal, right? Well, this is essentially what the current relationship between shareholders and companies looks like. The benefits of profitable large companies primarily go to their shareholders. Back in the 1980s, shareholders who actively tried to influence corporate policy to increase their returns were branded corporate raiders. Today, they’re simply called shareholder activists and make millions. After buying shares of high-profile companies, shareholder activists attempt to boost their value by influencing the board. Consider the relationship between Apple and shareholder activist Carl Icahn. Between 2012 and 2015, the company returned $112 billion (yes, billion!) to the investor and business magnate and the other shareholders. That’s $112 billion that can no longer be put toward developing new and innovative tech to strengthen Apple’s long-term value. Apple isn’t the only company playing this game – 91 percent of all US stock is owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans. Shareholder pay-outs tend to make the rich even richer, while a minimal amount of pay-outs go to pension funds and regular citizens holding stock. Perhaps it’s only fair that companies repay their shareholders for the money they invest into the company so it can produce its products. However, shareholder activists rarely pay for R&D in the first place. Usually, governments pay for innovation. Much of the technology required for smartphones, including touchscreens, GPS, voice activation and even the internet itself were developed as part of government programs and institutions like the military, allowing big companies to turn them into profitable products later on. As wealthy individuals continue to profit from shareholder payouts for products they didn’t help develop, many are wondering how we got to this stage. Let’s investigate this in the next blink. In recent decades, big brands have become increasingly involved in lending and investing – activities that were traditionally the work of banks and financial companies. It’s getting harder and harder to tell what a company’s core business really is. Today, most large companies have a lending unit. Originally established to offer credit to customers who wanted to purchase one of their products, lending units became increasingly profitable over time. With each success, financial departments grew increasingly daring and began taking greater risks. For instance, before the 2008 crisis, General Electric (GE) was busy buying and selling businesses to increase its own stock prices. GE also had a large stake in mortgages, which is where things began to go wrong. After the real estate markets had crashed, the government was forced to bail out GE for a whopping $139 million. As companies begin to behave more like banks, banks are also giving companies a run for their money. In 2011, teams at Coca-Cola realized that there was something strange going on in the aluminum market. Demand wasn’t rising, but prices were. It was revealed that Goldman Sachs had bought aluminum storage plants to cleverly exploit a loophole. While it’s illegal, after a certain point, to store stock and raise the prices, it wasn’t illegal to rotate the same stock between plants, which bumped up prices just as much. As a bank, Goldman was betting on the price of aluminum in the commodities market, but as a business, it was actively involved in raising the prices. Imagine having your house taken from you by somebody who then demands you pay them outrageously high rent. This, in a nutshell, is what happened both before and after the 2008 financial crisis. As banks bought up houses and rented them out, the financial sector began to benefit from the housing crisis at the expense of the average citizen. Following the 2008 crisis, both home sales and rent prices skyrocketed in the United States. You could read this trend as a sign that people are getting back on their feet and are buying properties again. Unfortunately, this is far from the case. Instead, many low-cost homes have been purchased by investment groups to rent out to families who can’t afford to buy their own home. This is a lucrative business – the Blackstone Group investment company owns 46,000 homes that provide a $1.9 billion income for the company. The reason so many families can’t afford to buy their own home in the first place is because all the affordable ones have been bought up by the very same investment groups renting them out. So although sales have risen, the percentage of Americans who own a home has been in decline since 2004. It’s not just houses that American citizens can’t afford. Retirement has also been depleted by financial activities. On average, a retirement household has around $104,000 to subsist on for their whole retirement. For couples between 55 to 64 this just isn’t enough to live a decent life for the coming 20, 30 or 40 years. This is a result of the short-sighted management of retirement plans. Like companies, fund managers are also rewarded for short-term results. Rather than focusing their strategy on long-term, sustainable growth, fund managers take on riskier bets for the chance of bigger wins. However, these risks also lead to big losses and less profit overall. Just as we ask caretakers and educators to look after our kids while we’re at work, we also expect the government to watch over the financial system. After all, it’s their responsibility. So why is it so poorly controlled? After Lehman Brothers fell in 2008, politicians seemed determined to reform the financial sector. Eight years on, only a handful of reforms have been ratified. In 2014, a few lines of legislation were added to the federal spending bill. This bill was supposedly written with the intention of forcing banks to give up their riskiest products, like swaps or derivatives, which allowed them to bet on the performance of stock market outcomes. This goal was directly undermined by the lines added to the legislation. What’s more, the politicians who voted for this amended bill to pass received 2.6 times more funding from political action committees (PACs) than those who voted against it. These PACs are comprised of J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – banks that control 90 percent of the swaps market, and who couldn’t let the bill damage their business. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that governance and finance share such a close relationship. Government officials in charge of controlling finance typically take up jobs in finance when their term ends. The high salaries paid by banks are much more attractive than the modest public service wages paid to government officials. Since 1900, 13 out of 35 Treasury secretaries have previously worked at banks. Seventeen of them went into banking after leaving their Treasury post. So what can we do to reform the financial system? The next blink will explore the author’s key recommendations. Before regulations in the financial sector were loosened, the sole purpose of finance was to support business and economic growth. In an age when companies have become banks and vice versa, how can we get finance to once again boost regular business? The first step is reducing the complexity of banking and financial regulation, which will cut risk-taking. Every day, millions of financial transactions take place with a total worth of $81.7 trillion. The financial system has become so sprawling and convoluted that it’s impossible to oversee. Banks like Citigroup are themselves so complex that even their own boards struggle to supervise their activities. Regulation law, too, is far from transparent. Just like the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, the 2010 Dodd–Frank Act attempts to separate commercial from investment banking to reduce the risk of banks failing. But the new Act is 2,319 pages long (the 1933 Act was just 37 pages in total) with a whole host of new loopholes that can be exploited to blur the lines between commercial and investment banking once more. It’s also imperative that we limit debt in order to stabilize the economy by encouraging citizens to save and by requiring banks to fund their investments with at least 20–30 percent of their own capital. This takes political courage, as debt and credit allow governments to hide economic stagnation. Following the 2008 crisis, it’s become clear that a healthy economy can only handle so much debt. The key message in this book: Unregulated, risky financial activity was behind both the Great Depression of the 1930s and the 2008 crisis. As the borders between commercial and investment banking, between commercial and political interests, and between companies and banks themselves continue to be crossed, rich shareholders profit while average citizens struggle to finance their own homes.

Woods, Jr.","summary":"In the seventeenth century, a single tulip from Holland was worth more than ten times the annual salary of a skilled craftsman. Tulip mania gripped the world, inspiring rampant economic speculation which resulted in a massive financial crash, stripping ordinary people of their life savings. Sound familiar? Whether tulips or mortgages, global markets have enjoyed countless booms and suffered through numerous busts. The most recent crisis in 2008 reverberated all over the world, with millions of people losing their jobs, their homes and their sense of well-being. Although many economies have since recovered, economists warn that the prevailing question is not if there will be another crisis but when. There has to be a better way! These blinks will explain how we got into this mess and how we can free ourselves from this disastrous boom-and-bust cycle. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the US government is to blame for the 2008 economic crisis; how an Austrian economic theory can explain busts past and present; and why suffering a bankruptcy isn’t all that bad. It’s common to see stories in the media about how unrestrained capitalism caused the most recent economic crisis. These pundits say that government should become more involved in the economy to fix the broken system. But is it possible that government, the institution tasked with repairing the economy, actually caused its collapse in the first place? Let’s take a closer look. The crisis began with the government giving mortgages to people who wouldn’t otherwise have been able to afford them. It started in 1999, when government-sponsored enterprises, better known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, put into action a Clinton administration plan to assist low-income and minority families in purchasing homes. As part of the plan, the government forged new mortgage requirements that allowed brokers to offer loans with zero money down, enabling people with no savings to buy houses. Not just that, but these new, risky mortgages were classified as creditworthy by government-backed rating agencies. These agencies then, not wanting to call politically popular programs “risky,” kept reassuring the public that the mortgages were secure. But Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the rating agencies aren’t the only ones to blame for the crisis. In fact, the Federal Reserve played a major role as well. Here’s how: In the early 2000s, the Fed slashed interest rates by printing tons of money. This input of cheap money, paired with relaxed mortgage rules, prompted a major housing boom, causing home prices to shoot up at an insane rate. With hopes of getting rich overnight, careless investors piled into the market. As a result, in 2006 some 25 percent of all home purchases were made by speculators. But the good times didn’t last long. By the end of 2006, housing prices were sinking, and foreclosures had risen by 43 percent. Since no down payments were at risk, speculators just walked out on their underwater investments. The mortgage market fell apart, and the financial system that had stuffed billions of dollars into mortgage-backed securities soon followed. This disastrous outcome came about because reckless government policies enabled people to spend money they just didn’t have. The Nobel-prize winning economist Friedrich Hayek developed what was likely the most important economic theory of the modern world. It’s called the business cycle theory, and its explanation of the boom-and-bust phases of the market applies to both the most recent crisis and economic catastrophes of the past. Here’s how it works. The business cycle theory is based on the effects of government-suppressed interest rates. That’s because artificially decreasing interest rates by printing money produces the illusion that current production can increase more than is sustainable. This deception makes entrepreneurs invest in long-term projects that aren’t based on the realistic savings necessary to feed current production levels. For instance, a builder who thinks he has 30 percent more cement than he does will build a bigger house than he has the materials for. When he realizes he’s out of cement, he won’t be able to complete his build and will have wasted time and resources on something that’s of no use. This means that by artificially lowering interest rates, the government causes people to act like they have a lot more money saved than they do. Therefore spending often spikes before a big crash. We saw the business cycle theory in action during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, for example. Between 1995 and 2000, the stock prices of internet start-ups jumped dramatically. Why did this happen? All the classical signs of the business cycle were accounted for: low interest rates prompted by the Federal Reserve’s expansion of the money supply, causing record-high debt, coupled with quickly rising capital prices for things like programmers and real estate. These factors meant that by 2000, the resources necessary to complete long-term market investments no longer existed. So the dot-com bubble burst, and the value of the Nasdaq stock exchange fell by 40 percent. So it’s clear what caused the economic crisis we’re still mired in, but how can we best deal with it? We can learn from past crises, such as the Great Depression. That’s because the foundations of the Great Depression were set by the inflationary government policies of the 1920s. So just as business cycle theory predicted the 2008 recession, it could also have predicted the depression of the 1930s. For instance, basic economics says that when the production of goods goes up, the prices of those goods go down. But that’s not what happened in the 1920s. Instead, the government increased the money supply by 55 percent, to make it seem as if prices were stable. The government thought that if prices were stable, then the economy would be as well. People gladly swallowed the government’s story and kept spending, while the stock market grew at an increasingly unsustainable pace until 1929. And while most economists at the time thought of the American economy as invincible, Austrian economists foresaw the boom’s eventual collapse. And their predictions were validated when, in October 1929, the stock market crashed. We all know what happened next: President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the New Deal, a series of social programs to boost the economy and address unemployment. But this program didn’t pull the United States out of the Great Depression; instead, it just prolonged the crisis. That’s because, instead of listening to reasonable ideas, Roosevelt kept throwing money into the economy. He refused to accept the lessons of the 1929 crash and its root causes. Neither the huge public works programs nor increased spending as a result of World War II would help save the economy. In fact, by hiking taxes and funneling millions of dollars toward businesses that had no real demand, Roosevelt stood in the way of the economy’s natural efforts to restart itself, based on the real desires of consumers. So it wasn’t until the 1940s when New Deal policies were finally ended that the economy started to recover. So just like prolonged government spending didn’t do a thing to solve the Great Depression, using government bailouts to inject billions of dollars into the broken US financial sector is a losing strategy. In fact, bailouts just exacerbate the problem. Instead, we should let failed banks and other financial institutions go bankrupt. For instance, by handing out billions of dollars to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government sent a message that failure will be rewarded. What the government really should have done is let the enterprises go bankrupt. That’s because, in the short term, a small number of well-known institutions going bankrupt sends a signal that the government is using common sense and letting the free market do its thing. Beyond this, it’s necessary to end the Federal Reserve’s unjust, Soviet-style central monetary planning. After all, with big time players such as investor Jim Rogers questioning the role of the Fed, it could be that we’re on the verge of a shift in opinion about the role of government in regulating the economy. But where should this shift lead us? First of all, to end the Fed’s obstruction of the free market, it’s necessary to reassess the institution’s relationship with the banking sector. For instance, since the Fed is the primary reason big banks can take ever-greater risks, it needs to have its position as the “lender of last resort” reevaluated. Basically, if banks keep operating under the assumption that the Fed will bail them out when their risky practices fail, the boom-bust cycle will never end. Second, the Fed needs to leave interest rates alone, as manipulating them only prolongs recessions. Instead, interest rates should float freely to fill their natural purpose of recalibrating the market to actual conditions, not artificial figures. At this point it’s clear that a government’s ability to print as much money as it wants leads to economic crises and poor investments. We need an alternative. But what exactly would that be? Money that’s connected to a commodity standard is a great way to limit government interference in the economy. That’s because, unlike paper money which can be printed endlessly, a commodity standard is tied to a supply of material like gold, which can only increase as more is discovered. But don’t worry, this doesn’t mean you’ll have to walk around with a bag full of gold to buy your groceries! A paper substitute could be linked to the value of gold, and people could exchange paper money for gold at any time. The government is naturally against such an initiative because, without the ability to print more paper money, it would need to use borrowing or tax changes to affect the economy. And it would be a lot easier for the public to protest such actions than remain perpetually in the dark, considering the secretive inflationary policies currently used by the government. But that’s not the only reason such a system would be beneficial. Another reason is that while inflation is bad for the economy, deflation can be good for it. That’s because inflation is an increase in the money supply while deflation – the opposite – means lower consumer prices. Some critics of a gold-based commodity standard say that having such a system would cause deflation, since the supply of consumer goods would consistently outpace that of gold. These critics maintain that falling prices would cause an economic crisis. However, a 2004 study revealed that 90 percent of deflationary periods in the last 100 years (barring those that occurred during the Great Depression) did not in fact lead to economic depression. Deflation is, after all, a natural process in any growing capitalist economy. Consider the technology market. While the quality-adjusted price of computers fell by 90 percent from 1980 to 1999, manufacturers were shipping out nearly 100 times more units by the end of that same period. This single example offers proof that deflation can also be good for both consumers and producers. The key message in this book: While the mainstream media maintains that rampant capitalism caused the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government is actually to blame. That’s because by depressing interest rates and fostering economic bubbles, the government caused the near disintegration of the US economy.   Actionable advice: Lobby the government to stop its endless spending! When the government spends more money than it collects in taxes, where does the remainder come from? From debts that cause interest rates to rise. So when the government spends too much, it has to borrow money and then push down interest rates by pouring money into the economy, thereby devaluing the dollar and prompting an economic crisis. Thus cutting government spending is necessary – and as citizens, we need to tell the government to do so. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

More than likely you don’t, and even if you do, you’ll be thinking, “I don’t need to consider saving for old age, it’s 40 years away.” Yet this view is completely wrong. No matter how young we are, we should always give thought to the future. This is especially true for Millennials, the generation born between 1980 and 2000. To put it bluntly, if Millennials want to have a peaceful, comfortable retirement, they have to act now. If they fail to, they will find life as pensioners very tough indeed. So what should Millennials be doing to be secure in old age? They should invest in the stock market. These blinks will show you how to do so effectively. In these blinks you will discover why you won’t be able to rely on a state pension in the future; how you can turn $10,000 into $4.7 million; and why you shouldn’t follow the crowd when investing. Imagine yourself in 50 years: What kind of life would you like to have? Do you want to live comfortably, with lots of money saved, or would you rather be dependent on a tiny pension, feeling pangs of anxiety with every purchase? The choice between these two realities is an obvious one. So what can you do to achieve lasting financial stability? Although many believe that creating a savings account is the best way to prepare for the financial future, unfortunately, that’s not the case. The truth is, interest rates on savings accounts are typically lower than the rate of inflation (annual price increases). Meaning: Money parked in a savings account actually loses value, in terms of its real world purchasing power. So if not savings accounts, then what? Well, you should invest in the stock market as early as possible. Don’t underestimate the potential rewards of starting to invest early in life. After all, when you start young, your money has more time to multiply in value. For instance, if you invest $10,000 every year on the stock exchange with an annual return of seven percent, you’ll earn $4.7 million by the time you’re 65 – if you started investing at age 22. On the other hand, if you made the initial investment only at age 40, you’ll end up with just $1 million. Although the advantages of investing young are clear, many Millennials aren’t doing so, partly because they entered adulthood in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis – the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And as a consequence of the financial collapse, Millennials tend to be more risk-averse than their parents’ generation. For example, a 2014 survey on risk found that only 28 percent of Millennials’ money was invested in stocks, compared to the 46 percent invested by other generations. Some people think, “I don’t have to invest for the future because when I retire, I’ll have a pension!” But what if you don’t? It’s a real possibility. After all, America’s population is aging, leading to increasing pension costs for the government. Consider the fact that average life expectancy increased from 47 in 1900, to 79 in 2013. Today, there are more people living past retirement age than ever before. As a consequence, the government has higher costs for pensions and health care. Medicare spending, which has grown by 11 percent every year since it was first established in 1966, is one example of this trend. And unfortunately, this upward trajectory will likely remain stable in the short-term, especially since baby boomers (the enormous generation born after World War Two) are just starting to retire. And ultimately, since these rising health care and retirement costs are untenable, there’s no guarantee that the government will continue to pay retirement benefits to future generations. Remember, our government runs like any business: If it doesn’t keep its accounts balanced, it risks bankruptcy. Or to put it more concretely, the government has to receive enough in taxes to match benefit spending. But that’s not currently happening: According to recent calculations, there’s a $9.6 trillion gap between projected spending on benefits over the next 75 years, and what the government expects to raise through taxes. For Millennials, that’s a huge problem. It means that although this younger generation is currently paying taxes to support the elderly, it’s unlikely to receive the same benefits when it reaches retirement age. So this mean Millennials will probably have to support themselves without government assistance. And if they hope to do so, then they should start investing in the stock market as early as possible. If you’ve decided to start investing in the stock market, you’re probably wondering where to begin. Well, the first guiding principle is to invest in companies all across the world. Many people don’t follow this advice: They put all their money into a few companies located in just one country. But in the long-term, this is a risky strategy. Because if the stock market in that country struggles, you could potentially lose all your money. Consider Japan’s stock market index, the Nikkei, which was growing at 30 percent in 1989. Although many people made huge investments in this seemingly “strong” market, the massive growth turned out to be a product of an unstable financial bubble – and the bubble burst in 1991. Ultimately, a 1989 Nikkei investor’s portfolio would only be worth half as much in 2013. As you can see, putting all your eggs in one basket is dangerous – so why do people do it? Well, many get swept up in the false promise of a stock market bubble. Others feel that they’re investing wisely because they’re buying shares in companies they “know.” For example, in 2010, American investors had 72 percent of their money in US stocks. Simply put, Americans prefer to invest in familiar companies, like Burger King and General Motors. But if you want to invest successfully, get out of your safety zone and spread your investments over large, diverse areas. This approach will protect your money even if one company or economy collapses. It’s also worth noting that diversifying will help you earn more, as global currencies change in value. For instance, say you invest in Samsung, which is based in South Korea. If the South Korean won strengthens against the US dollar by six percent, the value of your investment will also increase by six percent. In other words, when you buy stock market shares, you’re not only investing in the company, you’re also investing in the currency. Many people determine their investment strategies by what the “experts” recommend. And often those investment experts will recommend a tactic called Sector Leaders Strategy – that is, buying shares of the best-performing companies determined by a particular market index, which tracks a portion of the stock market. The Standard & Poor 500, for example, is based on the biggest customers listed on the exchange. So to follow the Sector Leaders Strategy, you could invest in an index fund, which aggregates stocks from the 500 biggest companies. Since index funds are calculated automatically and don’t require much human brainpower to run efficiently, they’re cheap to buy and also secure – which makes them an attractive investment option. However, if you want to earn the highest returns on the money you invest, you shouldn’t follow the herd. Instead, you need to be different. Because although index funds tend to give good returns, they’ll never beat the market – especially if they aim to match the returns of the market index. But there’s another reason to consider alternatives to index funds: The biggest companies tend to underperform when they reach the top. For instance, major American companies like Apple and Intel typically start posting a negative annual return once they hit the $400 billion mark. Therefore, investing in these firms may not be the most profitable choice. By contrast, you can try following the Sector Bargains Strategy – which entails buying the cheapest stock, not the best – to maximize your returns. Although it might seem counterintuitive, these kinds of approaches often outperform the leader strategy in the long-run. For instance, since 1979, the value of the Russell 3000 (an index fund which follows, more or less, a bargain strategy) has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 1,100 percent. As we’ve already seen, being different is the best investment approach. So let’s examine this principle a little more closely. For our purposes, the ideal investment strategy – let’s call it the Millennial Money Strategy – can be summarized thus: Buy cheap stock from valuable companies. Why is this the best strategy? Well, by buying a cheap stock (that is, one with a lower share price), you’re stretching your investment and potentially maximizing your future returns. And as we noted, you’re trying to find a true bargain – not merely the cheapest stock available. So when you’re buying shares, you need to ensure that the company has value and that the (currently low) share price is likely to rise in the future. To that end, what can you do to evaluate a company’s long-term prospects? Start by looking at how much the company earns; also pay attention to how much cash it attracts (in some cases, reported earnings are actually coming out of credit or loans). Then, to find the best bargain, compare the company’s stock price to its cash flow. This relationship indicates value/valuation. Ultimately, you’re trying to identify companies that have a cheap share price and secure finances. You can also boost this strategy by finding the right momentum and buying shares just as the market notices a company’s potential. An easy way of finding a stock that’s riding a wave of momentum is to look out for cheaper shares that have seen substantial price increases over the last six months. Ultimately, you should try to carve out an investment approach that combines value-seeking with momentum. And if you need a little more convincing, consider the fact that since 1972, companies that have matched these criteria have grown at an annual rate that outpaces market growth by a factor of two. Humans are hard-wired to make investment mistakes; essentially, we’re programmed to be irrationally fearful. In fact, it’s even been scientifically proven that we’re subject to something called constructive paranoia – that is, excessive sensitivity to loss. Consider a Stanford study that asked students to make 20 investment decisions. During each round, students had to decide whether they wanted to invest $1. A coin toss decided the outcome of the investment: If the penny came up heads, the students lost $1; when it landed on tails, they earned $2.50. As it turned out, after experiencing a loss, students were only willing to invest 41 percent of the time. However, rationally speaking, the decision didn’t make sense – because there was a 50 percent chance of winning a high reward! This tendency affects the market. For instance, investors often buy at market peaks (for fear of missing out) and sell at market bottoms (because they’re scared of losing everything). So plenty of people irrationally buy high and sell low, contrary to the most basic maxim of stock trading. But constructive paranoia isn’t the only investing mistake built into our programming: so is greediness. In general, we tend to pursue rewards even when our chances of getting these rewards are dismal. And in large part, this impulse drives financial bubbles: Even though there’s a strong likelihood that the bubble will burst, people still invest, because they’re blinded by the possibility of future rewards. Although you can never eliminate your instincts, it is possible to separate them from your investments by creating an automated system. For instance, you could set up an automatic payment from your bank account into your investment account. You would determine the amount and regularity of the payment in advance, as well as the fund you’d like to purchase with the money. So the idea is that once you’ve determined a particular strategy, you should apply it systematically, without letting your instincts get in the way. And having an automatized payment system is one way of doing this. Sometimes inexperienced investors think they need to sell their shares as soon as they start losing value. And yet, this kind of short-term thinking typically isn’t profitable. So why do we go for it in the first place? Well, our biology plays a big role: Humans have an emotional center, located in the brain (the limbic system), that pushes us to make decisions that will provide instant gratification. This impulse explains why investors prefer to buy bonds during periods of financial crisis. Since bonds bounce less than stocks in the short term, they provide instant gratification – in the sense that they protect the investor from dealing with negative numbers. That way, the investor feels that her wealth is protected and preserved. Short-term thinking also afflicts professional investors, who are preoccupied with their short-term career horizons. These professionals often create investment strategies designed to be profitable over a two- or three-year period, in order to demonstrate successful results to current or future employers. And yet, when we look at the data, it’s clear that the most profitable investments need several decades of time (around 30 years) to mature. What’s the reason for this? Well, although the market tends to fluctuate a lot, it mostly moves in short-term patterns. So although we often think negatively and tend to anticipate financial downturns, the market typically has an upward trajectory over the longer term. For instance, when we look at one-year periods, we can see that stocks lose real value 31 percent of the time, on average. However, indexes of stocks never lose money over a 20-year period. On the other hand, bonds have been shown to lose their value half of the time over the same 20-year period. The key message: In order to secure their financial future, Millennials should start investing in the stock market as early as possible. There are just a few simple guidelines that lead to investment success in the long-term: Diversify your portfolio to include stocks all over the world, stick to your strategy, and make investment decisions that go against the flow.  Actionable advice: Make taxes a factor in your investing. You should pay attention to tax advantages when investing: if you keep your winning/most profitable stocks for at least one year, your gains will be taxed at a lower tax rate (long-term capitals tax rate).

And even if they do find something, the paychecks of a typical corporate job will do nothing to help with their mountains of debt. These blinks encourage you to forget working for the Man. Forget about outdated, traditional business practices and the glut of business books repackaging the same old coaching advice. These blinks offer practical tips and advice that were hard-won through both success and failure in the real world. So roll up your shirtsleeves and get to work! In these blinks, you’ll learn: how good the odds of success are – or aren’t – for start-ups; how to write a better business plan in a paragraph; and why Facebook isn’t a marketing panacea. So you’ve got an idea for a successful business, one that you really believe in. Congratulations! But no matter how good your idea is, the numbers aren’t great; as the U.S. Small Business Association notes, a third of small businesses fail by their second year, and less than half last four years. Clearly, you can’t count on success, no matter how good your idea is. In fact, when it comes to starting a business, there’s only one thing you can be certain of – that it won’t be easy. So it’s best to accept that fact and check your expectations before you begin. First of all, you should accept that you’re guaranteed to fail along the way. But despite what most people think, this isn’t always bad. Analyzing failures teaches you valuable lessons that help you avoid failure in the future. Also, expect that things will never go according to plan. Successful entrepreneurs know that things change every day, so it’s impossible to predict the future. That’s why they don’t hang their hopes on everything going right according to some “perfect plan.” Instead, they plan for rock bottom. That means looking at any scenario and imagining its worst possible outcome in order to be prepared for it. To do that, there are four steps that you should take before making any business decision. Step one is looking at pros and cons in order to assess the risks. Is the best possible outcome so good that it outweighs the risks of the worst? Or are the two more evenly balanced, making the action riskier? Next, figure out what the consequences will be if things don’t work out. For example, if your business’s financial health could potentially be wiped out in your rock-bottom outcome, you need to realize that ahead of time. The third step is figuring out whether the thing that you’re considering doing would seem like a good idea at any point in time. If not – if you can imagine yourself regretfully looking back at it as having seemed like a good idea “at the time” – you should definitely think twice before proceeding. Finally, examine your alternatives. If your number one plan doesn’t work out, what’s next? Could, in fact, plan number two be a better option in the first place? It may not be as fun as imagining a scenario where everything works out perfectly, but being prepared for every eventuality makes you a more resilient entrepreneur in the long run. Let’s face it: when you start a business from scratch, there’s a ton of uncertainty, and you don’t have a lot of knowledge or resources at your disposal. But whining about it is a waste of time. Instead, you need to make the most of what you do know. Start by showing who you really are. By being authentic in your interactions with customers, you become more relatable, and it makes customers like and respect you. For example, if you’re a sci-fi loving tech person, wear your Star Trek pin when you meet with a client whose computer is on the fritz. The same idea goes for resources, too. So you can’t afford a fleet of delivery trucks for your product. But what do you have? Can you borrow your mom’s car for deliveries for the time being instead? Now you know what your assets are. But before you’re ready to start up, you need to ensure that you can actually deliver. Chances are, if you’re passionate enough to start a business, the idea is already based on a hobby that you really love. And while loving what you do is important, it’s not enough. There are four key points that you’ll need to look at before you can turn that hobby into a business you can actually deliver on. First, is your hobby really enough to support a business? It’s great that you love working with your Legos, but it’s tough to see the revenue in that. Second, are you really enough of an expert at your hobby that people should pay you to do it? If you want people to pay to see your driftwood sculptures, they’d better be more than just “okay.” Third, don’t assume that others will share your passion. Are there really enough people interested in visiting an expertly handcrafted driftwood sculpture garden? Or is that a little niche? Fourth, make sure it’s realistic that you can make it happen on your own. You’re not a world-renowned sculptor yet, so you’re not going to be able to hire a team of underlings to do the work for you. If answering these questions makes you confident that you can deliver, then it’s time to get the ball rolling. It’ll be much easier now that you know what you have to work with. When you start a new business, everyone typically insists that a crucial first step is a cumbersome, painstakingly detailed business plan. But instead of wasting time on one, you should be focused on building the business itself. For this, you need a practical tool for the real world: a One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan. A One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan lets you test your ideas by doing, and it creates an action strategy that grows and changes along the way together with your business. To create your plan, first ask yourself fundamental questions about your business: What is your product or service you’re offering? Who are your primary clients? How do you plan to generate immediate revenue? Answer these questions by writing down a maximum of one or two sentences for each. Each answer is a hypothesis about your business, and the paragraph that results will be a rough draft of your One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan. Next, turn your plan into lists filled with action steps, called Guess and Checklists. From each sentence in your plan, generate five points you can put into action right now. Use them to make a chronological checklist, including deadlines and expenses for each item. One hypothesis in the author’s plan described his start-up’s clientele as boutique PR firms, for example. So his first point was to make a list of all the boutique PR firms that existed in his area. The next was to look up contact info for each. Each time you complete a step on a checklist, evaluate it. What worked? What did you learn? Which steps can now be modified for the future? Now go back to your hypotheses. Were they true, false or incomplete? Continue to evolve your plan by eliminating the hypotheses and action steps that didn’t work and improving on those that did. The process of revising the hypothesis about his clientele took the author two months. In that time, he refined his clientele from boutique PR firms to independent PR specialists and brand managers, as well as senior account executives at boutique PR firms and marketing agencies. After two months, he had a proven, tested marketing formula that he still uses today! That doesn’t mean that he quit coming up with new hypotheses, of course. A One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan is an organic, living plan that’s integral to your business’ evolution, not some stuffy formal document. As long as your business is growing and evolving, your Plan should too. Choosing a potential business partner is a tricky business. Some partnerships click, and the business thrives as a result. Others... well, others can be like a bad marriage, or worse. So just like in a marriage, it’s important to be sure before you commit. There are five important questions you should ask yourself before diving into a partnership. First, are you sure you need a partner? Will she bring something to the table that you can’t? If so, could you bring that thing in without involving another shareholder? Maybe just hiring someone would do the trick. Next, ask whether a standard partnership is the best model. A partner with a dynamite idea for a new product but zero business acumen might end up just hindering you. In that case, something like a licensing deal or a joint venture might be a better idea, with all of the benefits and none of the loss of equity. If a partnership really is the best arrangement, what about your prospective partner? If you had to, could you defend your choice without a shadow of a doubt? What about your reasons for choosing her? Does she bring assets and skills to the table that complement yours? Do your goals really align? If your answers reveal any reservations, keep looking. Settling for someone who isn’t right will just undermine your business in the long run. Fourth, could the partnership work in theory and in practice? To make sure, consider a trial period in which you can both test out working together. Establish some short-term goals, and see what working together to achieve them reveals. Chances are that within just days or weeks, it will be clear how well you align. Finally, make sure your agreement is clear to both people and put everything down in writing. Things can seem rosy in the early stages of working together, and having things on paper might feel unnecessary. But clearly defining things like equity ownership, corporate responsibilities and rules for company stock purchases will pay off if things go badly and you end up in court. As tempting as it might be to dive in headfirst, you and your business will be glad that you took that time to ask these questions. It pays to look before you leap! An entrepreneur has freedoms that an employee doesn’t have. On the other hand, an entrepreneur doesn’t get to go home and call it a day at 5:00 p.m. An entrepreneur’s lifestyle is not a “normal” one because, ultimately, you are your business. It’s a symbiotic relationship where the time you put in is what allows both you and your business to thrive, especially in the beginning. That’s a time when you’ll be at maximum hustle, wearing all the hats there are to wear. Some of these hats will fit, while others might be uncomfortable. Maybe you’re great at budgeting, but cold-calling customers gives you nightmares. Never fear. You’ll figure it out – because you have to! At this stage of the game, anything that you aren’t willing to do simply won’t get done. What’s more, you’ll need to intimately understand each aspect of your business before you’re able to hire someone else to do it. To make all of this possible, you'll need to design a power routine, which allows you to tailor your life around your entrepreneurial strategy in a way that’s focused and productive. Here’s how. For starters, you’ll need to work every day for an entire month. Putting in seven days a week for a month might not be easy, but it will give you the information you need. Note your big successes during this time, and write down the days and times when they occurred. Next, categorize each of these successes as one of three things: strategic planning, internal operations or revenue generation. Working on your One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan is a strategic planning activity, for example, whereas contacting vendors is internal operations. Discussing a project with clients is, of course, revenue generation. Now look at the successes and failures in your schedule. When did you do best in certain categories? When did your slow periods happen? Try to figure out why your productivity ebbed and flowed when it did; then tweak your schedule to capitalize on this. For example, if you’ve been successfully generating revenue from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Wednesdays, and Sunday afternoons are best for strategic planning, take advantage of this by locking it into your schedule. Keep adjusting your power routine until you’re confident that it’s perfect. Then commit to your routine and stick to that commitment. That means that if Saturday afternoons are your sweet spot for successful internal operations work, then you’ll have to skip plans with friends that day. Your schedule is meant to revolve around maximum results for your business, not socializing. You’ve got to make a professional impression – everyone knows this. That’s why businesses spend huge amounts of cash on design, messaging and consultants. A start-up isn’t going to be flush with cash right at the beginning, though. That’s why it helps to know a few savvy tricks that can make you look like a winner without breaking the bank. It all starts with your website – the most important component of your brand. A website that makes you look like a big fish should be, above all, simple. Quick to load and easy to navigate will beat complicated or beautiful every time, and you don’t need an expert programmer or designer to make that happen. Try one of the many inexpensive, subscription-based service providers online, like Weebly. They offer online tools for your business, along with useful templates, and they can get your site up and running fast. Best of all? The upfront costs are low, and you can easily update your content yourself. But what about other costly investments, like expert advice? While business coaches and self-appointed experts are everywhere these days, a lot of them just offer repackaged common sense sprinkled with advice that anyone can get off of the internet. What’s more, they charge hundreds of dollars for it! So save your money and a lot of frustration. Instead, think about lunch. First, figure out what kind of information you’re looking for. Then brainstorm a long list of people who might be able to help, and figure out how you might be connected to them. Social networking sites are a great tool for this, and you can turn to your existing network of friends and contacts to ask for introductions. Once you’ve figured out your contacts, pick about 10 people from your long list and reach out to invite them to lunch. Make this a personal invitation, with information about yourself, your connection to each person, and what you think he or she might know that could help you. Then make that lunch count! Plan what you’d like to discuss and stick to it. Really listen to what your lunchtime consultant has to say. Also, no matter how useful the information is or isn’t, be gracious and follow up with a thank-you email. If you’re savvy enough to create a website and reach out to people like a pro, you should be able to act like a pro too. So your business is up and running – now how do you reach out to customers? Social media is a great marketing tool, but contrary to popular belief, just putting your name out there isn’t going to bring in customers. For that, you need effective marketing to get a well-crafted message out there in a targeted way. The first step is to create a brand language. This consists of words and key phrases that describe what you do. Just three or four should be enough as you’re getting started. These should be bold enough to grab and keep customers’ attention. With time and focus, they’ll be synonymous with your business in consumers’ minds. Think about the term “online search”; anyone who hears it will probably think of Google right away. The next step is an active brand message – a single, easy-to-read sentence of about eight words. An active brand message combines promotion with establishing expectations about what your company actually does. For example; a math tutoring service’s brand message might be something like “multiply your math successes by subtracting the confusion.” Now you’ll want to make sure that the distribution channels for your marketing fit the goals in your active brand message. The key idea here is to target carefully; just spamming every available channel is lazy and ineffective. So is sticking to a single channel. Despite what some people might think, Facebook isn’t a good fit for every marketing message. Let’s say that you want to market a dog-walking service, for example. You could rely on posting to social media. But what about a small flier that you give away at dog parks instead – or better still, offering a free dog treat in exchange for dog owners’ contact information? That’s much more direct than a Facebook post, and it does more, too. Beyond just attracting attention, it encourages immediate action in the form of giving contact info. Action generates revenue, and at the end of the day, that should be the goal of all marketing activity, since it’s revenue, not “buzz,” that will grow a start-up. Remember, keep your marketing goals clear and targeted – in fact, keep all your goals this way. Striking out on your own will be a wild ride, and you’ll need all the clarity you can get! The key message in these blinks: Being an entrepreneur isn’t easy, and it isn’t for the faint of heart. But it does offer independence and the satisfaction that comes from handling every challenge that comes your way. If you’re willing to put in the hours, and if you have savvy and a whole lot of hustle, you’ll ditch your “real” job in no time and never look back.  Actionable advice: Prioritize your health.  Starting up requires a huge commitment, but that doesn’t mean working 24/7. If you want to be able to keep working in the long term, you also need to take care of yourself. That means scheduling some downtime to decompress and also making a habit of exercise. This doesn’t have to be overly ambitious; it can just be a matter of doing simple exercises, such as push-ups or stretches, which you can do in the privacy of your bedroom. Your business will benefit from you feeling your best. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

For decades, customers loved what you offered and recognized your brand from a mile away. Then all of a sudden competitors have outflanked you – a hungry new rival could even make everything you offer redundant. What are you going to do?  Well, you can either wait on the sidelines and hope to find a new market, or you can act radically. In all likelihood, you’ll need to do the latter – stop treading water and start swimming. In the following blinks, we’ll look at how established companies can install a permanent growth mind-set at the heart of their operations by acting more like start-ups. Even creaky fifty-year-old organizations can learn to move with the freshness and agility of first-time entrepreneurs. In these blinks, you’ll learn when American capitalism began to rot from the inside; why Microsoft’s new CEO had to reinvent the organization; and how Bubble Wrap was invented. Let’s go back in time to the dawn of American capitalism. In the late nineteenth century – the days of the Rockefellers and Carnegies, of venerable mustaches and top hats – big business behaved itself. These were civic-minded, patriotic enterprises, which served customers and country. Businesses looked to provide a reliable product – say, good whiskey or a trusty tricycle – and preserve a connection with the consumers who bought their goods. Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, something changed. By the 1960s, American mega-corporations were focusing on accumulating profit rather than serving consumers’ needs. By this time, they were now more concerned with paying corporate executives massive sums than with fixing customer problems. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith diagnosed this situation in his book The New Industrial State, which claimed that big corporations raked in enormous profits at the expense of the betterment of society. In response to this book, two economists, Michael C.  Jensen and William H. Meckling, published an influential paper titled “Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behaviour, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure.” They also railed against the state of American capitalism. But rather than encouraging corporations to serve customers better, they told them to look after their shareholders. Shareholders, who had been the lowest priority, were growing disgruntled when business suffered a dip in the late 1960s. Worried that their discontent could blow up the economy, many businesses took the advice of Jensen and Meckling and decided that they would prioritize shareholders above all else. The shift to gratifying shareholders meant that business became completely detached from public or consumer needs. Many businesses became obsessed with shareholder appeasement, and abandoned any activity that didn’t boost stock prices. This meant that, naturally, rather than investing capital into developing that new car, computer or fashion line, businesses focused on cutting expenditures. The more efficient they became, the better the ratios were for shareholders. There’s a great metaphor to illustrate what happened next. Picture a small mother-bird with a huge cuckoo chick in her nest. She forgets her own chicks, choosing to feed only the cuckoo, which grows ever more enormous. Similarly, businesses that once looked to serve their customers and grow their enterprises became consumed with tending to their shareholders. Consequently, they stopped innovating and stopped growing. If a great white shark stops swimming, oxygen can’t pass through its gills, so it sinks and dies. When they stop innovating, big businesses tend to do the same. Stasis leads to a gradual – or sometimes, steep – decline. Modern start-ups understand this, so many foster a very different mind-set to long-established companies. Unlike established businesses obsessed with shareholder returns, start-ups look to provide new solutions to customer problems. They seek to identify a “pain point” or “friction point” for consumers. Think of the social media giant, Facebook. Back when it was cooked up in Mark Zuckerberg’s dormitory room, he foresaw a pain point. He sensed that many people – far beyond the Ivy League colleges where Facebook was initially tested – would love to keep in contact with family members and friends, to share photographs and stories across the world. We all know what happened next – Facebook grew to become one of the world’s most successful enterprises. Or consider the food-delivery service, Deliveroo. In this case, the pain point was the lack of delivery options for restaurant cuisine. In fact, Deliveroo’s founder, Will Shu, discovered this pain point himself while working late nights in Morgan Stanley’s London office. Rather than incremental tinkering, start-up culture encourages innovation that leads to long-term growth. Rather than simply tweaking existing products and improving proven processes, the start-up mind-set means embracing risk and facing the future. Although it sounds counterintuitive, in today’s fast-paced commercial climate, this is also the only way that a company can achieve sustainable growth. By continuing to seek solutions for endless customer problems, companies with a start-up mind-set can grow. If we look at the top five companies according to market capitalization in 2018 – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook – we see a common thread. All of those companies have adopted this start-up mind-set, and all continue to innovate and seek new customer solutions. What we’ve outlined here is the New to Big philosophy – the key to taking an idea with potential and letting it grow exponentially. In the next blink, we’ll learn how one established company adopted some of these strategies to save itself. Microsoft is a corporate powerhouse. As we learned in the last blink, in 2018, it was one of the top five companies according to market capitalization. It was on this list back in 2001, too, alongside General Electric, ExxonMobil, Citigroup and Walmart. Between 2001 and 2018, however, Microsoft dropped out of the top five. What happened? Microsoft lost its spark when Bill Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000. When the next CEO Steve Ballmer took over, rather than continuing the world-changing work of the founder, he applied a staid, incrementalist logic. While other tech firms were racing ahead and breaking new ground (notably, Google and Apple), Microsoft offered a series of drab products that imitated others, rather than stamping their individuality on the world. Then, in 2014, a new CEO was appointed who turned things around. This was Satya Nadella, who approached his job at Microsoft – a 44-year-old company with a rich legacy – as if he was taking the reins at a new start-up. He approached his role with a completely new mind-set, which he articulated in an interview in 2015. “We no longer talk about lagging indicators of success – revenue, profit. What are the leading indicators of success? Customer love.” In his book, Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone, Nadella sets out his philosophy, which entails promoting bold new ideas, making space for employees to experiment and fail and keeping an eye on the long view, rather than worrying about quarterly returns. Nadella has successfully shaped Microsoft into a kind of hybrid, where all the resources, capital and brand-recognition of a corporate behemoth meet entrepreneurial risk-taking. Now, with a double-digit profit margin growth every quarter, it’s clear that his tactics are paying off. You could say that Nadella has refounded Microsoft. So, what can we learn from Microsoft’s story? Not just that we can reinvent established companies, but that it’s positively necessary for their survival. In the same way that we should meet new challenges throughout our lives to remain agile, big companies must keep moving to keep their vitality.   What’s the difference between the dinosaurs of the corporate world and their hungry new challengers? A different mind-set, which runs from top to bottom. This is the difference between the Total Addressable Market model and the Total Addressable Problem model. Let’s begin with the Total Addressable Market, or TAM, model. This framework has been used for decades – it’s the main religion of the corporate world. Established companies are hardwired to use it. It addresses the problem of how big a market is, and how big a share of that market the business can reasonably expect to command. It works with what is knowable and battles competitors for a market share, modifying their existing products or services only. Rather than prioritizing new customer pain points, they focus mostly on their own – like stock prices and short-term financial success. And as we’ve seen, businesses that follow this approach in today’s world can begin to stagnate. In the worst circumstances, they can become obsolete. Of course, the TAM model isn’t completely misguided. If you’re in the lipstick business and you want to manufacture a new lip-gloss, you could use the TAM model to estimate how big a market you could reasonably expect to conquer. But, beyond that, it loses its authority. It’s like exploring the flora of a new planet with a guidebook from earth. By contrast, the Total Addressable Problem model is the way to achieve exponential growth. Because the TAP model is based on discovering brand-new customer problems or needs, it can uncover new markets. It is the untouched markets that will lead to growth, rather than those with lots of competition already.  Take the mobile phone. When it first came on the market, it was a bulky device aimed almost exclusively at high-powered executives. The Total Addressable Problem area seemed small. But as they became lighter, smaller and more affordable, demand blew up. Electronics designers had sensed that mobiles were addressing a far larger problem – mobile communication for everyone. This was the untouched market that would yield enormous returns for the first mobile phone manufacturers. Now that we’ve moved to the TAP model, we need to think differently about all aspects of doing business. That starts with anticipating what customers want. Rather than simply tweaking an existing product or idea to better suit the customer, those with a growth mind-set need to begin from where the customers are. In other words, you need to look at what customers actually do, rather than what they say they’ll do. Take the voice of the customer approach, where companies encourage customers to give feedback. Often what happens is that customers are socialized to give the answers they think they should provide. Say a leading tech firm is conducting research for a new app that locates nearby fine-dining opportunities. In their market research, they ask people what they think of the app and how much they’d spend on it. A good number of potential customers reportedly like the app and would spend $15 a month to use it.  A company approaching this in the old way, with a TAM mind-set, would report that the app received a “positive response” and that customers “would spend $15.” A company with a growth mind-set would finish their market research with another question – “Will you commit to signing up for it now?” If the answer to that is equivocal or negative, they’d report that the app probably doesn’t present such a great opportunity. You need to be ready to dump your idea and begin anew if customer research takes you elsewhere. Let’s say you’re a company that makes chewable candy and you’re looking to make a new product, but are aware that processed sugar is viewed negatively. In this case, you’d try to understand your customers and how they really feel. You find that both your die-hard fans and occasional purchasers associate eating your snack with “treating themselves.” So rather than the new sugar-free chewable candy idea that you started with, you’re now in the business of “treats.” Then, rather than manufacturing chewable candy, you can think of other ways that people like to “treat themselves,” like carob snacks, makeup or succulent houseplants. What’s the lesson here? Rather than acting like the focus-group researchers of yesteryear, you need to be a dynamic, flexible observer. Every email sent by the venture capitalist Esther Dyson comes with a footer that reads, “Always make new mistakes!” What does she mean by this? Let’s have a look. The results of productive failure are all around us. Take the lubricant, WD-40. Guess why there’s the number “40” after “WD” (which stands for Water Displacement). That’s right – it took 40 attempts before the company perfected the formula. Or consider Bubble Wrap. It was initially conceived as a futuristic, trendy textured wallpaper. It bombed, and only became a success when the company IBM used it to wrap computer parts for transport. Without this accident, it was destined for the landfill. But, much to its detriment, executive culture is afraid of admitting mistakes. Established companies don’t like failure – it’s not the way they’re wired. The executives who run them are highly competitive people who like winning. The valuable learning process of failure is alien to them. This influences everyone at the company who’d rather tiptoe around the leadership than voice their misgivings about the company’s direction. So, rather than making small mistakes from which the company could learn crucial lessons, a doomed project could be kept alive for too long, leading to a huge waste of money and company time. It’s important, then, to encourage productive failure. If you’re a big company and you wish to create an environment in which employees can experiment and fail interestingly, then you need to create an atmosphere in which it is acceptable to do so. This means allowing for lots of small, fast and cheap failures from which innovators can learn. It also means encouraging leaders to kill off doomed projects and for subordinates and confront their superiors with the truth. Failure is intrinsic to innovation. In the next blink, we’ll look at how companies can create a structure that incorporates this innovation. If you’re a business leader at a TAM-oriented company who wants to switch to a TAP mind-set, you’ll need a great team to make it happen. You’ll likely have the employees you need in your organization already. However, the people who’ve succeeded at your company may not be ready for the challenge of innovative entrepreneurialism. These high-performers will probably think according to the way big companies usually operate – which, as we’ve already seen, is incrementalist and risk-averse. Instead, seek out the iconoclasts, free-thinkers and contrarians. These individuals may have been passed over for promotion in the past because they’re considered “interesting” misfits, rather than smooth operators. There are important traits you can look for to narrow down potential recruits. First of all, they should be adaptable. They need to figure out what to do when tried-and-tested processes and ideas don’t work. For instance, if a project leads them into radically different terrain from where they began, they can change direction without breaking stride. Remember the chewable candy example we looked at earlier? The company junked candy altogether and decided it would move into marketing a “treat” – that is what adaptability means.   High on the list of necessary characteristics is curiosity. In other words, they should be able to detect patterns between what look like disparate or unrelated sources and trends and build innovative business ideas from them. They should also be humble. One important aspect of innovative entrepreneurialism is the ability to work collaboratively. This isn’t about the egotistical individual – it’s about what individuals can achieve together as a team. Finally, they should be passionate about experimentation. This is the superpower – the potential candidate must be a relentless experimenter. They should be something of a mad scientist, absolutely determined to crack the code. In our final blink, we’ll look at how to finance these wild ideas in a way that doesn’t spell disaster for a company. If you don’t buy a ticket, you can’t win the lottery. When investing in new business ideas, it’s a bit more complicated than this. However, the notion of risk is the same, and you can increase your chances of success by following a few of the following ideas.  Firstly, companies need to make it easier to secure permission to invest in new ideas. Though risk-taking isn’t limited to disruptive new start-ups, it can be tricky to get permission to try new ideas at long-standing companies used to refining their existing business model. This is often because budgets are allocated annually, and the process of securing funding can be incredibly bureaucratic and cumbersome. In fact, many new ideas die before they even pass under the nose of senior leadership.  One way to make it easier for funding to flow into new ideas is to install a Growth Board. A Growth Board is a small team at the top of the company. This team quickly judges the merits of new ideas, allocates funding and monitors the development of each scheme. But rather than allocating a large amount of funding all at once – as is often the case in established companies with an inflexible budgeting process – they should invest small amounts at the beginning of each project.  Then, as the project unfolds, more funding can be allocated if it succeeds. At each step, funding can either be awarded or withdrawn – this process instills the kind of combativeness and urgency that all start-ups face. And, importantly, this step-by-step process means that the whole venture can be “de-risked.” If the idea is flagging, the Growth Board can simply withdraw funding at an early stage.   And because most new business ideas fail, it’s best to invest in many at once. The great thing about the Growth Board model is that established companies can keep many different pots on the boil at once. Just like investments in the stock market, the majority of new business ideas aren’t successful. They can be interesting and useful failures, but not viable. But companies significantly increase their chances of hitting on one of those golden ideas – like Uber or Airbnb – if they hedge their bets. With this setup, a company can take risks and innovate. This is called the always-on mind-set – and the results can be incredible The key message in these blinks: Big companies seeking growth must act with the dynamism and flexibility of new start-ups. Otherwise, they face stagnation and obsolescence. The key to growth is to provide new solutions to customer pain points, which can be ascertained by an attentive approach to market research. To introduce this growth model into a big organization, a special team of maverick innovators must be employed.  Actionable advice:  Read outside of your comfort zone. If you’re an executive or corporate type, don’t just read books by other executives and business minds. Read art theory, philosophy and good novels. You might just find that the imaginative truths in works far removed from your own sphere inspire you to develop new commercial ideas.   Got feedback?

What to read next: The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen You’re now familiar with the challenges that big corporations face if they don’t learn to innovate quickly. Just because they have a solid legacy and good management practices, they might still be at risk of falling into serious stagnation. Through historical examples, Clayton M. Christensen explains why it’s the companies that seem to be doing everything right – good management culture, an established brand – that are suddenly blindsided by disruptive technologies. But not only can they survive in the face of these innovations, they can actually harness them to their own advantage.

We all want the same things – financial security, personal fulfillment, long-term happiness – and, more often than not, we know what we have to do to get these things. However, our lack of discipline and endless list of excuses can get in the way. So how can you overcome this? That’s the question these blinks set out to answer. Whether you work for a company or run your own business, we’ve selected the most powerful techniques that will help you stop living a life that’s full of excuses. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the Seven-Step Method is; how to do a Disaster Report to conquer your fears; and what delayed gratification can do for your financial freedom. Have you ever wondered how certain individuals, though allotted no more time than most people, manage to accumulate vast wealth and achieve great success? Well, it’s mostly a matter of self-discipline applied to the three fundamental areas of life: personal success, career and overall happiness. You can do this, too. And it’s best to start by becoming disciplined about your personal success. A great way to do that is to learn from the experts in your field. Attend their conferences, read their books and listen to their podcasts. Just consider the author’s San Diego-based dentist. He attended every dental conference he could, and, at a conference in Hong Kong, he learned a technique that transformed his career. At the conference, a Japanese dentist shared a new procedure that permanently improved the appearance of teeth. The author’s dentist immediately began implementing this new technique, and within a few years, clients from all across the United States were booking treatments at his clinic. By the age of 55, he was known as a “dentist’s dentist” and had earned enough money to retire. Is the thought of early retirement appealing to you? Well, then it’s time to accept responsibility in your life. The author learned this the hard way. When he was 21, he worked in construction, earning just enough money to get by. He had no car, no savings and lived in a tiny apartment. Then he had an epiphany: he had to take responsibility and change his life. He had to stop blaming his problems on his childhood and lack of education. The very next day, he began working harder. He also started buying self-help books and dedicating his life to self-improvement. His conscious decision to no longer make excuses or blame others played an important role in his future success. It’s hard sticking to New Year’s resolutions. In January, you’re dedicated to whatever you’ve resolved to do – be it taking a daily jog or quitting smoking. Come February, you find yourself skipping scheduled runs and sneaking forbidden smokes. So why can’t we stick to the program? USA Today reported that, in one study, a mere 4 percent of participants followed through with their resolutions. However, of those who did manage to stick to their resolutions, 44 percent wrote the resolution down. Committing your goals to paper makes it much likelier that you’ll achieve them; the simple act of writing out what you want minimizes distractions and focusses your energy in the right areas. To cash in on the power of the pen (and paper!), use the Seven-Step Method to achieve your goals: Step 1: Decide what you want and be specific. If you want to accumulate more wealth, decide on exactly how much money you want. Or if you want to lose weight, determine exactly how many pounds you wish to shed. Step 2: Write down your specific goal. Step 3: Set a date by which you think you could accomplish it. Be realistic. If it’s a large goal, break it down to sub-deadlines. Step 4: Write down a list of everything you could possibly do to achieve your goal. This includes listing the obstacles that you’ll face and the additional knowledge and skills you’ll need to achieve it. Step 5: Prioritize the most beneficial tasks and add them to your calendar. Your most important tasks should be completed first. Step 6: Start on your tasks right away. Step 7: Do something every day that helps you achieve your goal. In addition to employing the Seven-Step Method, ask for advice on how to achieve your goals more quickly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of seeking advice, consider the story of Bob Barton, one of the author's seminar attendees. Bob wanted to get ahead in his career. He paid close attention to how the senior salespeople at his company talked and dressed, and made a conscious effort to imitate them. This helped, but it wasn't until he asked one of the top salespeople to recommend a book that he really started to see results. They were flattered that he asked them and continued to recommend more books and audio programs. By disciplining himself to read and listen to them, Bob became the best salesperson in the office. Is your fear of failure – like not earning enough money or losing what cash you do have – holding you back from reaching your potential? If so, don’t fret: such fears aren’t hardwired into our brains. They’re learned during life, which means that, with a little willpower, they can be unlearned. An effective aid to overcoming your fears is The Disaster Report, which is comprised of four steps. Step 1: Describe your fear clearly. Step 2: Determine the worst-case scenario. Are you holding back from investing because you’re afraid that you’ll lose all your money in the process? When you confront your fears, they gradually become manageable instead of dominating your thoughts and feelings. Step 3: Find solutions for the worst-case scenario. For example, say you did lose money in the process. Big deal! You can always find a job and earn it back. Fear often stems from an unwillingness to consider the worst possible outcome, so it really does help to confront it. Step 4: Do everything in your power to ensure the worst-case scenario doesn’t play out. Not only will you be so busy making sure that the worst thing doesn’t happen; you also won’t have any time to worry. Another way to overcome your fears is to train yourself to deal with them straight away. For instance, one of the author’s seminar participants was unhappy at work because her boss kept criticizing and belittling her, even though she was a top employee. It’s no wonder that she slowly became afraid of interacting with her boss. After receiving advice from the author, however, she knew how to deal with the situation. The next time her boss berated her, she repeated what the author had advised her to say: Please don’t talk to me like that. I’d appreciate being spoken to differently. When my feelings are hurt, I can’t focus on my work or do as good of a job.  How did her boss react? Well, he apologized and never unfairly criticized her again. From that point on, she no longer resented her boss or her job. Did you know that 80 percent of global wealth is owned by 20 percent of the global population? Fortunately, in Western countries such as the United States, there is high income mobility. That means it’s possible to move from the lower-income brackets to the higher ones through hard work. So, if you work for a company, you should do your best at whatever work your boss delegates to you. This is what the author sought to do when he worked at a property-development company. He would ask his boss for more responsibility and discipline himself to complete the task as quickly and as well as he could. This earned him a reputation as the “go-to guy.” His boss once asked him to go to Reno to start developing the property of a company they’d bought. But instead of flying out within a couple of weeks, as suggested, the author booked a flight for the next day. He immediately met with the lawyer and engineer, eventually discovering that the property had no access to water and could not be developed. He terminated the contract, which would otherwise have ended up costing his company $2 million! His boss was impressed and, within a year, the author was promoted, managing 42 employees in the company. Now, if you have your own business, you’ll also need to work hard if you want to achieve your goals. Bear in mind that the average business owner works 59 hours every week. This requires willpower and constant improvement, so, to help you and your business succeed, try using the CANEI formula, which stands for Continuous And Never-Ending Improvement. This is how it works: When you start a new business, one of the first things you do is write up a business plan detailing your target market, pricing, marketing strategies and so on. But this business plan isn’t set in stone. Regardless of how successfully your business is performing today, it’s crucial that you continuously improve it. Indeed, you should revise and update it on a yearly basis to keep up with your competition and customers’ needs. You need to keep in mind that running a successful, constantly improving business requires months, or even years, of working long hours. Imagine a life of complete financial freedom. You live off the interest from your savings – spending all your time traveling and engaging in your favorite activities. Sounds dreamy! The good thing is this goal is achievable if you’re willing to apply certain tools. The first step toward financial freedom is practicing delayed gratification, and the One Percent Formula is here to help you do just that. Simply force yourself to start saving 1 percent of your income and discipline yourself to live off the remaining 99 percent. So, say you earn $3,000 per month; 1 percent is just $30. And if you’re like most people who live paycheck to paycheck or have accumulated a large amount of debt, the One Percent Formula is still a realistic goal. As soon as you learn to start living off the remaining 99 percent, you can increase your savings ratio to 2 percent, and so on. Each month, you’ll train yourself to consciously spend less and save more. And as you move toward financial independence, you can even pay off any debt you have and begin to attract more wealth. Then you must overcome procrastination by applying the A B C D E Method of prioritizing. To start doing this, you need to write out a list of all the tasks you have to complete at the beginning of each day. Then prioritize them by following the A B C D E Method. The only rule is that you shouldn’t complete a lower-value task before completing all the higher value tasks first. It takes a great deal of discipline to choose your most important tasks and start on them immediately, but the following steps will assist in instantly doubling your productivity and earnings. Under A, list your “Must do” tasks – those that hold major consequences if uncompleted. Under B, write your “Should do” tasks, which have mild consequences if uncompleted. C tasks are “Nice to do” activities, which have no consequences if uncompleted. D tasks should be delegated to others so you can focus on the more important jobs. And, lastly, E tasks aren’t essential to your goals and should be eliminated. These days, people are living longer than ever before, and there’s no reason you shouldn’t live a long and meaningful life, too. The big question is how to do this. One of the key ingredients is having a healthy lifestyle, and that means eating well and exercising. You can take control of your weight by following the author’s Thinking Big weight-loss program, which is centered around avoiding the “three whites”: sugar, salt and flour. First, you should eliminate all sugars from your diet. That means no sugary desserts, no soft drinks and no more sugar in your morning coffee. This should help you shave off one pound per day and boost your energy levels. Next, for permanent weight loss, you should stop adding salt to your meals. And, lastly, eliminate white-flour products such as breads, pastries and pasta from your diet. It really does work. Just six months after starting the Thinking Big program, a 32-year-old man from Florida who had been struggling to lose weight managed to drop 22 pounds. Not only did he look different, he also felt happier and more confident and attracted more dates than ever before. On top of eating healthily, you should realize that it’s never too late to start exercising. The perfect example of this is a 68-year-old woman who lived in a senior-citizens home. She’d never really been into exercise, but then she watched an interview featuring marathon runners her age. Right then and there, she decided that she also wanted to complete a marathon. The very next day, she bought running shoes, invested in running books and started walking around her local neighborhood. At the end of the first year, she was able to complete a mini-marathon, and by the time she reached 75, she’d finished two 50-mile cross-country marathons. When you become a parent, your children become your priority. But can you guess one of the biggest regrets expressed by parents? That they didn’t spend enough time with their children when they were young. However, you have the power to cut back and get rid of other commitments that get in the way of you becoming the best parent possible. Start by making a decision today to spend more time with your family. Just consider one of the author’s friends, a man who used to play golf five days per week and who took frequent golfing holidays in the winter. Even after getting married and having four kids, he continued to play golf several times a week. As you can imagine, his wife wasn’t happy with his lack of familial commitment, and she confronted him about it. Consequently, he made a conscious decision to be responsible and reduce his golfing to once a week. This decision not only made him a better father and husband; it made him happier, too. On the path to happiness, you also need to learn to forgive others. This is perhaps most common when people harbor resentment toward their parents for something they did many decades ago. Such people complain about their childhood experiences and use them as an excuse for their failures. The only way you can reach peace of mind is through the discipline of forgiveness. By developing the habit of forgiving those who have hurt you in the past, you free yourself from the emotional baggage that holds you back from happiness. The key message in this book: You should always strive to learn more in your chosen field. This includes reading books, listening to podcasts and attending seminars by experts. Don’t waste your time with shortcuts. Achieving your goals requires great self-discipline and hard work, as well as dealing with your fears as they arise. Do this, and you can achieve financial freedom and more overall happiness. Actionable advice: Invest 3 percent of your income in yourself. According to the American Society for Training and Development, 3 percent is the percentage that profitable companies invest in their employees’ self-development. If you make $50,000 every year, decide to put at least $1,500 toward improving your knowledge and skills. It’ll pay off in the long run. Got feedback?

But if these endless sets of numbers play such a crucial role in our lives, why don’t we give them more consideration? These blinks aim to remedy the lack of attention paid to statistics, providing rich examples of how we can learn from statisticians to better our world. You’ll learn about the five principles that are central to statistical thinking, and how they can be used to make sound decisions.  In these blinks, you’ll also learn how long lines at Disney World can be avoided; how statistics can fight the spread of E. coli;  what dying in a plane crash has to do with winning the lottery. Have you ever been at an amusement park, waiting in line for a ride in the hot sun thinking, “if they just had one or two more roller coasters, all the lines would be shorter”? While it may seem that adding attractions would lead to quicker queues, it’s actually not the case. Why? According to statisticians, and using the example of Disney World, it’s the varying pattern of when guests arrive at the amusement park, and not the average number of guests arriving, that makes the lines so mind-numbingly long. Since lines form when demand exceeds capacity, it seems logical that if Disney World accurately predicted demand, they could build capacity to accommodate it. Unfortunately, it’s not so simple.  Statisticians are positive that even if Disney could accurately predict the number of park visitors hopping on the Dumbo ride on a peak day, a line would still form because guests come at irregular intervals throughout the day, and because the ride’s capacity remains fixed. So, planning for capacity can deal with average rises in demand, but not with fluctuating demand.  Disney has come to deal with this issue using a feature called FastPass, which entitles guests to come back to a ride at a designated time and jump into an express lane. FastPass works because it reduces the variability of guests arriving at any given time. So, while it doesn’t change the ride goers’ actual waiting times, it does give them the freedom to enjoy other activities in the meantime, thereby boosting customer satisfaction.  But theme parks aren’t the only place this logic plays out: statisticians can point to the same trend in traffic jams. Just like at Disney World, highway congestion is the result of suddenly high volumes of cars, which exceed the road’s average capacity.  To deal with this issue, the Minnesota Department of Transportation uses a technique called “ramp metering”, in which traffic lights on ramps regulate the pace at which cars enter the highway, thereby stabilizing the number of cars on the road.  To understand the basics of how statistical reasoning can be applied to real-life situations, it’s helpful to consider two examples: the first offers a peek at epidemiologists who try to explain the causes of diseases; and the second shows how credit modelers seek correlations that indicate a person’s financial responsibility – essential information for banks and insurers.  In the first example, epidemiologists use statistics to identify causal relationships that can pinpoint the outbreak of a disease and its origin. For instance, in September of 2007, several patients in the United States tested positive for E. coli, a bacteria that can lead to severe discomfort, kidney failure and even death. These few cases were enough to uncover the disease’s source and protect the health of others.  How? Five of the affected patients from Oregon were questioned intensively about what they eat. The food that four of them had in common was bagged spinach. From there, existing statistics were consulted, which showed that only one in five Oregonians would eat spinach in any given week. The data allowed the epidemiologists to pin the outbreak on spinach, since the ratio of consumption evidenced in the patients was much higher than that of a typical Oregonian.  But statistics can be used for more than revealing contaminated vegetables. By identifying patterns, credit modelers can determine a person’s creditworthiness.  For example, in America today, many people take out mortgages quickly without undergoing invasive interviews. Creditors don’t need to ask people loads of questions before lending them money because a computer essentially already has, tracking a person’s innumerable past loan decisions and identifying patterns, or correlations.  A mortgage lender may have discovered a correlation among borrowers in a particular line of work, and an inability to repay loans. Using this information, they can then instantly determine the creditworthiness of an application. As the idea of correlation demonstrated, differences between groups of people are essential to statistical reasoning. Whether they show disparities between an older generation and a younger one, or people who hold a college degree and those who don’t, group differences are fundamental to statistics.  For one, statistics take group differences into consideration to design fair exams. Statisticians can make sure standardized tests like the SAT are fair by omitting questions that give preference to one social demographic over another. For example, a question could be unfair if its phrasing is clearer for white test-takers than for the African-American community. To determine which questions are fair, statisticians compare the performance of black and white students on any given question. However, a difference in performance doesn’t necessarily imply an unfair question – statisticians must also take any group differences into account.  In this example, group differences would be present if one group of students constituted a majority of low-performing students and the other constituted a majority of high performers. To take this difference into consideration, statisticians don’t compare all African-American students to all white students, instead comparing both high-performing and low-performing students of each demographic.  Group differences are also key to fair insurance, a system that works by collecting premiums from a majority of policyholders to subsidize the damages incurred by a few. This model seems fair, since anybody could be on the giving or receiving end of an accident. However, our insurance system is unfair when group differences between insured people aren’t considered.  For instance, if property insurance treated houses along a coastline the same way as inland houses, all homeowners would pay the same premium based on their average exposure to risk. However, statistics show that houses located inland are much less likely to be affected by natural disasters like hurricanes than their counterparts with an ocean view. Armed with this information, insurers can adjust the premiums according to the relative risk.  It may seem that, in modern times, it’s difficult to keep the truth from surfacing. After all, people have developed all manner of methods to uncover facts, like drug testing to expose steroid use among athletes, or polygraphs to unearth what people won’t admit. However, these modes of testing are not entirely error proof. In fact, if testing for drug use, two types of errors can cause problems: the false positive, when an athlete who did not take drugs is falsely accused of doing so, and the false negative, when an athlete who did cheat is exonerated.  As a result, the people administering drug tests face a trade-off: if they try to minimize false positives, an error that serves to diminish their authority, their actions will bear the unintended side effect of letting more cheaters walk free. Assume that ten percent of all athletes use performance-enhancing drugs. As testers are trying to avoid false positives, they use testing methods that only return positive results when the evidence definitively points to cheating.  As a result, statistics show that only about one percent of athletes test positive. However, since we know that about ten percent of all athletes use drugs to cheat, we also know that nine percent of them test negative despite using drugs. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that nine out of ten athletes who use drugs get away with it.  Lie detector tests are prone to the same unavoidable trade-off. Polygraphs work by monitoring the test subject’s medical statistics – like their breathing or blood pressure – while they are asked a series of questions. The collected data can point to false information by showing a correlation with changes in the person’s physiological state.  Naturally, the detectives administering the tests want to avoid false negatives, that is, criminals who go free. However, the problem is the same as with the athletes: avoiding false negatives means accruing false positives and accusing many innocent people. While most people wouldn’t associate the field of statistics with fighting crime or erasing irrational fears, statistical logic can do exactly these things.  Statistics teach us to question patterns that appear obvious. For instance, on October 31st, 1999, an EgyptAir jetliner plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, leaving no survivors. But between 1996 and 1999, before this tragedy occurred, three other jets had crashed into the ocean right around the same location.  As a result of the EgyptAir crash, some people stopped flying in the area. Their logic was that four crashes in four years was too many to be a coincidence, and that it must indicate some kind of disaster-prone pattern in the region. However, statisticians looked at the bigger picture, and while they saw the four crashes in four years, they also saw millions of planes safely traversing the same airspace during the same period. As a result, they questioned what appeared to be an obvious pattern. In fact, statisticians approximate that the odds of dying in a plane crash are one in ten million – about the same chances of winning the lottery.  On the topic of the lottery, it provides a good example of how statistical thinking also teaches us to question patterns that appear unusual. For instance, between 1999 and 2005, the Ontario Provincial Lottery issued tickets resulting in 5,713 “major” winners, meaning people who raked in prizes of 50,000 Canadian dollars or more. But what’s more shocking is that 200 of the winning tickets were cashed in by the very store owners who sold them.  Assuming fair conditions, store owners shouldn’t be any more likely to win than anybody else. A statistical analysis of the lottery winners exposed that store owners should have accounted for only 57 wins instead of 200.  The statisticians’ findings led them to suspect fraud, a hypothesis that was proven correct when it was revealed that most of the winning store owners had cheated by claiming they held the winning tickets of others who had just earned a free play.  The key message in this book: Statistics are based on five key principles. Statisticians search for variations from the average, uncover causation and reveal correlation, account for group differences, are realistic about the unavoidable trade-offs they face and question patterns whether they appear obvious or odd.  Actionable advice: Use statistical thinking to overcome your fear of flying. If you’re one of the many people who fear flying, a bit of statistical logic might help. A key principle of statistics is to question patterns, so if your fear is a result of a recent spell of plane crashes, you might be able to overcome it by considering what the pattern really indicates. Remember that for every plane that crashes, thousands of others land safely at their respective destinations; the odds of dying in a plane crash are about 1:10,000,000!

Most of us will remember the significant damage done by the world’s last major economic collapse, the 2008 financial crisis – but far fewer of us will understand why exactly it happened. Was it the fault of banks, businesses or governments? The problem is, it all seems very complicated. What were the root causes of the financial crisis? How does the world of finance operate, anyway? These blinks set out to explain why the financial sector is so important, and also dangerous. In these blinks, you’ll learn why finance is so necessary; what went wrong with the financial system; and how the world of finance can reflect societal values again. These days, the global financial system has earned a reputation as one of the root causes of many of the world’s problems. But it didn’t start out this way. Finance was originally intended to improve our quality of life by making it easier to conduct business. The financial system allows us to buy the things we need to live comfortably and connects people who need money with those who can lend money. It also makes the insurance business possible, giving us the chance to protect ourselves from major disasters or emergencies, and allows us to organize our personal assets so that we can pass them along to subsequent generations. Mortgages are another mutually beneficial part of finance. They make it possible for people to own property by taking out a loan, and subsequently making monthly payments with interest to the lender as a reward for supplying the loan. On a larger scale, a healthy financial system can benefit society as a whole, which becomes clear when we look back at the progress we’ve made over several centuries. It was a strong financial sector that allowed Britain and the Netherlands to become world powers in the early days of industrialization. As investments continue to pour into developing countries, it’s strong finances that allow this money to spread and improve the standard of living. We can also see how the undynamic financial systems of communist countries lead to failure time and time again. In these centrally controlled systems, the money is unable to flow to businesses in need, which leads to fewer jobs and poor economic growth. However, even though capitalist freedom has led to the kind of prosperous industrialization that became a cornerstone of modern society, not all of its financial innovations have been good. In fact, some of them haven’t been beneficial to us at all. As it turns out, the financial industry has lost sight of what’s good and bad for the global population as a whole. We’ll get to the bottom of why this has happened in the blinks that follow. In its early days, finance centered around helping people get the money they needed to realize their ideas. Think of a bank providing a baker with enough capital to open up his own bakery. But due to rampant financialization, those good old days are gone, and we’re drowning in needless transactions that aren’t doing us any good. The rampant trading activity and massive growth in the finance sector is called financialization. The problem is, financialization helps banks and stock markets, but hasn’t had any positive impact on household income, small business growth or the economy at large. Financialization started in the 1970s, when large institutions started trading more and more securities, which are financial assets such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. But what really pushed financialization over the edge was the emergence of a new market based on derivative securities. Derivatives are like contracts that base their value on how well other assets perform. Based on the contract created, one party can end up benefiting from an asset’s price going up or down, depending on the kind of derivative it is. One kind of derivative is known as a credit default swap (CDS), which allows a bank to protect itself against a borrower defaulting, or failing to make payments, on their loan or mortgage. In a way, it functions like insurance: the institution investing in the CDS is promising to pay the bank in the event of a default, while the bank is promising to eventually reimburse them, with interest. This is how we ended up in the recent financial crisis of 2008: too many banks were giving out loans to people who were in no position to honor them. Then, too many people defaulted on their loans, and suddenly all the institutions needed money from each other. The system collapsed upon itself. This crisis was further impacted by technology that made it easier than ever for people to trade securities and derivatives, leading to massive artificial inflation of the financial sector. These practices are tantamount to gambling with other people’s money, which, as the recent crisis has shown, isn’t helping anyone. In the years before financialization, the economy was relatively stable due to a financial sector that promoted a culture of caution and planning. By contrast, today the finance sector acts as though it has little to lose, so we end up with a far more volatile economy. And though it may sound strange, banking executives aren’t exactly encouraged to act in their banks’ best interests. Prior to financialization, executives were expected to invest their own money into their banks, which gave them a great incentive not to fail – and to avoid taking too many risks. So, when it came to providing mortgage loans, it was in their best interests to grant these to reliable people who were likely to hold up their end of the bargain and make regular payments. Back then, being a bank manager was also a lifelong job, so they would be around long enough to face the long-term consequences of their actions. But now, these executives make decisions based on an “I’ll be gone, you’ll be gone” approach, which involves making as much money as possible in the short term, and then moving on before it all falls apart. In the years leading up to 2008, countless mortgages were being granted to people who were clearly unlikely to be able to pay them off, which was a major contributing factor to the crisis that followed. Another conflict of interest can be found in the new breed of broker-dealers. Brokers were traditionally agents who helped bring two like-minded dealers, or traders, together. But during the time of financialization, brokers began making their own deals. They were no longer just making money on commissions from their clients, they were also making profits from their own deals. Naturally, this meant it was no longer in their best interests to steer clients toward the best deals. A broker-dealer is now more likely to steer clients toward a less lucrative trade and save the best deals for themselves. Many people involved in the global financial crisis of 2008 like to claim that it was impossible to see it coming – but this isn’t true at all. In reality, what happened was the logical culmination of decades of dangerous and selfish decision making. It’s hard to see what else would happen when everyone in the finance sector was driven by an insatiable desire to make as much money as possible. This mentality can be directly connected to the transition banks made from being largely private or family-owned businesses to being run by corporations. Once banks became owned by shareholders and banking executives were in control of shareholders’ money rather than their own money, they were now free to take much greater risks. And with no personal attachment to the money, they were in no position to be held accountable for any losses that might occur. With so little at stake, they were free to be driven by greed and make deals that would either pay off with huge rewards or cause damage that would have no effect on them personally or professionally. Meanwhile, the introduction of credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) only added to the lack of accountability and further destabilized the financial sector. As the name implies, for a mortgage-backed security to reap rewards, the mortgage and its associated payments must go smoothly. So, the whole mess began when greedy bank managers offered mortgages to people who were clearly unable to make the necessary payments. Naturally, this caused the MBSs that Bank A was trading with Bank B to be very insecure. To offer added security, Bank A would also trade some CDSs to Bank B, thus supposedly protecting themselves from possible defaults. But because Bank B was buying CDSs with nonexistent security from MBSs, both banks were destined to end up in deep trouble when the mortgages defaulted. In the end, both banks needed money but had none, which is why national governments then had to bail them out. The titans of finance often have friends in high places, including senators and other politicians. Some financial institutions even employ former government officials as consultants, guaranteeing them access to political networks and giving banks an inordinate influence in legislatures and legal systems. Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that the finance sector spends more on political lobbying than any other sector. In the United States, between 2012 and 2014, the finance sector spent $800 million on lobbying, which doesn’t include an additional $400 million that was donated to various candidates’ electoral campaigns. Naturally, this amount of money doesn’t come without expectations, and those who win the elections are likely to feel a responsibility to somehow return a bank’s generosity. This leads us to the immense government bailouts that followed the 2008 crisis, a clear sign of how much influence the financial sector has on the US government. Beyond that, it also set a dangerous precedent: it sent the message that it’s acceptable for banks to be reckless, since taxpayers will clean up their messes. Any lessons that could have been learned from what became a global disaster were quickly pushed aside. The banks should have known they were playing with fire by financing subprime mortgages, that is, mortgages for people with lower credit scores and who were deemed to be a higher default risk. But the big corporate banks were also well aware that they were considered too big to fail by the government, so they knew they had a permanent safety net. The finance sector has yet another important advantage working in their favor: since most people don’t understand their complex deals and confusing terminology, it’s easy for them to get away with greedy and irresponsible decisions. Unless you work in finance, it’s doubtful that you know what words like “subprime” or “derivative” really mean, and unscrupulous dealers can use this to their advantage when coming up with excuses for why they lost all your money. Before 2008, many people assumed that the well-paid professionals in the finance industry made rational decisions. But the crisis revealed the truly irrational and risky behavior that’s been going on for years. The sad part is, they didn’t pay for these actions – we did. Another word you’ll hear a lot when people talk about the financial crisis is “regulations.” And contrary to what some might say, there were a lot of regulations in place when everything came crashing down – some of which date back to the infamous crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that came immediately after. But this is another important lesson that we should take from the 2008 crisis: sometimes regulations do more harm than good. When we pile on one regulation after another, it becomes more difficult to implement effective policy oversight. More often than not, these excessive rules will merely encourage people to find new and creative ways of working around them, eventually making matters worse. This is what happened with Regulation Q, which set a maximum interest rate on bank deposits, such as those in a savings account. Regulation Q worked until the mid-1980s, when US banks began bypassing the regulation by depositing their money into European banks that weren’t beholden to the regulation, and then transferring the money back to the United States. So, rather than discouraging bad business practices, as the regulatory agency had hoped, it just created more work for the authorities. One potential solution would be to create a set of international regulations, which is the primary topic of discussion at G8 and G20 summit meetings – but these meetings have yet to be very productive. Another troubling reality of regulations is that they make finance extremely complicated, which generally benefits the institutions more than their customers. Added regulations can make it harder for the average customer to understand even basic transactions. And when we become dependent on supposed experts or specialists in a field, we become far more vulnerable to being taken advantage of. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in charge of enforcing financial regulations in the United States, and their aim is to make the system as transparent as possible. However, the average person will never know what’s really going on with their money if the information available to them is so full of jargon that it might as well be in a different language. And as long as outsiders are kept in the dark, it will to continue to be business as usual for the financial sector. Today’s politics are divisive, but there is one thing most people should be able to agree on: we need to stop the financial sector from making profits through shady deals that end up costing hardworking people their life savings and require governments to bail out major banks with taxpayer money. If we want to be sure that we’re not walking into another crisis, we need to restore trust. This means restructuring the financial sector in a way that removes the temptation for professionals to act in their own self-interest over their clients’. One step in this direction would be to better separate the jobs in the financial system and make sure that positions like broker-dealer are no longer possible. This way, brokers would only be rewarded for negotiating successful deals between two parties, and would be prohibited from acting as dealers and arranging self-serving financial transactions. Another step would be to protect people’s savings deposits and keep them off-limits from banks and other financial trading institutions. This would keep people’s life savings safe in the event of another major collapse, and would prevent banks from using their clients’ money as just another set of assets to include in their payments and trades. Also, it would give a bank’s greedy traders far less of other people’s money to play with, thereby reducing the likelihood they’d take on high-risk transactions. But perhaps most important of all is to have proper ethical conduct be promoted from within the financial system. Having the SEC threaten, and occasionally enforce, billion-dollar fines is clearly an ineffective way of promoting good behavior. Ethical business practices must be instilled from within the institutions themselves, by executives and leaders who set a good example and reward those who adhere to similarly ethical practices. Obviously, this is easier said than done. But every transformation has to start somewhere. The key message in this book: As the recent banking crisis proved, the financial sector has become a dangerous, self-serving beast that offers little in the way of benefits to the average person. However, history shows that our financial system can work when regulations are streamlined and ethical business practices become the norm rather than the exception. With some considerable restructuring, the financial sector could once again be a valuable and useful system that makes our economy stronger and improves our overall quality of life. Got feedback?

Baranowski","summary":"There are countless books out there dishing up tips on how to become a successful investor. And the basic message of all these books is “buy low, sell high” – the buzzword of investing. But do you actually understand what it means? No worries if you don’t because these blinks will clue you in on that and much more. They outline the way to a successful start in investing, explaining what company stocks are and what you need to invest in them. You’ll also learn why successful investors are picky and never gamble with their money. And you’ll learn why investing won’t make you rich overnight. You’ll also learn why a dip in the value of your shares may be a golden opportunity; why markets are like trains; and why buying stocks is a bit like buying an umbrella. So, you’re ready to start investing in the stock market? Well, the most logical place to begin is by understanding what stocks are, because, despite what some might think, they’re not just pieces of paper with a price tag attached. In fact, every stock represents part of a business, and when you buy stock you’re actually purchasing a share of the company. So in the same way that entrepreneurs can own a business outright or split ownership with other partners, as a stockholder, you can own shares of a company. But while entrepreneurs and partners work day in, day out to manage their business, as a shareholder you don’t have any responsibility for managing the company and can sell your shares whenever you want. So stocks are effectively pieces of a company, and many companies make their stock available to the public. This is a strategic decision that depends on the size and financial needs of a company. Every business relies on financing, but some entrepreneurs use their own savings while others come up with the initial capital by asking family and friends like the founders of Google did. As a company grows, its funding often needs to grow with it. Eventually, the company can become so big that it only has two options for how to raise the massive amounts of capital needed to run its daily operations and make investments: First, they can borrow money from a bank just like an average person would do to buy a car or a house. Naturally, this money, along with the interest it accumulates, needs to be repaid. The second funding option is to go public. That means splitting ownership of the company into shares and selling them on the stock exchange. This option is different from a loan because the money never has to be repaid by the company. Instead, shareholders own stock as long as they want until they sell it to other investors, hopefully turning a profit and sometimes collecting dividends in the process. Now that you know what stocks are, it’s time to learn how to analyze their value and become a successful investor. If you’ve ever read the financial news, you’ve probably been bombarded with information, both enthusiastic and catastrophic. You see headlines like “Google shares hit record high” or “Oil prices collapse.” Some investors become quickly distressed trying to keep up with the media craze. But sound investing is about rationality, not emotions. Say you own stock in Starbucks and read in the paper that the company’s valuation fell by 10 percent in just one day. Your emotions may urge you to sell your shares to avoid getting caught on a sinking ship, but don’t listen to them. If you approach the situation rationally instead, you’ll see that a 10 percent loss is an opportunity to buy more shares at a lower price. After all, you know the company has serious potential. But rationality isn’t all you need. Investing also requires great timing. It’s essential to know when to disagree with the masses and buy when everyone is selling or sell when everyone is buying. Good timing usually presents itself when extreme emotions are driving financial markets. For instance, during the 2000 dot-com bubble, investors were slobbering over internet companies like Pets.com and WebVan. However, it was quickly revealed that these companies had no business models, produced zero revenue and were bound for bankruptcy. Or take the 2008 global financial crisis when financial markets fell apart due to mass panic. During this time, even sound and profitable companies saw their shares devalued. In both this event and the dot-com bubble, there were lucrative opportunities by thinking differently from the crowd: namely, by selling in 2000 when enthusiasm was at its highest or buying in 2008 when panic struck. You might have dreams of getting rich overnight, but even the most successful investors like Warren Buffett didn’t make their fortunes so quickly. In fact, being a good investor is all about cultivating patience and discipline, so take it slow. Rushing investment decisions is a sure way to fail. The truth is, it often takes months, even years, for an investment to turn a profit. For instance, in recent market history, Facebook ran into difficulties soon after going public, and the stock dropped substantially only to quadruple a few years later. But discipline can be tricky. Part of it is about letting go of the fear that you’re missing out on an investment opportunity. For example, if markets rose by 20 percent this year and you failed to invest, you might feel like you missed out. Such feelings are natural. But in reality, there are so many publicly traded stocks that financial markets are virtually infinite spheres of opportunities. In fact, financial experts often compare missing an opportunity on the stock market to missing a train: another one is sure to come! Finally, discipline also means not gambling with money you might need. Fear, which can drive people to make irrational choices, is the investor’s worst enemy. But it can be difficult to keep your fear from getting the best of you if you invest money you need to pay your mortgage. So avoid making bad choices based on irrational fears and only invest money you know you won’t need for the next three to five years. Keep the rest safely planted in your savings account. Knowing when to break from the crowd is essential to good investing, and the most effective way to outsmart other investors is to build up your knowledge every day. But before you do that, you’ll need to know where your investing competencies lie. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, often cites the concept of a circle of competence. The idea is that it pays to know what you’re good at and to stick to it. Let’s say you know a lot about pharmaceutical companies. Your knowledge gives you an investment advantage in this field. But you might also be drawn to stocks in industries you barely know anything about. It’s important to avoid these and invest only in what you know. Remember, over time your circle of competence can grow if you keep learning about new investment opportunities and other industries. In fact, continued learning will give you a profound advantage in investing. It’s pretty simple really: knowledge gives you an edge because most people these days don’t have it. The Pew Research Center’s report on reading shed light on this phenomenon: it found that 23 percent of Americans didn’t read a single book in all of 2014. Compare this number to just 8 percent in 1978. Knowing a bit about accounting may help you read a company’s financial report, but you need to be knowledgeable about the world around you to know what those numbers mean in the current economic and political landscape. So reading regularly is imperative to succeeding as an investor. You also need to remember that part of the investing process is learning from your mistakes. So if you sell a stock too late and lose money the best thing you can do is analyze the situation! By doing so, you can determine exactly where you went wrong and be less likely to do it again. It might seem ingenious to come up with a complex investment strategy, but the truth is, real wisdom is about keeping things as simple as possible. So just focus on what really matters. After all, there’s a nearly infinite number of criteria to consider when assessing a company: brand image, financial performance, the management team’s charisma – and the list goes on. To stay focused, stick to the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. Here’s how it works: In the nineteenth century, the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto observed that 80 percent of Italy’s land was owned by just 20 percent of the population. Based on this observation, he deduced that in many cases, 80 percent of the effects result from just 20 percent of the causes. And the same logic can be applied to investing: stick with the indicators that matter most to you and forget about the rest of them. After all, only a few will ultimately cause a stock to appreciate. Selectivity is another way of being focused. So you shouldn’t buy a little bit of everything but choose stocks that fit your profile. In short, you need to apply filters. When Warren Buffet considers an investment he uses the following four: First, do you understand the business? You shouldn’t invest in a company selling a new technology you don’t know anything about just because it seems innovative. Second, does the company have long-term potential? After all, some industries are fads and others, like food or health care, are more essential. Third, do you trust the management? This one is simple because a CEO that previously bankrupted several companies is a red flag. And, finally, is the price right? In other words, if you think the stock is overpriced, move on and look for another opportunity. There are literally thousands of companies whose stocks are traded on the market. To separate the winners from the losers, investors need to know how to ask the right questions. When looking at a stock, it’s best to act like a five-year-old and never stop asking questions such as: Why do people like or need the company in their lives? Why do they consume its products? Is the company selling a revolutionary innovation or is it a trendy start-up that’s going to fade away? You should also ask: Why is now the right time to buy? After all, major corporations like Nike, Exxon and Microsoft have existed for decades, so why should you invest in them today? Well, maybe they just tapped into a new and promising market or have nailed down a profitable long-term trend. Another strategy is to seek out companies with a genuine competitive advantage, that is, one or more attributes that help them outperform competitors. One such attribute is pricing power, a company’s ability to easily raise prices while retaining its customers. Just look at Apple. When the company launches a new iPhone, they barely even consider the prices of their competitors. Instead, they set their own prices with the knowledge that consumers desire Apple products and will pay a hefty price to get them. Finally, you should steer clear of companies that can’t anticipate change. In fact, there are plenty of ways to sniff out a company’s danger of incurring heavy losses in the near future due to this flaw. Two such indicators are cheap competition and the rise and fall of technology. Take Kodak, which fell out of fashion with the rise of digital photography, causing the demand for film cameras to plummet. Then again, some companies can better adapt to changing trends. For example, Coca-Cola is no longer just a soft drink company but has expanded its product line to include other drinks that meet the ever-changing needs of consumers. Today, financial markets are prone to drastic drops and spikes. These changes can be caused by mood swings prompted by the overexcitement and exaggerated disappointment of investors. That’s because, today, investors are taking in too much information, gossip and rumors from the media. They overreact to this information overload by buying and selling too quickly. As a result, investors today hold on to their stocks for exceedingly short periods of time. For instance, in the 1960s, people held stocks for an average of eight years. Today, people will generally sell them after just six months. This rapid buying and selling also fuels the drastic fluctuations of financial markets. So, keeping your cool is key, and you shouldn’t pay attention to daily fluctuations in stock prices. Say you just invested a lot of money in stocks. You might be tempted to check the price movements of your stocks on a daily basis. But it’s rare that prices go up every day, and even small decreases could frustrate you, causing you to sell too soon. Instead of checking prices on a monthly or even yearly basis, you should give the companies you’re invested in the time they need to implement business strategies and grow in the long term. Then, once you’ve immunized yourself to the market’s mood swings, you can begin profiting from those who haven’t. That’s because buying stocks is a little like buying an umbrella. If you walk around New York City on a rainy day, you see loads of vendors selling low-quality umbrellas for exorbitant prices. But if you walk the same streets on a sunny day, the same umbrellas will be selling for half the price. Now apply that to the way distressed sellers respond when the market isn’t working in their favor. Smart investors can jump on the opportunity presented by the panic of others who want to sell at all costs. That’s because such moments are the best time to buy stocks at bargain prices. Investing might seem like it’s all about making more money, but the truth is, good investors make it their priority not to lose money. The best way to do this is to buy cheap. When you buy a high-priced stock, you expose yourself to potentially huge losses if the price plummets. Obviously, this damage is reduced if you go with cheap stocks. Imagine stocks as students. There are reliable, straight-A students, which are analogous to your expensive stocks, and everyone knows that they are great. Then there are good students who have temporary problems: these are your cheap, but valuable stocks. Maybe they were absent a few times or failed a test. Still, these stocks have massive potential because their imperfections make them much cheaper than their real value. So buying cheap is key, but it’s also important to remain conservative with your expectations. That’s because you can’t predict the future and shouldn’t bother trying. Instead of hoping for the best possible outcome, you should strategically construct scenarios that don’t rely on a company defying all odds. That requires being realistic and determining whether a company can turn healthy profits even in imperfect conditions. Just take Tesla. Some speculators might bet on the company’s next car being a huge success, but a wise investor would only buy shares of the company if the company has a plan to build a healthy business based on modest, but long-lasting success. And finally, when embarking on your investment journey, be sure to diversify your stocks. After all, the less experienced you are, the less you’ll know about the specifics of any given sector. Therefore, the greater the diversification, the smaller the impact if one of your stocks crashes because the rest of your portfolio can curb the damage. For instance, if you invest solely in banks, your entire portfolio will crumble in the event of a banking crisis. The key message in this book is: If you’re new to investing, you might think that the stock market is a way to get rich overnight. But the truth is that investing is about patience, discipline and rationality. By planning strategically and sticking with your investments, you can build up the portfolio and the wealth you’ve always dreamed of.  Actionable advice: Accept your mistakes. The great thing about investing is that you don’t have to be always right. Even if you’re wrong with a few investments, you can still turn a profit with the rest of your portfolio. So accept your mistakes and know they’re not deadly. You can even use these failures as inspiration to learn and do better the next time. Got feedback?

But that voice was once stifled. Though written in 1938, Outwitting the Devil wasn’t published until 2011 because Hill had some controversial thoughts about churches and schools, which, to his mind, discouraged individuality and kept people in a stifling web of fear. So here we are 70 years later, and Hill’s book is finally seeing the light of day. In some ways, this narrative is very much in line with Hill’s belief in perseverance and resisting the urge to give up.

In these blinks, you’ll learn how to avoid becoming a drifter; the importance of keeping an eye on bad habits; and what a jockey can teach us about perseverance. Is there a dream you’ve held onto for years but have been afraid to pursue? There probably is, since, in the author’s estimation, 98 percent of us are letting our minds be controlled by fear. As a result, we tend to drift through life without thinking for ourselves or following our own desires. The fear that causes us to drift is instilled early on. First, there are the churches that teach children to beware of the insidious “Devil.” Then there are the schools that offer very little preparation for children to be individuals in the real world, and focus instead on having students memorize endless facts and figures. The author, Napoleon Hill, learned firsthand about this overwhelming fear and lack of individuality while working toward his life goal: creating the first philosophy of individual achievement. For years, he’d interviewed people about their successes and failures, but his notes were starting to become aimless, and they certainly didn’t add up to a concrete philosophy. He was stuck and his mind was fogged with fear and indecision. Then, one day, he had an epiphany. While out walking and taking in some much-needed fresh air, he was suddenly confronted by a voice that felt like his “other self” talking to him. The voice was commanding, and it told Hill that he could finish his manuscript on the philosophy of individual achievement; all he had to do was stop giving in to fear and doubt. Hill came to believe that this voice represented something we all possess. He calls it Infinite Intelligence – an abundance of faith and positive energy that we can always tap into as long as we keep doubt, fear and worry from our mind. Thanks to this voice, Hill was able to push his fear aside, put in the necessary work and finish his book. As a result, Hill became the first great writer of the self-help genre, and his work continues to be read worldwide. In other words, Hill became a non-drifter, which is someone who knows that the key to success is becoming the master of your own mind. Hill’s breakthrough came, in part, because he had a very clear goal in life. If you want to increase your chances of success, you’ll have to find a life goal of your own. Indeed, identifying your goal is all-important, since a person’s success often hinges on whether or not he knows what he wants. Now, this work can’t be done for you; neither school nor church can determine your path in life. So it’s lucky that you (and everyone else on Earth) has an invaluable privilege. We’re all self-determining. Even in the worst of situations, we have a choice: we can let our mind fill either with positive or with negative thoughts. For example, a lot of people struggled during the Great Depression, but some had the self-determination to stay positive and accomplish greatness. Take Henry Ford. Like so many other people of his time, he could have let the prevailing negative thoughts cloud his mind. But, instead, Ford kept fear at bay and didn’t let negative thinking get in the way of his developing one of the biggest automobile companies in America. Ultimately, it was determination and positive thinking that helped him create assembly-line manufacturing and realize his dream of producing an affordable car that every middle-class American could buy. So remember, the most important determining factor for success is whether you choose to think negatively or positively. And when you combine positive thinking with a definite goal in life, you’ll be on your way to avoiding the fate of being a drifter. Franklin D. Roosevelt is another great example. He had a very clear purpose when he became president of the United States: to sweep away the fear that had been persisting since the start of the Great Depression and to shift the nation’s focus away from depression and toward recovery. When asked about the major problem facing the United States, Roosevelt replied, “It is not a question of majors and minors; we have but one problem and that is to stop fear and supplant it with faith.” This was a definite plan, and it worked – it allowed Roosevelt to immediately take control and put America on the road to recovery. As the saying goes, “You reap what you sow.” In other words, your results are going to reflect your effort. And once you start thinking positively and pursue your goals, you’ll soon find how effective having a purpose can really be. Whether the ostensible culprit is poor eating habits or an irregular sleeping schedule, people are great at coming up with excuses for bad and unproductive behavior. The real danger, however, is when those habits start to become a regular way of life. When drinking ceases to be a monthly activity and starts becoming a daily one, then you may be falling victim to what the author terms the law of hypnotic rhythm – a fixed engagement in habitual behaviors. This law applies to both bad and good habits. However, you should be especially wary of negative habits since they can quickly have a devastating effect on your life. For example, most headaches and other illnesses are caused by overeating or indulging in the wrong kinds of foods. And when people develop bad eating habits, their ability to function can deteriorate and their goals can go out the window. The same can happen with other habits, such as sex, which can become such a strong focus of desire that all other goals fall away. To avoid such habits, successful people tend to surround themselves with people who have positive habits. After all, it’s common knowledge that the habits of the people around you will rub off on you. This would seem like a simple enough strategy, yet most people go through life accepting their circumstances instead of pursuing better ones. A good example of someone who didn’t just accept his circumstances is Andrew Carnegie, who served as a mentor to the author. The philanthropist and business titan did what many other successful leaders have done; he surrounded himself with successful people. So, if you find yourself being negatively influenced by the dark moods of your friends or colleagues, it may be time to find peers with better attitudes. If you once pursued a project and, in the end, were met with failure, you may have taken this as a sign to give up. But successful people know that failures are only a rough patch on the road to reaching their goals. Take Thomas Edison – the man behind the light bulb, the phonograph and a long list of other revolutionary inventions. He had to go through dozens of failures before he successfully realized any of his visions. There are likely thousands of people more intelligent than Edison. What really set him apart and put him into the history books was his perseverance in the face of countless setbacks. During the Great Depression, the author published Think and Grow Rich (1937), which helped people see beyond the hard times and disappointments of that decade. And that book’s advice still holds true today. We always need to find a way of creating goals in spite of whatever desolate circumstances we may find ourselves in. To this day, the author’s 1937 book remains among the top ten self-help books of all time. Another habit many successful people have is to recognize that any given failure may be the seed that grows into success. Every problem you encounter will have a solution, so there’s no reason to think of failure as anything other than a temporary state of mind. For example, Julie Krone was told time and time again that she couldn’t be a professional jockey because none of the horse owners wanted a female jockey. But Krone had a motto: “Keep showing up!” And sure enough, she wore those horse owners down until they finally let her ride. Julie Krone became a champion jockey. Indeed, years later, USA Today listed her as one of the toughest athletes in history. If you have your dream, don’t let someone else’s negative attitude make you think it can’t be done. The key message in these blinks: We all have good thoughts and bad thoughts. Sometimes that inner voice tells us to keep fighting and other times it tells us to give up. Fortunately, we can choose to listen to the positive voice and follow it while ignoring the negativity and pushing aside the fear that keeps so many people from making their dreams come true. By recognizing our fears, exercising the power of positive thinking and following a clear plan, we can all overcome failure and achieve our deepest desires.  Got feedback?

Without glancing at credit card bills, student loan statements or mortgage commitments, you wouldn’t be alone if you said you had a good amount of outstanding debt. But what happens when you don’t pay back your debt, as agreed? Yep, bad things happen. You’re fined, or slapped with a bad credit rating – or if things really go bad, you develop a criminal record. Yet just like you and your friends, companies and even countries in recent years have compiled tons and tons of debt. Yet as you’ll discover in the following blinks, these entities didn’t sweat the details of paying those debts back. The result? One of the biggest financial crises in history. You’ll learn exactly how we got to this point and why such irresponsible borrowing behavior was allowed to happen in the first place. In these blinks, you’ll discover how many zeros there are in a trillion; why it’s easier to buy a sheep with cash than with a loaf of bread; and why you may be buried in debt, but your grandparents are not. If money is just ink on paper, why is it that we worship it so? The answer rests in how we use it. Money’s primary function is as a medium of exchange. Before we used money, deals were settled through bartering. If you were a baker, for example, and you wanted a pair of pants or a leg of lamb, you could find a shepherd and trade. If you gave him 100 loaves of bread, he’d give you a lamb. But what if the shepherd had no need for bread? You’d then have to find something he did want, perhaps a new knife. You’d then have to find a blacksmith (who needs bread) to make the knife, which you could trade for the lamb. Trying to find the right thing to trade could lead to some intricate, time-consuming bartering. Money cuts through this confusion: if you want something, you simply exchange it for money, which the seller can then use to buy something else. The transaction is simple, and direct. Money also functions as a unit of account, or a means of measuring a product’s value. To trade an item, we need to understand its worth. Bartering makes this difficult. Could you say accurately how many lambs one knife is worth? Or does it depend on the needs and resources of the shepherd and the blacksmith? Money makes valuation easy, as beforehand its value is agreed upon. Finally, money can be used to store value, for example, by maintaining the value of a specific product. Most of the world’s countries keep the value of their money more or less stable to foster investment and prevent inflation, in which prices rise but the value of money decreases. Understanding money’s many functions is essential to understanding the way it can influence the economy and society. With an understanding of how money functions, we can now look at one of its major roles in modern society: the concept of debt. People often lend and borrow money to and from one another based on trust. In fact, the word “credit,” another way to describe debt, stems from the Latin word credere, meaning “to believe.” No matter whether you’re a creditor or a borrower, mutual trust and confidence in the transaction serves as the foundation of debt. The borrower needs to be confident in her own ability to pay back the loan; the creditor likewise needs to have to trust in the borrower to do so. What’s more, both borrower and creditor need to be confident that they will profit in some way from the arrangement. Student loans provide a good example. A student applying for a loan trusts that he will get a good education and a well-paying job after college, while the bank (lender) trusts that the student will finish his education and will be able to pay back the loan, with interest. There has been plenty of trust between borrowers and lenders in recent decades. The result of this is that most Western countries carry debt that is at least three or four times higher than reported annual income. How could this state of affairs have ever happened? In the last 40 years, Western countries’ economies have grown steadily, while living standards and productivity have likewise increased. As societies became more confident in their ability to earn and thus easily pay back loans, they borrowed even more from banks and other countries, which trusted the borrowers to pay the loans back and on time. Slowly but surely, the debt that was amassed surpassed levels ever seen in the global financial system! If you go to Times Square in New York City, you might notice a particular clock. This clock doesn’t tell the hour but instead records the accumulation of debt by the U.S. government in real time. When the clock was built back in 1989, it was equipped with enough digit places to display an amount in the trillions, or a one followed by 12 zeros. By 2008, the clock needed to be updated. By then, the amount of debt the United States had accumulated had hit a total of $10 trillion, which required more digits than the clock could handle. So how did the United States, as well as other countries, fall so deeply into the red? Over time, countries racked up more and more debt, without stopping to think how the debt would be paid back. If you ask a mountain climber how she manages to climb so high without fear, she might say, “Keep looking up, never look down.” Countries essentially did the same thing. As a nation grew comfortable in its general ability to pay back debt, it would start to borrow beyond its means. Yet as the mountains of debt kept growing, countries simply stopped looking down. A nation would concern itself only with borrowing more to maintain operations, not with how to pay the debt back. Eventually, everyone looked down, and confidence in the debt-burdened system collapsed. Why shouldn’t a climber look down? If you do, you quickly realize how far you can fall, and your confidence will crumble. This is exactly what happened with the financial system. Sitting on mountains of debt, countries suddenly looked down and were shocked at the unbelievable amount of money they owed each other. Faced with this realization, confidence disappeared. Countries stopped borrowing, and, more crucially, stopped lending. And as a result, the financial system ground to halt and credit dried up. The sudden realization of the degree of indebtedness caused countries and banks across the world to panic and halt lending. But how did this actually result in a global financial crisis? The golden years of borrowing had created a bubble in the financial system. As countries, companies and banks borrowed more and more, they created an artificial boom in the global economy. In contrast to previous boom periods, which resulted from events such as high worker productivity or improved business practices, the boom preceding the global financial crisis was fueled by cheap credit. As long as people continued to lend to one another, the trend would only continue. Investment banks like Lehman Brothers, for example, borrowed huge amounts from other banks. They used this debt to buy and trade other forms of debt, such as mortgage bonds, from which they profited greatly. And as their profits increased, they saw no reason to slow their borrowing to keep things going up. As soon as the confidence in borrowing waned and the flow of credit dried up, however, the bubble burst and the financial system collapsed. Once everyone saw just how much debt Lehman Brothers had accumulated, no one wanted to lend to the firm anymore. Then when the U.S. government refused to keep the company solvent with a bailout, Lehman was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. This bankruptcy created a domino effect worldwide. Banks and insurance companies that had lent money to Lehman suffered massive losses, and as a result, they too stopped lending. And it wasn’t just the financial industry that suffered. Countries, such as Greece and Spain, had funded years of growth with massive borrowing. Once the crisis hit, these countries too had no way to pay back their debts. The financial crisis was both massive and devastating. But how much did the crisis’ effects change our practices of borrowing and finance in general? The next blink will look at what the future holds for borrowers and lenders. After the 2008 financial crisis, many people believed the end of the world was nigh. But really, those that predicted the end times had no grasp of economic history. The truth is, large financial crises happen all the time, whether in ancient periods or modern times. Before King Louis XIV died in 1715, France experienced a serious financial crisis as the king had accrued debts worth nearly a billion livres, the currency of the time. France tried to lessen the crisis by printing paper money while attempting to rekindle confidence in its new banking system. The idea was to trick investors into thinking that banks were more credible than they actually were. And just like in 2008, the French bubble quickly burst, and many people lost everything, their homes and their livelihoods, and were forced to live on the streets. One of the most common ways to fight a debt crisis is through inflation, in which the local currency drops in value. If your currency becomes half as valuable, then you effectively wipe away half of your debt burden that is denominated in that currency. Many economies in the past, including ancient Greek despots, took this approach. So why didn’t every country hit by the financial crisis do this in 2008? One reason is that countries like Greece, which uses the euro, can’t devalue its currency independently to bolster its economy, as many other European countries use it as well. Post-crisis, it’s easy to understand how people could be pessimistic. Is there any silver lining to look for in the global financial system for the future? There is, but we have to deal with the consequences of changing global demographics. Researchers estimate that the world’s population will grow by 50 percent within the first half of the twenty-first century. This growth will occur mostly in the developing world, while birth rates in developed countries will fall. This unbalanced growth will inevitably lead to problems. For one, developing countries’ economies will struggle under the weight of a massive population. At the same time, the low birth rates of developed countries will lead to a decline in productivity, due to a shrinking population. To ensure the future economic health of the globe, we need to work on these and other problems. Economically struggling countries, like Greece for example, not only need support but also must change social assumptions. The country requires fundamental reforms to fix the root of economic woes, rather than relying on further borrowing to fund growth. By working to foster real growth – by improving infrastructure, fighting corruption and increasing productivity – Greeks could actually develop a strong economy for the long term. Growth would be based on a stable foundation, and thus unlikely to collapse. The world is in dire need of a change in direction if we are to manage the problems caused by our debt-ridden way of life! Most young people today carry some sort of debt, in the form of an overdrawn checking account, a housing loan or even a weighty student loan. The ease with which we accumulate debt is a relatively new development. Our great-grandparents, survivors of the Great Depression in the United States, avoided banks and would have rather been seen eating garbage than borrowing money. Even Baby Boomers still fear debt as bad or unusual. Indeed, the way that societies and cultures have dealt with financial matters has changed. If you owed money, it was usually seen as the mark of having lived an extravagant or wasteful life, of living beyond your means. Most people simply didn’t need credit, as they could rent a home and work at the same company their entire life for a steady income. But the advent of lowered interest rates, entrepreneurial activity and a decline in traditional working practices made people more willing to take on debt and build a business, finance an education or own a home outright. Whereas older generations feared debt, the younger generations see it as an accepted way of life, not something to be ashamed about. Yet this accumulation of debt, above and beyond normal levels, not only can cause problems between generations but also lead to problems for us all in the future. The key message in this book: Wanton borrowing and overconfidence in financial systems led to a massive, worldwide financial crisis. Even in the face of this crisis, there is still no shortage of debt, for individuals and for governments.  Suggested further reading: House of Debt by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi When we bailed out the banks during the Great Recession, we didn’t actually address the real factors that caused the economic downturn. The actual problem lay with excessive mortgage lending to those who couldn’t afford it, which led to heavy debts and, eventually, huge collapses in consumer spending. To avoid the consequences of this boom-and-bust cycle in the future, the authors propose new ways of restructuring debt and stimulating the economy.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Do you see a massive house in a beautiful area, a huge, shiny car maybe with a personal chauffeur? That would be nice! But you’ll never get there, will you? Whatever dream life you may wish for, you probably accept that it will remain just that, a dream. Real prosperity and wealth is never going to happen, unless you discover a long lost billionaire aunt, or win the lottery.  But you’re wrong. You can become prosperous – and wealth is relatively straightforward to achieve. All you need to do is learn the steps and thinking needed. And where can you discover these? Start by reading these blinks. In these blinks you’ll discover why merely thinking about your dream life can bring you one step closer to it; why everyone needs to learn about the miracle of compound interest; and why you need to start hoarding pictures of your dream house. It’s natural for everybody to want a life full of success, happiness and prosperity. But what does that really mean? What makes a life prosperous?  Find out for yourself by drawing what’s called a prosperity picture, a visual representation of what you desire from life both now and down the line. It just takes three simple steps. Step one – define your goals. Start by asking yourself what you want today, in the near future and the long term. What does your life look like? Where are you? What smells surround you? Which people?  Once you’ve answered these questions find photos that reflect your desires. For instance, if you see a picture of your dream house or car make sure to hold on to it.  Step two – bring your goals together and make them easier to visualize. Start with a blank sheet of paper on which you draw a future prosperity picture frame: First draw a horizontal axis labeled “time frame” that runs from the present into the distant future. Then draw a vertical axis labeled “finance” that runs from not very much money at the bottom to great wealth at the top.  Once you’ve got your picture frame, divide it into four squares, each of which represents a different combination of money and time. Now you can start attaching pictures that represent your goals into each box based on how much money they will require and when you want to achieve them by.  For example, your dream house might be way off in the far upper quadrant because it’s going to take a lot of both time and money to make it a reality.  Step three – keep your eyes on your vision and constantly picture it. Remember, you’ve just created something that could transform your life. Don’t toss it in a drawer and forget about it. Make a point of seeing it constantly so it reminds you what you’re working for every single day. Alright, so a prosperity picture is nice but how do you make it a reality? The first step is to prepare your brain for the future you desire and that means believing it’s possible. To achieve this it’s necessary to use visualization, because simply visualizing your goals will bring them closer.  How? Actually, science can explain it: visualization has been proven to work thanks to a small part of your brain called the reticular activating system or RAS. It works on a subconscious level by sifting out important information from all the unessential facts.  For instance, say you buy a green Corolla and all of a sudden see green Corollas all over town. This is not due to an overnight increase in the green-Corolla-driving population but because your RAS tells you that the combination of green and Corolla is relevant to you. So, in this way your RAS is the gatekeeper to your brain and you can “set it up” to see the things you want, thereby training your brain to notice particular opportunities.  So how can you harness your RAS to realize your personal prosperity picture? It all depends on “seeing” your desired future! Dr. Srinivasan Pillay of Harvard Medical School found that people stimulate the same parts of the brain during a visualization of an action as they do when actually performing the same action. Therefore, if your visualization is successful your actual chances of success are improved since you’ve already “done” it. For example, Russian scientists took four groups of Olympic athletes and compared their physical training schedules to their mental ones: The first group only did physical training. The second did 75 percent physical and 25 percent mental, including visualizing themselves finishing before others. The third group split their efforts 50–50 and the final group did 75 percent mental and a mere 25 percent physical. Can you guess which group did the best? That’s right, the last one. OK, so visualizing your goals can help you realize them, but not without the money necessary. So it’s also key to start planning.  While most people don’t like to consider finances, success depends on getting them under control. That’s because without making financial considerations and plans, living the life you want will be an impossibility. For instance, the parents of Jim, one of the author’s clients, had a classic picture of retirement: they were going to sell their house, buy an RV and head out on the open road.  They followed their dream but because they didn’t plan financially they had a difficult time getting by and had no choice but to go back to work. But that could have all been avoided. For instance, by taking a financial inventory of all your assets and liabilities you can be sure to avoid the fate of Jim’s parents. There’s two ways to do this: either online or on paper.  If you prefer using a computer you can take advantage of online financial planning tools like Mint.com. Just plug in your data one time, linking your profile to your bank, investments and other accounts and it will update automatically.  However, some people are worried about security when dealing with money and those wary of online tools can always pick up the old pencil and paper. Begin with the pluses, listing what you have. This list should include three major asset groups: cash, investment as well as retirement accounts and personal belongings.  Now for the less pleasant, but extremely important part: debt. Make a list of everything you owe. It should include all different forms of debt like mortgages, unpaid credit cards and any other outstanding loans. Now that you’ve got everything listed it’s easy to calculate your net worth by subtracting your liabilities from your assets. This number is your current financial health. OK, now that you know your current financial state you’re ready to plan a path to your prosperity picture. The first step is getting rid of your debt.  We all know that debts can accumulate in all sorts of ways from mortgages to car payments but one of the most pernicious debts is that from credit cards. That’s because they can creep up on you and the option to spend now and pay later can make big problems.  For instance, Jennie, after separating from her boyfriend, remodeled her house and took a trip to the Caribbean. In the process she racked up $10,000 of credit card debt! So what should you do if you find yourself in this situation? Pay off your debt as soon as possible. Because the longer you wait, the more interest you’ll pay. For example, if Jennie made the minimum payment of $200 a month she would be debt free in 8 years after paying $9,000 in interest! However, if she chose to pay $300 a month she would be free of her debt in 4 years and would pay less than $4,000 in interest. But while paying off your debts is important, it’s also key to keep putting a little money aside. Because life can take unexpected and difficult turns. So to safeguard yourself, regardless of what the future holds, you’ll need insurance in three essential areas. First, health insurance is a must. You should research government-subsidized options, employer plans and private insurers. Second, disability insurance is essential. Because the current chances of being injured while in the workforce are 25 percent. Therefore, if you can’t survive without your monthly income, insurance can be an essential safety net. Lastly, life insurance becomes key when you support dependents. Make sure that if the worst happens and you pass away, your loved ones are not left in financial trouble. Even if you earn an above average salary you might find yourself with not much left to spend at the end of the month. Well, you’re not alone. But you can change this situation and boost your net worth. It all begins with controlling your spending.  Start by writing a spending plan. First determine your net income, everything you earn after taxes. Then make a list of all your expense and organize them into groups. For instance, healthcare, housing, transportation, education, children, personal, entertainment and so on. Now that you know your net income and expenses you can calculate your monthly unallocated amount, the money left to spend. Keep in mind that this amount has the potential to increase, because once you’re looking clearly at your spending habits you begin to cut unnecessary expenses. For instance, Lisa, a client of the author, analyzed her spending habits and discovered plenty of redundancies, like two digital New York Times subscriptions, a gym membership she barely used and many others. Every month she was unnecessarily spending $131! Now that you know your unallocated amount you can invest wisely and that means taking advantage of compound interest, a way of building wealth in which interest is added to an investment that has already accrued interest over time. You can use compound interest to your advantage by regularly setting aside some amount of money. For example, say you have an average salary and are in your mid-twenties to early thirties. If you can manage to invest $2,000 a month at just 6 percent interest you’ll have $1.3 million in 25 years! But if that’s out of your budget don’t worry. Investing a mere $200 a month can return $136,000 in 25 years. Think of it this way, saving $200 a month only means putting aside $6 a day. So, you’ve got the tools to accomplish most dreams but not all dreams are small and time is not always on your side. Don’t want to wait 25 years to reach your goals? Don’t worry. Just use short-term investment strategies.  That means going beyond savings accounts and considering other options. For instance, certificates of deposits are an investment tool that require you to commit to keeping your money invested for a fixed time period, generally five to six years. While they afford you less flexibility than savings accounts they pay higher interest which increases the longer your money stays put.  Another option worth looking into is short-term bond funds. A bond is essentially a loan which an investor makes to a government, municipality or corporation, and a fund is a conglomerated pack of bonds.  So when you take out bonds you’re basically a money lender. Bonds are a fixed income security, meaning you are paid interest based on a predetermined rate, and investing in them usually returns more than certificates of deposit.  But if you can tolerate higher risk in exchange for a higher return, the stock market is your ticket.  Here’s how it works. Just like with bonds, you can buy shares of an individual company or put your money in stock funds, or pooled shares of multiple companies. But if you’ve got a high risk tolerance you can avoid paying the fund manager fees necessary to join a stock fund, which tend to range between 0.2 and two percent of your investment, and buy stocks on your own. Just remember that individual stock prices are prone to higher fluctuation than those in a stock fund and therefore bring higher risks. Congratulations, with all you’ve learned you now have a picture of your prosperity. Just believe in it, get your finances in order and prepare to live the life of your dreams!

Then, driving to work one day, he heard a podcast interview with financial guru Mr. Money Moustache about the FIRE movement. This changed Rieckens’ life. FIRE, or Financial Independence, Retire Early, is a community devoted to combining aggressive savings and low-cost investments to buy back their most precious resource— time. Within five months, Rieckens had left his job, cut his family’s expenses in half and set out to make a documentary about the journey. Two years later, he is just nine years from retiring, the documentary Playing with Fire is finished, and he has written a book in the process. These blinks reveal hacks for making the most of your finances so you can focus on what you really care about. As we’ll see, FIRE converts have used their newfound financial independence to do many things, including retiring early, making flexible career choices, pursuing passion projects and simplifying their lives. And best of all, the FIRE lifestyle isn’t only for wealthy people and doesn’t even demand extreme devotion; it’s for anyone who wants to live a more intentional life. In these blinks you’ll find out the optimal price to pay for a car; why investing all your savings in the stock market isn’t as dangerous as it sounds; and why FIRE doesn’t have to mean cutting out your Christmas shopping. Most people work until their mid-sixties. They see it as the normal thing to do, because without the security of a full pension, early retirement may be an inconceivable notion. But when you take a look at what people are working for, something doesn’t add up. Whereas consumer culture demands that people overwork themselves for unnecessary luxuries, FIRE advocates a frugal lifestyle, freeing up valuable time for focusing on the important things in life. In 2016, the author, Scott Rieckens, took a job as a creative director to bolster his family’s “perfect” beachtown lifestyle in Coronado, California. At the same time, he and his wife Taylor felt they needed luxuries like their expensive Vitamix blender or eating out on a nightly basis. With a combined annual income of $142,000 after taxes, the couple felt that they were doing well enough financially that they could afford these luxuries. And besides, weren’t they contributing to their 401k retirement accounts all the while as well? However, there were other major expenses looming in their future. The couple wanted to buy a house and start saving for their newborn daughter’s college fund. As the author realized how insufficient their $10,000 in annual savings really was, he began to despair. Would he have to stick to his new salaried position for the rest of his career just to afford these necessities? This would also mean foregoing his entrepreneurial dreams. With no plan, he and his wife would need a big break if they wanted to change their situation. Driving to work one February morning in 2017, Rieckens heard an interview with Mr. Money Mustache on his favorite podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show. Mr. Money Mustache, a Canadian blogger whose real name is Pete Adeney, retired near Boulder, Colorado when he was just thirty. Since then, he has developed a cult following of people looking to make financially savvy lifestyle choices so they too could retire decades early. These “Mustachians” are part of a growing movement called FIRE, which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. Using a simple online retirement calculator, Scott Rieckens found that if he and his wife cut their expenses in half and invested their savings, they would actually be able to retire in just 10 years. That day, he realized that he didn’t need a big break; he needed to change his lifestyle. You might now be thinking that retiring early will be boring. But in fact, most people who achieve financial independence through FIRE aren’t actually “retiring” in the traditional sense of the word. Financial independence means having enough wealth that you no longer need to work to cover your expenses. But FIRE can make all kinds of flexible career choices possible. For example, in 2005, Sylvia had just finished law school and landed a job at a law firm in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. In the wake of the flood, Sylvia got rid of any possessions that wouldn't fit in her car and prepared to start again somewhere else. Her spending habits were already reasonable by normal standards, but the experience made her aware of how quickly material possessions could disappear. As a result, she was motivated to adopt a frugal lifestyle; she reduced her grocery expenses to $50 a month and worked as a delivery driver on the weekends to supplement her income as a lawyer. Once she was free of her student loan, she continued these habits even as her salary grew. Now Sylvia is 38 years old and six years into financial independence. But she hasn’t stopped working; instead, FIRE has given her the freedom to take a chance on starting her own law firm. Other people have used FIRE to travel, do charity work or pursue their creative passions. At the end of the day, what you do with your financial independence is up to you. But, you may now be wondering, how much money does this actually require? Let’s take a look at the math. According to the FIRE Formula, you can reach financial independence by saving and investing in total twenty-five times your annual expenses. The Rieckenses thought they could cut their expenses down to $60,000 a year, meaning that they would need to save $1.5 million in order to retire. If they invested their savings, they could expect at least a five percent rate of return, earning them $75,000 per year. And according to a study by Trinity University, they could even survive market slumps and inflation by following the “4 percent rule.” By withdrawing a maximum of four percent of their $1.5 million each year – the $60,000 they had budgeted for their expenses – they could build up a buffer by saving the extra one percent of returns left over. This way, in the long run, their principal of $1.5 million should not dwindle. In other words, they could live off of those savings for eternity! Now all the author had to figure out was how to cut down his family’s spending to the projected $60,000 per year. As we’ve seen, the math behind financial independence is simple: you just need to trim your expenses and build up enough assets to be able to live off the returns. Now it’s time to break down your finances. The first step is to track where every dollar of your money is currently going. Figure out how much you spent and saved in the past year, and then you can start making adjustments. The general goal in FIRE is saving and investing around 50 to 70 percent of your income. If this seems daunting, an easy way to reduce your spending and save more of your income is to first focus on the largest expense categories: housing, transportation, and food. Five weeks after Scott and Taylor made the decision to pursue FIRE together, they set off for a year of travel. In addition to staying with their parents to save money, the idea was to find a more affordable city in which to settle. And in Bend, Oregon, with its plethora of outdoor activities, highly rated school districts, and three-bedroom houses around the $350,000 price mark, they immediately felt that they had found their new home. Then came the transportation question. Since Scott planned to cycle to work, they decided they only needed one car. But what kind of car is FIRE friendly? Brandon, the blogger behind the FIRE blog Mad Fientist, advised the couple that while a leased car has a depreciating value, a reliable, used car in the $5,000 price range could last a decade without substantial depreciation in value. However, finding a suitable $5,000 car proved challenging, since they needed an all-wheel-drive for the mountainous turf around their new home. In the end, they compromised and purchased a used AWD Honda CRV for $7,500. Then it was time to make the most of their savings. When the Rieckenses started pursuing FIRE, they were new to investing. They didn’t feel comfortable investing everything they had into the stock market, so they split their savings among three things: low-cost index funds, real estate, and entrepreneurial projects. Low-cost index funds use algorithms to buy up stocks across the market. Since the value of the overall stock market usually increases at a pace of around ten percent per year, investments into index funds should behave roughly accordingly. Index funds are dirt cheap, which is great because you don’t want fund management fees eating up your returns. What’s more, they are generally considered to be one of the most profitable approaches to investing – just ask business magnate Warren Buffett, who recommends them as a more profitable alternative to paying a money manager. If the inevitable fluctuations of the stock market make you nervous, you can always adjust your savings goals and withdrawal rate to something you’re more comfortable with. In practice, this means either working longer before retiring or reducing your expenses further. Now that you’ve caught FIRE, so to speak, you’ll naturally want your friends and loved ones to share your enthusiasm. That’s especially important if you’re asking a partner to commit to this new lifestyle with you. If you aren’t sure whether your partner will be receptive to FIRE, try having him or her complete the author’s “Ten Things Exercise.” For weeks after the author discovered FIRE, he delayed bringing up the topic with his wife Taylor; he was afraid that she would think it was just another one of his short-lived entrepreneurial obsessions. Also, he recognized that she was the bigger breadwinner in their home; suggesting that she should forgo the luxuries she chose to spend her money on could have easily ended in a fight. One day, he suggested that she write down the ten things that made her happiest on a weekly basis. To his delight, he found that her list was uncannily similar to his own, which he had drawn up earlier. And while they had both noted down things like spending time with their daughter and being active outdoors, neither list included the beach life into which they had invested so much money. Now, when the author told Taylor about his obsession with FIRE, he had her attention, because it was clear that their current spending pattern did not reflect their values. When it comes to sharing your plans with friends, however, you might want to avoid being too dogmatic or preachy. Though your friends might benefit from your new financial insight, FIRE can often be a lot for people to swallow. Instead, a better bet to find people who are similarly inspired and will join you on your journey is to get involved with the FIRE community. Around the time they set off traveling, Scott’s idea for a FIRE documentary began to garner attention. He received an email from Travis Shakespeare, a senior vice president at BBC Worldwide and FIRE convert who was interested in directing the project. Within weeks, a crew had been assembled to follow Scott and Taylor on their journey. Thanks to the making of the FIRE documentary, Scott and Taylor met many of the leading voices in the FIRE community, including Mr. Money Mustache and hundreds of others practicing the FIRE lifestyle. Approaching a four-day Camp Mustache retreat where the crew was set to film, Taylor expected a cult-like atmosphere. Instead, she found a diverse group of people with whom she felt at home. As we’ll see in the next blink, enthusiasm for FIRE is determined by a set of shared values that attract a diverse range of people. If you don’t have a six-digit salary, you might be wondering if FIRE is just a trend for wealthy people. After all, how are you going to save twenty-five times your annual expenses if you don’t earn very much in the first place? While it might get you to financial independence more quickly, a higher income is by no means necessary to practice FIRE. Take Kalen, a 26-year-old management analyst from Evans, Colorado. She was starting to experience what some have called “millennial depression,” as the prospect of working until her mid-sixties made her feel tied down and unsatisfied. Around the same time, Kalen became interested in investing. Her boyfriend Kyle’s mother recommended a few FIRE blogs as a starting point, and the rest is history. With a combined income of under $50,000, Kalen and Kyle have been practicing the FIRE lifestyle since 2016. With their annual expenses reduced to $32,000, they are now set to reach financial independence in six years. But they aren’t just pursuing FIRE to retire early. Whether you achieve financial independence in five or thirty years, the heart of FIRE is valuing happiness over materialism. That’s a choice available to everyone– regardless of your income bracket. Another big stumbling block for many when it comes to FIRE is how extreme it sounds. Though some FIRE converts do go to extreme lengths to save money, your approach to FIRE can and should be flexible. The author and his wife learned this the hard way while they were staying with Scott’s parents in Iowa. When December rolled around, they realized to their horror that they hadn’t budgeted for Christmas. Spending their usual $1,500 on the holiday clearly wasn’t an option. But scrambling to turn what was left of their $150 “shopping budget” into presents for the whole family was futile. Suddenly, their new frugal lifestyle was feeling like a frustrating burden – but FIRE is about making choices that afford long-term happiness. They didn’t have to wait for financial independence to enjoy their lives! In the end, they found a FIRE-friendly way to solve the Christmas problem. They gave their toddler Jovie secondhand books, which she loved, and bought their nieces new presents so as not to ruin the celebrations with their new lifestyle. They also decided to forgo gifts for friends. By the time they settled in Bend, Scott and Taylor had cut their spending down to $60,000 and were nine years away from financial independence. But that Christmas in Iowa helped them realize they didn’t always need to be frugal; they just needed to be intentional in how their spending reflected their values. The key message in these blinks: Whether you decide to move your family to a cheaper town or just cut down on your trips to Starbucks, taking control of your finances with FIRE is an empowering move available to anyone. Though you can use aggressive savings and low-cost investments to retire in a relatively short span of time, FIRE is more broadly about aligning your consumption habits with your values to get the most out of life. Actionable advice: Join an online forum to discuss your finances.  For most people, finances are a taboo discussion topic. One survey by Wells Fargo even found that money ranked over death and politics as the number one most-challenging conversation topic. As a result, the path to FIRE can be an isolating experience with or without a partner. The FIRE community, on the other hand, champions collaboration and honesty. If you are unable to attend a FIRE conference in person, there are plenty of online forums that you can easily join anonymously. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: Unretirement, by Chris Farrell As you’ve just learned, early retirement is becoming more popular than ever before. But why is this only happening now? Well, a part of it has to do with how society’s views on work, community, and money are shifting. In Unretirement, Chris Farrell highlights how conventional early retirement is becoming a less and less viable option for most people. Alternatively, many older workers are going into “unretirement,” or forging themselves new careers that energize them and benefit the world at large.

For far too long, a woman was expected to quit her job when she was pregnant. If she was lucky, her employer might hire her back afterward. Thankfully, much has changed over the past few decades, and there’s one job market in particular that has been moving away from the traditional rules of the workplace: the New Economy. The New Economy is fueled by innovative tech companies like Facebook and Airbnb. And since they’re breaking many of the traditional rules of employment, it makes them a great place for women to work. This brings us to the author’s power UP movement, which is about empowering women to use the New Economy as a means to realizing their power and breaking down barriers that stand in the way of their goals. These blinks are full of tips on how to power UP. In these blinks, you’ll find how to use intrapreneurship to your advantage; how to overcome “mommy guilt”; and why a ten-year break from work is sometimes the perfect thing. The New Economy is a fast-moving field, since advancements and new innovations are being made all the time in the technology industry. If you hope to stay on track during all of the twists and turns that lay ahead, you need to keep a few core principles in mind. To begin with, it’s important not to get discouraged when mistakes are made, and instead use them as an opportunity to power UP. The author, Magdalena Yesil, made a mistake back in the early days of Apple. She rejected a job offer from Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak! Unfortunately, she had heeded the advice of her college advisor, who told her she shouldn’t take a job from a tech company that named itself after a fruit. Rather than just beating herself up, Yesil recognized the real cause of her mistake: she didn’t do the proper research before making the decision. Instead, she decided to power UP. From then on, she’d do her homework and make well-informed career decisions. Another core principle of powering UP is to stay humble, as this is key to being receptive to valuable feedback. During her first engineering job, Yesil designed a semiconductor chip. After her presentation on the chip’s logic functions in her first review meeting, her work was harshly criticized by her bosses. But, once again, Yesil saw an opportunity: this was a great chance to learn and understand each and every design flaw that needed fixing. During the meeting, she remained attentive and receptive to each piece of criticism. And because she was open, her colleagues were always honest with her about any ways in which she could improve. This brings us to the third principle: remain confident about each career decision. Making a career change can be a scary and emotional time. Changes often come with financial risks, but these are the burdens you must bear if you are to reach your long-term goals. Marc Benioff was an early collaborator of the author’s when she was working at Salesforce. But before they became colleagues, Benioff worked at Oracle, where he had a close friendship with his mentor and a secure and lucrative position. When Benioff joined Salesforce, he had an eight-thousand-square foot office space with just ten other employees. But he presented each of these employees, as well as Salesforce investors, with an attitude of confidence about his career decision. As it turned out, that decision wasn’t bad: Salesforce’s offices are now the tallest building west of the Mississippi. If you have an idea for a product or service that has potential to be the next big thing, you might be tempted to launch your own start-up right away. But there are a number of reasons why you might want to first work at an established company. First of all, you can benefit from the normal hours and steady paycheck. Start-ups are notoriously demanding of their few employees, often expecting 24-hour devotion while providing little in the way of resources. Additionally, if you’re looking for money to explore your innovative idea, you’ll likely have a much easier time getting it from your boss at a stable corporation than you would from a group of start-up investors. This concept of exploring new initiatives from within the confines of an existing business even has its own name: intrapreneurship. Debra Rossi is an experienced intrapreneur, despite working as the executive vice president of Wells Fargo, which is a 165-year-old bank and part of a tightly-controlled industry. Rossi is also the president of the Electronic Transactions Association, and she flexes her intrapreneurial muscles at Wells Fargo by deciding which innovative start-ups are allowed to use the bank’s credit-card processing. One day, a curious start-up landed on her desk. The company’s business plan involved auctioning off things like stuffed animals. It was called eBay. Rossi took a risk on eBay’s unusual business model and it paid off. The partnership ended up being a game changer in how electronic payments are handled on the internet. Working for an established company is also a great way to develop useful skills that will increase your chances of successfully launching your own company one day. Julie Wainwright worked as a brand manager for the cleaning-supply corporation Clorox before starting her web-based luxury consignment business, The RealReal. After three years at Clorox, Wainwright understood how to navigate between profit and loss, as well as the ins and outs of brand strategy and marketing management. But she didn’t stop there. After Clorox, she worked at Software Publishing Corporation, where she set up international distribution systems throughout Europe and learned more about writing business plans and delivering profitable results. Wainwright believes that by working for these two companies, she got the hands-on business skills she needed to launch her own successful company. So even if you’re itching to start your own company, there’s a good chance you still have a lot to learn. If you consistently deliver stellar work, you could easily sit back and think that it’s just a matter of time before your boss will offer you a promotion or a raise. However, with a passive approach like this, you might be waiting a long time. Unfortunately, excellent work doesn’t always speak for itself, so unless your boss is a micromanager, there’s a good chance you’ll need to make a case for yourself and point out all the great results you’ve been getting. While it may not come easily to you, if you want to rise in the ranks, you must take ownership of your work. The author interviewed a female executive at a tech company who was shocked when she found out she was being passed up for the new head-of-product position. She took pride in her ability to build highly productive teams by firing those who didn’t meet expectations and seamlessly introducing new talent. However, there were no concrete metrics in place to measure management skills like hers, so she had to personally show her bosses how her firing and hiring directly related to the company’s productivity gains and savings. By making sure her work was recognized, she was ultimately awarded the new position, which earned her a rightful spot among senior management. So, if you want that raise, it’s up to you to make sure your performance is measured by metrics your boss will notice. This means compiling evidence that clearly shows how you’re contributing unique value to the organization. A great way to do this is to ask your colleagues to email you after each presentation or meeting, offering feedback on your effectiveness. By having written testimonials, documented in the form of emails, you’ll have a clear record of your performance, how it’s progressed over time and how your achievements add value to the company. These testimonials should allow you to have an increased sense of confidence the next time you’re negotiating for a raise. If your boss says, “I don’t know, your presentations haven’t been so good lately,” you can point to your emails and say, “As a matter of fact, Bob said that my time management of the staff meeting in December was better than ever.” Now that you know how to get the credit you deserve, in the next blink we’ll look at how to navigate career bumps. Are you tired of those awkward and unpleasant comments from Joe in accounting? Then a boost in gravitas can help you out. Having gravitas is all about acting in a serious and dignified manner. And it’s the best way to handle an undesirable situation, such as inappropriate sexual comments in the workplace. Gravitas starts with body language – with having a strong, upright and confident posture, and making eye contact with the person you’re talking to. Clothing also plays a big role in providing gravitas, so be sure to wear the items that provide you with a sense of power and control. For Steve Jobs, it was a black turtleneck shirt; for you, it might be a perfectly tailored blazer. When you have gravitas, it can help you deal with verbal sexual harassment. Generally speaking, you can confidently confront the harasser in one of three ways: You can question them by asking, “What do you mean by that comment?” Or, you could set clear boundaries and say, “I’m uncomfortable with your comment and I hope you’ll respect that.” Otherwise, you can use humor and say, “It sounds like someone is asking for a meeting with the head of HR.” In these situations, you should recognize that It’s better to be the “bitch” than the martyr. The sad fact is that when women put their best foot forward to get ahead in their career, they’re often seen as “bitchy.” According to Stanford University’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research, women are more likely to be penalized when they exhibit the same direct and assertive traits for which men are rewarded or even promoted. In the late nineties, Lara Druyan faced this double standard when she was the only woman speaking to a group of colleagues and managers at her company, Silicon Graphics. It was obvious from the moment she stepped up to speak; the audience stopped paying attention. This forced her to make a difficult decision. She knew that by being assertive and complaining about the disrespect, she ran the risk of being labeled a “bitch.” But she also knew that standing up for herself was the right choice, so she asked that the crowd give her the same respect that the other speakers received. Gravitas will come in useful throughout your professional career, since it works to ensure that others hear you loud and clear. We all know Facebook’s prime position as an international social network, but these days it can be used for far more than seeing what your old high school crush is up to. In fact, it’s also a tool that can help you generate a strong personal network that taps into the power of other women. Such a network can provide both professional and emotional support, and it can help you navigate the unique, gender-specific challenges that women face, like working through pregnancy and motherhood. Heidi Zak is the founder of the online bra company, ThirdLove. She first met her close friend and mentor, Lisa, at an investment bank she worked for when she was just out of college. Since then, Lisa has been her go-to source for advice on every major career decision – from leaving Google to starting ThirdLove to having her first child just as the new business got started. Years later, Zak repaid the kindness by writing Lisa a recommendation letter when she was applying to be a finance professor. She was also in a good position to give Lisa negotiation tips when she was offered a job with a start-up. But that doesn’t mean men should be excluded from your network! It’s a great idea to cultivate an honest friendship with a male peer. As an ally, he can lessen the feeling of being an outsider in a male-dominated workplace. One programmer, who was the only female on her team, told the author how she would always leave the office before her teammates began their after-hours drinking sessions. It was one of the reasons why she never felt as though she truly belonged. But if she’d had at least one male ally in the group, she probably would’ve felt more comfortable sticking around and having a beer. According to Catalyst, a research and advisory organization, 35 percent of professional women seek out a female mentor, while only 9 percent reach out to a male mentor – even though there are more men in senior positions. Due to our patriarchal society, the men often have the money and leverage needed to open doors, so it’s wise to keep them in your network. Either way, having close friends at the office, regardless of their gender, is a proven way to keep you passionate and engaged in your work. Do you, or someone you know, suffer from a case of “mommy guilt?” If you’re not sure, the symptoms include an inadequate work–life balance, with a lack of quality family time and too much time spent at work. If this sounds all too familiar, fear not. There is a remedy. One of the best ways to rid yourself of mommy guilt is to feel empowered in your career. When this happens, you’ll feel the positive effects at home, including a better sense that you’re a good role model. The author recalls that, throughout her childhood, her mother Selma would complain bitterly about how she had to sacrifice a promising career in medicine in order to raise her children. At the age of 63, Selma was transformed when she got her first job working as a barista in a Whole Foods Market. Thanks to the paycheck, and a feeling that she excelled in her position, she finally got that boost in self-esteem that comes from hard work. Even her grandchildren were inspired by Selma’s efforts and began looking up to her as a role model. However, contrary to what Selma once believed, having a family doesn’t mean your career has to take a hit. These days, thanks to parental leave, you can remain empowered at work even if you’re taking time off. And there are some tips to keep in mind to ensure this happens. Before you leave, work out all the details concerning which of your colleagues will be covering each of your responsibilities. Share this plan with your boss, along with your expected return date. You can also plan on remaining an active part of the team even if you’re not in the office. In fact, if you decide to work during your maternity leave, you could set yourself a few measurable performance goals during this period so that you can still feel good about being productive at work. Your self-esteem could also benefit from demonstrating how committed you are, even if you’re at home. So go ahead and show your boss that you can turn around assignments and answer emails quicker than ever if that fits with what you want to do. It’s also a good idea to keep in touch with at least one colleague so that you remain in the loop on any office politics or gossip that you may have missed out on. Is your mommy guilt reducing? Good. Rest assured that with some preplanning and a little flexibility you can remain at the top of your career and still enjoy parenthood. If you’ve been fired, or if you decide to quit your job, the first piece of advice is to remain calm. Take some deep breaths and remind yourself that this isn’t the end of the world – or even the end of your career! If you do decide to quit your job, this decision should be made in an effort to better your career and provide yourself with the opportunity to power UP in the future. It should never be a purely emotional reaction. If you’re trying to determine whether or not quitting is the right move, ask some close friends and colleagues for their opinion to get some alternative perspectives. No matter what, you should always strive to make big career decisions with a mind that is unclouded by raw emotions. If you’re experiencing a sexist work environment or dealing with an unexpected medical issue, you may be dealing with levels of anger or fear that are preventing you from seeing an actionable way of correcting the situation that doesn’t involve quitting. Ideally, when you quit, it should allow you to pivot to another great opportunity – like leaving an unsatisfying job to pursue your true passion. It shouldn’t be used as a way to escape a toxic environment, since your employer should be able to resolve such issues. Whether you quit or you lose your job, you should use this break from work as an opportunity to recharge. Remember Julie Wainwright from the consignment business The RealReal? Back in 2000, she found herself unemployed and in desperate need of recharging. Her company Pets.com had gone bust and become the laughing-stock of the industry. As if that wasn’t enough, she was also going through a painful divorce and several broken friendships. Wainwright didn’t try to quickly rebound from these psychological and professional disasters; instead, she took ten years to recharge. This involved returning to old hobbies like painting and drawing, which helped her regain some much needed self-confidence. The break also allowed her to find the inspiration for The RealReal. While out shopping with a friend, it dawned on her: she could build an online consignment shop that verified the designer goods from every vendor. It was perfect! Recharging is also an opportunity to get up to speed with the latest developments in the industry or to strengthen your network by meeting up with your most important connections. Most of all, it’s time to give yourself the clarity and space to connect with yourself and figure out your next move. Creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace is often easier said than done, but it’s always worth the effort, since it benefits the entire company. In fact, according to the Journal of Economic & Management Strategy, gender-diverse workforces earn 41 percent more revenue than gender-homogeneous ones. If you’re looking for a job, keep in mind that the interview process is the perfect time for you to find out how well you’ll fit in with a company’s culture, as well as how high your chances for advancement will be. Ask questions like, “How many women are in senior management positions?,” “What are your policies on parental leave?,” “How does the company assess performance?,” And how do you ensure people’s ideas are heard?” If you’re still unsure, you could also reach out to some women in the company to gauge their personal experiences. When GoDaddy’s chief product officer, Steven Aldrich, partnered with Stanford University’s Clayman Institute to study the employee-evaluation process, they found that the specific criteria for these evaluations makes a big difference. When businesses used criteria that didn’t explicitly reward the positive behaviors found in a gender-neutral environment, women were generally chastised more often for being “aggressive” in their communication. But after eighteen months of using criteria that was explicit, businesses routinely saw a narrowing of the pay gap between women and men. If you’re in a leadership position, here are some tips for how to create the diverse workforce you want to see. First of all, broaden your search. A good way to do this is to use recruitment networks that also reach women and minorities, like Power to Fly or Jopwell. If you’re looking at a series of candidates, don’t hire anyone until you’ve interviewed at least one qualified woman. Another tip is to train less qualified but more diverse candidates to become the talent you need. Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods, wanted to hire more female engineers, but they were unable to find any that had the experience they needed. But instead of giving up, they established a three-month training course called the Hacker School. After two sessions, Etsy was able to increase the number of female engineers by 18 percent. Nevertheless, you should always hire qualified talent. If you pass over great hires just to fill a quota, you’ll only be causing the employees you hire to wonder whether they really earned their job. It’s also important to remember that the standards you implement should give everyone the chance to excel. Whether you’re an employee, executive or an equal rights activist, every voice contributes to changing how the industry operates. The power UP movement is much bigger than any one person. The key message in these blinks: Breaking glass ceilings in the tech industry, or the New Economy at large, comes with its own set of challenges for women. But you should never look at these challenges as roadblocks that limit your potential. Powering UP is about staying confident during adversity, making sure your voice is heard and creating space for yourself where none is given. Since the New Economy doesn’t play by traditional rules, it’s filled with opportunities for you to embrace your individuality and find your own success. Got feedback?

Kiyosaki","summary":"Which sounds better: being financially comfortable or being rich? Deep down, most people want to be filthy rich – but they also tend to feel that the future is already decided for them, and that they’ll never actually be rich. But how rich you are or aren’t is up to you: if you make the decision to be rich, and adopt the mind-set of the rich, there’s no reason at all why you can’t achieve that goal. First, however, there are a few things you’ll need to learn, as there are no “get-rich-quick” schemes that actually work. In practice, becoming rich means investing in financial education and literacy until analyzing financial statements becomes second nature. It also means learning how to create and grow a business, and then using the experience and money you’ve accumulated to make more and better investments. The first step, though, is to get in the right frame of mind, and go from saying, “I’ll never be rich,” to “I’m going to be rich, and this is how!” In these blinks, you’ll learn that the rich don’t invest in the same things as the poor and middle classes; why it’s better to invest your pre-tax earnings than save your taxed income; and why “get an education, work hard, save money” is bad advice. Maybe you've heard of the 80-20 rule, which states that 80 percent of our success comes from 20 percent of our efforts? Well, that might be true for overall success – but for money, the rule is 90-10, because when it comes down to it, 10 percent of people have 90 percent of the money. The rule applies in many walks of life. Think about Hollywood stars, and then think how many actors are waiting tables between gigs. Yep, 10 percent of actors earn 90 percent of the money. The same goes for athletes, musicians and, of course, investors. A Wall Street Journal article confirmed this, noting that 10 percent of the population own 90 percent of all the shares in the United States. Why is it that rich people can accumulate so much wealth? Well, one reason is that some investments are simply off-limits if you’re poor. Back when he was a young man with little cash, the author asked his rich friends if he could get involved in their business deals. But, despite their friendship, the answer was always no – not because they didn't want to help him out, but because it would have been illegal. In the United States, the US Securities and Exchange Commission restricts certain investments to accredited investors – that is, people with a net worth of $1 million, or a consistent annual income of $200,000. Anyone who is worth, or makes, less than that simply isn't allowed to get involved. Now, there are good reasons for preventing people without much money in the bank from making potentially risky investments. But these rules also prevent poorer people from making the best investments – the investments of the rich. So how can you break into that top 10 percent? In the following blink, we'll find out what it takes to think like a rich person. “Get an education, work hard, save money. Then you’ll be fine.” Sound familiar? This sentence sums up the standard middle-class approach to financial security and, more likely than not, you were probably told something similar by your parents.   But here’s the thing: this advice will never make you rich. Rather, it will keep you in the 90 percent that only has 10 percent of the money. So how do the rich approach financial gain? They certainly don’t toil away at one job until retirement; instead, they purchase businesses and make investments. Why is that? Well, for starters, because employees inevitably have less money to invest; that’s just the way the US tax system is set up. For example, let’s say you want to save $1,000 from your salary. Well, first you have to pay tax, so in order to save that $1,000, you’ll have to earn, say, $1,300. Inflation will reduce your savings’ value every year, and you’ll pay tax on the interest you earn. Doesn’t sound like a recipe for wealth, does it? Business owners, on the other hand, have more money to invest because it comes out of their pre-tax earnings. Unlike the employee who has to save out of taxed income, a business owner first buys assets and then pays taxes. As such, an employee has less money to invest in assets that can generate wealth. It doesn’t sound fair, but it’s the way the system works – it’s hard for an employee to become rich because she gives so much money to the government first. And there’s another reason why business ownership and investment are better paths to riches: investors often face less risk than employees. Lots of people rely on employment, savings and pensions for their financial security. But the old notion of a stable job for life just doesn’t apply in today’s job market. Employees get fired all the time. What happens to a company’s share price when it lets lots of employees go? Very often, it goes up! So being on the investor’s side of the table is usually less risky than being on the employee’s. Can you explain the difference between assets and liabilities? Or calculate a company’s price-to-equity and debt-to-equity ratios? Many people shy away from investing because the terminology sounds like a foreign language. If you want to get into that 10 percent, however, it’s time to invest in your financial education. First off, it’s important to understand the difference between assets and liabilities. Rich people never confuse the two, but others mix them up all the time. And that’s one of the reasons rich people tend to make better financial decisions. Let’s take a common example. You’ve probably heard a homeowner say something like, “My home is a great asset.” Sounds sensible enough, right? But, usually, it’s downright wrong. Something is only an asset when it generates positive cash flow – that is, when it brings in money. Say your house is worth $200,000, with a $150,000 mortgage. Where does the cash flow? Not in, but out, through your mortgage, fees, insurance and so on. Sure, maybe one day you’ll sell it for a tidy profit – but you have no guarantees, so it’s actually a liability.   Understanding assets and liabilities is a great first step. But to successfully make the investments of the rich – to develop real estate or buy into a business – you need to have a deep understanding of financial terminology. Let’s say you want to buy shares in a growing tech business, and you want to understand whether it’s a good deal. How can you figure it out? Well, the share price tells you little, so to really understand value, you’ll need to calculate and analyze measures like debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity, cash-on-cash return and financial leverage.  All in all, if you don’t even know that your mortgaged house is a liability, not an asset, it’s no surprise that you might think the investments of the rich are too risky. Anything seems risky if you can’t understand it. So spend time developing your financial education – it may be the best investment you ever make. When we think of investors, we often imagine besuited Wall Street bankers, or bustling men shouting on a trading floor. But the word “investor” can be applied to a range of people, from bond traders to business founders. The taxonomy of investors begins with accredited and qualified investors. These two are outsiders. We’ve already met the accredited investor: someone with a high salary or established wealth who meets the legal requirements for the widest possible choice of investments. Qualified investors are just as wealthy as accredited investors, but they’re also financially educated. They’re equipped to analyze a business’s financials, or the reasons behind market movements. But both are always on the outside. Sure, they may buy shares and prosper that way, but they have little control over their assets. In contrast, an inside investor creates assets instead of buying them. The inside investor builds her own business, be it a real estate agency, a tech start-up or something else entirely. That business can become a valuable asset, and she can use it to generate income, or eventually sell it. To truly be the top dog – a sophisticated investor – the inside investor has to use the experience of building her own business to learn how to analyze other companies from the outside.   The sophisticated investor knows how to make tax and the law work to her advantage. We’ll take a look at how in the final blink.   But first, let’s look at how you can become an insider and start accessing the investment opportunities of the rich. It’s time to get down to business. Many people think, “I could never start my own business.” But just 120 years ago, 85 percent of Americans were independent farmers or small shopkeepers. In other words, the vast majority of Americans were businesspeople – and you can be one, too. Anyone can start a business and become rich. If you want to become an accredited or qualified investor, you already need to be wealthy. But starting a business only requires a bit of creativity.   The author is a case in point. As a child, he created his first business from nothing. He saw that a local store was discarding old comic books and persuaded them to let him take the discards. He then opened a profitable comic library, charging school friends a 10-cent membership fee. From nothing but a good idea, he built an asset. One reason many people hold back is time and money. You’ve got to pay the bills, so you don’t want to give up your job, right? How the heck are you going to find the time to start a business? But it’s entirely possible to start a business part-time, and some of the world’s finest business leaders did just that. Michael Dell started Dell Computers by working part-time in his university dorm room, and eventually got so rich that he decided to drop out. Jeff Bezos started Amazon part-time, working out of a garage, and today his company is worth over $500 billion. Imagine if he hadn’t had the courage to start things up in his spare time. Once you have a business, you have options. You can reinvest the cash it generates into other assets; you can grow the business and sell it; or you can take it public. All three can be routes to riches you’ll never experience as an employee.   All of us have the potential to start a business, but maybe we don’t know how. In the next blink, let’s take a look at the key principles for making a business work. Did you know that Bill Gates didn’t invent the software that made him the world’s richest man? He merely bought it from a group of programmers. He built a great business, not a great product – and that was the key to his success. Building a business is a matter of mastering three things.   First, a business needs a spiritual mission to guide it. Henry Ford embodied this. His mission wasn’t to make money, though that’s exactly what he did, and in vast quantities. Ford’s mission was to bring the car to the masses and “democratize the automobile.” He pursued this mission relentlessly and the riches followed. Finding a guiding spiritual mission, one that aligns with your financial goals, will help keep you on the right track. Second, every leader needs a team. Maybe you’re an accountant, an insurer or a lawyer. But you are unlikely to be all three, and all are important if you want a successful business. A common factor among rich business leaders is the knowledge that money spent on their team is an investment – one that will almost certainly make them richer. Third, every team needs a leader. Anyone who, like the author, served in the military, knows that troops won’t follow a poor leader. Leadership is a skill unto itself. It’s not simply about being the best; rather, it’s about bringing out the best in other people. How can you acquire leadership skills? One great way is to volunteer. In many groups, no one wants the responsibility of leading. So, whether at work, at a religious institution or in your community, speak up and volunteer to lead – it’s a great way to get feedback and learn where you can improve. There is one more personal skill that is essential if you want to succeed in business, and we’ll take a look at it in the next blink. Raising capital, advertising, negotiating, motivating your team and making sales – what do all these aspects of business life have in common? All are crucial for success, and all require top-notch communication skills. So how can you become a better communicator? Well, investing time in a sales-training program is a proven approach. Good places to look are network-marketing organizations, as they often have great programs. Joining and sticking with one for at least five years can work wonders. Shy people, scared of failure, come out the other end with the two key skills of a salesperson: the ability to communicate the value of a product with ease, and fearlessness in the face of rejection. Master these two qualities and you will likely be a powerful communicator. This trait will shine through, not just when you’re selling your product or service, but when you have to deal with an investor, negotiate better terms or rouse your team. If you’re serious about being a top communicator, don’t just think about your words; your physical appearance is just as, if not more, important.   Studies of public speakers show that 55 percent of their impact comes from body language, 35 percent from how they speak and just 10 percent from their words. If you think about the business leaders you know, they probably all look the part, right? And this can go a long way indeed. A banking friend of the author once told him that his bank had just brought in a new president because of his appearance. The new appointee simply looked and spoke like the president of a bank should. The board would run the bank, but the president’s outward appearance would generate new customers. Learning to communicate and look the part will pay off in lots of ways. Just like improving your financial literacy, it’s an investment worth making. So you’ve started a business, and it’s going well. Now it’s time to use the income and the experience you’ve accumulated and take things to the next level. It’s time to become a sophisticated investor.   As a sophisticated investor, you’ll take more control over management, corporate structure, investment decision making and taxes. The result? Maximized returns. Let’s look at a restaurant owned by Bill and Jane, two hard-working Americans. They operate as a sole proprietorship, which means that they have one income source. They pay normal, personal income tax and they are liable if anything goes wrong – like a sick customer filing a lawsuit. All their eggs are in one basket. No disrespect to Bill and Jane, but the sophisticated investor knows better. He would have two corporations: Bill would own the restaurant itself and Jane would own the building it’s in. This way, risk is spread. If a customer falls sick and sues the restaurant, the real estate is legally separate and protected. Meanwhile, under this corporate structure, expenses like health insurance and legal fees are allocated as business expenses and paid pre-tax. Tax itself is paid at lower, corporate rates – less risk, less tax, more financial return. Whatever you want to invest in, as a sophisticated investor, you know how to make your money work for you. An average person’s plan for retirement might consist of squirreling away $15,000 a year in a 401k plan and hoping for an 8-percent return. The sophisticated investor is more likely to invest in real estate, some stocks and shares and a business venture. With the experience brought by building a business, and by investing in his financial literacy and education, he can make the investment decisions of the rich: spotting the best opportunities, understanding what’s really risky and what isn’t. The average approach sees you work for your money. The second approach sees your money work for you. Don’t be average. The key message in these blinks If you want to be rich, you must think and act like a rich investor does. That means focusing on building a business and investing in assets, not focusing on employment and savings. In doing so, you can build and control an investment portfolio that generates income and grows your wealth.  Actionable advice: Decide whether you want to be secure, comfortable or rich.  Take some time to truly reflect on what your priority is: to be secure, to be comfortable or to be rich. One is not better than the other, but they represent very different choices and outcomes. Talk to your partner or family, and sketch out pros and cons. Being certain in your decision to prioritize becoming rich will give you the mind-set you need.

Kiyosaki","summary":"When the financial crisis hit in 2007–2008, a bewildered public struggled to come to grips with what had just happened. This was an extreme situation, no doubt, but when it comes to economics in general and how to become rich in particular, many of us still labor under a number of misconceptions. For instance, most people still think the way to get rich is to get a degree, find a good job and work hard. As these blinks will show you, nothing could be further from the truth. Not even a well-paid job will make you rich. Our current financial system is simply not set up that way. There is only one way to get truly wealthy: by owning and capitalizing on assets. But how do you do it? These blinks will show you. In these blinks, you’ll learn how banks create money; why getting a well-paid job won’t make you rich; and why you weren’t taught finances in school. The phrase “The poor get poorer and the rich get richer” might sound like something from a cowboy film but in the United States it’s never been more true. Regular people are robbed of their wealth because the system is based on inflation. Inflation is certainly bad for the average person – it means the money they’ve worked hard to earn is suddenly less valuable. To make matters worse, inflation encourages people to put more of their money into their savings, but that’s actually another cause of inflation. Here’s why. When you deposit your savings into a bank, the bank then lends your money out to debtors. However, banks lend out much more than they receive in deposits. Prior to the crash of 2007, banks had a lending limit of $34, meaning they could only lend out $34 for every dollar they actually had. But that increase in the money supply causes inflation, making your one dollar worth much less. This sort of wild lending periodically results in financial bubbles, which the monetary system then answers with bailouts. Bailout money is taken from taxpayers, meaning bailouts are actually built into the system. That’s another way the current monetary system creates poverty. However, bailouts and a system of inflation are only harmful to the people who work for a paycheck: employees, freelancers, small businesses and specialists. These are the groups that pay the highest taxes and tend to keep their savings in the bank. This is why the middle class is shrinking so quickly. In 1970, 50.3 percent of Americans earned a middle class income, but by 2010, that figure had decreased to 42.2 percent. There are a number of different views of wealth but one thing is certain: everyone wants to be wealthy. Unfortunately, schools teach people how to be poor instead. Modern education is designed to turn people into employees, taxpayers and consumers. People often assume that education is the solution to poverty: if you study harder, you’ll get a better job and earn more. Unfortunately things aren’t that simple. You can have three master’s degrees and still be unemployed and poor. There’s certainly nothing wrong with being a hard-working, taxpaying consumer, but that alone won’t make you rich. Schools don’t actually prepare students to make money in the world – schools don’t offer any sort of financial education. This leaves many defenseless against financial crises. For example, most people think the 2007 crisis was a stock market crash but it was actually a derivatives market crash. Derivatives are the complex and risky insurance policies that made up a massive part of the market at the time. If the population had better financial education, they might’ve known the increase in the derivatives market between 2000 and 2007 presented big risks and would eventually cause the crash. And they’d be better equipped to face similar problems in the future. The lack of education also leads to misconceptions about money and wealth. Many people mistakenly assume that wealthy people are evil and purposefully make others poor. In some cases there’s truth to that, but not always. Some people become wealthy precisely because they’re generous. John D. Rockefeller was one example. He became rich by selling gas at cheaper prices than any of his competitors, which also made life much easier for millions of working-class people who didn’t have access to gas before. When people say you need to be educated to be wealthy, they usually mean you need to go to university and get a degree. What you actually need is financial education. Schools don’t teach financial education because it’s too powerful. Financial education means looking beyond traditional explanations and gaining the knowledge necessary to create more assets – and it has the power to make you wealthy. In the past, slaves weren’t allowed to read and write, because it would’ve given them too much power over their owners. These days, most people are deprived of financial education for the same reason. Real wealth isn’t about getting a big paycheck – that’s another misconception. It’s about having assets that put money into your pocket without you having to work for them. You need education to know how to create them. If you buy an old house, then repair it and start renting it out, you’ll have created an asset. You’ll get rent from the tenants without having to work for it. Moreover, the government rewards assets with lower tax rates, so that’ll increase the wealth you bring in. People who haven’t been educated on finance think in terms of income and expenses instead. That’s why they often mistake liabilities for assets. Many people see their own house as an asset, for instance. It’s actually a liability because it takes away your money through mortgage payments and taxes. You might think it’s easy to determine whether someone is rich or poor but it’s actually not that simple. You can still be poor even if you live in a nice house and drive an expensive car. If you want to change your financial situation, you first need to know where you stand. You need an income statement, where you write down your income and expenses, and a balance sheet where you keep track of your assets and liabilities. For example, imagine you have a job that pays $10,000 per month and an apartment you rent out for $1,000 per month. You also pay $2,000 in mortgage payments every month and lease a Ferrari for $1,000 per month. Most people would assume that all of those things are assets, but actually, the sole asset is the apartment. The other things cost you money or require you to work for them. The best way to plan for the future is to choose between the four asset classes. After you’ve assessed your financial situation, it’s time to focus on acquiring new assets – even if you don’t know how yet! The four asset classes are business, real estate, paper and commodities. Choose the one you’re most interested in – it makes a difference when you’re working with something you care about. The author, for instance, is most interested in commodities and real estate because he genuinely likes gold, silver, oil and historic buildings. His interest also motivates him to study his assets and hold onto them instead of selling when prices rise. Acquiring assets is the first step toward your new, wealthier future. In the following blinks we’ll look at how you set about it. As we’ve seen, having a degree doesn’t necessarily make you wealthier. Financial education is the key to success, but where do you actually start studying? First, you need to figure out what kind of future you want for yourself. Remember: being wealthy isn’t the most important thing in life. Some people are much happier working a nine-to-five job for their entire life than tackling a high-powered career. If you do want to be wealthy, however, a nine-to-five job won’t get you there. So think about the future that suits you best, then aim for it. If you’re looking to be wealthy and financially independent, you have to let go of your employee mentality and get into big business or professional investing. And you can’t succeed in big business or professional investing without the right education for it. You need the skills of an entrepreneur. One of the key differences between entrepreneurs and those who are self-employed is that entrepreneurs are generalists, meaning they know a little about a wide range of topics and hire specialists to deal with the rest. That’s because when entrepreneurs start a business, they’re responsible for every part of it: from developing the product to leading the team. So don’t specialize in a single field if you want to be an entrepreneur. Learn a bit about all the things that make a business work, like team building, leadership skills and company missions, for instance. Strive to cooperate instead of compete. The employee mentality makes people think they have to compete with their colleagues to get ahead, but that’s not the kind of thinking you want in your team. A skilled entrepreneur knows how to guide the group to success. One of the biggest differences between rich and poor people is their intelligence, but it’s not the kind of intelligence measured in school. You’re considered smart in school if you have a good memory and learn to read and write quickly, but in the real world, different skills help you get ahead. For entrepreneurs, intelligence is all about handling risks and financial losses, learning from mistakes and staying level-headed. Entrepreneurs build their businesses from the ground up using practical skills that are much more important than remembering who the 36th president was. So how do you acquire those skills? Well, you learn from a coach or a friend, or by taking a course from an expert. Then hone your skills by practicing them. Because above all, we learn when we do – it’s experience that stays in our memory, not information we’ve memorized for a written test. And doing often means taking the wrong turn, miscalculating or making errors – errors that we’ll never make again thanks to a bad experience. In school we’re punished for our mistakes; we’re made to believe that only stupid people make them. The truth is the exact opposite. However, you can’t learn by doing if you don’t have enough cash to start investing right away, so you need to simulate the experience through practice. Before the author first bought property, he spent time studying ads, visiting houses and talking to brokers. That’s the best way to learn the entrepreneurial skills you need to become financially successful. Most people follow simple rules regarding debt: work hard, stay out of debt and you’ll be OK. But as an entrepreneur, debt might be your new best friend. Debt can actually be a powerful tool for gaining leverage. Most people assume that if they work harder, they’ll earn more and become rich. In fact, the opposite often happens: they fall into a higher tax rate and earn even less. If you want to become wealthy, find ways to do more with less. Think about a musician who moves from only playing live shows to selling their CDs: they’re getting their music to more people by doing less work. Debt can help you in a similar way. In the finance world, it can be powerful because it allows you to do things you don’t otherwise have the savings to do. The author, for example, first got into real estate in the 1980s by purchasing a small apartment for $50,000. He paid a deposit of $5,000, and took out a loan with ten percent interest for the remaining $45,000. His monthly payments (including interest) were about $450, while rent in the area was around $750! So use debt to create assets for yourself. Traditional thinking says you should work hard, save money and buy assets without loans, but it doesn’t work like that. Most people can’t save enough to buy valuable assets – it makes much more sense to create them by taking out loans. The author had a friend who had a lot of success with this strategy. He went into debt so he could buy a 150-year-old church in Scotland, which he then turned into an exclusive housing complex. The building had been in ruins for years and people walked by it all the time. But he saw the opportunity to turn it into an asset – he made money for himself and provided people with interesting new homes. The key message in this book: The current monetary system robs the working class of their hard-earned wealth, and the education system keeps them from learning how to stop this happening. If you want to become wealthy, figure out what asset class works best for you, then research it and acquire your assets by going into debt. Steer yourself toward the future you want. Actionable advice: Expand your financial vocabulary. Start reading financial publications like the Wall Street Journal and look up the words you don’t know. If you learn two words per day, you’ll learn 60 in a month! Suggested further reading: Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki Rich Dad, Poor Dad combines autobiography with personal advice to outline the steps to becoming financially independent and wealthy. The author argues that what he teaches in this New York Times bestseller are things we’re never taught in society, and that what the upper-class passes on to its children is the necessary knowledge for getting (and staying) rich. He cites his highly successful career as an investor and his retirement at the early age of 47 as evidence in support of his claims. Got feedback?

Some might even say that she was the world’s first venture capitalist. The businessman in question? Christopher Columbus. The venture? To find a shorter route to India in order to save money and time in trading goods. And the risk of failure? Extremely high! Fast-forward to today’s world of venture-capital-backed start-ups. Failure may not result in death on the high seas, but the risk is still very high. In fact, nearly 90 percent of start-ups fail.  That’s where good venture capitalists, or VCs, come in. They provide capital in the form of money so that promising founders can bring their ideas to life. In return, the VCs receive an ownership stake in the company. In addition to providing funding, VCs advise founders on long-term decision-making, and how best to go about reaching strategic goals. For many in the start-up world, the inner workings of VCs are a bit of a mystery. Fortunately, the author, Scott Kupor, happens to work at one of the biggest names in VC. In these blinks, you’ll learn some of his insights into the life cycle of VC-backed companies. Along the way, you’ll discover what the Y Combinator is, and how it tipped the VC landscape in favor of entrepreneurs; why the author’s firm decided to invest in Airbnb; and how to prepare for your first VC pitch. Nearly half a century ago, in the early 1970s, Silicon Valley found itself host to a number of new businesses operating in the world of venture capital. For the next thirty years, a very small number of these companies held the vast majority of venture capital in Silicon Valley. This meant, of course, that a select few companies had a lot of power over which entrepreneurs received funding. But starting in the early 2000s, all this began to change. Two converging phenomena started coming together, transforming the nature of the VC-entrepreneur relationship. Firstly, rapid advances in technology meant that the amount of capital required to found a start-up began to decline. On one side, servers, networking and data center space were getting cheaper by the day; on the other, with the advent of cloud computing, start-ups no longer needed office space to store their data on-site, thus saving on rent. All of a sudden, founding a start-up was less reliant on VC backing than it had been in the past. The second development that transformed the VC-entrepreneur relationship was the founding of the Y Combinator, or YC, in 2005. The YC is a school that teaches entrepreneurs how to found companies and secure VC funding. Famous alumni include the founders of Airbnb and Dropbox. The YC helped a once-dispersed entrepreneurial community come together to share knowledge and, in doing so, also helped even the balance of power between VC firms and entrepreneurs. It was at this point that the author’s VC firm entered the scene. In 2009, investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz founded Andreessen Horowitz. Detecting a change in the Silicon Valley landscape, they realized that VCs needed to provide more than just capital to entrepreneurs. Sure, having CEOs with vision and good product-market fit was still as relevant as ever. But they might lack knowledge in other important areas like recruiting, marketing or sales. This is where VCs like Kupor enter the equation. At Andreessen Horowitz, it’s his job to advise CEOs, particularly by helping them build networks and relationships with both people and institutions. In doing so, Andreessen Horowitz has concocted a winning formula that’s churned out several huge companies, such as Pinterest, Slack and GitHub. Founders of early-stage companies often don’t even have a product to present to potential investors. Instead, a founder usually comes to pitch an idea to VC firms with, well, precisely that – just an idea. This means that VC firms have little actual data to look at when assessing whether to invest in early-stage start-ups. Instead, they have to rely more on qualitative analyses.  The first aspect of such an analysis is all about the people involved in the company. What are the backgrounds of the founders? What evidence does their pitch provide that they’ll be able to bring their idea to market effectively? And, in particular, what makes their story stand out from the potentially dozens of other founders who’ve had the same or a similar idea? One way VC firms evaluate such questions is by looking for a solid founder-market fit. This means that the founder, or founders, have unique experience that has given them particular insight into the potential product for which they are seeking backing. Take Airbnb, for instance. Its founders gained unique insight from hotels that became fully booked when big conventions came to their town. So they came up with an idea: Why not rent out a cheap place to sleep in our apartment to conference attendees? That way, the attendees would save money, and the founders would be able to pay their rent more easily. This story convinced Andreessen Horowitz, and the firm went on to back Airbnb. But while people are the cornerstone of any successful venture, the products they offer have to fill a gap in the market so that customers will purchase them. This usually depends on how revolutionary a product is. New products from small companies won’t gain momentum if they are only a tiny bit better than what’s already out there – the product has to represent a breakthrough in the market. Aside from people and product, market size is the final thing VC firms consider before backing early-stage companies. This is particularly important, as almost half of the early-stage companies that big VC firms invest in go on to fail. To make up for those failures, successful start-ups need lots of market room to expand continuously. Of course, assessing market size can be hard when potential markets haven’t been created yet. Airbnb, for instance, initially saw itself as helping only a small market – conference attendees. But Andreessen Horowitz saw beyond this; they saw an opportunity for Airbnb to expand into hotel markets and beyond. And this is exactly what happened. If you’ve ever had the chance to pitch a business idea to venture capitalists, then you know that it’s a pretty nerve-racking experience. Perhaps you’ve recently quit a steady job to pursue your entrepreneurial dreams, and your future livelihood might rely on whether the pitch goes well or not. Luckily, the author has heard thousands of pitches over the last ten years of working at Andreessen Horowitz, and he knows how to distinguish the good ones from the bad. In his experience, a good pitch can most easily be understood by contrasting it with a bad pitch, so let’s begin with the latter.  Often, founders will pitch an idea, and immediately afterward list a number of companies that might acquire them once their idea comes to market. But even though some may think that’s what VCs want to hear, it isn’t. VCs want to hear founders’ conquer-the-world strategy, even if that strategy only has a small chance of success. The question is not who might want to acquire the future company – what VCs want to know is what the world will look like once the founders have conquered it with their idea. Of course, once founders present their conquer-the-world strategy, they can expect VCs to put it to the test. During a pitch, potential investors will inevitably poke holes in founders’ strategies via a process that the author calls the idea maze. This is the part of the pitch in which entrepreneurs get quizzed on the origins of their idea, why they think it would make a good product, and what sorts of insights and market data they considered during the ideation process. At the end of the day, many founders will end up making a product different from the one they originally pitched, known in the VC industry as a pivot. So when asking their questions during the idea maze session, investors’ goal isn’t to determine whether the founder’s product will have a 100 percent likelihood of success; instead, it’s simply to test the founder’s thought processes and depth of understanding of the product and marketplace. Of course, this sort of pivot shouldn’t take place during the pitch itself! If the idea maze leads founders to change their whole pitch during a 60-minute meeting, that’s not a good sign – this rapid change of heart shows a lack of commitment to the conquer-the-world strategy that investors want to see radiating from founders. Having said that, it’s of course important that founders seem willing to listen to good advice and adapt their pitches accordingly. If you as a founder have been lucky enough to make a successful pitch to a VC firm, you’ll then begin the often arduous process of negotiating a term sheet. Essentially, a term sheet lays out all the rules, regulations and processes that both the VC firm and company have to abide by if the deal is to go through.  These stipulations can be pretty complicated and confusing – especially to founders, who tend to be much less familiar with term sheets than the VC firm with which they’re partnering. But term sheets can be simplified into two main components, which can make them much more comprehensible and thus level the playing field of knowledge between VCs and founders.    The first one gets into the nitty-gritty economic side of the agreement. This can include aspects such as the size of the investment, liquidation preferences or who gets to control various shares in the company. While the economic aspect of any term sheet negotiation is important in the short and medium term, it is the other aspect, governance, that has much greater ramifications in the long run. Governance is all about how the company’s board of directors goes about its business – and who gets to sit on the board in the first place. When negotiating a term sheet, deciding who gets a seat at the table is extremely important, as it’s the board that gets a say in how the company is run, who runs it and whether it should cease to exist – or be sold off. And, perhaps more important, the board chooses a company’s CEO. The author’s company usually presents successful founders with a term sheet that sets out a three-person board of directors. One of these positions is filled by a representative of the VC firm and another by the company’s CEO, this usually being the founder. The third and final person on the board is a designated independent, neutral outsider who has no conflict of interest with either of the other two board members.  Of course, as companies grow, so do their boards. So it’s important in your initial term sheet to make sure that the board remains balanced. For example, if your company goes through another finance round with a different VC firm, they’ll probably also want a seat on the board. In that case, you’ll want to make sure you negotiate that for every additional VC on the board, there will also be another representative from the company itself. With a fair term sheet in hand, it’s time for the CEO to turn her attention to running her now-funded company. As well as leading her team through the day-to-day activities of the company, the CEO is of course responsible for keeping her eye on long-term vision, particularly if she is also the founder. However, a CEO’s relationship with her board of directors can sometimes complicate things – it’s thus important to make sure that both sides maintain a healthy relationship. That’s especially true of the relationship between the CEO and the VC representatives on the company’s board. While most good boards give CEOs room to run their companies, this isn’t always the case. In many instances, VCs were themselves CEOs in the past, and can often face the temptation to involve themselves in the daily affairs of companies they’ve invested in. But at the end of the day, VCs are not meant to be aware of all the nitty-gritty day-to-day happenings of a company – that is the job of the CEO. So it’s of vital importance that VCs keep a safe distance, and give CEOs space to do their thing. Having said that, it’s important that the CEO maintain a steady back-and-forth channel of feedback with VCs and other board members.  After all, VCs have often sat on countless other boards, and may have a lot of useful input to offer a CEO based on mistakes that other CEOs they’ve advised have made. This is particularly the case if you’re a first-time CEO – while you might have a fantastic vision and team, it could be you’re making rookie mistakes in areas such as hiring or planning long-term growth. VCs can offer input here, but it’s important that you make sure they don’t overreach. At the end of the day, even though VC firms are providing the capital, it’s the CEO’s job to run the whole show – and that includes the board. From the outset, the CEO should tell the board what sort of feedback channels she wants to establish, such as weekly meetings at which advice is sought and company news conveyed. In the case of companies with multiple VCs, the CEO may not have time to meet with all of them individually – if that happens, it’s probably much more useful for VCs to come together and compile feedback that can then be presented to the CEO in a more compact way. Let’s assume for a moment that your company isn’t bankrupt and being shut down after a few rounds of VC funding that eventually led nowhere. If this is the case, congratulations – your company is in the 10 percent of start-ups that don’t fail. If you’re now the CEO of a profitable business that can survive independently without venture capital, it’s likely you’re being offered potential acquisition deals. In fact, 80 percent of successful VC-backed start-ups go on to be acquired by bigger companies.  But there are a number of issues CEOs and boards need to consider during any potential acquisition deal. Perhaps the largest of these is the question of which employees will remain with the company post-acquisition. It could be that many key employees have stuck with you as CEO for years, and it’s time for them to be rewarded for their hard work. This also means negotiating favorable equity deals for the members of your team whom you bring with you into your company’s post-acquisition existence. Aside from acquisition, the other option for boards is to make an initial public offering, or IPO. This entails making the company public and selling shares on the stock exchange. The pricing of shares is one of the major issues here. When Facebook made its IPO in 2012, for example, it set the initial share price at $38. Within the first day, however, that fell to $14. Luckily, by mid-2019, shares had more than quadrupled – but such overpriced initial offerings can result in negative associations dogging your now-public company in the future. So make sure to get a team of good investment bankers to advise you   on the price at which you should set your initial shares. Of course, whether a company is acquired or goes public, the question of the reward for VC firms is paramount, as far as they’re concerned. At this point in the company’s history, the life cycle of venture capital is nearing completion. The initial funding of the company is now about to pay off, and VCs are readying themselves to cash in on the initial risk they took all those years ago. However, if VCs sell their shares off too quickly, the company’s value may plummet due to a perceived massive sell-off. So it’s often a good idea for VCs to withdraw their stock in a company over a period of time rather than all at once. Finally, as CEO, your next stage of the journey is about to begin. Whether you’ve just gone through an IPO or acquisition, the initial idea that you pitched to VCs has begun a new chapter. You’re now having to answer either to a bigger company’s CEO or to public shareholders. But no matter what happens, you should be proud of the fact that you’ve joined the minority of start-ups that make it past the VC stage. The key message in these blinks: With the advent of countless new tech start-ups in the early 2000s, the relationship between venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs changed significantly. Nowadays, one of the main characteristics VCs look for in companies is a founder who has unique insight into the problem his product is trying to solve. Key to getting VCs on board with your product is mastering the art of the pitch, which involves exhibiting a willingness to adapt while still being 100 percent committed to the validity of your idea. Once you get funding from VCs, the challenge then becomes maintaining positive relationships with them; a good term sheet can help with this. And if you make it through to an IPO or acquisition, you’ll have joined the small club of founders who made it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

After all, we’re told time and again that you can’t buy happiness. Well, sure – you can’t spend your way to Earthly bliss. But here’s the flipside: poverty is pretty sure to make you miserable. Far from being the root of all evil, money is the most important tool we have to improve our quality of life.  If you want to look out for the people you love, you’ll need money – the more, the better. Want to spend more time with your kids? Ditto. How about creating time for leisure, reading, going to the theatre and discovering new cultures and countries through travel? You’ll have guessed the answer by now: money.  That’s the philosophy of Kristy Shen, a self-made millionaire who retired at 31. In these blinks, we’ll be exploring how she did it. Expect plenty of unashamedly contrarian takes, left-field strategies and novel concepts. More to the point, expect to find a roadmap to wealth creation, debt eradication and financial independence.  Ready? Let’s get started. Along the way, you’ll learn  why property isn’t always the bonanza you’ve been told it is;  how to save for early retirement and make your money go further; and  why you should eliminate debt before attempting to grow your wealth.  In 2005, Steve Jobs gave a commencement speech at Stanford University. His advice to the students? “Follow your heart.” That feel-good mantra rippled around the world. Endorsed by the great and good, it soon came to feel commonsensical – why on Earth wouldn’t you follow your passions and do something you love?  Here’s one reason: it’s often the wrong choice.  Take the often life-defining decision students make every year about what they’re going to study. That was just what the author, Kristy, was mulling over back in 2000. She had a shortlist of three possible majors – creative writing, accounting and computer engineering. Her heart told her to go with writing; math told her to go for engineering. Kristy followed the latter’s advice. It was a good call.  Let’s look at that math. A four-year program in Canada costs about $40,000. Professional writers fall on a spectrum between the unpublished newbie who earns zilch and established pros like Stephen King who earn millions. The average income, however, is $17,000. In 2000, the minimum wage was $6.85 an hour or $14,248 a year. That’s what anyone without a degree could expect to earn, so subtracting that sum from $17,000 told Kristy how much a writing degree was worth: a measly $2,752.  An accounting degree, by contrast, was worth around $24,000 more than the minimum wage. Computer engineering meanwhile netted you a whopping $40,000 more every year.  But hold up. You can’t put a price on happiness – surely dreams are worth pursuing whatever the bottom line says, right? Well, not necessarily. After all, if you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, you’re unlikely to wake up excited about your work, especially if it calls for creativity. Passions also change over time; a 2013 study published in Science found that the dreams of nearly all of the 19,000 participants had changed significantly over the previous decade.  And that’s why it pays to follow the math. Just ask Kristy. Today, she’s a professional writer. The reason she got there is simple: her well-paying engineering job meant she wasn’t reliant on writing to make the rent. Money, in other words, provided her with the foundation which eventually allowed her to pursue her true dream.  In the following blinks, we’ll see how she did it. Did you know that on average Chinese citizens save 38 percent of their income? Americans, by contrast, squirrel away 3.9 percent of what they earn while the Japanese keep just 2.8 percent for a rainy day. So what’s going on – are the Chinese just inherently frugal?  Not really. Even before the communists came to power in 1949, corruption was endemic in China. Combine that with the absence of official credit channels like bank loans and you had the makings of a culture which ran on favors. When folks wanted to buy something big, they had a simple choice: take on an onerous personal debt and put themselves in someone else’s power, or save up until they had enough cash to buy it outright. That’s why, historically, debt in China is understood not so much as an “IOU” but an “I own you.”  If you’re Chinese like Kristy, that history means you’re basically programmed to avoid debt like the plague. But here’s the thing: when you crunch the numbers, it turns out that’s a pretty good attitude to adopt wherever you live.  Take the Rule of 72, an insight first formulated by a fifteenth-century Italian mathematician called Luca Pacioli. Here’s how it works. To work out how long it takes for your investment to double, you simply divide the interest rate by 72. So let’s say you’re getting six percent on your $1,000 investment. 72 divided by six equals twelve – that’s how many years you’ll be waiting for that grand to compound into $2,000. Over time, the balance increases. The money you make makes more money.  If you’re an investor, the Rule of 72 is your friend; if you’re a debtor, it’s your worst enemy. Say you buy a $1,000 TV on credit. Typically, the interest rate will be around 20 percent. Divide 72 by 20 and you get 3.6 – that’s how long it’ll take your debt to double! After seven years, it will have almost quadrupled.  When you put it like that, the Chinese custom of paying off personal debts during the New Year on pain of being cursed with 12 months of misfortune starts to make a lot of sense. But don’t worry – the idea here isn’t to scare you. In the next blink, we’ll see how you can wipe out your own debts. Debt is a blood-sucking vampire. It bleeds you dry. Worse, it leaves you terrified of the sunlight, trapping you indoors in an endless cycle of work and repayment. If you want financial independence, you’ll have to put a stake through this bad boy’s heart.  Consumer debt has the highest interest rates, so that’s where you should start. The first thing you’ll need to do is cut your expenses to the bone. It’s painful but essential. As we’ve seen, the Rule of 72 means your debts grow at an ungodly rate. If you’re saddled with a 10 or 20 percent interest rate, there’s no point trying to save or invest your hard-earned cash – there’s no getting in front of debt. Do whatever it takes, whether it’s finding a side hustle, renting out a spare room, or saying “no” to dinners out.  Next, you’ll need to prioritize how you repay your loans by putting them in order based on interest rate, from highest to lowest. When you’re surrounded by hungry vampires, it’s always a good idea to kill the one with the biggest appetite first. That means paying the minimum monthly repayment on all your cards to avoid defaulting and throwing everything that you don’t need for essentials like rent at the nastiest bloodsucker. Paying off your smallest loan might make you feel good, but you’re not trying to massage your ego here – you’re fighting for your freedom. The final step is refinancing your loans. Lots of credit card companies allow you to transfer balances between different cards and pay zero percent interest for a certain amount of time. That’s usually a year. If you’re sure you can use these so-called “grace periods” to pay off a loan completely, use this option. Bear in mind, however, that these companies are gambling on you failing to do so, which will allow them to jack up the interest rate and screw you.  Remember, trying to gain financial independence while carrying around debt is like running a marathon with a backpack full of bricks – it’ll sap your strength before you’ve even run a mile. If you want to grow your assets, you need to kill that vampire! What does cocaine have to do with shopping? Surprisingly, quite a lot. Understanding that connection holds the key to getting the most out of the money you decide to spend on luxuries.  But before we get to that, let’s talk about the brain. When something good happens, the “pleasure chemical” dopamine surges through your mesolimbic pathway, essentially your brain’s main highway, to the nucleus accumbens – a kind of dopamine processing plant. A substance like cocaine triggers this surge – but so does splurging on a Gucci handbag. In both cases, the reward is a massive neural high.  Here’s where it gets interesting. As a 2006 article in the journal NeuroImage demonstrated, the nucleus accumbens doesn’t just react to positive stimuli – it also reacts to the expectation of those stimuli. In other words, pleasure isn’t just about absolute dopamine levels but how much dopamine our brains expect is on the way.  Unfortunately for cocaine addicts and shopaholics, the brain keeps ratcheting its expectation levels upwards. That’s why people need ever-larger amounts of cocaine and ever-more expensive handbags – they’re forever chasing that unrepeatable first high.  That means you’re not going to enjoy yourself even if you’re wealthy enough to fund your shopping habits. This might sound like the preamble to an old-fashioned moral lecture about how money can’t buy happiness, but it’s really not. Truth be told, it can. It just boils down to what you’re spending it on.  Not all spending is created equal; some kinds go further than others. When Kristy started her blog and began receiving emails from her readers, she noticed a trend. The more stuff people owned, the unhappier they were. Folks who owned less and used their money to buy experiences, by contrast, were pretty happy with their lot in life. That’s because possessions give you an initial burst of dopamine which fades as your nucleus accumbens acclimatizes. The pleasure that comes with learning new skills or traveling doesn’t fade nearly as quickly. As long as you practice now and again, you’ll always be able to play the piano, and those holiday snaps from Rome will always take you back to that week you spent in the Eternal City with your husband.  Lots of folks are cautious about borrowing money, but they usually make one big exception: a mortgage. Conventional wisdom says buying a house isn’t just a rite of passage into adulthood but a wise investment in the future. After all, you can always sell at a profit, right?  Well, no. In reality, property comes with all sorts of hidden costs. Let’s talk numbers.    According to the US Census Bureau, the average family stays in their home for 9 years. Typically, these families invest in brick and mortar in the expectation that property prices will rise. Historically, that rate rises and falls with inflation, but for simplicity’s sake, let’s assume here that prices increase by a steady 6 percent every year.  Our family – let’s call them the Smiths – buy their house for $500,000. Add 9 times 6 percent – 9 years at 6 percent inflation – to that and you get $844,739. That leaves a tidy profit of $344,739.  Not so fast. To buy the property, the Smiths need a title search from the land registry office. That’s $1,000. The title recording fee costs $150. The lawyer who processes those documents charges another grand.  Then there’s insurance. Rates vary across the US, but 0.5 per cent of the house’s value is pretty common. Paid annually for 9 years, that comes to $22,500. A property tax of 1 percent per annum adds another $45,000 to the bill. Meanwhile, realtors advise setting aside at least one percent of a home’s value every year for maintenance, which is what the Smiths do. That’s another $45,000.  Selling isn’t cheap either. A commission of 6 percent of the final sale price clocks in at $50,684. The land transfer tax is 1.2 percent, so that’s $10,137. Oh and there’s another lawyer, who also bills for $1,000.  That brings us to $175,571 – 51 percent of the Smiths’ profit. But we haven’t talked about interest yet. Like most families, the Smiths paid a ten percent down payment in cash and borrowed the rest from their bank. Over 9 years, they have paid $162,033 in interest.  That’s a whopping 98 percent of the sale price. And remember, we started by assuming that the value of the Smiths’ house would grow by 6 percent every year. That’s well above the actual inflation rate in the US, which is about 2 percent. In the real world, the Smiths would have lost money! In the last blink, we crunched the numbers and saw that the cost of buying, owning and selling a house outweighed the returns in the case of a fictional American family. The moral of the story, however, isn’t that you should never buy a house – it’s that you need to work out if that’s a good call in your situation. Ask a realtor and they’ll swear it’s all very simple. If the monthly mortgage payment equals the rent on a similar house or apartment, you’re better off buying rather than giving your money to a landlord. Look more closely, however, and you’ll find it’s a little more complicated.  That’s where the Rule of 150 comes in. This is a tool to help you compare the true cost of owning a home with what you would be saving by not renting. Here’s how it works: Over the first 9 years of a standard 30-year mortgage, only about 50 percent of your payments go towards the actual loan; paying off interest on that loan accounts for the other 50 percent. Now, additional ownership costs like maintenance and insurance are roughly equal to the interest on a standard mortgage during those first 9 years, so that’s another 50 percent. So to calculate your actual monthly payments, you’ll need to multiply your monthly mortgage payment by 150 percent. That’s how much your home will actually cost per month once you’ve accounted for all your expenses. So say you’re looking at a monthly mortgage bill of $1,500. When you multiply that by 150 percent, you get your true cost – $2,250. If your Rule of 150 monthly cost is higher than your rent, it makes sense to stick it out in the rental market; if it’s lower, you might want to think about buying.  When Kristy first considered buying a house, she was living in Toronto, Canada’s most expensive city. Prices were out of control and one-person apartments were going for a million dollars apiece. After applying the Rule of 150, she quickly realized that there was no way she was going to be able to buy her own home.  That opened an unexpected can of worms. If she wasn’t going to blow her savings on property, what was she going to do with that nest egg? Let’s find out in the next blink! The American business guru Robert Kiyosaki once remarked that poor people buy stuff, the middle class buys houses and rich people buy investments. What he meant is that rich people put their money into things that make them more money. But you don’t have to be a multi-millionaire to follow their lead.  Broadly speaking, there are two ways of investing. The first is to do what Wall Street whizzes do – spend a ton of cash on research and fancy algorithms to pick the best companies. The second variant is cheaper, simpler and, most importantly, less risky.  That’s called index investing. Think of it as betting on the casino rather than individual horses. It doesn’t matter who wins the race – the house always makes money. Let’s unpack that.  An index is a list of companies ranked by market capitalization, or the overall value of their public shares. When you invest in an index, you’re effectively betting on every one of those listed firms. Because the index contains the stock of multiple high-performing companies, a single failure won’t wipe you out. The only way you can go bust is if every name on your index simultaneously files for bankruptcy.  That’s highly unlikely. Why? Well, index investing has an elegant built-in barometer. If a company is worth more, the index automatically picks up more shares in that company, and vice versa. If a tech giant releases a world-beating smartphone and its stock soars, the index buys more shares. If a car company runs into trouble and their stock plummets, the index dumps shares. And when a company drops in value from number 500 to number 501, it’s kicked off the index entirely.  This is a highly intuitive way of gauging the stock market as a whole, which is why major indexes like the S&P 500 – a list of the 500 biggest companies – work like this.  Index investing is also good for your wallet. The simplicity of the concept means there’s no need to pay for a hands-on fund manager. In the US, for example, a typical index fund charges fees of just 0.04 percent – 25 times lower than what you’d pay for an actively managed fund. The sales commission? $0. If you ever want to see your bank manager sweat, head to your local branch and ask to have your savings put into index funds! Chances are you’ve idly daydreamed about early retirement. Most folks quickly shelve that idea when they take a look at their bank balance, though. If you’re not raking it in, you just can’t afford to stop working before your mid-sixties, right?  Wrong. Your time to retirement doesn’t depend on how much you earn but how much you save. If you’re making and spending a million bucks a year, you’re entirely dependent on your job and won’t ever be able to retire. If you make $40,000 a year and spend $30,000, on the other hand, you already have a healthy savings rate of 25 percent.  The “normal” retirement age is 65 because most people save between five and ten percent of their salaries and have investment portfolios yielding an average of six to seven percent annually. Plug those numbers into a spreadsheet and you’re looking at 40 to 45 years of work.  The way to reduce that time is to up how much you’re saving. This does two things. Firstly, it cuts your living expenses, which in turn cuts the size of your target portfolio – the amount of cash you’ll need to retire. Secondly, it pumps more money into that portfolio. Think of it as a race: you’re moving the finish closer while also running faster. Even relatively small changes have a big impact. Boosting your savings rate from ten to 15 percent, for example, shaves 5 years off your working life!  Still not convinced? Well, okay, let’s take a look at the case of a fictional couple we’ll call Paul and Jillian. Together, their annual earnings come to $62,175. That’s the median family income in the US. Deduct 15.2 percent for taxes and you’re left with $52,724.40.  Now imagine Paul and Jillian have read these blinks and decided to turbocharge their savings rate. They rent a small apartment in an affordable city, cook at home and use car-sharing services like Zipcar. All in all, they pay $40,000 to cover their costs and put $12,724.40 into their portfolio every year.  Let’s lowball the interest rate they’re getting on that and say it’s 6 percent. Even if they never get promotions or better-paying jobs, Paul and Jillian would have a million dollars in 30 years. If they started at 24, they could retire at 54 – 11 years ahead of schedule! How much do you need to save to retire early? That’s exactly what researchers asked in a landmark study published in the investment journal AAII in 1998.  They used stock market data to simulate what would happen to a group of fictional retirees who withdrew different percentages of their portfolios every year after retirement. Would “Alan,” for example, make it over the line or run out of cash if he withdrew 10 percent of his $500,000 nest egg every year?  Here’s the answer: Your portfolio is self-sustaining when your annual living expenses are no greater than 4 percent of its total value. Economists call that a safe withdrawal rate. This number allows you to determine the size of your target portfolio – simply multiply your annual expenses by 25. If you need $40,000 a year, you’re looking at a $1,000,000 portfolio. That’s a lot of cash, right? Sure, but don’t let that put you off – there are also alternative strategies. Take partial financial independence. This gives you the benefits of financial independence, such as flexibility and having more free time, and it’s achievable with a smaller portfolio.  Say you earn the US median family income of $62,175 and need $40,000 a year to cover your living costs. If you shift to part-time work and earn $28,000 after tax, you’ll have an annual shortfall of $12,000 in your budget. Multiply that number by 25 and you have your new target portfolio – $300,000. Save that amount and you can enter semi-retirement! Then there’s geographic arbitrage. This is the idea that you can earn income in a country with a strong currency like Germany or the US and retire in a country with a weaker currency like Mexico or Thailand. When Kristy and her husband Bryce visited Vietnam, for example, they realized that you can live a luxurious life there for around $1,130 a month.  If you’re earning the local average salary of $150 a month, that’s unaffordable; if you’re earning the average US monthly salary, however, it’s well within your reach. So what does your target portfolio look like now? Multiply $1,130 by 25 – that makes $28,250. So there you have it – a ton of tricks to help launch your journey to financial independence. All you have to do now is ask yourself a simple question. What’s more important – accumulating expensive things or your freedom? Answer that honestly and your money decisions will become clear. The key message in these blinks: Getting a handle on your finances comes down to one basic principle: follow the math. That means ignoring feel-good advice like choosing to study a subject you love rather than one that will bring in a salary you can actually live on. It also means bucking social trends if they’re not right for you. Crunch the numbers and you might just discover that you’re better off investing your savings in the stock market rather than buying a house and saddling yourself with a lifetime of debt. Why? Well, if you’re growing your money while avoiding ruinous interest rates, you’re setting yourself up for financial independence. And that means you’re one step closer to the ultimate dream: early retirement.  Actionable advice: Make invisible waste visible. Consumerism promises happiness but it’s usually little more than a temporary fix. What it does generate is waste. A lot of waste. Take clothing. According to the Guardian, Americans throw away 11 million tons of clothes every year. So here’s how to eliminate waste in your own wardrobe: make it visible. Simply push all the clothes in your closet to the left, and place an empty hanger with a piece of masking tape in the middle. Everything you wear from now on goes on the right of the marked hanger after it’s been washed. Over time, this reveals how often you use different items. On the right, are the superstars of your wardrobe; in the middle, pieces you do wear but infrequently; and on the left, clothes you never take out at all – the waste.  Got feedback?

Quit your day job and be your own boss!” Following this type of entrepreneurial advice comes with a fair share of risk. And let’s face it: not everyone who tries self-employment thrives as their own boss. So what if you have an inner-entrepreneur who wants to venture forth, but you also want to keep the benefits of your current job? There’s a lot to be said for health insurance, regular feedback and steady deadlines. Well, maybe it’s to consider becoming a side hustler! In these blinks, you’ll find out precisely what it means to have a business in addition to your day job, as well as learning the dos and don’ts of having a successful side hustle. From finding the perfect idea for your part-time business to optimizing your income from it, these blinks will make you into a side hustler in no time. You’ll also learn how obscure hobbies, like writing fish tank reviews, can give you an extra income; how some pretty simple math can prevent your making business mistakes; and why Girl Scouts have a lot to teach the business community. One day, a British construction manager decided to start writing reviews of fish tanks. The reviews included hyperlinks to Amazon product listings, and he knew he’d get a small commission if readers clicked through and purchased them. But the reviews were posted on an obscure website and, busy with his other day-job work, he half-forgot he’d ever written them. So he was pleasantly surprised when, several weeks later, he received a check for $350. Even now, years down the road, he’s still getting $700 a month for the same reviews. In short, he has the perfect side hustle. A side hustle can be defined as a profitable business venture that operates as an adjunct to other paid work or employment. No more than the bare minimum amount of time, money and effort should be invested. It shouldn't be a big deal. You can even think of it as a kind of job security. The days of a \"job for life\" are over, and a side hustle ensures several incomes from different sources. You simply won’t be held to the whims of a single employer whose loyalty to you can’t be counted on. Everybody needs a side hustle. It can make transitioning from your day job easier, too, if you decide to quit or are fired. Leaving may seem exhilarating in the abstract, but the reality can be difficult: you’ll lose a reliable income source and health insurance. A side hustle gives you a taste of entrepreneurship, but without all the risks of going it alone. There’s also no reason to feel daunted when beginning a side hustle. For starters, you don’t need to spend a lot of time doing it. No more than an hour a day maximum. Any more is probably a waste of time. Secondly, there’s no need to have a business degree to get going. Remember, it's your business you’re running, not someone else’s – you're the one setting the entry requirements! So those are the basics. But what kind of idea makes for the best side hustle? The adage has it wrong; money can grow on trees. But growing a money-bearing seedling requires planting the right seed under the right conditions. All it takes is a little thought, however, and you’ll find those fecund and productive ideas that are bound to blossom. To get going, it’s important to recognize that hustle-worthy ideas share three qualities. They need to be feasible, profitable and persuasive. If you can answer yes to the following three questions, then the idea is feasible. Does your idea motivate you? Will it earn you money? Can it be accomplished in a short period of time? How do you know if your idea is profitable? Well, try explaining the merits of your proposal to potential customers in two sentences. No luck? Then your potential customers won’t become paying customers any time soon. An idea is persuasive if your customers can’t say no. Consider Julia. As a caricaturist, she was earning $100 an hour as a side hustle. But when she started sketching with digital drawing technology, she found she could charge $250 an hour. This was possible because few customers had seen the technology before. The novelty gave her a persuasive edge over the competition, and that wow factor was irresistible So once you’ve got some feasible, profitable and persuasive ideas, you’ve got to do some basic math. You should calculate the projected profit of each hustle with this equation: “anticipated income minus anticipated expenses.” Put this way, making a profit is easily understood. You should spend less money on your hustle than you bring in. You should also calculate the answer twice. One should be a conservative projection, the other an optimistic one, depending on the predicted strength of possible outcomes. So now that you have an idea, how do you go about pitching it? You might think it’d be difficult to make a lot of money from giving guitar lessons as a side hustle. After all, there are already plenty of guitar teachers doing the rounds. But Jake earns $6,000 a month doing exactly that. He can make this much because his offer trumps the rest. Once you’ve got your idea, you can turn it into an offer. Every offer includes three elements: a promise, a pitch and a price. The promise is a bold statement that tells customers how they’ll immediately profit – that is, how you'll change their life. Jake promised \"The most awesome guitar lessons in the universe.\" A pitch tells customers all they need to know, with no irrelevant details. Jake's pitch was \"The typical goal is to have fun (always first and foremost), as well as learn the instrument, all while maximizing efficiency so we meet your goals.\" Your price communicates the cost, and should also include a \"call to action.\" A tag like \"phone this number\" or \"click this button” should do the trick. It needs to be easy and obvious. The best offers also create a sense of urgency. Your potential customers need to think they want your hustle immediately. A good way to do this is to ensure you respond to queries from customers quickly and efficiently. A study by the Harvard Business Review found that companies who responded to a customer's request for information within an hour were seven times more likely to get business. Another technique for communicating urgency is to use the color red. Highlighting words like \"now\" or \"today\" works wonders. Finally, if you’re selling online, you’ll find that a countdown on the checkout screen is great for hurrying customers along. Okay, we’ve covered the things that constitute an offer, so now let’s think about the kind of tools you’ll need to get up and running. One particular Valentine’s Day, Sarah spotted a gap in the market. No one was selling custom-printed candy hearts. So she got down to it herself and within days had multiple orders. When her supplier wasn’t able to keep up with demand, Sarah found her own printing machine to ensure the business kept chugging along. If you, like Sarah, want to be resourceful and have the right attitude for rapidly growing your hustle, you need to have the basics covered. You need a resource shopping list which will include the following. First, a website. This is your online home, and a content-management system such as Wordpress can make setting it up easy. A social media profile. You needn’t be operating on every single platform – just one or two should be fine. However, do register your side hustle’s name with the most popular platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, irrespective of your current reach. A scheduling tool. A side hustle is a time-based commitment and time management is critical. A scheduling tool means you’ll spend less time organizing meetings with colleagues and customers and more time working, as online scheduling applications are designed to display mutually available slots. A payment system. Be sure to have an invoicing system, PayPal account or shopping cart on your website before you launch. Once you have these four elements sorted out, you should prioritize providing more value and generating more money. Value is best improved by responding to customers' unspoken needs. For instance, say you’ve been walking a man’s dog while he’s on vacation. Maybe that same man needs regular dog care when he’s back in town? Ask him. Money can be generated through regularly scheduled price increases. Don’t be afraid of doing this – customers will understand. After all, once your business has proven its reliability, you need to charge a fair price. Each spring, Girl Scouts can be seen selling boxes of cookies at malls and outside supermarkets all over the United States. Their pitch is simple: “Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?\" They sell them by the truckload – 200 million boxes every year, to be precise. So what can a side hustler learn from the Girl Scouts? Well, they sell so many cookies not just because the cookies are scrumptious but because people know that they are. When you’re selling a product or service, you’ve really got to emphasize its merits. Lead with the benefits. You might tell customers that your product will make them happier or their lives simpler and better. Ideally, you should connect with people’s emotions. Consider a dog sitter. She might not explicitly try to assuage an owner’s guilt about leaving his dog at home alone, but she can imply it. A carefully crafted pitch might go “Leave your dog with me and he’ll feel loved and cared for.” Be subtle. Once you’re able to distill your side hustle’s benefits, you should reach out to four types of people who can help you along the way. There’s no need to do your solo side project alone. First, find supporters. Most likely this means your family and friends – people who can contribute in different ways and support your efforts. Second, seek out mentors. These are guides or experts who can give you feedback and advice. Third, identify influencers. These are trendsetters who'll spread the news about your product. Trusted authorities, like reviewers or bloggers, are generally best for this. Fourth, locate some ideal customers. These people are perfectly placed to evaluate products and respond to questions you might have with honest and detailed answers. Once you've established this network, you’re sure to go far. Often, when business owners are asked how their businesses are going, they’ll just respond with a perfunctory, \"Oh, it’s fine.\" That’s not the right answer! A business is never in stasis. It’s either on an upward trajectory – or it’s sinking. It’s important, in the early stages of your hustle, to know exactly what sort of trajectory your business is on. Once you’re up and running, ask yourself a simple question: is your venture making money? There are three possible answers. First, you might find you’re far exceeding initial expectations. Fine, that’s great. You’ve obviously got to keep going. Second, you might think your original idea was good, but people haven’t latched onto it. It’s difficult to admit it, but that’s the time to cut your losses and move on. The most common response in the early stages is the third. You’ve found your idea hasn’t completely gained traction, but as it’s making a bit of money it doesn’t make sense to pull the plug. If this last option sounds familiar, but you’re still not certain how to finesse the problem areas in your hustle, then have a look at your metrics. Metrics are measured in three areas. Profit – that’s income minus expenses. Growth – ask yourself how many new customers or what new prospects you have. And time – how long do you spend on your hustle each week? Once you’ve identified areas of concern, you can improve on them by applying two basic rules. In the first case, do more of what’s working. In the second, abandon what’s not. It’s universally tempting to try to solve a problem. But don’t. Really. In the author’s experience, the most successful people just drop them and concentrate more on those aspects that function best. Well, that’s it! You have all the tools you need to start your side hustle. From here, the only way is up. The key message in this book: Absolutely anyone can create and launch a successful part-time business. It doesn’t require much time, money or effort to start one, and it doesn’t mean quitting your day job. A side hustle is a great idea. It gives you an extra paycheck, but without the terrifying risks of being a self-employed entrepreneur. Actionable advice: Create a workflow for your side hustle. When working out how your customers will purchase your product or service and receive what they’ve paid for, it’s useful to write a list of processes that need to take place along the way. This list of processes is called a workflow. When you make this master list of activities, actions and next steps, you should consider: How will prospective customers learn about your idea? What will happen immediately after the customer registers for or purchases what you’re selling? What else needs to occur in order for the customer to purchase and actually get your product or service? Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Over the years, many people have tried to distil the essence of success into easy catchphrases or simple mottos, but most of these have failed. Let’s face it, most lifestyle gurus are little more than salesmen for grandiose and dubious ideas; they know all the cliches and slogans, but they have no idea how to really lead people toward success. These blinks present a real method to success, the 10X Rule. Based on the experiences of a top sales trainer and business owner, they explain how anybody can apply one simple rule to set themselves up for the lasting successes and ambitious achievements that once seemed out of reach. In these blinks, you’ll find out why we should emulate children when it comes to decision making; why you need to go “all-in” in life; and why you shouldn’t really concern yourself with customer satisfaction. Perusing the shelves of your average bookstore, you’re bound to find a plethora of titles that promise you the secrets to a successful life. But with so many options, it can be hard to know which is the best one. So, before you get sucked into another questionable formula for success, consider the 10X rule – a surefire way to succeed at whatever you want. The 10X rule is based on the knowledge that success always requires more effort than you originally thought. You can look back on your life and easily see that your endeavors always demanded ten times more effort than you thought they would. Success in business pursuits always came when you invested ten times more than your competitors. So, if you want to sell a product and think making ten phone calls a day will help you do so, you should probably aim for closer to 100 phone calls per day. But putting in this added effort won’t just help you achieve your daily goals; the 10X rule will help you accomplish a whole lot more. This brings us to the second half of the 10X rule: all your goals should be ten times bigger than what’s considered realistic. In other words, reach for the heavens and pick a goal that’s beyond your wildest dreams. It might seem silly, but if you aim too low you’ll still be disappointed when you achieve your goal, and feel crushed if you fail. It’s much more desirable to fail to meet an incredibly high expectation than to attain a mediocre goal. For instance, say your dream is to be an author. Writing a novel should be your goal, not writing a two-page short story. Even if you successfully accomplish the latter, you still won’t consider yourself a writer. In this way, the 10X rule is about trying harder and dreaming bigger. History has shown time and time again that merely having the best product isn’t enough to make you a success. Real market success is a product of the right attitude and the readiness to handle unexpected issues. That’s why the 10X rule is also about being ready to confront unforeseen challenges. By aiming as high as the 10X rule tells you to, you’ll be working hard enough to deal with anything that comes your way. Imagine you aim to sell 100,000 items in your product line when most people would shoot for just 10,000. This gargantuan goal means that if you, say, experience a huge influx of orders, you’ll succeed where others will fail because you’ve developed the capacity to handle a bigger operation. But the 10X rule also offers some clear guidelines for success. The first has to do with the fact that people often think of success as something for others, but not for themselves. It’s essential to disabuse yourself of this belief and remember that success has no restrictions. No matter what other people say, success isn’t a zero-sum game and there’s plenty to go around. Anyone with a 10X mindset can achieve success, and it doesn’t have to come at someone else’s expense. For example, if you succeed at bringing an improved cell phone to market, you’ll have offered a positive contribution, making it a success that benefits everyone. Even if other businesses look on with envy at first, others will learn from your contribution and attitude to find their own success. In this way, the 10X rule, by pushing you to achieve all you can, is a tool for reaching your true potential. Just consider the author. Until the age of 25, his life was all about alcohol and drugs. At a certain point, he realized he wasn’t living a fulfilling life whatsoever and had no will to achieve anything at all. So, he transformed his mindset and pushed himself to levels of achievement he could never have imagined. Next up, you’ll learn how you can do the same by applying the 10X rule to your life. Have you heard about the four degrees of action? It’s a pretty simple concept that states that, when confronted with a situation, you can respond in one of four ways. You can either do nothing, retreat, take normal action or take massive action, and it’s the last of these that is the key to success. To see this principle in action, look no further than children. When they’re faced with a challenge, they simply give it everything they’ve got; they don’t pause to calculate or budget their effort. So follow their lead. Instead of determining how many hours you’ll need to devote, just make massive action your natural habit. Say you need to sell your product to a market influencer. Instead of skimping on budget or keeping your efforts measured, go all out to convince him. Do all the research you can, spare no expense and don’t let up until he’s sold. However, following this route means taking responsibility. Remember, success isn’t something that happens to you – it’s something that happens because of you. As such, it’s key to avoid thinking of yourself as a victim, or someone who can be acted upon, and start thinking of yourself as an actor. Embrace challenges and see opportunities instead of risks and dangers. Keep in mind that the word “average” by definition means less than extraordinary; it’s your task to push beyond this boundary. The fact is, the world is full of average everything. Just consider how most people aim to be middle class. Wanting to be average means thinking only about getting by, perhaps thinking about tomorrow or the day after, but not any further. The danger here is that average can sink to below average very quickly. The 2008 financial crisis is a great example, as it hit the middle class hardest, forcing many into poverty. It just goes to show that aiming for average isn’t enough. Define what average means in your context, but only to shoot for ten times above it – doing so will make you a success for years to come. Anyone who has been around a card table knows that going “all-in” in a game of poker is a risky move. You might win the round and take home the pot, but you could also lose everything you have. Luckily, going all-in in life is a little bit less risky. When applying the 10X rule, going all-in just means investing effort, energy and ideas to reach your goal. First, you need to identify goals that are big enough for you to be motivated to achieve them. To do so, begin by picking objectives that are out of your reach and go all-in to realize them. But going all-in also means thinking outside the box to come up with solutions. After all, if you’ve chosen appropriate goals, the problems you’ll face will be immense. Problems of this magnitude often crush other people who try to overcome them. You’ll need to be clever, using every last drop of your effort and energy, to succeed. Whatever you do, don’t follow in the footsteps of those who have failed. To succeed against such odds, you have to be obsessed with your goals; they have to dominate your thoughts and become your mission. This is another context in which kids can be great role models. Children are obsessed with every new thing they encounter, devoting their full energy to their new object or activity of interest. To succeed, you’ll need to do the same thing. When others see how obsessed you are, they’ll be prepared to follow you on your journey to realize your wildly ambitious goals. On the other hand, if you fail to show this devotion, they’ll be unlikely to believe in your optimism. So, obsession with your goals is a crucial factor, but it’s just as important to avoid obsessing over failures and to shy away from excuses. That is to say, you should only be obsessed with doing things right and not worry about when they go wrong. Living by the 10X rule means remembering that you always have to keep growing. After all, the road to success is paved with growth and it’s better to fail while fighting than while retreating. So, to keep your eyes on the prize, it’s important to shake off outside influences that seek to control your actions; instead, keep pushing for the goals you want to attain. For instance, in failing economies, people tend to panic and scramble to move their assets to safe havens. But you don’t have to worry about what other people are experiencing, just about achieving your own goals. Another important thing to keep in mind is that overexposure is nothing to fear. You might be worried that pushing ahead time after time will bore people or make them feel annoyed by you and your company. But the simple truth is that overexposure is far better than obscurity. Just consider Coca-Cola or Facebook – has overexposure hurt them? And finally, to truly be successful, you need to seize control of your workday and your feelings. Many people have concerns about time management and time, of course, is limited. However, the real question isn’t which one of any two given options you can accomplish, but rather how you can foster a mindset that makes everything possible. The only workable strategy here is to strive to accomplish more in less time. Keep a close eye on how much time you have, then work harder and budget your time more effectively. We can again look to the author for a good example. After his daughter was born, he started waking up one hour earlier to spend quality time with her and let his wife sleep in, all while doing the same amount of work as he was doing before. In this way, the structure of your workday is critical, but so are your feelings. Emotions like fear and pride can hold you back; being scared of risk can prevent you from reaching your goals and too much pride can make you averse to constructive feedback. So, when faced with such feelings, remember that it’s your job to remain in control and keep marching toward your goal. Now you know just about everything you need to apply the 10X rule to your life. There’s just one last thing to figure out: how will you choose your goal? Well, what you definitely shouldn’t do is follow in the footsteps of others who simply adopt the targets imposed upon them by their social context. Take the concept of customer satisfaction as an example. Even though people are constantly told that satisfied customers are of the utmost importance, most companies don’t have enough customers in the first place; their real target should be to increase their customer base. Not only that, but with the 10X mindset, you don’t need to live in fear of poor customer satisfaction because you’ll always deliver above and beyond people’s expectations. As a result, you can focus your energy on finding new customers. In fact, truly successful brands like Google and Apple always put customer acquisition before customer satisfaction. They know that the more people they get talking about their brand, the further they’ll reach. And keep in mind that feedback from a customer, even if negative, is always valuable, as it shows you how you can improve. Another target that’s good to keep in focus is name recognition. You should consider your name your most valuable asset and make it synonymous with what you stand for. For instance, when people think of mp3 players, they think of Apple; when they think of app-based mobility services, they think of Uber. So, do as these successful companies have done and proudly advertise what you have to offer. Then, once you’ve set your sights, jump into action. Simply list your goals, outline what you need to do next and give it everything you’ve got. If your goal is to sell 100,000 units of your product, you should consider exactly how to get there. Do you need to increase your marketing budget, or should you develop a great advertising strategy? After you write this list, you can keep checking on it and adapting it based on what works and what doesn’t. The key message in this book: The 10X rule is about shifting your goals and your focus to reach beyond what you thought possible and accomplish much more. With a 10X mindset, you’ll think bigger, work harder, show greater commitment and be more inspired to reach targets that once seemed unthinkable.    What to read next: Great by Choice, by Jim Collins & Morten T.

The answer to that question has always been obvious enough: pretty much everyone. The pressing question is how to earn that money. If you don’t win the lottery or some popular game show, then you’ll have to invent some revolutionary product or start a groundbreaking business. Or will you? Well, as it turns out, there is actually an easier way to become a millionaire, and it involves setting up a simple system that puts money from your paycheck directly into secure savings accounts. In this way, anyone can become an automatic millionaire. By setting up automatic payments, even people who are bad at personal finances and sticking to a budget can secure themselves a wealthy future. What’s more, with the automatic-millionaire plan, you don’t even need to be making a lot of money. As the following blinks will show you, it’s all about making small payments to yourself and committing to it, each and every payday. In these blinks, you’ll find out what the “latte factor” is and how it can help you get rich; why you should stop renting and cut up your credit cards; and how you can feel rich while your fortune accumulates. You may not think that earning under $40,000 per year will lead to your becoming a millionaire – but if you use this money wisely, you’d be surprised how far it can go. Take Jim and Sue McIntyre. When they were getting financial advice from the author, he was astounded to notice that Jim had never earned more than $40,000 a year, yet here they were in their early fifties with nearly $2 million in net worth. The McIntyres are living proof that the key to success isn’t earning a huge paycheck. It’s being smart and creating yourself an easy-to-manage financial plan. Soon after their marriage, the McIntyres were lucky enough to receive invaluable financial advice from their parents. Jim and Sue were told that they could either work for their money or make their money work for them. Obviously, the McIntyres wanted to put their money to work, so they came up with a simple-to-follow plan: employing a portion of every dollar they earned. It started with a mere 4 percent of their income, and, over the next few years, they gradually increased that to 15 percent. To avoid the risk of frequent budgeting arguments, they also set up a system that automatically distributed and budgeted their funds. What the McIntyres also had going for them was that they established and started this plan early on. This allowed the money they put aside to increase in value exponentially, thanks to its accruing compound interest. So, with this in mind, there’s a very good chance that you already earn enough to become a millionaire in the years ahead. Over the past five decades, the average prices on the stock market have risen by around 10 percent every year. This means that if you set aside $2,000 every year during your twenties, when your sixty-fifth birthday rolls around, you’ll have over a million dollars to celebrate with! This idea of getting rich over time by regularly putting away a small amount is called The Latte Factor. Your average coffee shop latte costs around $3.50, which, as an everyday cost, adds up to around $1,250 per year. If you’re a pack-a-day smoker, spending $7 on cigarettes every day will add up to around $2,500 per year. Now, let’s say you put aside $10 every day. If we add an annual return of 10 percent, that would leave you with almost $700,000 in 30 years’ time, and nearly $2 million in 40. So, today is the day to start reconsidering the money you spend on all the “little things,” since there’s a good chance you already have what it takes to become an automatic millionaire! We all have unavoidable expenses – things like taxes, rent and insurance. It’s only after we take care of these costs that we can finally set aside some money for ourselves, right? Not so fast. You may think this is the mandatory order of things, but the truth is, you can reverse it. The first person you should really be giving money to is yourself. After all, you work to support the well-being of yourself and your family, not other people and their businesses. A quick first step that can immediately correct the order of things, and ensure that you get paid first, is to set up a pre-tax retirement account. This not only allows for money to be automatically directed to a savings account; it also makes smart financial sense. Since the money in your retirement account will only be taxed when you withdraw it, it’ll likely be taxed at a rate lower than the one your current income is subjected to. Plus, by diverting these funds, you’ll also have more pocket money now. Say you have an annual income of $50,000. If the current tax rate is 30 percent, that leaves you with a net income of $35,000, and if, after taxes, you put aside $5,000 for retirement, you’ll end up with $30,000. Now, if you use a pre-tax retirement fund, that $5,000 will be taken straight from your initial $50,000, giving you $45,000 to be taxed at 30 percent, which leaves you with $31,500. That’s $1,500 more to spend every year! So now’s the time to commit to putting away at least one hour’s pay, every day, for future prosperity. The average American currently saves less than 5 percent of his gross income, which only adds up to 22 minutes worth of daily pay. But the key to being an automatic millionaire is to save at least 10 percent of your gross income – the more the better – and by putting away an hour’s worth of wages, every day, you’ll be sure to hit that mark. But don’t wait until the end of the year to put aside your 10 percent, or else you’ll likely find that you didn’t budget properly. Instead, automatically take the money out of every paycheck. This is what being an automatic millionaire is all about. Think of it this way: you can’t afford not to save at least $14 a day for 35 years. With a 10 percent interest rate, this will provide you with a small fortune of $1.6 million! Let’s take another look at the McIntyres, who, despite their modest salaries, became millionaires. Among the secrets to their success was not only a commitment to paying themselves first, but having a way to avoid the stress and unrealistic amount of discipline it takes to budget their spending. Here’s a general rule of thumb to live by: if it requires a lot of discipline, it probably won’t work. We humans are not designed to deprive ourselves of instant gratification in order to reap some hypothetical rewards a few decades down the line, so budgeting for the future is something we have very little patience for. After the McIntyres had a few arguments about saving money, they decided to do things differently and take themselves out of the equation. Instead of trying to control their behavior, they set up an automatic system for paying themselves first, and the only decision they had to make was the exact percentage of their paychecks they were going to put aside. Once this was decided, they put an automatic payment system in place that deposited the money straight into a savings account. It’s easy to see why this works. If the money doesn’t show up in your checking account, you won’t be tempted to spend it! Here are a few more tips to help you set up a great system for automatic saving. First, remember to make use of the pre-tax retirement account mentioned earlier. This really makes a difference. Second, don’t assume that your current retirement plan is the best one for you. In fact, don’t even assume that you have one.   There may be a better interest rate available. Even if you’re self-employed, you should check your retirement-account options and make sure you have the best one available. Now, you might be asking, what if I don’t have a retirement plan yet? Go to a bank, brokerage firm or mutual fund company and set up an individual retirement plan as soon as possible. As you’re looking over your options, pay close attention to the ways your plan can protect you against market fluctuation. This means making sure your money is going into an investment portfolio that is diversified and includes a variety of instruments like bonds, cash, stocks, and Treasury bills. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in life when it comes to having a steady, prosperous income. This basic uncertainty can lead to worry – sleepless nights when you’re stuck contemplating all the dreadful what-ifs involving pay-cuts or unexpected layoffs. So it’s only good sense for your automatic financial plan to include an emergency fund. When you set up an emergency fund, it not only acts as a financial safety net; it can also help you live a more stress-free and unrestrained life. This is the added benefit of being an automatic millionaire: you build wealth while also putting an end to all the time and energy spent worrying about your finances. The average American has less than three months worth of expenses saved up in case of an emergency. Under these circumstances, it’s no wonder that the threat of unemployment is an incredibly stressful and common feeling. So why not reduce this fear and give yourself more freedom by saving up? When you have between six and 18 months’ worth of wages saved up, you’ll find it easier to decline overtime offers from your employer or to change your career path altogether if you’re feeling uninspired by your work. You can start building up an emergency fund by automatically putting aside 5 percent from every paycheck. But remember, this is a real emergency fund, so you have to treat it as such and only dip into it when there’s something like a natural disaster or a medical emergency to cover. Now, just like your retirement account, you should make sure your emergency account is in good hands, with a trusted financial institution that will earn you proper interest. For example, putting your regular 5 percent payments into a money market account is usually a reliable way to ensure you’ll earn more interest than your standard savings account. Government bonds are also a safe bet for earning reliable interest, but just be aware that they can often take more time to cash out. Still, both of these methods will leave you better off than keeping your emergency savings buried in a jar in your backyard! Jim and Sue McIntyre were not only clever about their automatic savings plan. They made another smart decision when it came to housing. By the time they reached their early fifties, the couple owned two houses; they lived in one and rented the other out, which gave them an additional source of income. So here, again, we can follow in the footsteps of the McIntyres by ceasing to pay rent and becoming homeowners as soon as possible. Ultimately, renters end up giving their landlords around the same amount of money as someone would if they were paying the monthly installments on a home-ownership mortgage. But despite paying the same amount, renters have nothing to show for it at the end of the day. What’s worse, all this money going into the landlord’s pocket can keep them strapped for cash and unable to make the leap to homeownership. If you’re worried that you’d never be able to pay off a mortgage, here’s a reassuring fact: the rate of foreclosures – when a homeowner is evicted for failing to pay off their mortgage – is currently less than 2 percent. However, when you finally make the move from renting to buying, you’ll have to make some important decisions, such as choosing the right kind of mortgage and coming up with a way to pay it off quickly. There are a variety of mortgages out there, so choose wisely. When low interest rates are common, it makes sense to use a fixed-rate mortgage. It’s even better to set up a biweekly payment plan with your bank, rather than a monthly plan, as this will allow you to pay off your mortgage faster. Instead of making twelve payments of the monthly fee, you’ll make 26 payments of half the monthly amount, which adds up to making 13 full payments within the year. And paying off your mortgage as quickly as possible isn’t just a matter of time. Doing so will also mean you’ll pay less interest. For example, if you have a 30-year $250,000 mortgage, using the biweekly payment plan will save you more than $44,000! While you can put all of these tips into action immediately, you might be feeling buried by a mountain of debt. So let’s take a look at how you can dig yourself out. If you’re struggling with debt, you’re not alone: the average American family has amassed $8,400 in credit card debt. With that amount, if you only make the minimum amount of payments each month, it’ll be 20 years before you’re in the clear. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall into debt through the many credit card offers we regularly receive. But remember – debt is not compatible with being an automatic millionaire. One of the main problems with credit cards is their interest rate, which can be as high as 18 percent. This means that if you don’t pay back what you owe as soon as possible, you could end up paying over twice as much as you originally spent. For example, let’s say you use your credit card to cover $1,000 worth of holiday shopping. If you only pay the minimum monthly payments, you’ll end up paying $2,100 over time – that’s $1,100 in interest! If you’re currently in debt, there are three steps you can take to get yourself out. First is to get rid of your credit cards. You’ll never be debt-free if you continue living on credit. The next step is to renegotiate your debt. If you call your credit provider and say you’re willing to switch providers, you can usually convince them to give you a much lower interest rate on your debt. If your debt is spread over multiple accounts, see if you can move it all into one account – whichever has the lowest rate. If this isn’t an option, you’ll need to start paying off the cards one by one. Prioritize whichever card has the lowest ratio of outstanding balance to minimum payment. This is the debt you should pay off first. Once that’s done, move on to the card with the second lowest ratio, and so forth until all your cards are paid off. Then cancel them. The last step is to adjust your financial plan so that you’re automatically paying off your past debt as well as investing in your future self. To do this, you take the money you’re paying yourself from every paycheck and devote half of it to paying off your debt while the other half goes toward your future millionaire status. This way, you can still feel good about that bright future. Even though the automatic millionaire strategy isn’t about making you rich overnight, it can help you start feeling rich right away. How? By enabling you to automatically giving a portion of your money to charity. Setting up an automatic donation can easily be made part of your overall financial plan. And here, once again, we can take a cue from our friends the McIntyres. As part of their financial plan, Jim and Sue began automatically donating a specific portion of their income every month. Like the other payments, the money was taken directly from their paycheck and sent to a charity, thus never appearing in their checking account. Now, how much you want to donate is your choice, but a good way to start might be with a small amount, like 1 percent of your paycheck. If this goes well, you can then decide to gradually increase the amount. Whatever that amount is, and whatever the charity is, one thing is certain: you’ll be making a difference in the lives of people who need your help. You may think that only rich people can afford to be charitable, but this isn’t the case. Look at the American-British investor Sir John Templeton, whose philanthropy began long before he became a billionaire financial powerhouse. Donating money clearly didn’t get in the way of his money-making abilities, and it won’t get in the way of yours, either. If you want to make sure your money makes the biggest difference it possibly can, you should do your homework and double-check the quality of the charity you’re considering. Once, the author found out that a charity he’d been donating to only gave 40 percent of its proceeds to the supposed cause, so it’s safe to say that some charities are more effective than others. Fortunately, there’s a lot of info available online, so you can conduct your own research and feel confident about your choice. Another benefit in making charitable donations is that they’re tax deductible, which means that whatever amount you donate is exempt from taxation. So, for every dollar you give to charity, in the long run, you’ll actually end up spending less than a dollar once your taxes are sorted out. But it’s also worth noting that money isn’t the only way to contribute to a noble cause. There’s very likely a local food bank or shelter that could use your time as much as it could use your money. The key message in these blinks: If you want to stop worrying about money and build yourself the financial future of your dreams, you should do one simple thing: pay yourself first! And whether it’s creating a retirement plan, setting aside some emergency money or paying off your debt, the most important thing is to do it automatically. This way you can benefit from compound interest, and, as the years go by, you can sit back, relax and accumulate millions.

No matter what your income is, you can still achieve financial stability. It requires a little bit of effort to get started, but it’s well worth it.

Let’s join the Barefoot Investor Scott Pape as he shares the benefits of his financial wisdom. In these blinks, you’ll learn where billionaire investor Warren Buffett will put his money when he dies; the best place to store your credit cards; and the connection between a fire extinguisher and saving. None of us like thinking about our financial situations. We most often do it as a last resort when we’re in trouble. And when we do that, the solutions we come up with aren’t just drastic. They’re often downright silly. We might imagine we have to starve ourselves to save money, or maybe even stop having fun. It doesn’t have to be that way: the best methods for feeling like you have more money are sustainable and effective. First, stop making excuses. Classically, people think that it’s too late for them to resolve their financial situation and turn things around, but that is never true. You should take charge by making changes that fall within the realm of possibility. That way, you’re more likely to stick to them for the long haul. Quick fixes tend to be extreme and prone to failure – unless you have the discipline of a monk, of course. But few do outside religious communities. You're much better off making small changes as these deliver larger paybacks more effectively over time. People on low incomes also give up more easily and think it’s impossible to have better financial futures. But that excuse can be overcome. You need to make changes according to your own means. If you’re living on a minimum wage, then naturally your financial planning won’t look like a banker's. But even so, it’s possible to be smart with your money and live your life to the fullest. We’ll discover how to do that in the upcoming blinks. Second, accept that saving is the key to securing your financial well-being. This isn’t the same as saying that money is the key to happiness – we all know it isn’t. Nonetheless, research has shown that the feeling of powerlessness associated with a poor financial situation is actually not dissimilar to physical torture. It’s therefore imperative for you and your family to learn a little self-discipline. Good practices in the present moment and in the future will keep you all secure in the knowledge that there’s always a financial safety net on which to fall back. You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who spends much time thinking about bank accounts. Mostly we give them little thought and just let them be, but a little effort will secure the foundations of your financial security. You need five bank accounts. Seriously. You should make sure you open ones that charge no fees. Also, try to find one with a high interest rate where you can stash away your savings. The five accounts all have different functions. One should be for your daily expenses, another for little indulgences like eating out or a new pair of shoes. The third should be where you set aside savings for more expensive treats like holidays, and the fourth is where the money for paying off crucial costs like debts and big purchases like homes or cars goes. The final account should be used to save for retirement. It may sound complicated, but these accounts will work in tandem and in synchronicity with each other. You should ensure that your monthly income goes into your daily expenses account. Sixty percent of it will stay in there. This is where you’ll get the money to pay for rent, bills, food, insurance and normal travel costs. In other words, it’s the cash you need to sustain your daily life. Next, set up a monthly transfer of 10 percent of your monthly income into your treat account. Get a separate debit card for this account – it’s there for having fun, though not in excess. The money will run out every month, so be sure to calculate your fun wisely. And no cheating! Once this account is empty, you have to wait until next month to fill it up again. Another monthly transfer of 10 percent will go into your fun account for holidays. The final 20 percent should be transferred to your fire-extinguisher account, which you’ll use for bigger expenses that come up along the way, like getting your car fixed if it suddenly breaks down, or paying off debts. Do the math and you’ll see that we’re at 100 percent, but it’s only in four accounts. So from where does the money for retirement come? Before we get there, we’ll have to tidy up your debts. The biggest block to financial security and comfort is debt. It may feel like it’s impossible to shift, but it can be done. What’s more, once you’re in the black, saving and securing your financial comfort will be much easier. The first thing to do is recognize that credit cards are not your friends. Take a pair of scissors and cut them up. Credit cards are basically little encouraging notes sitting in your wallet to coax you to spend beyond your means. You then need to calculate how much debt you have sitting on each card. Call up your credit card issuer and tell the bank that you want zero interest on your debt for 18 months. Just say that you want them to match another bank’s transfer offer. Of course, there’s no way they’ll actually do it, but there’s a good chance they’ll cut your interest at the very least if you stand firm. Don’t let them boss you around! Now, use money from your fire-extinguisher account to pay off the debts month by month until they’re all gone. Critically, it’s the fact that you’re no longer adding to this pile of existing debt that makes this happen. You’ll even find that the process is a lot quicker than you might at first think. Once you’ve wiped out your credit card debt, the next stage is to use your fire-extinguisher fund to pay off any other debts. So, for instance, imagine you have a car you haven’t yet paid off. What should you do? Sell it. It’s completely pointless paying interest on something that’s depreciating in value every second. Now, with the money you save, you should just buy a car outright. You need something that works and does the job, nothing more than that. Anything fancier than basic is just a status symbol that you don’t need. You may think that a plush home or fancy car indicates wealth, but if it’s making you poor in the long run, then it’s not doing its job. When you think about it, it's better to be financially stable and do without the empty emblems. Now, once you’re debt free, you can start to make plans. Footloose and debt-free, now let’s talk about what to do with your fifth bank account. Remember, it’s never too early or too late to start saving for your future. This account is the best way to ensure a comfortable and secure future, whatever life might throw at you. Let’s call it your mojo account. It’s going to be working at full steam at a high interest rate. You’ll be topping this saving account up whenever you earn more through overtime, from selling stuff around the house or from picking up extra work. The idea is that once money goes into this account, it never comes out. Well, at least not until your working life comes to an end, or unless you’re faced with a serious and massive emergency that means you’re not able to work. So that’s the five accounts covered. But there’s one thing more you need to do. You need to get yourself a grow bucket where you can stash some more money away. It’s called a bucket rather than an account because the money in it isn’t just sitting there. It’s used for investments such as shares or property. Remember that investing is the way to secure your financial future. And they need to be smart investments too: they should still be making money for you even after you stop working. To most laypeople, investing appears pretty daunting. But it’s actually pretty simple. The best way to begin investing is to find an index fund. This will buy shares in the 500 biggest companies when their stock prices are low and sell when stock prices are high. You don’t actually need to do any of the work or research yourself. The trick is to find an index fund with low management fees. Index funds are no gimmick, either. Warren Buffet, the world-renowned billionaire investor, has himself stated that he’ll be putting 90 percent of all his money into an index fund for his wife when he dies. The rationale is sound. Despite fluctuations in the stock and bond trading markets, if you'd invested a dollar in 1802, it would be worth $930,550 today. That’s despite massive downturns like the Great Depression, the recent financial crisis, as well as every other wobble in the market. Just one more thing: be sure to reinvest the dividends from your investments to the bucket. One thing at least is undoubtedly clear: it’s always worth investing. It’s a myth that only the rich can live without worrying about money. If you follow the rules in these blinks, you too can join the ranks of the wealthy. That’s because wealth really isn’t about what you own, but rather how much money is yours. Let’s apply that thinking to your home. There are steps you can follow that’ll enable you to save up for a property or even pay off your mortgage faster. If you organize your finances by using different bank accounts and with a set of regular standing orders, it’ll be smooth sailing before too long. That’s because those processes will all be done for you. Automated saving systems, as well as funds for daily expenses and fun money that are sent to different accounts without you thinking about it, will take the pressure right off. Also, once you’re free of debt, you’ll have enough money in your “fire extinguisher” account to start paying off your mortgage or save for a deposit on a home. You might previously have thought it impossible, but it’s not! On top of all of that, such financial prudence and care are sure to set a great example for your children. The simple fact of living debt-free will make you happier. But also, you’ll be able to spend more time with your children as you’ll no longer need to work as much, trying to clear that mountain of debt. Not only will you be able to amass more positive experiences with them, but you’ll also be setting a good example. They’ll know now that living on credit is no option. Consequently, it’s far more likely that they’ll live happier and more financially-intelligent lives as adults, free from the credit trap. It should be clear from these blinks that financial security isn’t something you can manufacture out of thin air. It needs patience. But you’ll feel the benefits of taking control of your finances the moment you decide that your financial stability is your goal and in your hands. No excuses. The key message in these blinks: It’s possible to get a grip on your finances. You can even organize them so that after a few initial steps the mechanics of investing will take care of themselves. However, to secure your future financial security, you’ll have to begin by clearing your debts and destroying your credit cards. Then you can invest for your retirement. Actionable advice: Don’t accept any fancy add-ons for your mortgage.  When you’re on the hunt for a mortgage, take the most basic one available. You don’t need extras like so-called repayment holidays because they’re a way of making you pay more for things you’ll almost certainly never need. Got feedback?

In his work as a financial planner, author Carl Richards saw the effects of this firsthand. Everywhere he looked, people were making lousy decisions and suffering as a consequence. This is what drove Richards to write The Behavior Gap. These blinks show you how tuning out all the noise and focusing on your own personal goals will help you invest wisely, secure your financial future and live a happier life. In addition, you’ll learn why you shouldn’t always follow The Economist’s advice; why trying to predict the future could damage your finances; and why you should talk to your kids about money. Do you ever find yourself doing something that you shouldn’t, like having a third piece of cake even though you want to lose weight? This is called the behavior gap: a rift between what we know we should do, and what we actually do. This phenomenon is tied to our natural desire to avoid pain and seek pleasure, which leads us to act irrationally. One effect is that we often adopt a herd mentality, where we behave exactly like those around us without pausing to make our own decisions. This is because we assume it’s safer to do what everyone else is doing. This was seen in the 1990s dot-com boom. It seemed everyone was reaping huge profits on investments, so even ordinary people began borrowing money against their home equity, and ended up investing over $44 billion in stocks. Then when the NASDAQ shed half its value, people lost their investments and found themselves deeply in debt. This kind of reasoning can be found at the root of any market bubble. These situations produce a behavior gap: Instead of acting rationally, people get excited and let emotions guide their choices. To close the gap, think beyond today’s trends and remember surprising past events: the dot-com crash, the housing bubble, the 2008 debt crisis. All these incidents underscore the importance of investing carefully, without getting caught up in boom-and-bust cycles. Thinking about them will help you close the behavior gap by making the consequences of herd mentality more concrete. Also, avoid overconfidence. In the 1990s, Long-Term Capital, a hedge fund run by Nobel Prize winners, learned this lesson. Blinded by its own pedigree, the company’s board of directors was positive the firm could never lose more than $35 million per day. But one day, to their horror, the firm lost $553 million. Eventually, the company had to be bailed out by the Federal Reserve. We can’t predict the future; we can only control our own behavior. Have you ever wondered, What’s the world’s best investment? If so, you’re asking the wrong question. Here’s why: Planning for your future entails a delicate balance between living for today and saving for later. In this balancing act of spending and saving, the investment – that is, an asset expected to earn value over time – is only a small part of your financial future. In addition to seeking out high return investments, you could also secure your finances by saving more money, retiring later or pursuing a second career. In fact, since it’s impossible to predict how investments will fare over time, no single investment can categorically be “the best.” Instead of chasing this mythical unicorn, judge financial products by how well they help you reach your goals. No single investment can ever satisfy everyone, so ask yourself: What is the best investment for me? The answer will depend on personal factors – your goals, your personality, your existing holdings, even your credit card. For example, if you want to pay for your kids’ college in the future, you could open an educational account or invest in mutual funds at least 18 years before college enrollment. You should aim to save around $240,000. Of course, the college fund won’t be any use if your kids aren’t accepted somewhere, so don’t forget to help them with their homework! As you can see, wise investments are pieces of a larger puzzle. Some people don’t take this approach. Instead, they deal with their portfolio like baseball card collectors, buying shares based on magazine recommendations, with no cohesive strategy. Don’t make this mistake. You’re not a collector, you’re an investor. Judge financial products according to how they help you reach your goals. If they don’t help you, don’t invest in them – end of story. This way, your financial decisions will be based on principles, not emotions. Most of us love giving advice. It makes us feel important and wise. But that’s exactly why most advice is fundamentally useless. Harsh words? Not really. Most of the advice we hear is generic, which means it doesn’t necessarily apply to our specific situation. This is especially true when it comes to financial advice. A good financial plan is personal and unique, so what’s right for you might be a catastrophe for someone else. Of course, plenty of people don’t know that – or care. Millions read The Economist thinking they can beat the market by following the expert advice within. But generic advice can fail us. Here’s an example: People who want to lose weight are told to work out everyday. That might be good advice for many, but it won’t help someone with a heart condition. Additionally, most “expert” advisors are prone to conflicts of interest. Most of us intuitively understand this. That’s why we would never expect a salesman at a Toyota dealership to tell us that Honda makes the greatest cars in the world. So there are many reasons to be skeptical. The good news is, once you can detect unsound and irrelevant advice, you can then find advice that’s actually useful to you. And to that end, you can stop chasing the perfect investment or portfolio. Instead, you can design your portfolio to suit your current understanding of the market and adapt when things change. Think about it: You wouldn’t want someone telling you what to wear each morning. Instead, you trust your own sense of style and your own knowledge of your life! Similarly, there’s no reason to try to become the next Warren Buffett. You are you. With that in mind: In the following blink, you’ll find out why exploring your own goals, strengths and weaknesses is essential for your financial strategy. Why do so many of us strive for financial security? We have good reasons: We just want to be happy and provide a good life for our loved ones. Happiness is very important, but we should always try to remember that true happiness is more about expectations and desire than how much we earn. There’s proof: A recent study by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman and Princeton professor Angus Deaton found that happiness is correlated to income only up to an individual earnings level of $75,000 per year. After that threshold, those with higher incomes don’t have commensurately higher levels of emotional well-being. This means most people are overemphasizing their finances. If money can only buy you so much happiness, then beyond this point, money is merely a tool for pursuing things that bring true satisfaction to your life. For example, money can allow you to travel and see the world, buy a huge garden, or support a cause you deeply believe in. So in order to make truly wise financial decisions, you have to know yourself. That way, you can align the use of your assets with your personal values. David Brooks, op-ed columnist at the New York Times, is a proponent of this approach – but on a broader scale. He has argued that instead of tracking economic trends, governments should focus more on measuring whether social programs and institutions directly increase overall happiness levels. We can apply this principle on an individual level: Stop worrying so much about money. Instead, pursue your personal goals. This will allow you to make the best financial choices. To do this, look inward rather than outward. In the upcoming blinks, you’ll learn to cut through all the noise about the economy and maintain focus. We all want to be informed and knowledgeable about financial markets and the economy. But listening to mainstream media can actually lead you astray. That’s because mainstream media often propagates a herd mentality: making us feel safer in numbers. So when we follow the media’s advice, we take comfort in knowing that we’re behaving the same way as everyone else. Intuitively, we might understand that just because everyone’s doing it, doesn’t mean it’s right – but we humans are anxious creatures so the herd is very appealing. While understandable, following the crowd can be costly. Take the subprime mortgage crisis of 2006, when housing prices fell 30 percent on average. Worse yet, stock market prices fell 57 percent from their October 2007 peak. These collapses resulted from the fact that both assets had been massively overvalued, because everyone was “following the herd” and buying them, driving their prices up. So be wise: Don’t follow the herd. Ignore (almost) everything the media says. The media does, of course, report some sound information; however, the sheer quantity makes it impossible to sift through and find what really matters. This saturation makes it very easy to follow the wrong advice. Examples of media misinformation abound. Here’s just one: In a 2010 article, The Economist happily declared, “America’s Back!” The feature provided a long list of positive indications of economic recovery. But as it turned out, their predictions were wrong – the economy stumbled again. Luckily, there’s a way to deal with all this financial misinformation: Be more aware of what’s driving all the news and rumors you encounter in mainstream media and, more generally, worry less about money. When you clear your mind of all that clutter and tune out the noise, you can get back in touch with your real goals. That way, when you have to think about money, you’ll think in terms of what matters to you. Do you know the difference between planning and formulating a plan? There’s a distinction: A plan makes predictive assumptions about the future. But no matter how hard we try to predict the future, we’ll be wrong. On the other hand, planning isn’t about predicting the future, it’s about preparing for it. Planning involves making decisions based on what is happening now, not assuming you know what’s to come. And it’s especially valuable because it leaves room for surprises. For example: In 2004 the author bought a $575,000 house, for which the previous owner had paid $400,000. When the value of the house rose to $1 million in 2007, the author expected house prices to continue rising, so he didn’t try to sell it to make a profit. But then when the market crashed, the author found himself owing more than the house was worth. Unfortunately, in a turbulent financial market, we will all face surprises like these some day. So how can you deal with them? Just make constant course corrections to stay on track with your financial goals, adjusting your planning as circumstances change. Think about it this way: Imagine you’re piloting a cross-country flight from Los Angeles to Miami. If you’re just a smidgen off-course when you take off, it’ll still seem like you’re flying in the right direction, but you’ll eventually end up in Maine. Most pilots wouldn’t let that happen. Similarly, staying on course for financial goals requires you to pay attention to where you are and to make small adjustments to your trajectory. To do that, it’s best to think in shorter time frames: Focus on the next three years, not the next 15. That way, you’re working towards a larger goal without getting overwhelmed by the big picture. Emotions make us human, but there’s a high cost to allowing your feelings to shape your financial decisions. So how can you avoid letting emotions dictate your finances? First of all, be honest with yourself: Great investments require just as much luck as skill. Sometimes you make smart decisions that lead to successful investments. Other times, you’re just lucky. Another way to avoid making emotional decisions is the Overnight Test: Ask yourself, if someone sold all your investments overnight, which stocks would you buy again tomorrow? In this theoretical situation, you might let a few investments go. We often hang on to investments just because we’re used to them, the same way we might hang on to a loveless relationship just because we’re comfortable with it. This is where the Overnight Test helps us cut through our pre-existing biases and re-evaluate our investments objectively. So if you’re unsure of whether to keep an investment, ask yourself: Would I buy it again tomorrow? If the answer is no, toss it. A third way to ensure your emotions aren’t guiding your finances: Always ensure the decision could potentially help you reach personal goals. Some people don’t do this. Instead, they buy a stock because it’s “the next big thing.” But investing in something just because it’s trendy isn’t really a financial choice. Here’s what is: Building savings for retirement. So think about what you actually want for yourself and your family in the future. Then ask yourself whether the potential investment plays a clear role in the portfolio you need to help meet these financial goals. Of course, its always possible that the rational decision won’t have the expected results. Because even if you take these precautions, investing always forces us to make decisions in the midst of uncertainty. The only thing you can do: Make the best possible decision today and take responsibility for the potential results. Children are taught to admit when they’ve done something wrong. But do we adults follow our own advice? If you’re not used to taking responsibility for your actions, it can be hard. But it’s essential to improving your finances. For example, an acquaintance of the author believed that buying expensive clothes and driving a BMW would make him more successful. But there was nothing beneath the surface of all this shiny stuff, and the cost of keeping up these appearances drove him into serious debt. Instead of faking success, he should have diligently worked his way up the career ladder. That’s hard work, and it requires patience and discipline. But to make a positive change, hard work is necessary. Another key to improving your finances is to keep examining your assumptions about what really impacts your financial situation. Too often we focus on irrelevant things. For example, one day the author took a long drive to get cheap gas. Midway through, he did some mental calculations: He realized that if he saved ten cents a gallon on a 20-gallon tank, the savings would add up to $2. That figure barely covered the amount of gas he used on the drive. If he had realized this sooner, he would have saved himself a long drive. As you can see, even financially solid-seeming plans like buying cheaper gas require closer scrutiny. However, although a thorough examination of your decisions helps ensure positive outcomes, you also need to realize you’re never fully in control. For example, if you send your daughter to Harvard, you’re making a huge investment in her financial future. But after graduation, your daughter might decide to teach underprivileged kids at an urban high school for $19,000 a year. For her, this is the right outcome. However, it’s not exactly what you expected when you decided to invest in her education. As these kinds of surprises can await any of us, it’s better to accept them beforehand. Many people feel that it’s still taboo to talk openly about money with friends and relatives. Since everyone has a different background and attitude toward it, money can sometimes feel like a dangerous topic. But if you’re committed to making sound financial decisions, it’s too important to skirt around. So if we want to avoid misunderstandings, we need to consider our own biases and strive to find a common language. Here’s a misunderstanding around money that arose in the author’s life: He and his wife were talking to a friend about the friend’s recent kitchen renovation, and as he detailed all the work that had been done, the author automatically started calculating the costs of the project. Later, he told his wife that they couldn’t afford their own renovation. His wife was confused, because she’d just been chatting about someone else’s kitchen renovation – not planning to embark on an identical project. And this after 15 years of marriage! If it gets this confusing for husbands and wives to talk about money, it can be even more upsetting to discuss the subject with our kids. But don’t let your discomfort stop you. Another example from the author’s life: His friend wanted to be honest with her children about finances. Whenever the children demanded an unreasonable purchase, she told her children, “We can’t afford that.” Far from being awkward, this tactic actually resulted in a fruitful family discussion: Their 14-year-old son asked how poor the family really was, on a scale from one to ten. As his parents quickly realized, the boy wasn’t disappointed in his family’s financial situation, but rather concerned about their well-being. So overall, talking about money with your family and friends can be truly beneficial, even when it’s uncomfortable. And in the end, these conversations can be treated in a frank, simple way. Have you ever heard the phrase, “Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication?” It also applies to your finances. Simple solutions can bring us closer to our goals, while complexity slows us down. For example, people spend $40 billion a year on weight loss programs even though the do-it-yourself approach – consuming fewer calories and exercising – is the most effective. Regardless, people get lost in complex commercial diet plans and products, and often don’t reach their goals. If they did, weight loss wouldn’t be a $40 billion industry. This is where simplicity comes in: Always keep it simple. Instead of buying expensive products, go running every morning. This principle can also guide your finances. Don’t buy into the latest fad, spend your money carefully and save gradually. This approach is called slow and steady capital. Building slow and steady capital requires you to avoid the temptations of instant gratification. In fact, delaying gratification is hugely important to long-term success overall. In the 1950s, Stanford launched a decade-long study that looked at people’s ability to delay gratification, and found that people who were better able to postpone the fulfillment of their desires experienced greater long-term success than those who gave in to temptation. So when it comes to accumulating your slow and steady capital, don’t look for huge short-term gains; instead, takes steps to accumulate long-term wealth slowly. This will help you avoid big losses and ensure financial security. Sounds boring? Good. Be boring in your financial habits.  Spend less than you earn. Set money aside. Pay your debt. Steer clear of large losses. This conservative approach to money can lead to big results over time. For example, the author once met a gentleman who had turned a relatively small inheritance into an impressive fortune. The author asked this man about the secret to his amazing financial success, and he replied, confused, that there was no secret. He had just avoided extravagant purchases and instead bought “boring things,” paying for them gradually like everyone else. The key message in this book: Sometimes there’s a rift between what we should do and what we actually do. This is called the behavior gap and it often prevents us from making smart financial decisions. We have to take steps to avoid this – and close the behavior gap – by being honest with ourselves and thoroughly examining the factors involved in our decisions. The keys to sustainable investments are keeping things simple and taking responsibility for our actions. Actionable advice: Take time each month to reflect on your personal goals and make sure your investments line up accordingly.  The best way to meet your investment goals is to align them with your personal goals. That way your financial decisions and your personal values will support, rather than work against each other. Let’s say you’re trying to decide whether to invest your savings in a bank account or in stock. If one of your personal goals is to buy a motorcycle in six months, then the bank account is probably a better option, since it’s less volatile than stocks and also easier to withdraw money from. But if your personal goal is to save up for your children’s college fund, and you only intend to withdraw money in 20 years time, then stocks are probably a better option, as they will generate higher profits.

Without it, we’d be stuck with the system our ancient ancestors used: barter. Trading chairs for pigs and candles for milk is all well and good as long as you have what your neighbor needs, but it’s a tricky system to scale up beyond a small village – and it’s all but useless in the global commodity trade. The trick is finding something that everyone will accept and trust. In the modern age, that meant paper currency backed by gold. The idea was simple yet effective. After all, few things are better suited to retaining value than precious metal. The result was an age of unprecedented growth and prosperity. Things started going wrong in the early twentieth century when governments abandoned what had become known as the “gold standard” and began simply printing money. The result? A century of boom and bust and increasing debt. We don’t need to return to gold if we want sound finances, however. In fact, there’s a new kid on the block that’s perfectly suited to our digital age: Bitcoin. Like gold, it’s a highly stable way of storing value over time and it can be used anywhere, anytime. If the new cryptocurrency can overcome some teething problems, it may become the new standard for a new age of growth. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why the arrival of new technologies spelled the end for an ancient rock currency; how governments have undermined the value of currencies to fund their wars since Caesar; and why Bitcoin is perfectly suited to play the role of a new standard. How does an economy work without money? Simple, you swap stuff. Call it barter, or direct exchange. You could trade two pigs for a cow, or for a haircut – it all depends on what you have and what your neighbor needs, or vice versa. But here’s the problem: sometimes those things don’t align. Don’t have anything to tempt your would-be trading partner? Well, tough luck – you won’t get what you want, either! That’s where money comes in. Because everyone wants it, you can use it for any transaction. That’s known as indirect exchange. Early money wasn’t anything like the stuff you keep in your wallet today, though. Take the inhabitants of Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. Well into the nineteenth century, they used “Rai stones” for their trading. These stones came in all shapes and sizes, the largest weighing a staggering four tons! When a new stone was ready, it was dragged up a hill so that everyone could see it. Its owner would then exchange ownership or part-ownership of the stone for goods and services. Every transaction was announced to the whole community, which in turn acknowledged the exchange. This kind of money worked for so long because it was salable. The Yap Islanders knew that if they owned Rai stones, they could also sell them. The added boon was that they could be used around the whole island since the stones were visible from any point. They were also divisible. If you wanted something small like a basket of fruit, you sold a small part of your stone; if you wanted something bigger like a raft, you sold a larger piece, or even the whole stone. So if Rai stones worked so well, why don’t the Islanders still use them today? Well, there was a snag: they didn’t retain their value, or salability over time. Initially, that hadn’t been an issue. Quarrying and moving them from nearby islands was such a difficult business that the supply of stones was limited and their value remained stable. That changed in the late nineteenth century with the arrival of David O’Keefe, an Irish-American captain who’d been shipwrecked on the island. O’Keefe started importing Rai stones in large numbers using modern technology to exchange for coconuts. Soon enough, they were so commonplace that they no longer worked as money – they had been transformed back into mere stones! The first money resembling the change in your pocket was a product of a revolutionary technology pioneered in early pre-Christian civilizations: metallurgy, the craft of smelting metals. This technology made it possible to create highly salable coins that were both small and light enough to be carried far and wide. One metal stood out from the crowd when it came to coinage – gold. Why? Well, it has a couple of unique features. First, it’s virtually impossible to destroy and can’t be synthesized using other materials. Also, if you want gold, you better have a shovel, because underground’s the only place you’ll find any decent amount of the stuff. Furthermore, the more gold you mine, the deeper you have to go to find more gold, meaning that, even as gold-mining technologies improve, the supply of gold grows slowly and predictably. Combine all those traits and you have a material that’s incredibly effective as a store of value, which makes it salable across time. It didn’t take long for people to figure this out. King Croesus was commissioning gold coins in Greece over 2,500 years ago! Gold may have been around forever, but the love affair between money and gold only really blossomed in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. That’s gone down in history as the age of sound money. But before we define this term, let’s provide a little context. These centuries were shaped by rapid advances in communications and transportation. Technologies like the telegraph and trains made it easier than ever for both people and goods to get from point A to point B. That, in turn, justified the increasing use of ultraconvenient, nonphysical forms of payment like checks, paper receipts and bills. But how do you convince merchants and consumers that the pieces of paper they’re using to buy and sell are worth anything? The answer governments worldwide came up with was to issue paper money backed by precious metals, which they stored in vaults. In the leading European nations, the most commonly used metal was gold. Britain led the way, with Isaac Newton - who was Warden of the Royal Mint at the time - introducing the \"gold standard\" in 1717. By 1900, around 50 other countries had followed suit and officially adopted the same standard. Gold became increasingly marketable – and thus increasingly valuable – as more and more nations issued paper currency backed by gold reserves. This was sound money: the markets had chosen gold freely as the best store of value, and money was now backed by it. In the first century CE, the Roman emperor Julius Caesar issued the “aureus,” a coin containing roughly eight grams of gold. It became a standard method of payment across the Roman Empire. But as growth in the Empire began to slow, rulers started “coin clipping” – a sneaky practice whereby a portion of the precious metal contained in coins was removed to bolster the government’s spending power. Easy money, right? Maybe, but it eventually drove up inflation and triggered a series of economic crises that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the once-mighty Roman Empire! But the gold standard had one major flaw: the gold had to be stored in a small number of bank vaults. This facilitated the exchange of paper money for gold, but it also created a highly centralized system in which governments controlled the value of paper money. If they wanted to, they could always increase the supply of money without increasing the corresponding amount of gold. The salability of paper money, in other words, was entirely at their mercy. In 1914, nearly every major European power decided to make the most of this. War had broken out and they needed cash to fund their operations. Rather than raising taxes, they followed the Romans’ lead and simply printed new money. But it wasn’t “backed” by gold, and while the printing machines churned out new notes and bills, no new gold was added to the banks’ vaults. Within a couple of weeks, the countries fighting the First World War had suspended the convertibility of paper money into gold. The standard had been abandoned. That had two effects. First, this source of ready cash allowed governments to continue funding their war efforts for four more blood-soaked years. The second result of this money-printing spree was to severely undermine the value of existing currencies. The Austro-Hungarian krone, for example, fell by 68.9 percent compared to the Swiss franc – a currency that remained tied to the gold standard thanks to Switzerland’s decision to remain neutral and sit the war out. Both factors would go on to play a major role in shaping the economic life of postwar Europe. When the First World War came to an end in 1918, the European powers that had been involved in the conflict faced the thorny issue of revaluing their currencies. The obvious solution was to return to the gold standard, but a fair revaluation compared to gold would have been an unpopular admission of how little currencies were now worth. Returning to the old exchange rates wasn’t possible, either, as it would have overvalued paper currencies. The result would have been a flood of citizens demanding gold for their paper receipts, gold that they could then have sold abroad for a profit. So the governments chose to introduce fiat money – money backed by decree rather than gold. The adoption of fiat money led to an age of unsound money shaped by ever-greater intervention in the economy as governments scrambled to stabilize the value of their currencies. By 1944, the end of the Second World War was in sight and the victors began planning the postwar economic order. This was called the Bretton Woods system, a reference to the small New Hampshire village in which they signed their agreement. The basic idea was that all the world’s currencies would be tied to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate. The dollar would in turn be tied to the value of gold, again at a fixed exchange rate. The newly created International Monetary Fund – IMF – would be in charge of policing these exchange rates. Incredibly, the whole system required all participating countries’ gold reserves to be transported to the United States! In theory, Bretton Woods resembled the pre-1914 gold standard, as all currencies were ostensibly exchangeable for gold. In practice, it didn’t quite work like that. The United States bent the rules and inflated its own currency compared to gold while other nations inflated their currencies compared to the dollar to fund economic expansion. Eventually, the pretense was dropped and gold was completely abandoned as a standard. Keeping a rapidly inflating currency tied to gold was simply impossible. On August 15, 1971, President Nixon announced that dollars would no longer be convertible to gold. From now on, the value of currencies would be freely determined by the interplay of the world’s major fiat currencies. As we’ll see in the following blink, the results would be disastrous. Sound money reached its high-water mark in the nineteenth century. Paper money was backed by gold, a precious metal adopted by the free market due to the qualities that made it such an effective store of value. That, in turn, underwrote an era of prosperity. Let’s take a closer look at how that worked. The first thing to note about sound money is that it’s a great way of encouraging people to save and invest – the perfect recipe for sustainable, long-term growth. Why? Well, humans have a natural positive time preference: we prefer instant gratification over future gratification. Sound money nudges us to think more about the future. After all, if we can reasonably expect our money’s value to increase over time, it makes sense to take a look at what we can do now to maximize our future income. And that’s what investment’s all about – postponing gratification today to reap greater rewards tomorrow. Investment thus leads to capital accumulation. People pump money into producing capital goods, commodities that can be used to create other goods and revenue streams in the future. And the more capital accumulation there is, the greater the chance of stable, long-term economic growth. The problem with unsound money is that it distorts capital accumulation. The reason for this is simple. When governments interfere with the money supply by, say, manipulating interest rates, they also interfere with prices. That’s an issue because prices give investors the information they need to make good decisions without having to learn every tiny detail about global events. If a Malaysian businesswoman decides against expanding her offices because the cost of copper wiring has skyrocketed, she doesn’t need to know that the price spike is due to a recent earthquake in Chile. The price tells her everything she needs to know. Government intervention, however, means that prices no longer reflect market movements. Investors don’t have the information they need, thus distorting capital accumulation. Unsound-money policies like those implemented by European governments during the First World War create all sorts of problems. Two issues stand out – recessions and the endless accumulation of debt. In this blink, we’ll find out why. Let’s start with recessions. Government interference in the market takes the form of central planning. Here’s the rub. No single person, agency or department ever has access to all the information necessary to understand the vast and constantly changing web of preferences, choices, costs and resources that define an economy. And if you don’t have that information, you’re bound to make bad decisions – and this is precisely what governments do when they manipulate the money supply. Their interventions distort markets, especially capital markets, creating a “boom and bust” cycle. During the upcycle, artificially inflated money tricks investors into thinking they can buy more capital than they can afford. The resulting boom soon becomes a bubble; when it pops, the economy goes into recession. Then there’s debt. To see how unsound money leads economies to become indebted, let’s take a look at the Great Depression in the 1930s. During that era, governments increasingly adopted policies favored by the British economist John Maynard Keynes. According to Keynes and his followers, the “Keynesians,” recessions happen when total spending is too low in an economy. The best way to respond to recessions, they argued, is to increase spending. How do you do that? Well, you could lower taxes, but people don’t usually spend their extra money. The only other option is for the government to provide the cash for all that spending. Because raising taxes in the middle of a recession is difficult, governments invariably decide to increase the money supply. This has secondary effects on the way people spend money. Remember the idea of time preference from the previous blink? All that cash sloshing around the economy tends to push people into focusing on the present. Saving becomes less attractive and a culture of unwise, opportunistic investment takes hold. Soon enough, people are up to their eyeballs in debt. The overall effect is endless crisis. Government intervention causes recessions and the Keynesian response makes things even worse. But there is an alternative. We need to return to sound money and a new gold standard. The new technology of Bitcoin might just help us do that. After decades of reckless spending and debt accumulation, it’s high time that governments mend their ways and return to sound-money policies. That’s where Bitcoin comes in. So how exactly can the world’s first digital currency help put economies on the road to recovery, stability and growth? Think back to the gold standard. Markets chose gold to store value for two reasons – it’s scarce and it’s predictable, meaning that there’s little risk of the supply increasing enough to significantly deflate its value. Bitcoin has similar traits. In fact, its supply is literally fixed. Whatever else happens, there will never be more than 21,000,000 individual bitcoins. Once that number is in circulation, no additional bitcoins will be issued. The way bitcoins are created also leads to stability since the supply of the currency grows at a constantly diminishing rate. Here’s how that works. Like gold, bitcoins are mined. To access new coins, computers across the Bitcoin network pool their processing powers to solve complex algorithmic problems. Once these puzzles have been cracked, the “miners” – the computers that helped crack the puzzle – receive bitcoins as a reward. To prevent online gold rushes, Bitcoin’s designer, Satoshi Nakamoto, added an inbuilt failsafe – the number of bitcoins issued is halved every four years. The icing on the cake? The algorithmic problems become more and more difficult to solve as the number of computers working on them rises, guaranteeing a steady and reliable supply in much the same way as the increasing difficulty of mining gold makes the supply of gold steady and reliable. Bitcoin will continue being issued in ever-smaller quantities until 2140, after which no more coins will be released. That makes bitcoins unique. They’re the only good that is defined by absolute scarcity. Compare that to conventional commodities like oil and gas. We think of them as scarce, but we also know that if we’re willing to invest the necessary resources we’ll probably be able to find new sources. For all our increasing consumption of oil, total proven oil reserves globally are increasing! Bitcoin is radically different. No amount of time or resources can create more coins than the algorithmically programed supply allows. The upshot is that bitcoin can never be devalued by manipulating the supply, making it a perfect store of value. Sound money isn’t just about the scarcity of the unit in which its value is stored. It also needs to be secure. After all, if you’re not absolutely convinced that bitcoins are safe, you’re likely to look for an alternative. Luckily, the digital currency is also incredibly secure. That’s because of the Bitcoin ledger, which uses an innovative technology called the public blockchain. So what’s that? Well, when mining computers crack an algorithmic puzzle, they create a block. This is essentially a record of all recent transactions and mining activity. Each block is added to a chain of older blocks, creating the Bitcoin blockchain. This ledger contains every last detail about every blockchain transaction ever completed. And here’s the kicker: all that information is available to every network user. Ownership of bitcoins is only valid once it’s been registered on the blockchain, which is only possible if the majority of network users approve it. That means the Bitcoin network is entirely self-sustaining; there’s no need for a central authority to oversee transactions. More importantly in terms of security, it also means verifying transactions is easier than cheating. That’s because would-be fraudsters need to expend a significant amount of processing power on creating a fraudulent block – and, thanks to Nakamoto’s difficulty adjustment, it will become even more difficult as bitcoin increases in popularity. Verifying new blocks, on the other hand, requires virtually no energy. A majority of nodes can simply refuse a suspect block without making a dent in their processing power. It’s an effective fail-safe because it stacks the odds against cheats. Even if a user decided to expend vast amounts of energy and successfully hacked a majority of all network nodes to approve a fraudulent block, they’d still gain very little. Breaching Bitcoin’s security would quickly undermine trust in the network, leading to a drop in demand and value. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face! We know Bitcoin is both scarce and secure, but is that enough to make it more than a flash in the pan? The answer depends on how well it can master a couple of major challenges. Take price volatility. When bitcoins were first used to complete a transaction in May 2010, an individual coin was valued at $0.000994 US dollars. Fast forward to October 2017 and that had risen to $4,200 – an increase of 422,520,000 percent! And that’s just long-term volatility. In 2017 alone, the value of a bitcoin jumped from $750 to $20,000. These fluctuations are a product of demand. The supply of bitcoins is fixed so the currency can only respond to rising interest through price. Because Bitcoin is new, demand has naturally been highly variable. The result, however, has been to undermine the currency’s status as an effective store of value. Will things settle down? Well, according to the author, these fluctuations should even out as the market grows. That brings us to the second challenge facing Bitcoin. If the currency is to become a new standard, it needs to grow; but growth, even for Bitcoin, would eventually depend on an increasing reliance on large, centralized institutions. That’s an issue when a currency is designed to give people an exchange system that doesn’t rely on government-approved third parties like banks! Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a way to square this circle. Bitcoin’s transaction limit is currently set at 500,000 per day. That could be increased, but whatever the new figure, there’s no getting round the fact that there’ll be a daily cap. Then there’s the question of costs. The more transactions take place, the more nodes there’ll need to be. That increases the number of copies of the Bitcoin ledger that need to be updated, ratcheting up both transaction fees and the amount of processing power expended. Put these facts together and you’ve got a pretty compelling case for taking bitcoin trade off the blockchain – in other words, trade in currencies backed by bitcoin. That would create a new standard, but it would also mean that centralized institutions would need to be created to manage this system. Bitcoin may well provide a framework for establishing a contemporary sound-money policy. A question hangs over its future, however: will it be able to dodge the fate of the gold standard? Only time will tell. The key message in these blinks: Money has come in all shapes and sizes throughout history, but there’s only ever been one truly sound system: money backed by gold. The “gold standard” underwrote an age of prosperity and stability. That all changed in the early twentieth century, when European governments abandoned gold and fiscal prudence to fund their war efforts. The world hasn’t been the same since, and we’ve endured decades of rising debt and boom-and-bust cycles. High time for a change, then. That’s where Bitcoin comes in. Like gold, it’s a highly effective unit of exchange. But if it’s going to lead us to a new age of sound money, the digital currency will have to overcome some teething problems.  Got feedback?

We’re going to lose that extra weight, get that promotion, and finally realize our dreams. And then we wake up the next day and say, “Meh, maybe next week.” But the problem isn’t our goals or ourselves, or even our attitude. The problem is our approach. Why do we think we can just wake up and snap our fingers and change everything? Not only is it unlikely to happen, it’s also potentially dangerous. The Compound Effect offers another path. Build up momentum, make a plan, slowly change our bad habits into good ones, and tackle our personal limits. From the publisher of Success magazine, The Compound Effect represents a concrete how-to guide for reaching your goals and becoming successful. After reading these blinks, you’ll learn what Arnold Schwarzenegger’s weight-lifting technique can teach you about success; how to build up momentum like Michael Phelps; and why aiming for the quickest possible successes can damage your health. Fast money and fast promotions: we’re all looking for immediate results these days. But really, it’s long-term changes that produce positive differences and are far more rewarding. In this age of “now, now, now!” we eat fast food because cooking takes too long, we go on quick-fix diet plans to drop 20 pounds in a week, and become restless if we’re not promoted within a year. However, the more quickly we reach a goal, the bigger the consequences can be. It’s not healthy to expect instantaneous results. When you don’t lose those 20 pounds in seven days, you might become disillusioned and think you never deserved a better life anyway. What you need to do is take little steps, because daily, small, positive actions are the secret to long-term success. Take Scott, for example. Instead of trying to shed 20 pounds in a week, he cut 125 calories from his daily diet, listened to self-improvement recordings as he commuted to work, and walked a little extra each day. The result? In 31 months, he lost 15 kilos, and even got a promotion and pay rise at work. Using the Compound Effect means knowing that every decision you make creates your destiny, and that you must work consistently before you can experience success. Then, when you reach your goals, you have to maintain discipline if you wish to build on them, or your hard work will be for nothing. Think of those restaurants that become so popular that you have to wait ages to get a table. They take their success for granted and stop doing what got them there in the first place. Then, suddenly, the service and menus become lackluster, and no one goes there anymore. It’s crucial to avoid becoming dismayed when you don’t see immediate effects, and to ensure you keep generating good results. So what are the keys to consistent success? Sometimes we don’t want to admit it, but our choices are what shape our destiny and we are responsible for what we do or don’t do. Sometimes it’s the seemingly insignificant decisions that prevent us from being successful. For instance, no one wants to become obese, or declare bankruptcy, but these are the consequences of multiple poor – but small – choices. You’re probably familiar with the situation where you find yourself scoffing a bag of chips and after you’ve finished the bag, you realize you’ve ruined a day of healthy eating. It’s hard to admit that you alone are responsible for your actions. Maybe you think it’s bad luck, but that’s just an excuse for your poor choices. We can all be lucky. In order to “be lucky,” you just need to know how to spot good opportunities. You need to connect your decisions with the right motivation and clear goals, because when you have defined goals, you can focus on them far more effectively. Your mind will start to see the opportunities in front of you and you’ll start reaching them. Remember the Law of Attraction – “like attracts like.” Thinking about positive actions will draw positive things toward you. So, what are your goals? What makes you happy? Consider the areas of business, health, spirituality, family and lifestyle and note down all the attributes, behaviors and characteristics you need to reach those goals, and try to apply them to your everyday life. This means cutting out old habits. List your bad habits so you can see when and where you act in a way that isn’t good for you. For example, if you must eat something sweet after a meal, have some fruit or honey nearby for a healthier treat. It also helps if you’re surrounded by people with similar goals to you, and if you have patience with yourself. So we’ve learned that you take the first step to kickstarting your success when you make the right decisions. But how do you maintain that habit? You use The Big Mo. If you keep your healthy behavior up for a long enough time, you’ll fall into a natural, consistent rhythm. As you keep that pace, you’ll keep making the right decisions, and start feeling unstoppable! That’s the power of The Big Mo – the big momentum. It’s the most powerful driving force for success. Take swimmer Michael Phelps. His coach only let him finish training early once in 12 years, when he was allowed 15 minutes off so he could attend a school dance. But all that practice led to Big Mo, culminating in eight gold Olympic medals. To keep momentum rolling, your healthy behavior has to be built into your daily routine, so you’ll need a plan. Remember to be realistic and don’t try to do everything in a short period of time. Instead, create a routine that enables you to ease into your new life. So scrap the idea of hitting the gym for two hours every day! Going three days a week for one hour, and sticking to it, is far better. When building momentum, the length of time you work out isn’t that important. What matters is that you keep showing up. Next, eliminate situations that cause you to stray from your goals. The media, for example, can have a negative effect on your energy without you even noticing. Commercials, news about war, and so on, can wreak havoc on your attitude and expectations. Instead of tuning in to the news, why not listen to an inspirational CD or chat with someone you love? Finally, be aware of your environment. Sometimes you have to change it in order to fulfill your dreams. People, too, influence you significantly, so keep supportive folks around you to keep your momentum going. As you progress, you’re bound to hit some personal limits. The question is, will you stop pushing, or will you break through the wall? The wall of your discipline and routines represents the gap between your old self and your improved, stronger self. You’ll find your new habits will compound and you’ll change into a more successful person. So when you come to the limit of what you think you can achieve, push through that limit to get quicker results and multiply your success. Remember Arnold Schwarzenegger’s famous Cheating Principle for weight training? When you’ve reached the maximum number of lifts you can manage, lean back to access other muscle groups to support the working muscles. Doing this enables you to add five or six more reps to your set. Similarly, pushing through your personal limits will only make you stronger. Picture a scenario in which you’ve come within five pounds of your weight-loss goal, then hit a wall because of work stress. Remember, you already know how to be disciplined, make good choices, and build momentum without your old self-destructive behavior. So choose to push through, and you’ll find you won’t just achieve your goal, you’ll also be even stronger. It’s always to your own benefit to push yourself a little more, go for a little longer and prepare a little better. That’s why the author invests a great deal of time researching all he can about the companies to whom he gives keynote speeches. The extra work he puts in is more than what’s expected of him, and this makes his speeches extremely popular. So if you want to put yourself ahead of others and your old self, you need to break through your limits. The key message in this book: The keys to success are realizing that you’re responsible for your life, forming healthy daily habits, cultivating discipline and pushing past your comfort zone. Getting to your goals at lightning speed can sometimes be detrimental and is often not possible. Instead, steady progress and patience will get you where you really want to be. Actionable advice: Prove you’re the boss To prove to yourself that you’re really in control of your behavior and decisions, for 30 days abstain from smoking, quit drinking your favorite wine or eat one healthy meal per day. Completing this goal will help convince you that you really are the boss of your own life.

People whose remarkable talents have helped shape the history of art, literature and science. But how did these people become so accomplished in their creative fields, and how can we emulate their success? In these blinks, we’ll explore the scientific and social underpinnings of success. We’ll go on a journey that looks at some of history’s geniuses – such as Leonardo da Vinci and Charles Darwin – and ask whether their success was down to unique inspiration, convenient timing or merely good luck. We’ll look at the sorts of friends and teachers the most successful people had by their side, and explore the hidden phenomenon behind many successful products and creative ideas: the creative curve. In the following blinks, you’ll discover the surprising truth about the relationship between intelligence and creativity; the reason why the most popular creative ideas are more familiar than they are original; and how your friends influence your creative potential. How creative would you say you are? If you want to find out, start by trying to think of as many uncommon ways you could use a hairdryer as possible. One idea might be to use it as a leaf blower. This exercise is a test of your ability for divergent thinking – the ability to find multiple solutions to a problem. Divergent thinking is strongly associated with creativity. In other words, the more ways you thought of using that hairdryer, the more creative potential you probably have. Looking at people’s divergent thinking abilities has helped scientists understand the relationship between creativity and intelligence.   In 2013, Austrian psychologists investigating creativity and intelligence found that once participants’ IQ scores went above 86, their score was no longer predictive of their divergent thinking abilities. A person with a genius-level IQ of 150 was no more likely to think of more solutions to a problem than someone with a more average IQ of 100. In other words, beyond a relatively low threshold, your overall intelligence makes no difference to your potential for creativity. Around 80% of the world’s population has an IQ above this threshold of 86. Astoundingly, this means that roughly three billion people are walking around with the same creative potential as the geniuses we are taught to idolize. So how can more of us unlock this potential? Research indicates that it all comes down to practice. But not just any type of practice – it must enable you to expand your skills and challenge yourself. Studies by Professor K. Anders Ericsson of Florida State University have found that to become an expert in any field, one must practice in a way that emphasizes tangible goals and continual feedback. When studying professional violinists, Ericsson found that although all the violinists spent a similar number of hours practicing, the most accomplished among them were more purposeful: The most expert performers would ensure that a teacher regularly listened to and critiqued their playing, thus providing a feedback mechanism. They also asked their teachers to assign practice exercises they weren’t yet proficient at and worked on them until they became competent. In this way, they always had clear goals to work toward. So if you want to unleash your creative potential, don’t just practice the same skills over and over again in isolation. Make it your mission to continually develop skills and seek regular feedback. Why do we consider some people geniuses? Charles Darwin, for instance, is often considered a genius for discovering natural selection. But dig a little deeper into the history of his discovery, and all is not as it seems. Despite what you may have heard, Darwin was not the only person to develop the theory of natural selection. That honor also goes to one of Darwin’s contemporaries, Alfred Wallace. But unfortunately, history has all but forgotten Wallace, while Darwin is celebrated for his genius. This should give us pause for thought. Are those we deem geniuses really so unique and special? Arguably, there were other factors that give them their lauded status. Timing plays a big role when it comes to who society deems a genius. Indeed, the world remembers Charles Darwin more than it does Wallace because of Darwin’s canny sense of urgency. In 1858, upon hearing that Wallace was working on the very same theory that he was, Darwin quickly arranged for a presentation of his ideas to the Linnean Society – an important scientific institution – thereby appearing as if he were the primary driving force behind the theory of evolution. And Wallace? He was in no rush to take credit for what was as much his idea as it was Darwin’s, choosing instead to sail around the world for several more years before publishing his own account of the theory. By the time he finally returned home, Darwin’s 1859 book The Origin of The Species had already been published, and Darwin had written himself into the scientific history books forever. Timing also creates geniuses in a broader sense too, in that geniuses are inextricably linked to their historical context. Take the pop artist Andy Warhol – often considered one of the creative geniuses of the twentieth century. Imagine if he had created his masterpieces during the Italian Renaissance. Would he still have been thought of as a genius? It’s more likely he would have been labeled as a heretic and his works destroyed before future generations had a chance to appreciate them. Similarly, what if that genius of the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci, had completed his priceless paintings in the era of pop art. Far from being thought of as a creative genius, his work would have been considered hopelessly dated. Why? Because this form of artistic expression would’ve already been explored hundreds of years earlier. Therefore it’s important to recognize that geniuses are often a product of their time, rather than universally brilliant individuals. What makes us like some things, and turn away from others? The answer to this difficult question might be found by looking at the fortunes of a clothing brand. In 2009, popular tattoo artist Don Ed Hardy sold the rights to his designs to a fashion company, and soon Ed Hardy clothing became the must-have celebrity item. Before the end of the year, the brand had sold $700 million in clothes and accessories. Everyone everywhere seemed to be wearing Ed Hardy. But then something strange happened. By the end of 2009, Ed Hardy clothing had become an embarrassing cliché and sales had tanked. Why did it go so wrong? The fortunes of the Ed Hardy clothing brand are a perfect example of what the author has deemed the creative curve. The creative curve describes our paradoxical preference for both familiarity and novelty. Research indicates that the more familiar we are with something, the more we like it. For instance, researchers at the University of Michigan conducted a study in which participants were shown a number of made-up Chinese characters. They were told that each character represented either a positive or a negative adjective. Researchers then exposed participants to each of these characters either a greater or fewer number of times. When asked afterward, the participants overwhelmingly thought that the characters they’d seen more often represented something positive, while those they’d seen less often stood for something negative. The researchers concluded that the more familiar we are with something, the more positive associations we have with it. This explains the explosion in popularity of Hardy’s clothing brand throughout 2009. As people saw it more and more often, they developed positive associations with it, in turn driving up sales. But why did people stop buying Ed Hardy clothing as quickly as they did? This can be explained by the flipside of the creative curve – our desire for novelty. Researchers have discovered that in addition to our desire for familiarity, we also have a counter-desire for novelty. One study found that once participants had been played a song eight times, they began to like it less and less each time they heard it. This phenomenon explains the rise and fall of the Ed Hardy clothing brand. People liked the clothes more when they began to see them more often, but as soon as they became ubiquitous their desire for novelty kicked in, and they quickly ditched them. In 1982, a small video rental store in Arizona became wildly popular with film enthusiasts. But the long queues that formed every night weren’t down to its stellar selection of movies. The store was so popular because movie buffs wanted film recommendations from its 18-year-old clerk, Ted Sarandos. Fast forward 30 years and Ted Sarandos is now the chief content officer at Netflix – responsible for commissioning shows such as Stranger Things and Orange Is the New Black. Why have people always been so interested in Ted’s opinions? In fact, Ted Sarandos’ success is all thanks to his in-depth knowledge of the creative curve. As a college student working part-time in the video store, Ted decided to pass the time by watching each and every film in the well-stocked store. After several months of intense viewing, Ted became a walking recommendation machine. Customers would tell him what films they liked and Ted could give them any number of excellent suggestions in return. Through his massive consumption of films, Ted developed cultural awareness: a finely tuned knowledge of what films would feel familiar to his customers, which films were good and which were cliché. At the tender age of 18, Ted was skilled enough to know where a film would fit on the creative curve. Nowadays, Ted uses his knowledge of the creative curve to decide what sort of films and TV shows to commission for Netflix. He even acknowledges the creative curve himself, stating that the kind of content he looks out for are shows that have “one foot in familiarity and one foot in something really fresh, unknown, and novel.” And it’s not just film buffs who use mass consumption to build their knowledge of the creative curve. When the author conducted interviews with professionals from across the creative disciplines, including songwriters, painters and chefs, they all reported spending around one-fifth of their day – that’s roughly 3 or 4 hours – engaging in mass consumption of material related to their particular creative industry. Painters were continually attending art exhibitions, chefs carved out time to dine at exciting new restaurants and songwriters were constantly listening to music both new and old. So in order to reach the top of your creative game, be sure to spend about 20% of your time consuming the output of your chosen industry. After all, the insights you make might take you as far as Ted Sarandos. Ask around for long enough and you’ll soon find people who dream of writing a novel. But dig a little deeper, and you’ll also find that many of these folk would shy away from ever putting pen to paper. Why? Because they don’t think they have what it takes to become a successful author. Either they don’t think they have a way with words, or just don’t think they’re smart enough to manage it. But what if writing a successful novel had much less to do with writing ability or smarts than we assume, and everything to do with where the book falls on the creative curve? If this is true, then that spot on the bestseller list might not be so out of reach. Beverly Jenkins is a highly successful author whose success is largely thanks to her books’ winning combination of familiarity and novelty. That is, they fall right on the creative curve’s sweet spot. As a young girl, Jenkins loved to read just about anything she could get her hands on in the local library. But as an adult, when she got home from her mundane administrative job, she loved nothing more than settling down with a historical romance novel. Jenkins soon spotted a problem with her favorite genre: all the characters in these romances were white. In fact, in any of the popular romance books she read, none of the lovers were ever written as African-American. Despite having no prior writing experience, she quickly decided that she would be the author to fill this particular gap in the market. The rest, as they say, is history. These days, she’s known as the creator of a new genre of literature – black historical romance – and her books have sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.   The reason Jenkins’ books are so popular is because of their positioning on the creative curve. Firstly, they combine all the familiar elements of traditional romance novels: they never fail to provide a happy ending, and the lovers always reach a crisis point in their relationship before eventually reconciling. However, true to the rules of the creative curve, Jenkins’ books also bring something refreshingly novel to their readers. All her stories focus on African-American protagonists – a perspective that had been sorely lacking in the romance novels that came before. Next time you’re thinking of whether you really could write that book, think less about your writing talent and more about whether your idea hits the creative curve’s sweet spot. You just might be the next publishing sensation. When we think of a creative genius, we often imagine an inspired individual, feverishly working away. They might be slaving away on a creative project in a remote cabin, or in a futuristic office, but one thing’s for sure – the genius of our imagination usually works alone. This idea of the isolated genius is handed down to us through popular culture. Consider the character of Tony Stark – the hero of the Iron Man films – a solitary genius who single-handedly builds his eponymous robotic suits. But when we take a closer look at reality, our notions of the lone creative genius quickly fall apart. Creativity has a social component that’s often overlooked, but highly significant. In other words, it takes a community to make a creative genius. A 1992 study by researchers from the University of California looked at the social networks of thousands of innovators and scientists. Their findings showed that the quality of these social networks could predict the longevity and productivity of the innovators’ careers and predict how prominent they would be in their field. Additionally, research into high-achieving artists found that the quality of their reputations was directly associated to the number of relationships they had with other high-achieving artists. Successful artists who had more relationships with other successful artists had stronger reputations. Finally, research conducted in 1985 looking at a variety of world-renowned performers found that not one had honed their skills alone, but with a teacher who was both relentless and experienced. This research demonstrates what would be clear to see if one were to visit the offices of the man who is often posited as the real-life Tony Stark: Elon Musk. Musk is the founder of the technology companies Tesla and SpaceX. Far from being the lone creative genius we often assume, Musk has thousands of employees who enable his creation of futuristic cars, rockets and spaceships. So if you’re looking to become a world-class innovator, it pays to take a few talented friends, teachers or employees with you along the way. The key message in these blinks: We’re quick to mystify the notion of talent and eager to label a chosen few as geniuses, but the true nature of these concepts is less mysterious and more formulaic than conventional wisdom suggests. Community, great timing, a hefty dose of familiarity and a dash of novelty all contribute to what we recognize as creative genius. Actionable advice: Successful creatives need prominent promoters. If you want society to consider you a genius, you’ll need to do more than work hard and produce good work. You’ll also be needing a hefty amount of social recognition – society needs to believe that you and your work is credible. So you’ll need to take a particular kind of friend with you on your journey to success: a prominent promoter. This is someone who champions your work and introduces you to your target audience. Your friend should also be a credible creative force within that field too, so that when they begin to advocate on your behalf, other people will respect their judgement. Got feedback?

Indeed, most of us will have a tough time just remembering the mathematical concepts we were taught in high school. This is where The Economist Numbers Guide comes in handy, presenting a wide array of mathematical tools that are useful for solving complex problems in business environments. These blinks will show you how to create forecasts, how to use data to make decisions in risky and uncertain situations, and how to avoid drawing false conclusions from your data.   In these blinks, you’ll learn that two times two doesn’t always equal four; how a straight line in a chart can be very deceptive; and how fast food chains decide whether to open large or small restaurants. Basic mathematical concepts are invaluable in plenty of everyday situations. Of course, they’re vital in business situations too, but it’s important to ensure that you’re applying these concepts correctly. Take percentages. They can be applied to just about any problem involving financial growth or decline, but beware of the common traps! Suppose you’ve made an investment of $1,000, which is now worth $1,700. How much has the value increased in relative terms? Percentages will give you the answer if you first subtract the initial value from the current value –  $1700 - $1000 = $700 – then divide this difference by the beginning value and multiply by 100: ($700 ÷ $1000) × 100 = 70 percent. It seems simple enough, but beware of the typical slipups. First, remember: A percentage increase followed by the same percentage decrease does not leave you where you started; it leaves you worse off. So, if $1,000 grows by 50 percent, the sum is $1,500; however, a 50 percent loss on $1,500 would leave $750. Moreover, percentages and percentage changes are often confused. If, for instance, a growth rate increases from 10 percent to 20 percent, it has risen by ten percentage points. But the percentage change is not 10 percent – it’s 100 percent, because the growth rate has doubled. Rounding is another practical tool that can be applied incorrectly. Rounding comes in handy in day-to-day activities to simplify dealing with numbers. Values ending in four or less are rounded down, while amounts ending in five or more are rounded up. But take care to only round the numbers after making any calculations. Take the numbers 1.5 and 2.4, which both round to 2. Now, 1.5 times 1.5 is 2.25, which rounds to 2, while 2.4 times 2.4 is 5.76, which rounds to 6. So, the right answer to “two times two” could be anywhere between two and six! If you’re considering making an investment, you’ll be keen to work out how much your money will be worth in the future. You can calculate this by taking two factors into account: interest rates and inflation. Interest is the price paid for the use of money, so the calculation of interest rates is crucial when comparing investment opportunities. Suppose you invested $100 for five years at an interest rate of six percent per year. The interest earnings from your investment are then calculated as such: $100 × 5 × 0.06 = $30. You can also calculate the future value of your money, which is the initial value plus the interest earnings. So, your five-year $100 investment at six percent interest will have a future value of $130. If you consider investing $100 for five years at six percent or for three years at eight percent, you can easily calculate the future value of these two investment opportunities, making for a clear and easy comparison. We can see that the latter opportunity yields earnings of only $24, but you get your money back earlier. However, you also need to consider inflation when investing. Inflation can be seen as the opposite of interest: interest adds value, while inflation decreases it. Let’s say you want to have $10,000 in your bank account in five years. If the interest rate is six percent per year and inflation is at ten percent per year, how much money should you put into your bank account today? First, calculate the net annual rate of change by subtracting the ratio of inflation to interest rate from one: 1 - (1.10 ÷ 1.06) = -0.038, or -3.8 percent per yearr year. Then, use this rate of change to calculate the accumulated cost of inflation: $10,000 × 5 × 0.038 = $1,900. So, this means that in order to have $10,000 of current value in your account in five years, you’ll need to deposit an additional $1,900, or $11,900 in total. Let’s look at three tools that, when combined, offer a highly effective way of describing any set of related numbers. To help put them into practice, start by considering the number of sales that a real estate company makes per day. First, you need a way to measure the average or \"midpoint\" value of a set of numbers. The most common way of measuring an average is by finding the mean, which is done by adding all the scores together and dividing the sum by the number of scores. So, if our company sold one, two and three houses per day, respectively, over three days, the mean is calculated as (1 + 2 + 3) ÷ 3, which equals a mean of two sales per day. Next, we need a measure of the spread around the average. An average becomes much more meaningful when it is accompanied by an indicator of how widely the numbers are spread around it. The standard deviation is a great indicator of exactly that. You can calculate the standard deviation by first finding the mean. Then, for each number value, subtract the mean and square the result. Finally, find the mean of these squared differences and take the square root of the result. In our example, the standard deviation is one. But, if it were five or six, this would suggest that there are periods without any sales, and some days with many. Finally, we need a measure of shape. Collections of numbers can be shaped differently. This means that numbers can be distributed symmetrically around the average (1, 2 ,3), or skewed to one side (1, 2, 3000; which, incidentally, would result in an average of 1001). The most common shape for collections of random numbers is normal distribution, where the numbers are distributed symmetrically around the mean. With these three tools, it’s possible to make many different kinds of sales predictions. You’ll be even better equipped to do so when you have a way of presenting these predictions, which is exactly what the next blink will investigate. In reports and presentations, tables and charts can be instrumental in conveying your message. They can bring order to your data, while still displaying all the original information. Tables tend to serve one of two main functions, presenting data or interpreting it. Tables that present data are designed to be used by others. They should follow the rule of three: First, make tables concise and eliminate non-essential information by, for instance, rounding. Second, make tables informative by including summary amounts such as row and column totals or averages. Third, order tables in columns by importance and size – it’s easier to follow a sequence of numbers down a column than across a row. Tables designed for interpretation of data require additional information, such as percentage changes, absolute changes, totals, averages and so on. This information lets you to discover how the numbers in your data are related to each other. Unlike tables, charts allow us to summarize our data in a way that the eye can readily absorb. Trends, proportions and other relationships are revealed at a glance through line graphs, bar charts and pie charts. But making information visually accessible in this way often comes at the cost of accuracy. In fact, slight modifications in charts are frequently used to imply misleading claims. For instance, a straight line between two points on a chart can conceal a winding path between them. Say the price curve of a stock is plotted by taking its value on the first day of each month, and then simply connecting these points using straight lines. Such a chart may show stable behavior over the course of the year, but could conceal huge price fluctuations during individual months. Forecasting is all about predicting the future, especially future market trends, which is why it is a fundamental part of good decision making in business. So how is forecasting done? Let’s look at the three main approaches. The first approach is subjective forecasting, which is based on intuition, experience and guesswork. At first glance, subjective forecasting may seem inherently unreliable. But remember, a forecast is not necessarily right just because it’s based on numerical techniques. And, since forecasting techniques that work one year won’t always work the next, forecasts should always be tempered with a healthy dose of subjective managerial judgment. The second approach is the extrapolation of past trends, which, broadly speaking, refers to projecting past trends into the future. As a result, it naturally involves data sequences, or time series, such as the dollar value of ice cream sales per day, or the number of cars manufactured per month. The trick to forecasting is to reveal the trends in these time series, and to extend them into the future. The third approach is causal modeling. In this approach, predictions are based on established cause-and-effect relationships. For example, one company may base its sales predictions on advertising or prices, while another  might look at average earnings, employment and interest rate changes to predict future sales. A helpful mathematical tool for this kind of forecasting is regression analysis. This method allows you to estimate how sets of data relate to one another, such as how sales are influenced by taxes. To determine this relationship, you’ll first need to plot your data points on a graph, with sales figures on the x-axis, and tax rates on the y-axis. Regression analysis enables you to find a line that fits your plotted points best. So, this line of best fit approximates the relationship between your two sets of data, namely taxes and sales rates. Of course, none of these three methods can predict the future with certainty. But a good approach to forecasting will involve a combination of these techniques. If you took a handful of wheat seeds out of a sack, you could consider your handful to be a sample, while the entire sack would represent the parent population. Samples are used to present statistical information across many disciplines, especially in business. Working with samples can be highly effective if you take the right approach. Think of it this way: if we take consistent samples over a significant period of time, we can consider them to be representative in the long term with a certain degree of confidence. Suppose you’re running a company and want to know the average order placed by your customers out of the last 10,000 orders. Of course, you can be 100 percent sure that you reach the correct figure by examining all 10,000 invoices. Alternatively, you can be 99 percent certain that your figure is correct by sampling just 50 invoices. But how can we be so sure? If we know that a parent population of numbers is normally distributed, and we have the mean and the standard deviation at hand, we can calculate the likelihood that a sample of a certain size will behave in the same way as its parent population. So, sampling saves time and money in a wide range of business situations. Hypothesis testing also adds rigor to decision making. Say a bakery decides it won’t change its baking formula unless it can prove the hypothesis that its new dough mix is popular with at least six in ten customers. The bakery then commissions a market survey that indicates, with 99 percent confidence, that over 60 percent of consumers think the new dough is great. There is a one percent risk that the survey results are inaccurate, but such a small margin is acceptable and the bakers consequently introduce the new dough. In this way, hypothesis testing is a procedure that minimizes the risk of making the wrong decisions based on incomplete information. Many business contexts involve uncertainty or risk. Decisionmaking needs to be approached accordingly, but how exactly? Consider this example. King Burgers is planning on opening a new location. Should it open a large or small restaurant? The King family’s experience suggests that a big locale generates $500,000 in profit if popular, but incurs a $300,000 loss if not. Likewise, a small drive-through can generate $275,000 in profit or incur an $80,000 loss. If the Kings are unsure what to expect from their new market, there are four approaches. One decision-making technique is to choose the highest possible payoff. So, Optimistic King aims for the maximum profit. She builds a large restaurant that if popular will bring a $500,000 return. Another technique is to choose the lowest potential loss. In this case, even though doing nothing has zero potential payoff, it cannot generate any losses either. So, Pessimist King does nothing. A third technique is to pick the best return on average. Average King chooses this technique because she assumes that favorable markets and poor markets are equally likely. She calculates the average return for each restaurant, beginning with the large one – ($500,000 - $300,000) ÷ 2 = $100,000 – followed by the small one – ($275,000 - $80,000) ÷ 2 = $97,500. She decides to open a large restaurant since its average return would be marginally higher. One final technique is to weight the average return. Hurwicz King (named after a thoughtful mathematician) estimates that there is a 30 percent chance of a good market and a 70 percent chance of a bad market. She weights the average return by multiplying the potential profits and losses by their respective probability, and then subtracts the potential losses from the potential gains. So, (0.3 × $500,000) - (0.7 × $300,000) = $60,000 in losses for the large restaurant, and (0.3 × $275,000) - (0.7 × $80,000) = $26,500 in profit for the small one. She decides to open a small restaurant since of the two, it is the only option whose weighted average return produces a profit. The key message in this book: Forecasting trends, analyzing data and presenting your findings effectively are all made possible with a basic understanding of mathematical tools. These skills are simple yet powerful, and by mastering each one, you’ll be able to employ them with confidence to improve your decision-making abilities and your business in general.  Actionable advice: Remember the Rule of Three!  The next time you have to present any sort of business figures, remember the power that charts and tables have as tools for presenting data. If you want to make the most of your data, keep the rule of three in mind: make your tables concise, make them informative and order your numbers in columns rather than in rows. These rules will make the numbers in your table easier to comprehend.

Guy Spier’s price was $650,100. And that was just to have lunch with business magnate and philanthropist Warren Buffett, a man he believed could provide him with the tools to transform himself from a ruthless and dissatisfied hedge-fund investor into a happy, grounded value investor. Luckily for Spier, his instincts were right, and he left what must’ve been the most expensive meal of his life as a changed man. Educated at Oxford University, Spier became a smart and ambitious hustler in the world of finance, and set off on what appeared to be a successful though unremarkable career. The only problem was that he was intensely unhappy. He’d ended up spending most of this time in a working environment he absolutely loathed, leading him to compromise his ethics and become – what he calls – an inauthentic person. What he did next amazed and surprised his colleagues and former school mates: he discovered a completely different business mentality for himself, which involved him breaking with many of the existing conventions of the finance world. In these blinks, you’ll find out why following your own business ethics always leads to happiness; how sending thank-you cards to colleagues can transform your career; why elite students often lack an essential ingredient for success; and why it’s better for your life and career to stop being a taker and start being a giver. For all the prestige of an elite education, this kind of schooling often teaches skills that simply cannot be applied in the real world. For example, highly educated people from elite business schools didn’t see the recent 2007-2008 financial crisis coming. Why? Because there are some fatal flaws in the way that these institutions teach their students. Elite business schools and universities help students to develop specific technical skills based on certain theories. Those theories, however, neglect to take the real world into account, and therefore do not apply to the actual business world. Theories and economic models are created under the assumption that one will have the perfect amount of information. In reality, things aren’t nearly as neat. Take the price of ham. In theory, it’s possible to work out how much ham should cost. You could look at how many stores sell it, how many pigs are slaughtered, what the demand is and then work out the ideal price. But in no way will this price be matched in reality. There are just too many other factors that must be taken into consideration. For instance, stores in certain locations, such as train stations, will make their ham more expensive; and other stores will often have offers, making their ham cheaper. Since it’s impossible to have all of this info at hand in the real world, the theories taught in elite schools never quite match the reality. Elite education focuses too narrowly on rationality, neglecting the power of human instinct and critical thinking. Rational thinking is revered, while unconventional ways of thinking are condemned. So if in your studies you come up with an idea or argument that differs radically from the norm, it’s likely you’ll keep it to yourself, as sharing it may result in you being accused of lunacy. Additionally, if you happen to be a very rational thinker, an elite institution can make you feel sublimely intelligent. Many people with a first-class education think they know it all, and when they enter the world of work they ignore the sage advice of more experienced people, because they consider them to be inferior. You’re just out of college and have recently joined a big investment bank. Naturally, you want to make a good impression. Yet, in the first week, you discover that the bank often makes money by cheating clients out of theirs. What should you do? Should you stay and continue to profit from their dishonest methods, or leave with a clear conscience? This dilemma is one that many employees are forced to confront, as many companies – especially those on Wall Street – use dubious strategies to maximize their profits. In order to attain more clients and wealth, some investing firms have low moral standards and aim to exploit clients with their aggressive salesmanship. Take the brokerage firm D. H. Blair & Co. In order to dupe their clients, this company made investment deals appear more profitable than they actually were. Moreover, the managers of such companies expect all of their employees to play along with the shenanigans. For new employees in particular, this can present a tough ethical dilemma. But it’s not only the expectations of others that can cause you to forget about your own ethics. It’s also your intrinsic motivation to succeed. The pressure of competing with others and the will to succeed might give you a reason to stretch your moral boundaries. Imagine you’re the only one in your investment firm who hasn’t made a deal yet, but you suspect that every one of your colleagues is using dubious methods to accomplish their goals. If you’re like most people, you won’t want to be left behind. So, it’s likely that you’ll wonder whether you should copy the behavior of your dishonest colleagues and deliberately mislead your clients. Many fall into this trap and end up making the mistake of compromising their own standards. Yet, for those who want to overcome them, such mistakes aren’t the end of the world. Once you recognize that you’ve made a mistake, it’s an opportunity for you to learn from it and begin anew. It’s not easy to recognize moral fraud when it’s happening around you, and it’s even harder to get away from it. Nevertheless, it’s imperative that you do. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how to build a career based on sound morals. Have you ever read a book that changed your life? When the author became disillusioned in his job at D. H. Blair, he read Ben Graham’s The Intelligent Investor and Roger Lowenstein’s Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist. What he read in those pages forever changed the way he would approach his job. Warren Buffett’s value-investing philosophy was an especially strong influence, as this philosophy can help one to succeed in financial business without compromising one’s ethics. How? Investors are often driven by the whims of the market. Thus, they focus their sights on short-term, risky investments in companies that are trending. The value-investing philosophy, in contrast, focuses on the long-term development and potential of a firm. The philosophy views a company share not as a piece of paper to be traded for a quick buck, but as a stake in a real, flesh-and-bones company. In other words, it takes a detailed look at the business itself, looking at not only its current value, but its future potential too. The ethics of such an approach are sound: because one is always looking at the long-term potential, there is no pressure to deceive buyers to make a quick sale. This also happens to be the far safer approach, as there is less risk involved. As the author’s use of Buffett’s philosophy demonstrates, finding a good role model is important in business. It can be very hard to change your approach if you don’t know how to achieve that goal. You might end up feeling quite lost and helpless. That’s when a role model can help lead the way. Simply imitating the behavior of your role model – known as matching and mirroring – and trying to understand the motivation behind it, can make you more successful. For example, from Buffett, the author learned the best way to achieve success, using ethics, personal experience and hard work. Because he observed that this was the very opposite of what was happening at D. H. Blair, he was empowered to leave the company. Why is it that when we start a new project, it doesn’t take long before we’re tempted to give up? The simple answer is that we often have the wrong attitude towards it. The only way to succeed when we’re embarking on a new endeavor is to develop a positive attitude. The most effective way to achieve this is to develop a more practical way of thinking: instead of just sitting back and waiting for your new project to magically grow from a seed into a mighty oak, you simply have to go for it and try out your idea. Moreover, you have to be aware of your emotions and personal shortcomings. For example, after experiencing initial success as a value-investor, the author noticed that he was still driven by envy. So he changed his intrinsic motivation and stopped comparing himself to others who used short-term-oriented methods, or even dubious ones. Once you’ve developed the right mindset, you need to follow your own path, not those established by traditional business practices. Often, the conventional, and very common practices might not be ideal for your business. It’s certainly not easy to find your own way of doing business, but one effective approach is to prioritize ethics over profit when deciding how to represent yourself. Investors usually have multiple portfolios, one for each type of client, so they can hide losses and make their businesses look better than they are. In contrast, the author decided to focus on a single portfolio. He wanted to emphasize his credibility, establish trust and keep an overview of his investments. Although others thought this was a foolish idea, it actually worked, and helped the author to develop long-lasting relationships with customers and investors. Which of the following approaches would you think is more effective? Building a social network made up of only strictly professional business contacts, or one that includes friendship, care and mutual favors? If you answered the latter, you’re right. In fact, being authentic to each person you interact with and expressing your gratitude to those you work with will make others interested in your work. That means viewing and treating each contact as someone you can learn from, and expressing that relationship to him or her. By doing so, you will rapidly grow your social network. When the author started as a value investor, he wrote many “thank you” cards to people who’d helped him to develop professionally – to those who gave an inspiring speech, for example, or who did him a personal favor. After a while, people began to write back, inviting him to attend networking events and conferences. Eventually, the people you treat in this way will remember your name, become part of your social network and be there for you when you need their help. Being authentic to your clients through honesty and helpfulness will make them interested in you and your business. In his book, Power vs. Force: The Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior, David Hawkins explains that this kind of upfront honesty makes it easier for you to influence others, simply because, as a result, they’ll trust in you and your decisions. The upshot of all this is that you’ll develop personal goodwill. You’ll begin to put relationships before money, start helping others and want to give something back to society. And, as you change internally, so will your business mentality – a precondition to becoming a successful value investor. In fact, once you start doing small favors for people, you’ll start to notice other small things you can improve in your life and business, and thus gradually develop at a micro level. And these small acts can gather momentum, building to the point that you can do big favors for others, with little regard for your own personal reward. Warren Buffett, for example, pledged most of his shares to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is now working virtually for free, demonstrating that he cares very little about his personal wealth, and more about his social responsibility. Remember the financial crisis of 2007-2008, when panic and desperation spread through the financial world? The unpredictability of financial crises is, of course, rather terrifying. But value investors can depend on their business philosophy when everyone else is panicking, and even generate future profits. Even in a financial crisis, value investors stay calmer than others. That’s because they situate themselves in an intellectual environment that doesn’t rattle their nerves, or lead them to compromise their ethical standards. Being surrounded by panicking traditional investors, on the other hand, can cause one to act irrationally and unethically, and to distrust one's investments. But, because value investors are long-term oriented and are quicker to avoid risky businesses than others, their hedge funds – enterprises for investing huge amounts of money – are more stable. The author, for example, avoided investing in any risky businesses connected to the financial market or the “tech bubble,” so when the financial crisis hit in 2008, even though he lost money, his portfolio wasn’t completely devastated like those of most other investors. In fact, keeping calm during such a crisis can help you to make the most promising investments for the future. During a crisis, many businesses are sold for much less than their intrinsic value because fearful investors sometimes lose their nerve and sell them lock, stock and barrel, for an incredibly low price. This is a great opportunity for a value investor to swoop in and buy shares of a company promising high profits in the future for a very low price. However, being a value investor also requires that you maintain a belief and commitment in your own investments, and not immediately choose to  sell them if their value begins to drop. How many times during your working day do you stop to check your email, or browse a favorite website? Of course, getting distracted while at work is very common. But why is this especially true of those working in finance? Our brains simply aren’t made for dealing with the intensity of the financial world. When we deal with money, the most instinctive part of our brain – the neocortex – is activated. For us, money is like food or sex – an essential. So, when we make financial decisions, we’re likely to be overwhelmed by mood swings or irrational optimism or pessimism, which causes us to act quickly and, often, unwisely. At the height of the recent financial crisis, for example, the author’s employee decided to withdraw all his money from the author’s hedge fund, even though he followed the value-investing philosophy and knew that his money was comparably safe. Moreover, our willpower is a limited resource, so we can’t resist distractions indefinitely. If we constantly have to use our willpower to avoid doing instinctive things, its power will diminish until we take the time to “recharge.” This was demonstrated in a study by psychologist Roy Baumeister, in which he showed that the effort required to resist eating chocolate chip cookies wore out people’s willpower, making them susceptible to mistakes. Of course, in order to better handle uncertainties, you have to become aware of your own shortcomings and irrationalities. But the easiest way to deal with such temptations is to get a distance from them. This necessitates creating a stable working environment: choosing an appropriate city, designing your office in a way that suits your working habits, and developing daily routines to keep you focused on doing what you should. Take the author, for example. To get away from all the hustle of New York, he moved to Zürich and rented an office far from the attractive and distracting city center. That lifestyle helped him focus on his job, enabling him to make consistently sound financial decisions. As we’ve already seen, the human mind is often irrational. It’s good practice, therefore, to develop some tools to help you manage your mind. Once you’ve created the ideal work environment for yourself, you have to develop investing tools – a set of rules and routines. These will help you to bring order and predictability to your working life. In fact, these rules and routines will reduce the complexity of your decision-making process, and prevent you from being tempted by irrational behavior. The author recognized that when people wanted to sell him shares, or when he talked to the management of a company, he was easily influenced and manipulated by their reasoning. So he developed the habit of not buying anything that was advertised to him. Following this code enabled him to focus on only using his own, strong business instincts when making such purchasing decisions. He would only buy something when he sensed it was really worth it. One example of such a tool is the checklist. Making a checklist can help you to avoid making obvious and otherwise predictable mistakes. Especially when dealing with money, the human brain can become intoxicated. This is what the author calls cocaine brain: the brain gets stimulated and its reward circuits are activated. The result is that we often make small errors chasing immediate rewards, no matter how many rules and regulations we’ve set ourselves. Thus, reflect on your previous mistakes in business, and write a personal checklist of things you should control before making a decision. The author’s checklist includes more than 80 questions that he asks himself every time he’s considering investing in a new company. He questions, for example, the intrinsic value of a company, how stable its value chain is or if he wants to buy it just to satisfy a personal motivation. After learning all about the value-investing philosophy, you’ll probably be wondering why the author is sharing these valuable “secrets” with us. Well, it’s because he wants to act in the spirit of the value-investing philosophy, and give something back. So, how will the philosophy make you a better person? First, by developing a network of mutual friendship, you’ll transform from a taker into a giver. As a taker you would always have a hidden agenda when approaching someone else; as a giver you’ll try to sense their needs. This will expand your goodwill and establish a benevolent cycle: if you do favors for people, they’ll do the same for you. As a result, you’ll find yourself within a community in which all members have a positive influence on each other, and negative elements in your network are excluded. The author believes that, due to the principles of the value-investing philosophy, he’s now able to value true friendship, is much calmer, and became “addicted” to positive emotion. In short, he is a much happier person. Second, by understanding your inner fears, including your desires and biases, you take the first step towards inner growth. Identifying your shortcomings and learning about the deepest, darkest parts of yourself, will make you a stronger person, better equipped to deal with the adversity and uncertainty that are inherent to the financial world. Achieving such self-knowledge on your own is no easy task. If you feel you need assistance here, you could use career coaches, psychotherapy or religion – anything that will help you increase your self-knowledge. Moreover, by knowing your emotions and habits, you’ll develop a more playful attitude towards your working life. Once you know what motivates and scares you, you will see business decisions more objectively, and be able to make rational decisions without being emotionally troubled by them. To that end, the author took up playing Bridge, a game in which uncertainty and strategy play a central part. His experience with the game gave him many skills he could transfer into the world of finance. The key message in this book: Becoming a value investor means breaking with business conventions, creating a valuable social network and taking yourself on an inner journey. By surrounding yourself with positive people and working on growing your self-awareness, you’ll inevitably become not just a better investor, but also a better person. Actionable advice: If you have misgivings about your current career, ask yourself if you’re doing what you really want to do. If the morals and business practices of your job don’t reflect your own working ethics, you might have to invest some time and effort in establishing a new career. But don’t be afraid to take the other option and change your business from the inside: breaking business norms can be part of professional success as long as you stay true to yourself and your business network.   Suggested further reading: The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C.

A sentiment that still holds strong. But does it hold water? Given that more people than ever before have a college degree and the whole world is just a few keyboard clicks away, it might be time to reconsider this sentiment. Something has indeed changed. In our globalized modern world, a job is no longer the safest route to financial security. From outsourcing to unemployed college graduates, it looks like we are in a recession, but we could also be witnessing the limits of a decaying system and the beginning of a new one: a paradigm shift and the end of jobs as we know it. In these blinks, you’ll find out how the English King Henry VIII made capital more important than land; why great entrepreneurs think like poker players; and how population growth in the U.S. has increased unemployment. There are many variables that determine how society progresses. One variable particularly worth examining is the limit of the systems we live and work in. Software entrepreneur Eli Goldratt came up with this theory of constraints in the 1980s.  According to Goldratt, every system that has a goal also has a limit: a part of the system that restricts growth. So if your factory has two assembly lines that produce 100 units of a product and one that produces only 50, that third line would be the limit. In order to progress, then, we need to work on this limit. For example, if you have a great product but nobody’s heard of it, you won’t boost sales by improving your product. Here, the limit you need to improve on would be your marketing strategy. According to systems thinker Ron Davidson, the last three major changes in the Western economy occurred when the limits changed. Back in fourteenth-century England, the agricultural economy was based on land, and since the Catholic Church owned the lion’s share of it, they controlled the economy. Therefore, the limit was land until the sixteenth century, when Henry VIII appointed himself head of the Anglican Church and revoked Rome’s control over it.  Then, at the dawn of the industrial age in the 1700s, bankers became more powerful than kings, shifting the limit from land to capital, and forcing land-owner and Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III to ask bankers for a loan to finance his wars. Later, in the 1900s, we shifted from a capital economy into a knowledge economy. Knowledge, proliferated by technology, became the new limit, making companies like IBM extremely powerful. This was evident in 1975, when IBM successfully issued a billion dollars in bonds, despite their bankers at Morgan Stanley refusing to cooperate. Since the early 2000s, though, we’ve seen a weakening of the knowledge economy as a burgeoning entrepreneurial economy gains momentum. Read on to find out why. Jobs are becoming increasingly hard to come by and, believe it or not, those in their fifties today are partly responsible for it.  After WWII, the economic boom pushed the knowledge economy to its limit, and it began morphing into a new system. People born in the U.S. in the first two decades after WWII – the baby boomers – enjoyed a period of economic prosperity and an abundance of career options. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, jobs grew 1.7 times faster than the population between the years 1948 and 2000. This growth meant that baby boomers simply had to get a college education and the right credentials, and they’d walk straight into a job. The next generations followed suit, believing it would remain this way. But there was never any guarantee that the economy would stay the same. And it hasn’t. In fact, since 2000, the population has grown 2.4 times faster than have positions on the job market. This explains the plethora of well-educated, jobless graduates. In the U.S., over half the recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in a position that doesn’t require a degree. From this we see that knowledge in the form of credentials is no longer the limit. We’ve reached the peak of 9-to-5 jobs and we are now witnessing the beginning of entrepreneurship. Interestingly, the only jobs on the rise since the 1980s are non-routine cognitive jobs: creative, unpredictable work rather than work involving completing the same task every day. Our economy is expanding based on creativity and innovation. In other words, creativity is the new limit and the new power players are entrepreneurs who set up businesses and pursue innovative ideas. The apartment rental website AirBnB is a great example: they started out by posting apartments on Craigslist, an external site that lists apartments, as a creative way to market their own business. Aside from the dearth of jobs in the U.S., there’s another reason finding work has become so difficult: the possibility of outsourcing. Modern communication technology and increased global education has released us from our office cubicles and the number of people with university degrees has dramatically increased, making degrees less valuable. In fact, the number of college graduates in the world increased from 90 million in 2000 to 130 million in 2010. But what does this mean? Well, when we add technology like the video calls of Skype into the mix, this means that qualified talent can be hired and work from anywhere in the world. This also means companies can employ workers from countries with lower wage expectations. An English-speaking web designer in the Philippines, for example, can be employed for an annual salary ranging from $700 to $1,400. A shocking contrast to the expected salary of around $82,000 for a web designer in the U.S. Machines are increasingly replacing humans in industry, especially factory workers whose jobs are now carried out by hardware and software. But these machines have moved beyond factory tasks and can be used in knowledge-based jobs. Take Eventbrite, a company that sells tickets online which are booked and paid for entirely by software. So what can you do? Don’t wait around to be replaced by software – own it. Modern technology has made running a business financially viable for more and more people, and an entrepreneur can run a small company using an international talent pool at a relatively low cost. Such startups are often called micro-multinationals. Jesse Lawler, for example, runs Evil Genius Technologies, a Vietnam-based software company which employs workers from England, India, the Philippines, and other countries. Lawler has sales and customer service people in the U.S., while his programmers live in Vietnam. This way he cuts down drastically on his expenses: living costs alone would make it impossible for Lawler to hire more than two developers in the U.S. For an entrepreneur, modern technology presents an abundance of opportunities. The benefits of having a steady job have been drilled into our heads since we were children, but what if we were misinformed? A steady job today means exposing yourself to an insidious risk that is out of your control. In our current economy, your steady income can disappear at the drop of a hat, leaving you clueless as to how to recover. Your regular paycheck gives you a false sense of security, and you may easily be replaced by an equally talented employee in India who is willing to work for less. It’s a harsh reality but, if you’ve followed orders your entire career, you won’t have the skill set to create options for yourself. Think of this as the Turkey Problem: you’re like a turkey, relying on being fed everyday until one day you’re sent to the ax! Entrepreneurs don’t have this problem, as they deal directly with visible risks. They may not make an immediate profit, but they acquire skills and create systems and can change them if they don’t produce the desired results.  In other words, they enjoy unlimited control and unlimited variables, and the possibility for growth is vast. Most of the entrepreneurs the author talked with would actually be disappointed with a growth rate of 20 percent per annum. Much like poker players, entrepreneurs understand the concept of expected value. This is the average value in a series of repetitions of a random variable. Say you’re playing a hand in a poker game and it’ll cost you $1,000 to view the final card. You know there’s a 20 percent chance you’ll win $20,000 for the whole hand. So you’re coughing up $1,000 for an expected value of $4,000, which is 20 percent of $20,000. If you place this bet enough times, you’re guaranteed to come out on top. It’s no surprise, then, that many poker players end up being entrepreneurs. Starting a business is for highly intelligent business types with piles of cash, right? Actually, thanks to modern technology, anyone has the possibility to do anything from designing furniture to publishing a novel. Apple mogul Steve Jobs even said that entrepreneurs aren’t necessarily smarter than the average person. One thing that has changed the game of business is, of course, the internet. One way it has done so is by dramatically reducing production costs. The tools needed to create a product are more affordable and more widely available than ever before. Take Software as a Service, i.e., businesses like Adobe Creative Cloud that sell software on a subscription basis. Whereas in the past you needed to invest in pricey equipment and sign long-term contracts, now quality services can be accessed on a monthly basis. So, instead of spending hundreds of dollars on accounting software, you can now pay $9 a month for an accounting program like Xero. The internet has also lowered distribution costs. Along with accessing manufacturers in lower-cost countries, you can also reach and distribute to customers directly. The author, for example, used to work for a business that made and sold portable bars. By manufacturing in China and distributing directly to consumers, they were able to cut their costs by about 25 percent and improve the product’s quality. The internet is also constantly creating new markets, largely because location is now irrelevant. For instance, in the past you would use a law firm because it was near your office. Now, you can use a website like UpCounsel to find a vetted lawyer who specializes in your needs, regardless of your location. If you’re an entrepreneur, you can also more easily serve niche markets on the net. Firegang Dental Marketing, for example, offers digital marketing services exclusively in the niche of dentists who want to reach new customers. Prehistoric hunter-gatherers didn’t work like we do today: they worked to survive. But this changed at the beginning of the agricultural revolution. After that, work became an obligation. When we started creating farming communities, we worked to collect foods we could store or trade. Tilling the land was arduous, constant work to amass wealth rather than to survive. After the industrial revolution, factory workers viewed work and wages as a means to improve their quality of life. So they bore the obligation of routine factory tasks as they believed it would lead to a better life.  This idea probably seems very familiar to you. That’s because we still hold onto it today. However, today it’s possible to find more meaningful work. But how do we really weigh meaning versus money? Economist Dan Ariely conducted a psychological study in India to find out how powerful money was as an incentive. In Ariely’s study, a group of workers were assigned a complex task that was impossible to solve by using a formula, much like entrepreneurial work. One of the tasks, for example, was to unscramble an anagram. The first subgroup was offered a day’s wages for the task, the second two weeks’ wages, and the third five months’ wages. Surprisingly, the higher the reward, the weaker the performance. This is because meaningful work motivates us more than monetary incentives. We also saw this in 2006, when Mark Zuckerberg was offered $1 billion by Yahoo to buy out Facebook. Zuckerberg didn’t even consider selling. Why? His work meant too much to him. As of 2015, Facebook is worth $230 billion. In the end, Zuckerberg got to continue doing the work he loved and made a staggering profit to boot. This is all the more proof that starting a business that fulfills us is far more viable than we have traditionally been taught. Being an entrepreneur isn’t always a walk in the park, but it’s not as treacherous as you may think. Rob Walling, leader of three software companies, used his experience to create a useful entrepreneurial method known as the Stair Step Method. The first step involves creating and launching a single product, selling it for a one-time fee, and using just one marketing channel. By keeping things simple this way, you’ll learn some business basics without the pressure of a highly competitive environment, how to build and market a product, how to network, and how to hire and manage a small number of employees.  The next step is to launch enough one-time products to be able to quit your job, as Walling did before becoming a computer programming consultant. In 2005, he launched a few products and acquired some invoicing software still in its development stage, but he was only bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. At this point, your focus should be on generating enough income to buy back the time you put into your day job. This will also allow you to gather business experience, a network of entrepreneurs and a stable workforce. Walling was able to teach himself marketing just by building on the SEO that the previous owners of the software used. He then used the capital he gained from consulting and the SEO skills he learned to purchase and run an e-commerce website selling bath towels. After you’ve launched some products and gained some experience, it’s time to expand your business. You could launch bigger products or create a membership site, for example. After buying the towel website, Walling increased the company’s profit from zero to $2,500 per month. One key thing to remember is that no college course can make you an entrepreneur. While education used to be the ticket to financial stability, now practical experience is the way to acquire the skills you need to get meaning and income from your work. The key message in this book: The promise of a stable 9-to-5 job at the end of college has been unsustainable since the turn of the century. Our society is transitioning into an entrepreneurial economy and now, more than ever, is the time to take advantage of technology to create meaningful work that embraces risk and creativity, and offers more wealth and freedom than the broken tradition of the 9-to-5 grind. Actionable advice: Make decisions like a billionaire. When investing, diversifying is the key, right? Wrong! If you want to see real gains, look at the strategy of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger of the $300 billion Berkshire Hathaway holding company. Instead of diversifying, day trading or trying to beat the market year by year, these billionaires focus on 40-year time frames. The result? They’ve raked in $50 billion over 50 years by sticking with only four to five investments.

Managed well, your portfolio is a ticket to financial independence and even early retirement; managed poorly, it’s a black hole which swallows up your livelihood. In short, the stakes are high. You don’t need to be a financial whiz to know that the most important decision is what to buy – but it’s not as simple as just identifying lucrative openings. This where the FALCON Method comes in. Named after the author’s surname, which means “falcon” in Hungarian, the FALCON Method directs your attention to a single, fruitful asset class: company shares. This method helps unravel the tangled financial landscape by providing you with an objective set of measurements to evaluate different businesses. By ranking the best of these on a set of equations, we reveal which are ripe for investment. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why stocks reign supreme; why a company is like a black box; and how you should handle your portfolio once you’ve taken the plunge. Stocks, options, bonds, mutual funds and commodities: The variety of asset types available in the financial world can make anybody's head spin. Professionals devote their lives to studying the investment landscape, so how can the rest of us hope to discern which assets are best? Thankfully, some of these professionals have given us a helping hand. One of these is Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time and a constant source of financial wisdom. In a 2011 letter to his shareholders, he outlined three main investment classes and revealed his stand-out favorite. The first is currency-based investments. These investments are tied to a national currency, and bonds are the most common example. Basically, bonds are a type of loan. The bond issuer – usually a corporation or government – sells a bond to an investor. The bond issuer also agrees to buy the bond back in the future for the same amount, plus interest. Bonds are a currency-based investment because they’re issued and repaid in a certain currency – whatever happens, they’re tied to this medium. But currency-based investments contain a fatal flaw: You’re trusting that the national currency won’t rise due to inflation! If you have a currency-based investment worth $10 and inflation increases by 10 percent, $1 of your invested cash has vanished. Buffett's second class is unproductive assets, investments which won’t generate extra income once you own them. Commodities such as wheat, oil and gold are the main types of unproductive assets. They’re unattractive too, because investors don’t earn a secondary income from owning them; they’re simply hoping to eventually sell them for more than they paid for them. Buffett’s third category, productive assets, are the best type for building wealth and generating a reliable long-term income. Productive assets, like a company or buy-to-rent real estate, aren’t tied to a national currency – it’s always possible to value them against gold or another currency. They also generate a secondary income, perhaps by earning the owner rent. The best productive assets are company shares. Each share represents partial ownership of a company.  For example, buying shares in Coca-Cola means that you’re part owner of the business – a shareholder – and are entitled to a share of its profits. These are paid out in the form of dividends, usually on an annual basis. What’s more, an investor still has the underlying value of her shares, which she can sell on the market at any time. So, we’ve explored a few asset types and seen how stocks reign supreme. But picking a great asset type doesn’t guarantee an early retirement! To invest prudently, we should understand how companies operate and learn how to evaluate them. A great metaphor for thinking about companies is that of the black box, something put forward by author David van Knapp in his book Sensible Stock Investing.  In van Knapp’s view, a firm is like a black box with input and output pipes attached to it. As an outsider, you’re unaware of what happens inside the box, but firms exist to generate money, so more cash must go out through the output pipes than goes into the input pipes. Thinking of companies this way focuses our attention on analyzing these pipes. Examples of input pipes include revenue – which is the money a company generates from selling its goods or services – and equity sales. The most common equity sale happens when a company issues and sells new shares. It’s important to pay attention to this pipe, because it means the value of already-existing shares will be diluted. Examining output pipes is important too. These are things like ongoing expenses, such as staff salaries and advertising fees, and payments on debts. There are also things like acquisitions – when one company buys another – along with taxes on profits to consider. When scrutinizing a company, the most important output pipe to examine is its profits. That’s because the way a firm uses them is a telltale sign of a great investment opportunity. Be on the lookout for companies doing these three things with profits: First, take note of payments to shareholders in the form of dividends. A company obviously needs to generate a return for shareholders in order for it to be a sound investment! Second, be aware of share buybacks. This is a common business practice which involves a company purchasing their own shares on the open market. They do this to reduce the overall number of shares in circulation, which increases the value of each remaining share and increases the amount of dividend per share. Third, look out for retained earnings. This is cash recycled back into the company for growth and expansion. The best thing about the black box metaphor is its pragmatism – it makes sure you don’t harbor illusions about what you simply can’t see. Instead, it directs your attention toward the crucial areas of what you can see. Ever pictured yourself as a professional stock trader? Perhaps perched behind your laptop on a tropical beach, clocking up wins? Well, for the sake of your portfolio, keep these as pipe dreams: A lavish trading lifestyle is only profitable for a tiny minority. Instead, most investors stick to the classic quantum investing model. Quantum investing works by ranking a set of stocks according to a set of quantitative criteria, such as the amount of dividends paid per share. This is commonly known as the dividend per share figure. Once ranked, an investor buys the best of the bunch. These are held for a period of time, usually 12 months, before being sold. The process is then repeated. The quant method, as it’s known, can be useful: By relying on quantitative criteria and a defined time frame, it removes psychological bias from trading, which is the most common way to lose money. But it also has several disadvantages. First, many quantitative criteria will generate a list of companies completely unknown to you. It’s hard – and also unwise – to commit your capital to a firm you don’t know well. Second, the classic quant method is inconsistent. Because no investment method is faultless and you are picking a bunch of new companies annually, sometimes there are one-, two- or three-year periods where you’ll have to deal with losses. Most traders don’t have the patience to stick through these. But there’s a different approach to classic quant investing: the FALCON Method. Like the classic quant method, the FALCON Method is designed to limit psychological errors and emotional decision-making. But unlike the quant method, the FALCON Method advocates a buy and hold approach which prizes long-term investments. Here, the goal is to receive continuous dividend payouts and anticipate an increase in the stock’s underlying value, at which point investors will sell their asset for a profit. Additionally, the FALCON Method suggests only purchasing stocks in reputable, well-known companies. Household names are much easier to have faith in than a bunch of unknown, constantly changing companies. Because of a clear structure which only lets human subjectivity creep in at the final phase, the FALCON Method prevents our biases from causing costly mistakes. By this point, all stocks which survive the rigorous filtering process are above-average investment opportunities. So, we want a buy and hold portfolio consisting of shares in well-known companies. Now it’s time to drill down into the specifics of the FALCON Method and build a shortlist of potential purchases! But what household names are worth our time? Well, the FALCON Method concentrates on a specific group of companies which have been paying dividends for at least 20 years, and haven’t reduced the amount paid during this time. Why the focus on dividends? Because they represent the only truly reliable item in corporate reports. Other items, like revenue and cash-flow figures, are able to be distorted by unethical activities and unscrupulous accountants. Just ask the former executives of Enron, an electricity and natural gas supplier. In 2000, Enron claimed revenues of nearly $101 billion. Then, in 2001, the company’s hugely fraudulent accounting practices, including falsifying revenue reports, were exposed. Enron filed for bankruptcy later that year. Dividend payouts, unlike revenue, cannot be manipulated; they’re transparent payments made by the company to their shareholders. Twenty years of dividend payments might seem like an excessive time frame to consider but it’s a sensible practice for two reasons. First, it allows us to assess how the management of a company behaves in times of trouble, such as the financial crisis in 2008. Second, the ability to pay a consistent amount of dividends to shareholders is a sure sign of a company’s consistent earning power. Companies with reliable, consistent earnings tend to overperform so it’s no wonder that companies paying dividends consistently are the sweethearts of investors. That’s why the S&P 500 index, which groups together publicly-traded companies for measurement purposes contains a group of companies called the Dividend Aristocrats. These companies stand out for having increased dividend payments for over 25 consecutive years. However, there’s a weakness in focusing solely on the Dividend Aristocrats and increasing dividends. First, why limit ourselves to companies on the S&P index? There’s an ocean of opportunities lying outside these 500 firms. Second, if a company retains the same dividend payment for two consecutive years, it’s removed from the Dividend Aristocrats’ list. The FALCON Method takes a more flexible approach, understanding that sometimes it’s better to channel resources into securing a firm’s future. That’s why it concentrates on firms with a long dividend history and no reductions to that dividend. Of course, a good dividend record doesn’t always make a great investment, but it is a positive sign. Buying high-quality items at discount prices is a wonderful feeling. The trouble is that, thanks to the internet, sellers have never been better informed about what their goods are worth. If we do stumble across a discount, it can be gone in an instant – a true steal is usually snapped up in an instant. But bargains still exist and brevity isn’t a bad thing, especially not in investment: If you’ve bought into a bargain, prices will rise after time to reflect the underlying value of your asset. The key to getting a great deal is to understand that every company has a price assigned to it by the market, which fluctuates daily. This price is different from the underlying value of a company, which is comprised of the company’s assets, financial health and future potential. So, by evaluating a company’s underlying value and taking note of the historical price of its shares, investors can secure a discount by purchasing shares in valuable companies when prices are cheaper than the historically-accepted average. The reason this works is because businesses create value and humans set prices. Humans are fickle and intrinsically emotional creatures. We are subject to psychological biases and feelings of greed and fear. This innate nature of ours is what causes stock market prices to fluctuate so wildly. Just look at what happens in a stock market panic: Investors flock to sell their shares and are willing to sell them for low prices. This is the very moment when smart investors strike. When market sentiment is pessimistic – either in an individual company or the wider economy – stock prices will decrease relative to the asset's underlying value, something that generally stays the same. This makes buying top-quality companies during times of pessimism a sure-fire approach to earning a healthy profit. But following this approach isn’t as easy as it sounds. It means disagreeing with the whims of the crowd and making decisions which run against the trend of the market. This technique requires a lot of knowledge, but also a little bravery. Finally, it’s crucial to understand that this market trend works in reverse – just as prices fall during times of panic, prices rise during times of euphoria. Tempting as it may be to buy stocks in Amazon, Google or Walmart as they soar, a wise investor never buys into hype at over-inflated prices. So, we now have our shortlist, but we also need to do some more filtering based on more advanced financial indicators. There are three main indicators the FALCON Method uses: dividend yield, free cash flow yield and shareholder yield.  Dividend yield is the dividend a stock will produce compared to the price of that stock. It’s calculated by dividing the amount a stock is expected to pay in the next year by the current price of that stock. For example, if one share in Microsoft is expected to pay $1, and that share costs $10, then its dividend yield is 0.1, or 10 percent. Free cash flow yield is one criterion that investors often overlook. Put simply, free cash is the money left over after a company pays for its essential operational costs. Free cash flow yield measures the relationship between this figure and the current market price of a share. To calculate it, divide a company’s free cash flow yield by its total number of shares, producing a figure known as free cash flow per share. Then, divide free cash flow per share by the current market price of one share. For example, if Amazon has a free cash flow of $200 and 100 existing shares, its free cash flow per share is $2. If a share in Amazon costs $20, we know that their free cash flow yield is 0.1, or 10 percent. Finally, a firm’s shareholder yield shows how much money a company sends back to its investors through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. Share repurchases occur when a company buys back its own shares on the open market, increasing its ownership stake in the company and increasing the value of all remaining shares and future dividend payments. Calculating it takes a couple of steps. Let’s imagine that Google spent $100 on dividends and $150 on share repurchases in 2018. Our first step is to add these together, giving us $250. Then we’ll subtract the value of new shares issued from that; let’s say that amounts to $50. We’ll then divide the $200 that we’re left with by Google’s market capitalization, that is, the value of all existing shares combined. If market capitalization is $5000, dividing 5000 by 200 gives Google a shareholder yield of .04, or 4 percent. When applying these filters to our companies, define minimum values for all three indicators. There is no magic number, but be sure not to set these too high: this method makes it difficult for companies to pass all three filters even if they have moderate values. If a company passes one, it still must get over the next two hurdles! The FALCON Method doesn’t rank stocks based on simple, one-dimensional factors: in the Method’s fourth step, it identifies and ranks stocks that are the cream of the crop using something called weighted multifactor ranking. This uses multiple factors to rank our stocks and also decides how much weight to assign each factor.  Let’s look at an example. Say we are ranking two companies – Stock A and Stock B – on three factors: dividend yield, free cash flow yield and shareholder yield. We first need to choose how much weight to assign each factor. Here, we’ll opt for equal weighting – meaning that each factor will be worth 33.3 percent of our final score. You can choose any weight you like, though, as long as they total 100 percent. Let’s look at this in practice: Stock A has a dividend yield, free cash flow yield, and shareholder yield of 5, 7 and 10 percent respectively. Stock B, on the other hand, clocks in at 10, 5 and 12 percent. We know that each stock’s factor is worth 33.3 percent, or 0.333. Thus we can calculate the stocks’ final scores by multiplying each of the three yield percentages with this number and add them all together. For Stock A, this would result in a final score of 10.6 and for B, 8.9.  Although the three factors we’ve used in this example to rank Stock A and Stock B would be fine, we’ve already used them as our filters in a previous step. So instead, we should use some new metrics we’ve not used before.  The FALCON Method suggests using a modified version of the Chowder Rule – a protocol comparing a stock’s current dividend to its potential for future growth.  This works by adding a stock’s dividend yield to the percentage a stock’s dividend has grown by in the last five years – if the stock’s dividend yield is more than 3 percent, this number must be greater than 12. If less than 3 percent, it must be greater than 15. However, focusing only on a five-year timeframe can obscure important data: What if the company paid a high dividend for four years, but cut this in the last twelve months? Instead, the FALCON Method recommends constructing multiple Chowder Rules with varying timeframes (one, three or five years) and using each as a factor in the weighted ranking. So far, the FALCON Method has concentrated on using quantitative indicators because they are free from psychological bias. But subjective judgment is useful if used carefully – and by postponing this until our last round of selection, we can almost guarantee that all remaining stocks are first-rate investment opportunities. Let’s explore some things to look out for when making the final decision. First, pay attention to the ROIC indicator. ROIC stands for return on invested capital. As a shareholder in a company, you have a stake in that enterprise which is equal to the amount of money you have invested into it. A good investor should always monitor how well a firm’s management uses the capital at its disposal, and that’s where the ROIC indicator comes in. This tool is found on most online trading platforms and assesses how efficient a company is at allocating its resources to profitable activities. The higher the ROIC, the better. Also, pay attention to stocks which are cyclical and try to avoid them. A cyclical stock is one whose price fluctuates wildly, with large peaks and troughs. Take the ten-year price history of the Chevron Corporation, a US oil and gas company. From a high of almost $100 per share in 2008, prices plummeted to $60 in 2009. The next year saw a steep rise, peaking at over $130 per share in 2013, before crashing yet again to $75 one year later. These cyclical trends are often found in volatile industries, such as the oil and cryptocurrency markets. You’d be forgiven for thinking that investing in cyclical stocks is a savvy move, but placing your capital here is often counterintuitive because of the extra risk it poses. After all, no-one can tell when a cyclical stock has hit its bottom; volatile markets can make you rich in no time, but they can also make you poor just as quickly. What’s more, this approach butts heads with the FALCON Method’s buy and hold philosophy; steady, consistent growth over the long term wins the day. Using qualitative judgment to assess the ROIC and overall trading pattern can be useful, but only as a final pointer toward your chosen stocks. The FALCON Method’s first four steps have done the heavy lifting for us by using structured rules and leveraging powerful financial indicators to reveal the best investment opportunities. No investment method is flawless, but this method, just like its bird of prey namesake, is precise when it hunts. The key message in these blinks: The FALCON Method advocates a precise and unemotional investment strategy which focuses on rigorous company evaluation and a buy and hold philosophy. Its well-structured process focuses on long-term dividend payers and applies a strict set of filters to weed out dodgy deals and subpar investments. By following the FALCON Method’s steps and using its recommended financial indicators, average traders can give themselves the best possible chance for growing their wealth and building a passive income.  Actionable advice: Go out and do some analysis. Now that you’re up to speed with the FALCON Method, test these techniques by building your own list of companies. You could start by referencing a well-known index of companies, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. Draw up a list of the long-term dividend payers and away you go! Got feedback?

Hubbard","summary":"Every weather forecast relies on highly complex models and huge sets of data. Once analyzed and presented, this information allows you, with impressive accuracy, to see whether your picnic in the park will be a wet affair or not. You might think it doesn’t really matter. After all, you can always put on a raincoat. However, for multi-billion dollar companies operating on volatile markets, or for scientists trying to calculate the likelihood of a tsunami or an earthquake, risk, and risk management, is serious business. And these days it’s more important than ever. But many of the methods used to assess and manage risk today are flawed. Luckily, there are ways to overcome this problem. These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll learn why experts’ opinions are overrated; what Monte Carlo has to do with risk management; and how you calculate the risk of an event that has never happened before. You’ve probably heard the term risk management; it’s part of the jargon used by organizations and governments, but it’s also entered the public vocabulary. While there are many definitions of the terms risk and management, it’s helpful to keep things simple: Start with risk. You could say that risk is the likelihood and magnitude of an undesirable event. For instance, in a scientific or mathematical context, risk always describes the probability and magnitude of an undesired effect. But what do probability and magnitude measure? While probability always estimates the odds that something will happen (that your home being struck by lightning, for example), magnitude can be measured in a variety of dimensions, most commonly the loss of money or of lives. But keep in mind that an undesirable event could be anything – from a natural disaster to a major product recall to political instability. Now that you know the definition of risk, what does it mean to manage it? Managing risk means effectively using resources to decrease danger. For instance, one of the most common definitions of the word management is “the planning, organization, coordination and direction of resources toward defined objectives.” In other words, using what you have to get what you need. In order to achieve this goal, a risk manager always tries to reduce the risk of pursuing an objective. Just like any other management task, managing risk is an effort to effectively use limited resources, like money and time, to complete a task. Now that you know what risk management is, it’s time to learn how it developed and how it applies today. It could be said that organizational risk management began when some king or leader first made the decision to fortify their city’s walls or put away extra provisions in case of a tough winter. But risk management has come a long way since its beginnings; the advent of computers in particular has dramatically improved the field. But even prior to digitization, the risk of nuclear power and oil exploration in the 1940’s increased the sophistication of risk management, a major reason why it’s in the minds of most large organizations today, regardless of their field. So how did risk management evolve into such an important field? A major breakthrough was the use of risk analysis during World War II and, later, the Cold War. During wartime, the “war quants,” a group primarily made up of engineers and economists, were given extensive training in quantitative calculation methods. They used these techniques to ascertain a variety of things – the likely production capacities of the enemy and the potential risk of invasion, for example. But today risk management applies to much more than war. In our time, risk is analyzed by everyone, from governmental institutions to corporations. Consider this: In 2007, three large independent studies were conducted by, respectively, The Economist, Aon Corporation, an insurance broker, and Protivity, a risk management consulting firm. The surveys examined the role of risks and risk management in more than 320 organizations across 29 countries. The results? Although the studies were worded differently and focused on slightly different factors, there were interesting consistencies between them. For instance, all three studies showed that the function of risk management is increasing on an organizational level. Depending on which survey you look at, anywhere from 35 to 60 percent of all companies have hired or intend to hire a Chief Risk Officer, or CRO. And Aon’s report showed that the boards of 88 percent of surveyed companies are “actively engaged in the review of risk management.” So it’s clear that risk management is important. But there’s an issue: the most commonly used methods are flawed. How? For starters, commonly used qualitative descriptions like “very likely” are open to interpretation and mean different things to different people. How can you maintain consistent understanding in a group when some practice is described as having a “level 5” impact? To put it differently, everybody knows that something with a “very low” probability is less likely to happen than something with a “medium” probability, but how much less likely? It’s impossible to say. To prove this point, the author asked a client who had just attended an intensive risk-assessment workshop with co-workers what it meant to say an event was “very likely.” The client said that it meant it had a 20 percent likelihood of occurring; his colleagues disagreed, however, and a heated argument erupted. Some thought his estimate too low; others thought it too high. But that’s not the only way common methods are flawed. Another major issue is that scoring methods don’t take into account the relationships between risks. For instance, more often than not, risk factors are related to each other, whether by a correlation or a common mode risk that increases the likelihood of both risked outcomes occurring. Just consider the hydraulic controls in planes. Oftentimes, three identical systems are installed in one aircraft; the redundancy supposedly makes the likelihood of all three simultaneously failing one-in-a-billion. But there’s one problem: the common mode risk – that is, the potential for an action that either triggers other actions or makes them more likely. In this situation, the common mode risk results from the hydraulic tubes being installed in close proximity to one another; such proximity makes them highly prone to total failure from a single event, like shrapnel from a broken propeller severing all three. Unfortunately, the issues don’t stop there. Another flaw with popular methods is that they rely exclusively on expert opinions. We’ll explore that next. The opinions of esteemed experts are respected and relied on by people for all manner of things, and risk-management methods are no exception. But expert opinion may not actually be so helpful for assessing risk. Why not? For one, extensive psychological research has consistently shown that people tend to overestimate their capabilities. Just consider the fact that 87 percent of Stanford MBA students put their academic performance in the top half of their class. Another famous study showed that a clear majority of people claim to be better than average drivers, something most of us know to be false. But the proof goes on: the Cornell psychologists Kruger and Dunning published a book called Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Awareness, which showed that approximately two-thirds of the population consider themselves exceedingly reasonable, humorous and grammatical. According to the author, even so-called experts are affected by these statistics. They tend to be overly sure of their predictions and they therefore underestimate risks. But there’s another issue with expert opinion in risk management: the fact that people’s experience is biased – a fact that psychologists like Daniel Kahneman, recipient of the Nobel Memorial Pize in Economic Sciences, have used to show that our ability to evaluate probability is flawed. But flawed how? The simple truth is that our memories aren’t 100 percent perfect and we don’t work like computers. Therefore our minds are influenced by biases such as the peak end rule, which states that we usually remember extreme and recent experiences better than others. For instance, if we once went on a picnic that was ruined by rain, even though the forecast only predicted a 5 percent chance showers, we tend to assume that the forecast is inaccurate because we fail to remember all the times the weather prediction was correct. While the opinions of experts are biased like those of everyone else, even the most quantitatively accurate methods require some sort of expert advice in order to effectively identify risks. The good news is there’s a way to improve expert opinion. It’s called calibration training and here’s how it works: The main purpose of calibration training is to give people an accurate picture of their uncertainties. While the most important parts of these trainings are repetition and feedback, there are many ways to calibrate. For instance, a straightforward calibration exercise is to test for ranges. This training is especially important for calibrating estimates for probabilistic models such as the Monte Carlo Simulation, a tool we’ll cover in more detail later on. For now, here’s how range testing works: The testee is asked questions like, “How old was the youngest person to fly into space” or “What was the dollar price for a ton of steel a year ago?” They then respond with lower- and higher-end estimates, the lower bound meaning the testee is 95 percent certain that the actual value is higher and the higher bound meaning they’re 95 percent certain the correct value will be lower. Another testing method is the post-mortem analysis. In this exercise, the testee is asked to estimate the probability of a disaster by assuming it already occurred and then asked why it happened. This method has proven effective at producing more complete and creative ideas about potential risks than brainstorming alone. Remember, experts who have been calibrated with such methods are the best source of data for any probabilistic risk-assessment method, but what’s the best method of risk assessment? The absolute best method for assessing risks is called the Monte Carlo Simulation. It’s been used to evaluate some of the biggest risks imaginable from nuclear power safety to oil exploration and even environmental policies. How does it work? Monte Carlo tests analyze the variables associated with any given risk and process data to produce risk analysis models. In other words, a Monte Carlo displays all the factors that influence the probability and magnitude of a risk and then uses them to run thousands of random scenarios which ascertain the real probability of particular outcomes. For instance, imagine you want to invest $1.5 million in a new factory to produce wrenches. The variables are how much the factory could produce, the average price you can get for a wrench and the average demand per year. By combining these variables you can determine the return on your investment in the first year, aka the risk of making no money. The next step? Once you have your variables in place you need to set realistic ranges for them. In the ideal scenario you’ll have empirical data to go off, but in most cases you’ll need to rely on some sort of expert opinion, of course improved through calibration training. So, say your calibrated experts come up with a low to high range for production capacity of 400,000 to 1 million, price boundaries of $0.7 to $2.5 and a demand range of between 300,000 and 1.5 million. Your model then randomly creates 10,000 or more scenarios within these ranges and tells you how much money you’d make or lose in each situation. As long as your variables were certain, the mean of all the returned outcomes should be your real return. But remember that this hypothetical was simple and didn’t include tricky things like the correlations between variables, for instance between demand and price. In a standard simulation you’ll likely be dealing with more than 50 variables that are complexly interrelated! One of the most common criticisms of quantitative probability methods like the Monte Carlo simulation is that there’s simply not enough data to simulate specific events. The skeptics agree that methods like these are preferable to soft methods such as scoring, but maintain that there’s no way to get the data necessary for a simulation to be effective, using this claim to justify the use of expert opinion and scoring methods. But the truth is, there’s a better option. Institutions like insurance companies and the nuclear-power industry compute the odds of hypothetical events all the time. For instance, nuclear power companies have run several simulations of events that are likely to occur once every 500 years – longer than the industry has even existed. How do they do it? By deconstructing the risk model – in this case a nuclear power plant – into its component parts and computing the risk of failure for each individual component. This works because while some disasters have never occurred and as a result there’s no data for such events, the nuclear power industry does have extensive research and empirical data on the failure rates of the individual parts which compose a power plant – things like human error, valves and different materials. This technique of deconstruction can be applied to most situations. You’ll be amazed at how much you can learn by carefully taking the object of your risk assessment apart and searching for data. Once you’ve attained data in this way you can pass it along to someone with the requisite knowledge about the relationships between the components and construct a risk model like a Monte Carlo. The model will in turn calculate the probability of multiple parts failing simultaneously or in quick succession; it will also calculate the magnitude of the disaster, and just like that you’ve ascertained the risk of something that never occurred. So the accuracy of any probability assessment is based on the quality of the model that’s used and the precision of the parameters and assumptions that are fed into it. Knowing this, you can ensure your model is accurate by comparing your estimates with the facts on the ground. Why? Because testing your predictions against reality will uncover flaws, such as variables that are consistently missing from your estimates. This information is key to finding weaknesses in your model and will help you improve your probabilistic tools. But how can you know if conducting a risk analysis is worth it for your organization? To figure that out, you need to consider the value of additional information. For instance, the ultimate goal of conducting a risk analysis is to mitigate danger, because in a business context this almost always means saving money. Therefore, it’s essential to calculate what risk experts call the expected value of additional information. For example, if you could save $30,000 in minimized risk by spending $8,000 on a survey, the expense is a no-brainer. But according to the experience of the author, most people don’t take the time to determine the value of additional information. You can avoid this mistake by calculating what a risk analysis is worth to you with these easy steps: Begin by determining what’s called your expected opportunity loss; this probability of your losing money in any scenario multiplied by the amount of money you'd lose. Let’s say this number, your expected “cost of being wrong,” comes out at $60,000. Now you know how much money you’re willing to spend for information that’ll make you sure of your investment. Once you’ve determined this, it’s time to look for uncertain variables in your model that contribute the most to your target parameter – the return on your investment, in this case. For example, being more certain about the average price of your goods could drastically increase the assurance that you’ll turn a profit. Building, utilizing and maintaining the appropriate risk-management tools is essential to mitigating risk, but even with the right tools there are still plenty of barriers to managing risk – for instance, things like organizational silos, a type of structural problem resulting in the blockage of information, resources and authority. Consider the fact that all managers are in part risk managers because every manager is required, to some degree, to measure risk and return. In most cases, managers can effectively monitor the risk of their own area. But when it comes to assessing the risk of major decisions that have implications for multiple departments – like the construction of a new production facility, for example – you’ll need a more comprehensive approach to analysis. Why? Because it’ll help you overcome problems like organizational silos, stubborn departments and managers who don’t readily share information with others. It’s therefore essential to have a department devoted to reviewing and standardizing all risk-related decisions while unifying decision-makers and subject experts. Because such a department, in addition to keeping tabs on risks and their relationships across your organization, will also be better at identifying the stakeholders and experts who are essential to assessing risk and return. Not just that, but by having a standardized process for risk analysis you can optimize your existing risk models by adding new empirical data and building what’s called a scenario library – a collection of standard corporate risk scenarios replete with a set of variables and correlations. This tool can then be used as the standard for everyone in your organization! The key message in this book: The most common risk-management methods are flawed because they rely on qualitative descriptions and don’t account for human bias and the relationships between risks.Therefore, in order to effectively determine and manage risk it’s essential to use probabilistic models, which rely on calibrated experts and comprehensive variables.  Suggested further reading: The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb The Black Swan offers insights into perceived randomness and the limitations we face in making predictions. Our over-reliance on methods that appeal to our intuition at the expense of accuracy, our basic inability to understand and define randomness, and even our biology itself all contribute to poor decision making, and sometimes to “Black Swans” – events thought to be impossible that redefine our understanding of the world.

They live from paycheck to paycheck, hoping their credit cards don’t get refused and trying not to think too much about their overdraft. That shouldn’t come as a great surprise. Today’s aspirational society encourages consumption, while simultaneously providing next to no financial education. For many young people, the only financial advice they see are tone-deaf articles about rash millennials buying so much avocado toast that they can’t afford to buy a house (conveniently forgetting the matter of their crushing student debt in the process). If you, too, feel a bit helpless when it comes to money – budgeting, saving, investing and securing your financial future – then these blinks are for you. They will help you take small but important steps toward getting your finances in order, and will show you that being financially savvy isn’t just about boring budget spreadsheets and savings accounts – it’s also about learning to cook well, take care of yourself and nurture your career. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to make a simple budget to understand your financial income and spending; why a dollar spent and a dollar saved are not of the same value; and how to get paid what you deserve. If you’re lost at sea when it comes to money, maybe it’s best to start your financial diet nice and slow. There are four “don’t you dare” rules that we can all remember and follow; if you do so, you’ll have taken a big step toward steadying your finances. First, don’t you dare spend money on credit if you can’t pay it off within a month. Sure, credit cards have their benefits – they can help build a credit score and get you air miles. But if you have one, treat it like a debit card. The day you spend money you can’t pay back in a month is the day you sabotage your financial health, because that’s when the interest starts to accrue. Second, don’t you dare fall into the CEO lifestyle. When the author first became CEO of her own enterprise, it changed her thinking. Suddenly she would think, “I deserve this $150 facial, because a CEO’s gotta look good, right?” We all convince ourselves that we need certain things to live the lifestyle we want, whether that means an iced latte every day, or a taxi home instead of the subway. The reality is that we don’t need these things, so we should get over them. Spend according to the budget you have, not for the lifestyle you think you should be living. Third, don’t you dare go a week without checking your bank balance at least twice. Just like a reluctant dieter avoids looking at the caloric content of the cake they are devouring, lots of people in poor financial situations just can’t bring themselves to look at their account balance. You can’t get on a financial diet until you confront the reality of your income and spending, however gruesome it might look the first time you check. And finally, don’t you dare imagine that savings will just magically appear. When you are young, it’s easy to think of your current self and your future self as two completely different people, and pass the responsibility for saving on to “future me.” Many people think that merely staying out of debt is enough and they can worry about savings in the future. But the fact of the matter is, there is only one you – and you need to start saving, even if it’s just a little, right now. Follow these rules and you’ll already be avoiding a lot of common mistakes. But to really get to grips with your financial diet, you need to learn how to budget. One of the fun things about being an adult is the freedom it brings – to stay up late, or to spend your money exactly how you like. That freedom is a rush, and constructing a strict budget for yourself might feel restrictive. But without one, you will be forever financially lost. So the first, most important step in your financial diet is to establish what money is coming in and going out. There are lots of useful apps you can use to do this, like Mint or You Need a Budget, but you can also just make a simple spreadsheet. Whatever you choose, start by entering all your income after tax, like your salary or freelance earnings. Next, enter all of your expenditures. Do this for at least the last two months, and do it honestly, including all expenses – everything from your rent check to that Diet Coke you bought yesterday. And finally, add any savings you have put aside, like money going into a retirement fund. Once you’ve done this, you can start to analyze the results. How much are you spending on food each month? And how much on late-night online shopping? Could you be paying off your debt quicker? Is that $80 a month takeaway coffee habit really worth sacrificing potential savings of $960 a year? Simply analyzing your budget should lead you to some sensible conclusions about your financial behavior. But it can also be helpful to introduce a system to guide your future behavior. The 50/30/20 plan is a simple way to ensure that your spending is under control and your savings are at a sensible level. Here, 50 percent of your income should go on fixed costs, like your rent and utilities. Thirty percent should go to lifestyle or variable costs, like your groceries, travel and nights out. And finally, 20 percent should be saved. This system works well because it gives an easy-to-understand framework against which to judge your expenditures. If you see that you are spending 40 percent of your income on lifestyle expenditures, and only saving 10 percent, you know you need to make a few adjustments. Everyone’s breakdown will be a little different – some might only spend 40 percent on their fixed costs, for instance – but the crucial step is coming to grips with the basics: how much money is coming in and what it’s being spent on. Only then can you start to think about getting more value out of the money you have. Ask yourself a question: are you working for your money, or is your money working for you? If you are stuck thinking about working for your money, it’s time to become your money’s boss. Make it work for you, as soon and as much as possible, by investing it. Whether you are able to put away a dollar a day or ten, you should start doing so as soon as you can. Being young is a secret shortcut to increasing your wealth, because it means that your money has more time to multiply. To understand how this happens, you need the rule of 72. The rule of 72 shows how long it will take any investment to double in value. You just need to divide the number 72 by the annual interest rate, or return, you’ll receive on any investment or savings account. That gives you the number of years until your original money is doubled. For example, investments with a return of 7 percent will double your money in 10.28 years. So, invest $1,000 in a fund returning 7 percent a year, and in a decade you’ll have $2,000, without you needing to do any work for it. Now that you understand how your money can work for you, you realize that a dollar saved and invested is not the same as a dollar spent. Let’s say you are thinking about spending $100 on a new dress. The dress is nice, but you can now see that your choice is not between spending the $100 or saving $100; it’s between spending $100 now, or having $200 in ten years time, $400 in 20 years time and $800 in 30 years time. So if you think investing is something that only old people do, don’t be fooled. Being young gives you an advantage when it comes to investing: the sooner you start, the more time your money has to multiply. Next, let’s take a look at what you should be doing with your money in practice. For many of us, thinking about investing conjures up images of men on a trading floor, shouting into telephones as they frantically buy and sell stocks and bonds. The good news is that the reality of investing is very different and much simpler than that. But before diving in, there are two things you need to do. First, build an emergency fund. In addition to always having a little money in your standard checking account for everyday expenses, you should also have an emergency fund covering at least three months of living costs. You never know when you might get sick, have your house flooded or experience some other disaster that requires some immediate cash. Second, pay off your debt, especially if it charges more interest than you could receive by putting the money in savings or investments. If you’re earning a 3 percent return on your investments, but paying 4 percent on your credit card or student debt, that’s a net loss. Once you’ve sorted these two steps, you are set to invest. The best starting point is probably a retirement account, like a 401(k). That’s because, up to a certain amount, your employer will likely match the contributions that you make. And that means free money! If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) contributions, then you could start to look at IRAs – Individual Retirement Accounts – which allow you to invest and then deduct the investment on your taxes. More free money! Once you’ve got to grips with 401(k)s and IRAs, a whole world of investing awaits. You can, for example, invest in low-risk funds like index funds, which track overall performance of an index like the New York Stock Exchange’s Dow Jones. Or, if you feel confident enough, you could start to pick individual stocks to buy. But to start with, keep things simple and speak to your HR advisor at work about your 401(k). It’s likely they’ll be able to give one-to-one advice as to what options are available to you – and if not, there are plenty of free financial workshops out there. Before you know it, you’ll be a full-fledged investor who can sit back and relax, happy in the knowledge that your money is working for you. Setting money aside in a fund isn’t the only way to invest in your future; you can also expand your career horizons or build your skill set and experiences. A great way to do so is to find a mentor who can help you. One of the author’s early mentors was Joanne Cleaver, a journalist and entrepreneur. Cleaver argues that networking is a key to building a successful and satisfying career, because being known by the right people for the right things always pays off in the long run. One great way to network, Cleaver says, is to volunteer. Sure, working for free sounds tough. But think of it as working for yourself, with the payoff coming a little further down the road. When Cleaver worked for a city newspaper, she offered to help out with its annual charity drive. She mocked up a newspaper front page with tear-jerking stories about their city and how donations could address them. The result? The newsroom donated more cash than ever before. Weeks later, Cleaver found herself invited to the newspaper’s president’s suite. The president loved the mock-up so much that she’d printed out a bunch to share with all the other executives, establishing an instant reputation and goodwill for Cleaver. But no matter how great a networker you are, your financial health will always struggle if you don’t get appropriate compensation for your work. Negotiating your salary can be a little scary, but it’s also one of the most powerful ways to improve your financial health. Thankfully, these days it’s easy to find out a benchmark salary for any job simply by searching websites such as PayScale and Glassdoor, asking people in the relevant industry or even just going on Reddit and anonymously asking the world at large. Once you have a clear view of what you are worth, go into any compensation conversation prepared to negotiate, not accept, an opening offer. Remember that negotiation is an indicator of confident professionalism, so stay positive, always ask for time to consider an offer and never act overly impressed with what’s on the table. Get this right and you’re on track for a financially healthy work life. But there’s more to life than work, so let’s take a look at another aspect of a successful financial diet – your actual diet. Many millennials have a strange relationship with food. It’s not necessarily that they eat badly, but they are more likely to slave over a fancy recipe found on Pinterest than to rustle up something simple from leftovers in the fridge; they’re also more familiar with local takeout menus than with good, honest, everyday cooking. This approach to food can cost you. It costs you the pleasure of eating a simple home-cooked meal and, of course, it costs you financially. So if you’ve done your budget and are horrified by how much you’re spending on food, maybe you could learn a little from Italian grandmothers. The typical Italian grandmother is always whipping up something delicious, not based on what she’s just seen on Instagram, but based on what ingredients are in season, what’s in the cupboard and what’s about to go off and needs to be used. She cooks in large quantities, freezes what she can and is focused on everything in moderation rather than any dieting fad. So how can you achieve that Italian grandmother status? The most important thing is to stock your kitchen properly. It’s crucial to stop thinking of individual recipes – like what you need to recreate the Bang Bang chicken you ate in a restaurant last week – and start thinking in terms of what you need to make sure you can always cook something at home. If you’ve got good olive oil, some salt and pepper, dried chilis, spices, herbs, garlic and onions at home, then when you find yourself with nothing but a leftover eggplant and some tomatoes in the fridge, you’ll have everything you need for a delicious pasta sauce. Being able to throw something together is a great life skill that will not only enable you to eat well, all the time; it also means fewer costly trips to the grocery store for a specific set of ingredients. Oh, and one last thing: never, ever go shopping while drunk, upset or hungry – that’s a surefire recipe for abandoning your nutritional and financial diets. Think of money not as a way to buy happiness, but as a way to buy a happiness construction kit. It can’t buy you inner peace, but it can buy you the comfort and security you need to take risks and pursue your ambitions. Even then, it can be hard to maintain a sane approach to money, your future and your life fulfillment. But here’s how you can. First, don’t dream big – dream medium. Society today, and social media in particular, is relentlessly aspirational. Pinterest and Instagram posts constantly tell us, via a message written over an image of a tropical beach or a yacht in azure blue seas, that if we just work hard enough and follow our dreams, we can achieve anything. The reality is that for most of us, that simply isn’t true. Maybe the Yale-graduate trust-funder has enough cash in the bank to dream big and launch a start-up. For the single mom holding down two jobs and paying off $35,000 of student loans, things look a little different. So there’s no shame, and a lot of sense, in dreaming medium – pursuing your goals in earnest but with a touch of realism about what is and what isn’t possible at any given time. That means making conscious decisions about when and where in life you want to take risks, and when it makes sense to play it safe. When you do decide to take a risk, like moving to a new city or changing careers, try to think things through and plan in advance, both financially and logistically. Second, be open about money. It’s odd, but even in today’s era of constant communication, people simply don’t like to talk about money. The author’s friend, Anna Breslaw, has said that while she was an editor at Cosmopolitan for two years, she received hundreds of intimate questions and requests for advice from readers – but she almost never heard anything about money. People, it seems, are more comfortable talking about anal sex than their salaries. But just like your sex life probably won’t improve if you never talk about it, neither will your attitude to money. Once you feel able to talk freely and openly about money, to your friends or your partner, you’ll notice improvements. You’ll be more confident professionally, more demanding toward yourself and more attuned to what is and isn’t healthy. If you can achieve that, then the financial diet will have worked for you. The key message in these blinks: Money helps you build the life you really want to have, now and in the future. That doesn’t mean you have to obsess about it or build your life around it. But it does mean that you should make sure you understand how to manage money, make it work for you and ensure that your financial situation supports rather than prevents you from achieving your dreams.  Actionable advice: Create a home that makes you feel good.  If you feel good about your home, you’ll be more happy spending time in it, meaning more life satisfaction and less expensive nights out. Mastering some basic home skills – like changing light bulbs, assembling and revamping furniture or hanging a picture on the wall – will pay off big time, as they will lower the bar to making home improvements. The great news is there are plenty of resources online. So, the next time you need to put up some shelves, check on Youtube before you call in help. Got feedback?

Using his experience of political strategy, his media savvy and his deep knowledge of how political and regulatory decision-making works, Tusk has helped start-ups like Uber, FanDuel and Lemonade fight back against an establishment that wanted to eliminate them. In these blinks, we’ll discover how Tusk learned the craft of political campaigning and strategy, from securing press coverage for Chuck Schumer to ruining Anthony Weiner’s prospects for the New York mayoralty. We’ll find out how as an advisor to, and investor in, major start-ups, he has battled against corrupt decision-making, entrenched corporate interests and regulatory laziness. In these blinks, you’ll learn: what a funeral for dead trees taught Tusk about the power of the media; how Uber demonstrated that people power could override establishment interests; and why if things had been just a little different, we could have had President Bloomberg instead of President Trump. All politicians crave two things: Constant attention and constant validation. Outside of elections, the best way to achieve those is to get good publicity. Tusk learned this in the 1980s working for Henry Stern, a New York City council member and the city’s parks commissioner. Tusk’s job was to get as much publicity for Stern as possible, partly because it kept the politician happy, and partly because the more time the Parks Department spent in the public eye, the easier it would be for Stern to secure his budget and policies. Parks aren’t inherently that interesting, so Tusk was forced to be creative. When Stern wanted to push for new measures to make it a crime to fell trees without permission, Tusk staged a funeral for \"murdered” trees. When a new bathroom was constructed in one of the city’s parks, the media were invited not to a ribbon-cutting ceremony, but the ceremonial cutting of a toilet roll. The press lapped it up, the coverage was great, and Stern was happy. Tusk’s creativity came in handy in his next job, as communications director to Chuck Schumer, Democratic senator for New York. Schumer understood that most voters don’t really know what politicians do all day. But they do like to see that their politicians are busy. As a result, the whole Schumer operation revolved around getting constant media coverage. This could be difficult, because as a junior senator, Schumer didn’t have all that much to do. So Tusk and his team would invent things, like writing a tough letter to the Ford Motor Company in protest at the rising cost of windshield wiper liquid. On one occasion, Tusk worked up and released to the media a proposal for the modernization of the old-fashioned, unreliable voting machines used in elections. This idea proved unexpectedly prescient when, weeks later, the 2000 presidential election descended into chaos due, in part, to disputed votes made on old-fashioned punch-card machines. It seemed clear that America needed a new system. An avalanche of press coverage for Schumer – now regarded as the expert on the subject – ensued. Tusk learned how to give his political bosses what they craved. And that was an important lesson for his future career: if you can mold the media narrative, you can get what you want from politicians. When Tusk became campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg’s bid for a third mayoral term in 2009, the outlook wasn’t great. During eight years in office, Bloomberg had put up taxes, raised water rates and cost New Yorkers a lot of money. The mayor was in for a fight, whoever his opponent turned out to be. But what Tusk wanted to avoid was going up against state congressman Anthony Weiner. At the time, Weiner was a leading Democratic contender. He was charismatic, a great fundraiser, and – importantly in multiethnic New York – a Jewish guy with an Italian name. So Tusk built an entire campaign solely to knock Weiner out of contention for the Democratic nomination. How? By making Weiner feel like the risk of standing was so great that he would simply quit. This entailed fighting dirty to make Weiner nervous about the scrutiny he’d face if he did run. The only legislation Weiner had passed was a bill giving more visas to models. Tusk’s research team found that Weiner had received donations from some of the models in question. This was not just pay-to-play – donating in return for favors – it was also illegal, as only US citizens can make donations. After a briefing from Tusk’s team, the New York Post ran a damaging story about “Weiner’s ‘Naughty’ Hottie$.” Tusk also wanted to intimidate Weiner with a show of strength when canvassing voters house by house. Normally, starting this activity early is pointless, as voters largely ignore elections until near voting day. But this time, the aim wasn’t to win votes. It was to intimidate Weiner. Bloomberg volunteers went doorknocking in Weiner and his family’s neighborhoods. When Weiner’s dad opened his front door to the Bloomberg campaign, it sent a message. Tusk did the same with digital, bulk-buying online adverts, but only for users in Weiner’s zip code. Every time Weiner went online he’d see \"Bloomberg for mayor” ads. The highly personal, targeted strategy worked. Eventually, with his polling numbers looking weak, and his sense of personal jeopardy growing, Weiner chose not to run. Bloomberg went on to win a third term. This was Tusk’s last campaign in politics. He got a bonus, $234,000 after taxes, from a grateful Bloomberg, and used it to set up a political strategy consultancy. Things started a little slow, but then Tusk took a call from a contact. A transportation start-up was having problems. Could Tusk help? Today, Uber is part of everyday life for millions of people. But not long ago, the rise of the ride-hailing company was under threat from all sides. The unions hated Uber because they couldn’t organize its drivers, who were all small businessmen. The taxi industry hated Uber because lifelong taxi users were abandoning them overnight after experiencing a single Uber ride. Regulators disliked Uber because it was new and different. And politicians hated Uber because their donors from the taxi industry were harassing them about it. In response to these challenges, Uber hired Tusk. Washington DC was an early example of the fight they faced. At the request of the city’s taxi commissioner and taxi industry, a local politician introduced legislation that would, in practice, ban Uber. Tusk had seen time and again in his earlier career that politicians can be manipulated if you can shift the public narrative. Politicians don’t necessarily consider issues by looking for the best public policy solution. They think \"Is this going to anger my donors? How is this going to make me look good or bad in the media?\" Therefore, Tusk aimed to demonstrate that popular opinion on this issue was so strong that it outweighed the interests of taxi-industry donors. Tusk’s team crafted a press release accusing DC politicians of keeping transportation prices artificially high to protect the influential taxi industry. This started to shape the media narrative. Then, through its app, Uber encouraged drivers and customers to contact their DC city council member directly to express their anger at the ban, providing the contact details to do so. Usually, a city councilor gets just a couple dozen calls or emails about even a contentious issue. So they were not prepared for what happened next – almost 40,000 tweets and 50,000 emails from Uber users and drivers to city politicians in just a couple of days. When you can show a politician that your ability to generate negative media and hurt his poll ratings far outweighs the benefits of keeping his donors happy, then you can get him to do pretty much anything you want. After Tusk’s campaign, not only was the legislation abandoned, but new legislation explicitly authorizing Uber passed unanimously later that year. But Tusk and Uber would still face a hard fight with higher stakes. Nowhere was more important to Uber than New York, because what happens in the nation’s cultural and financial capital sets a precedent that other cities and states often follow. Unfortunately for Uber, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed legislation to limit Uber’s growth at 1 percent a year. In effect, de Blasio’s bill would kill Uber in the Big Apple and send a huge negative signal to the world, likely damaging Uber’s growth elsewhere. Tusk came up with a strategy to surprise de Blasio. Firstly, they hit him from the left. De Blasio’s whole brand was about being on the side of New York’s vulnerable – people on lower incomes, immigrants and people of color. But these were precisely the people who benefitted from Uber, whether as drivers or users. So Tusk ran ads that featured passengers from the Bronx and from Queens. They related how yellow taxis ignored them because of the color of their skin, and how with Uber they could finally reliably catch a ride. De Blasio was suddenly on the wrong side of his own supporters. Secondly, they pushed the idea that de Blasio’s agenda was pure corruption. Taxi drivers were the mayor’s second largest donors, and Tusk would later discover that the industry had written the legislation that de Blasio published. The taxi industry in New York had deep pockets, but Uber was rapidly eating up their market. Tusk’s team generated media stories about the dubious links between the mayor and industry, and suddenly, de Blasio looked to be the very thing he’d always railed against – a man in the pocket of moneyed interests. Thirdly, Tusk again unleashed the full power of Uber’s users. Uber added a \"de Blasio” button on the app. Users who tapped on it received an explanation of the problem, along with a request to email and tweet their council members. In just one week, 250,000 people did just that. After a couple of weeks of pressure from the media, drivers and users, city council members started to drop support for de Blasio. Supporting de Blasio and the taxi industry was no longer more important than stopping the public beating they were getting from real voters. A little later, the mayor’s office abandoned the bill. Uber’s future was safe. Handy is a platform that connects customers with handymen and cleaners. The workers are independent contractors, just like Uber drivers. But the start-up planned to do something new – to give its independent contractors benefits like a pension or healthcare. Handy’s idea was to set up a benefits fund that other sharing economy platforms like Uber or Lyft could also pay into if they wished. Potentially millions more American workers could get benefits while maintaining the flexibility of being an independent contractor. All Handy needed were clarifications to labor laws so that contractors paying benefits wouldn’t be reclassified as full-time employees. So who stood in the way of this improvement to working conditions? Surprisingly, unions and Democratic politicians. Unions hate independent contractors. They can’t organize them, represent them or, crucially, charge them membership dues. And the United States’ existing, vague labor laws gave unions influence. Vague laws meant unions could put pressure on politicians – usually in receipt of union donations – to apply state laws in a way that prohibited the rise of independent contractors and the sharing economy. Tusk and Handy took the fight to New York but immediately ran up against a brick wall in the form of SEIU 32BJ, the union for security guards and janitors. SEIU 32BJ doesn’t represent any housekeepers, but nonetheless regarded anything related to cleaning as their jurisdiction and wouldn’t give ground. The union’s president, Hector Figueroa, had good political reasons not to. After all, he would soon be up for re-election. His opponents would pounce on any sign of weakness, like modifying New York’s labor laws in a way that could make life easier for non-unionized independent contractors. When Tusk’s team talked to the office of the state governor, Democrat Andrew Cuomo, the problem was clear. Cuomo’s labor-issues representative clearly understood Handy’s proposal. But the same question kept coming up \"What’s 32BJ’s view on this?\" The governor wouldn’t do anything that the union opposed. Tusk didn’t win this fight in New York. But he and Handy continue to battle at state and federal levels to secure new laws. Sometimes, creative campaigns can overcome self-interested politics. Other times, that creativity needs to be matched with persistence. The ancient Greek philosopher Pericles said that just because you take no interest in politics, it doesn’t mean politics isn’t going to take any interest in you. The daily fantasy sports industry should have heeded those words when it was thrown off course by a political risk it didn’t see coming. Daily fantasy sports games are now big business. The games allow fans to create fantasy team lineups for major sports like the NFL and win money depending on their selected players’ performance in real-world games each day. In 2014 and 2015, the new market grew incredibly fast. The two companies which account for almost all the market, FanDuel and DraftKings, received hundreds of millions in investments, and their customer base rocketed. The two businesses were so relentlessly focused on competing with one another that they didn’t give much consideration to the opponents they shared. These included the casinos, who have long established and tight relationships with state governments, and the politicians and advocacy groups from both left and right who hate gaming. Tusk even met with FanDuel in 2015, but while the business liked Tusk’s ideas, it was so focused on its competition that it felt political strategy wasn’t a priority. So FanDuel were poorly prepared when, in October 2015, the New York Times published a damning accusation claiming that a midlevel DraftKings employee had used confidential information to enhance his teams in a FanDuel competition, winning $350,000. The accusations would never be proven, but the damage had been done. The attorney general for New York State announced an investigation into the industry, and other states followed, urged on by local casinos and anti-gaming advocates. Suddenly, the legality of daily fantasy sports was in doubt in 39 states. The situation rapidly turned into a lobbying match between casinos and daily fantasy sports. Tusk, now working with FanDuel to fight back, knew well that in a battle between long-time political donors – the casinos – and start-ups with no political relationships, the casinos would win. Unless, just like with Uber, they could fight back with a wave of customer advocacy so big that politicians wouldn’t be able to ignore it. Using the FanDuel app, 150,000 customers contacted their state legislators. By the end of the 2017 legislative session, they’d passed legislation securing daily fantasy sports in 15 states. It was a good outcome but, had the start-ups been better prepared, they wouldn’t have needed to defend themselves. If you’ve ever had to deal with all the bureaucracy and costs of traditional insurance companies, you’ll probably agree that the industry needs a little disruption. So Lemonade, a fully digital insurance company that promised easy sign-up, low prices and a typical payout time of three seconds, seemed like a pretty good bet to disrupt the industry. Lemonade’s model was different from normal insurers. It was based around customers paying into a pool from which Lemonade drew its costs and profit, and from which any claims were paid out. Any money left over in the pool at the end of the year would be paid back to customers instead of Lemonade keeping it as profit, as a traditional insurer would. There was just one problem – the New York Department of Financial Services, or DFS, was refusing to grant Lemonade an insurance license. Lemonade seemed to be too different to tick all the boxes needed to grant a license because DFS’s inflexible processes were based around traditional insurance models. It was clear to Tusk that simply talking to the regulators wouldn’t work, so he decided on a political strategy. Tusk and Lemonade would persuade the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, to overrule the regulator by showing the high political cost if Lemonade wasn’t approved. As a start-up, being able to take on the regulator and politicians depends on having a couple of things: a narrative into which the media can buy, good inside lobbying, money to spend on advertising, the ability to hurt the politicians by leaving town and the moral high ground. Luckily, Lemonade had them all. Tusk’s team started spreading the story that New York was so under the influence of its entrenched business interests that innovative Lemonade would be forced to relocate to London. This was supported by a more aggressive line. A researcher collected lists of political donations from the insurance industry to Cuomo, enabling Lemonade to pitch stories about pay-to-play decision-making. Tusk’s team prepared a letter from a group of venture capitalists saying that if New York couldn’t license an innovator like Lemonade, what was the point of investing in the city’s tech sector? Tusk saw some signs that the DFS’s senior team were getting nervous about the pressure, but with no decision forthcoming, Tusk’s lobbyists told the governor's office to make up its mind. Either the newspaper headlines the next day would say that New York just approved an innovative, customer-friendly insurance business, or they could say that one of the hottest start-ups in the United States just left town because the governor preferred bureaucracy to jobs. A few days later, Lemonade was approved. Michael Bloomberg looked, on paper, like a great candidate for the 2016 presidential election. He was an independent at a time when distrust for both parties was high and he could self-finance his entire campaign, meaning he wouldn’t be beholden to any special interests. In early 2016, Bloomberg started seriously considering a run for the presidency, and Tusk agreed to take a leave of absence from his business to run the campaign if it went ahead. The strategy for victory was complicated. Bloomberg could never win a majority in the electoral college – the usual route to the White House. But if he could win enough states to prevent anyone else getting a majority, then the House of Representatives would have to elect the president. Then he might be able to secure the critical votes. Tusk had to get imaginative about how Bloomberg would get his vote out. After all, Bloomberg had no party infrastructure on which to rely. So he made a proposal to Uber. If the Bloomberg campaign would pay for a ride for every United States voter to and from the polling station, would Uber put a Bloomberg button on its app? Customers taking a free ride wouldn’t have to vote for the guy, of course, but there was a good chance they would. Tusk’s second idea was to differentiate Bloomberg from Clinton and Trump. He wanted to build the campaign around the idea that one person can’t solve America’s problems alone. But if you believe America is broken, went Tusk’s thesis, Bloomberg will give you a team of the brightest and best to fix it. The idea was to recruit the most talented people to fill the government. On Tusk’s wish list were Bill Gates for education secretary, Elon Musk for energy secretary and Warren Buffett for the Treasury. In the end, Tusk’s innovative campaign ideas didn’t matter because Bloomberg decided not to run. At the time, the polling indicated that he was most likely to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances if he ran, increasing the chances of Trump getting into office. That, for Bloomberg, was the issue settled. He wasn’t prepared to risk letting Trump take the presidency. For Tusk, the decision was hard to swallow. It meant missing a once-in-a-lifetime chance to run an innovative presidential bid on an unlimited budget. And when Trump's victory later came to pass, Tusk regretted the lost opportunity of a Bloomberg presidency, which could have – in Tusk’s view – offered a safer, better America. Traditional businesses have a competitive advantage when it comes to politics. They know plenty of politicians, have lobbyists in all the right places and make tactically savvy donations. They’ll use all of these advantages to stop the start-ups trying to disrupt their markets. So if you work for or have founded a start-up, it’s time to even things up. Here’s how to get a little savvier about how to fight back. Firstly, if you aren’t clear whether your product or service complies with all regulations, then work out whether to ask for permission before launching or just get on with it and beg for forgiveness later. Uber took the latter approach, deciding that its best interests lay in rolling out the service without asking regulators for explicit permission. It quickly built a loyal customer base and then fought its regulatory battles – begging for forgiveness for any infringements it had committed and working through its problems from a position of strength. As Uber showed, this can be a powerful approach to take. But it isn’t always right. A key question to ask is \"from whom would you be begging?\" There’s a big difference between dealing with an irritated regulator and finding yourself up in front of a judge and jury with the prospect of a jail sentence. Try and avoid the latter. Whatever approach it takes, every start-up that threatens the status quo will face a political fight at some point, so consider what tools you have to fight with. Firstly, what are your politically valuable assets? Can you either give or take away? Like jobs, for instance, or your HQ. Can you threaten a move out of the state? Secondly, who are your allies? Fighting alone is hard, so try to build a coalition that will convince your decision-makers, whether that means consumer-rights advocates or VC investors. Or get creative – perhaps a local politician has recently gotten tough with a different start-up and wants to prove he isn’t completely anti-innovation. If so, recruit him to your cause. Ultimately, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to fighting political battles. But investing in understanding the politicians who could impact your business, and how to shape the narrative in a way that will keep them on your side, could prove to be one of the best investments you’ll ever make. The key message in these blinks: When you disrupt someone, in industry or in politics, they don’t thank you for it. They punch you in the face. So start-ups facing political and regulatory risks need to learn to punch back. They can do that by understanding how to shift the public and media narrative in favor of their interests by exploiting signs of corruption in political decision-making and by mobilizing their customers. If you are a start-up founder, getting savvy about politics could be one of the best investments you ever make.  Actionable advice: Incorporate political analysis into your expansion strategy.  If you are plotting market expansion, include an analysis of the political and regulatory outlook. Consider what laws may permit or limit your activity, and whether the political climate is pro-innovation or a little conservative. When weighing up potential new markets, consider how powerful your opponents are in each. That way you can be best prepared for any political battles ahead of you. Got feedback?

These can include car dealers, infomercial hosts and real estate agents. What these three have in common is that they’re all trying to sell you something. Many people believe that to become successful in these industries, you’ve got to do whatever it takes. This can sometimes even mean engaging in morally questionable practices. But what if there’s another way? These blinks provide an alternative method for closing deals that’s based on honesty and positivity. Following the advice of one of America’s greatest property sales professionals will set you on the path to success, whether you’re in the real estate industry or not. In these blinks, you’ll discover the difference between the hard sell and the soft sell; the three main goals you should set yourself; and the importance of speaking second. If you were to start a business, what would it do? Would you run a café? Or create your own clothing line? Or sell luxury homes as a real estate agent? No matter what it is, ensure the success of your new business venture by adopting the right habits from the start. Begin by getting into the routine of setting goals. As a real estate investor with a broad portfolio encompassing New York City and beyond, Anthony Lolli knows a thing or two about success. To achieve similar results in your career, there are three main types of goals you should always set yourself: Short, medium and long-term. If, for example, you want to increase your chances of becoming a successful investor in real estate, your short-term goal should be to obtain your sales license. For your medium-term goal, aim to buy your first investment property, while your long-term goal should be to earn $1 million. All these goals are related to one another – if you can reach the first one, it’ll set you up to reach the second, and then the third. Having goals like these will help you to make decisions wisely. When faced with a difficult decision, you can always ask yourself: Will this bring me closer to my goals? This simple question will make it easier to respond to your toughest career dilemmas. As a six-year-old boy, Lolli’s earliest long-term goal was to buy his mother a mansion. Thus, in early adulthood, when Lolli was deciding whether or not to continue with a job, he asked himself if that decision would bring him closer to purchasing the mansion. For example, he quit his job installing home security systems because he realized he couldn’t possibly get rich doing so. Though Lolli’s goals are related to real estate, his method is something you can adapt to almost any situation to help set yourself up for success. It shouldn’t be a surprise that success requires the help of others. This was one of the toughest lessons Lolli learned on his path to becoming a successful business owner. Look at it this way: your business is something you built from the ground up and it’s incredibly hard if you have no one to help you look after it. To develop a prosperous business, you need a trustworthy team around you. These people are your workplace family – folks you can entrust with your career mission and life’s dedication. Trust is important because the distribution of responsibilities isn’t easy. For example, Lolli once needed to hire someone to fill the role of chief operating officer (COO), who would be responsible for day-to-day decisions regarding the business. Even though the new COO had met his expectations in other roles within the company, Lolli still initially found it hard to relinquish power. Imagine you’re a new parent handing over your baby to a minder for the first time. Not so easy, is it? That’s why it’s crucial to have trust in the people around you. So although it was tough for Lolli to hand over some of his responsibilities to the new COO, his trust in the person made this easier. Another thing to keep in mind when you’re looking to hire someone is to make sure the position is clearly defined. Take time to consider what the purpose of the role is. Ask yourself what problems will be solved by adding this person to the team. Will they be allowed to spend the company’s money? Furthermore, you need to determine how much freedom to give your new recruit. To what extent can they do their job without getting your approval first? By clearly defining each person’s role, you’ll establish distinct expectations that they can strive to meet. Undefined roles will lead to uncertainty about how much authority a person has within the business, which will make it harder for them to live up to expectations. Imagine a beautiful four-bedroom house, located in a great neighborhood and surrounded by excellent local schools. To top it off, the price is significantly below market value. A property such as this doesn’t need any help in being sold – it basically sells itself! The reality, however, is that most properties aren’t perfect, and this means you’ll need to consider how to make them more attractive to buyers. In general, no matter what business you’re in, there are two techniques when it comes to sales: the hard sell and the soft sell. A hard sell involves openly pushing the client toward purchasing your service or product, convincing them into making an emotional, impulsive decision. In the case of real estate, the broker will tell the client that there’s a lot of interest in the apartment – which could be snatched up at any moment – and if they don’t act fast, they risk missing out. A soft sell uses comparatively less pressure. With this technique, the broker might inform the client about current market conditions, present them with alternatives and then allow them to decide. Though the hard sell technique is highly controversial given its high-pressure nature, if used honestly it can be very effective. People who use the hard sell method effectively are highly energetic and infectiously enthusiastic, yet honest. These brokers get their clients excited about purchasing or renting property, but most importantly that enthusiasm comes from an honest place, with the brokers genuinely believing that the property would be an excellent investment for the client. The hard sell is only effective if the product you’re promoting is something you truly believe will be good for the client. If you sell them something they later find out was too expensive or unsuitable, chances are they won’t be doing any business with you in the future, which in turn will cost you money in the long run. Want to know a secret about the perfect property? There isn’t one. Every house or apartment you sell could be a little better – whether by having more space, better natural light or being closer to public transport. Perfection doesn’t exist in the real world, and neither does the perfect home. Knowing this will help you develop the right mindset to deal with any doubts your client may have. One of the most common objections from clients is that a property is too small. Fortunately, this doubt can be easily alleviated by focusing on the property’s upsides. Try leaving the property and walking your client around the neighborhood – especially if they’re moving to a big city like New York or London. Point out the positives that outweigh having a smaller home, such as great entertainment and cultural attractions, as well as being surrounded by an abundance of cafes, bars and restaurants. Let them know that with all these offerings, their home will mostly be used as a place to sleep, so it doesn’t really matter that it’s not particularly big. Another frequent objection is that the building is outdated, but there are ways to mitigate this worry too. You can inform them of the advantages of living in an older building. The first thing to point out is that they’re usually well constructed. If the client is a light sleeper or simply values privacy, they won’t have to worry about noisy neighbors since the building’s thick, solid walls form an effective sound barrier. Another benefit is that hot water and heating are usually included in the rent. Old buildings typically have a central boiler, which tenants have no control over. Having these fees incorporated into the rent can mean significant savings on your client’s utility bills. It’s always important to show the hidden positives of a property, rather than letting clients fixate on superficial issues. This way, they can grasp the full potential of the property in question. Negotiation is the bread and butter of real estate. A typical day as an agent involves you wanting something from your client, who also wants something from you. With a little discussion, bargaining and good will, both parties can walk away satisfied. To obtain this win-win outcome, you need to hone your negotiation skills. First, know that an effective negotiator should be accommodating to the other party. Focusing entirely on what you want demonstrates a disregard for the other person. They might feel as though you’re behaving unfairly, and therefore less likely to continue doing business with you. Moreover, a client who feels cheated will warn others about you, costing you business. Regardless of whether they’re your superior, colleague or subordinate, try to ensure that everyone walks away from a negotiation happy. Speaking honestly about what you want fosters a genuine environment in which you can conduct negotiations as collaborators rather than adversaries. Another tip for effective negotiations is always letting the other person speak first. Usually, whoever speaks first in a negotiation is the one that walks away with less. The reason for this is basic math: every time you make an offer, you narrow your possibilities. Imagine a scenario where you’re required to buy out a tenant so that you can renovate their place: First, you offer them $20,000. By making the first bid, you’ve effectively put up a ceiling on the best possible outcome you can get from this negotiation. Now, it’s much more difficult to turn around and offer them $15,000 later on in the negotiation. That’s why you should always wait for the other party to speak first. After working long enough in the real estate business, you’ll start to see some familiarities between clients. Being able to identify a type of client as soon as they walk through the door will help you quickly determine the best way to help them. One common client type is the out-of-towner. This client is not from the area but has decided to visit for a few days with the sole purpose of finding a new home. They’re typically highly motivated and under a lot of pressure to find a place before their visit is over, meaning that your help would be very much appreciated. Given their enthusiasm, you should lock in as many appointments with them as you can, take time to show them around the area and inform them on the local property market. Another typical type of client is the dreamer – this is someone who wants what they can’t have. Dreamers usually have unrealistic expectations for properties. Maybe they came across their dream house on TV, one that’s impossibly cheap and spacious, and think that this is an attainable goal. So how do you handle clients with such high expectations? The best way is to be completely honest with them. Let them know the facts about the property market. Show them options that they can afford, rather than wasting everyone’s time by offering them properties that are out of their reach. This way you’ll also avoid disappointing them. Regardless of whether your clients are out-of-towners, dreamers, or some other type, the key to being a successful agent is connecting with them. By addressing their needs with a balanced level of enthusiasm and pragmatism, you and your client can find an agreement that you’re both very satisfied with. The key message in these blinks: To become successful in the real estate industry, you need to surround yourself with a trustworthy team that can help you to reach your targets. Sales tactics like the hard sell, speaking second, identifying your client type and highlighting the positives of the property are invaluable tools of the trade, but they’re only effective if there’s honesty behind them. Actionable advice: Get people to refer you. Building rapport with a new client can be tough, but your chances of winning them over are greater if they came through a referral. Ask your friends, acquaintances and previous clients to refer your services to people they know. Word-of-mouth marketing is a powerful tool, and a referred client will already have a favorable opinion of you, so it won’t be too hard to gain their trust. Got feedback?

Perhaps you’d be surprised to discover that by analyzing the behavior of stock-market traders, you can learn how your hormones influence your everyday life and how to improve the way that you deal with stress. Written by a trader-turned-neuroscientist, The Hour Between Dog and Wolf aims to explain the bubbles and crashes of the stock market in terms of the central role played by our physiology and biochemical processes. These blinks contain the key lessons of the book, which – as you’ll soon find out – are not only relevant to making your fortune on the stock market but to all areas of your life. In these blinks, you’ll learn how intuition is as much a product of the body as it is of the brain; that we make decisions to act after our body has already performed the action; why men and women differ greatly in their stress responses; and why hiring more women and older men to work on the trading floors is likely to decrease the risk of a market bubble and crash. When you think about the connection between your brain and your body, how do you picture it? Do you imagine your brain as somehow separate from the rest of your body – a kind of control center that resides in your head, steering the body and causing its every action? If so, then you’re in for a surprise: thinking involves the whole body, not just the brain. For instance, our thoughts and actions are influenced by hormones that stem from different regions of the body. Take Ghrelin, a hormone secreted by cells lining the stomach whenever it’s empty. Release of the hormone causes the brain to register hunger, prompting you to raid the refrigerator for something to eat. But you’re not a slave to Ghrelin. If you have strong reasons for not eating – e.g., a religious fast, hunger strike or a diet – you can effectively ignore Ghrelin’s signals. But this is true only up to a point: over time, the hormone acts somewhat like a lobby group, its signals becoming louder and harder to ignore. As this shows, certain body regions influence the processes in your brain – in this case, registering hunger. And this can be further demonstrated by looking at the way that the gut interacts with the brain. Whenever we’re stressed, the brain will inform the gut that the body is facing an imminent threat, and must therefore prepare for it. Upon “learning” this, the gut will halt the digestion process, in order to save energy for either fight or flight. Stress, in other words, is processed by both body and brain. It works the other way around too: an overly sensitive gut can influence our thinking. In fact, sufferers of Crohn’s disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease, are more sensitive to emotional stimuli. So, if sufferers are exposed to emotive images – such as a distressed child – they’re more likely to become emotionally aroused than healthy people are. Testosterone is considered one of the body’s most powerful hormones because it has a major influence on our behavior. If you’re facing a challenge such as an athletics tournament the body releases testosterone, enabling you to compete for prolonged periods. It accelerates our metabolism and the rate of cell growth, increases our physical strength, lifts our mood and heightens our cognitive performance. But high levels of testosterone also make us more prone to risk taking. In a competitive environment – such as the stock market trading floor – the impulse to take risks can be a destructive one. In the author’s examination of the influence of traders’ testosterone levels on their skill and risk taking, he found that high testosterone levels didn’t increase skill, as skills can be increased only through experience, but it increased the amount of risks traders took, compared with individuals with lower testosterone levels. While risk-taking can often pay off, that success will prompt the body to release even more testosterone. This feedback loop is known as the Winner Effect, and it’s a process that can result in extremely reckless behavior. This effect has been observed in animals, too. After a fight, the victorious male experiences a spike in testosterone, increasing his testosterone levels for the next fight, while the loser’s testosterone levels fall, causing him to avoid fights in the future. The high testosterone levels in the winner will, after a while, transform him. The French even have a name for this moment of transformation: “the hour between dog and wolf” – that hour where the light is so dim that we can’t know whether we’re safe or threatened. Transformed, the victor becomes overconfident and engages in reckless behavior. Animals’ high testosterone levels can lead them to win many of their battles, but, since they are more willing to take too dangerous of risks, they are also likely to die younger. Have you ever wondered how you’re able to catch a fast-moving ball so quickly and accurately, even when there’s little time to make a conscious effort? That’s because our brain anticipates such movements, since our physiology is too slow for us to see things in real time. Due to the structure of the human eye, we experience the external world with a delay of one-tenth of a second. This 100-millisecond delay between the throwing of a ball and our registering that movement means that the brain is forced to anticipate the position of the ball in mid-air. This phenomenon was demonstrated by an experiment in which participants were instructed to look at a screen that showed a circle made of two color bands – blue on the outside, yellow on the inside. The inner yellow circle, however, flashes on and off. Then, this blue-and-yellow circle is moved around the screen. But the observer doesn’t see a travelling blue-and-yellow circle; he sees a moving blue circle with a yellow one lagging behind. Why? Because the brain can anticipate the location of the blue circle, but can’t anticipate that of the flashing yellow one. This experiment demonstrates the way that the human brain anticipates the location of moving objects, rather than seeing that movement in real time. Also, since catching a ball and many other reactions are automatic, our consciousness appears to be a mere by-product of our actions. In the 1970s, physiologist Benjamin Libet performed an experiment in which he measured the electrical activity in his participants’ brains, and instructed them to lift one of their fingers. The participants’ brain region responsible for preparing the action of lifting a finger was active 300 milliseconds before the region responsible for making the decision to lift a finger was engaged. This suggests that conscious decisions come after our brain has prepared for an action. In other words, our consciousness acts much like a bystander, observing a decision already taken. Often, even if we cannot explain how we know something, we still somehow feel that it’s true. This is perhaps the reason that people tend to think of their intuition as a kind of supernatural gift. The fact is, however, that intuition is actually an effect of our body recognizing patterns in the environment. This kind of pattern recognition is particularly important in the cutthroat world of the stock exchange, where traders have to predict the ups and downs of the market. For, in fact – contrary to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which states that markets cannot be predicted at all – traders can learn to predict the market. The Efficient Market Hypothesis is a central principle in economics which argues that markets fluctuate upon the arrival of new information. Since news is by definition unpredictable, proponents of the hypothesis argue that markets must be equally unpredictable. However, if the Efficient Market Hypothesis is true, traders couldn’t make consistently more money than the stock market makes itself. The author tested the hypothesis by examining the Sharpe Ratio, a measure for success in the stock market, of experienced traders, and found it to be 2.5 times higher for them compared with less experienced traders. This shows that they were, on average, making more money than the stock market. Because the most skillful traders were those whose Sharpe Ratio had steadily increased over the years, the researchers concluded that predicting the stock market must be learnable. Yet traders themselves can’t explain how they beat the market; that’s because they depend on their intuition, which is influenced by their automatic physical reactions – or Somatic Markers. The traders can learn the patterns of the market environment subconsciously, because incoming information triggers an unconscious physical response. For example, when a trader considers his available options, his body might respond by tensing up in slightly different ways for each option. So, even though he might not consciously register these body memories, he’ll get a “hunch” and intuitively make the right trade. Even though we might think of stock market trading as an “office job,” the trading floor is often brimming with young, fit males – and often former athletes. Why? To be successful, stock market traders need to possess qualities such as high stamina, excellent concentration skills and a quickness in making trades. For example, traders often must engage in visuo-motor scanning as they survey the screens for – sometimes minute – price anomalies. It’s very taxing on our brain to engage in this kind of activity for a prolonged period, yet traders have to do it for hours at a time. Because this activity requires great concentration, being good at it depends heavily on physical fitness –  getting the right nutrients, enough sleep, and a range of other physiological factors. Traders must be quick, too. If they see a good trading opportunity, they have to pounce on it, since if another trader is quicker to purchase stock, this would cause the stock price to rise and would diminish their returns. Moreover, physical fitness gives traders a greater awareness of their bodies. Thus, they’ll likely be better at interpreting their bodies’ signals – the Somatic Markers – which, as we’ve seen, enable traders to predict patterns in the market, and leads to more reliable hunches on the trading floor. Indeed, in one study, researchers found that they could accurately measure people’s sensitivity to Somatic Markers with a “heartbeat awareness” test. Participants listened to a repetitive tone and were asked to indicate whether or not that tone was in synchrony with their heartbeat. The study showed that fit and well-trained people are better at accurately identifying synchrony than their overweight counterparts, leading some researchers to suggest that possession of this skill should be a prerequisite for the recruitment of traders. While traders are in the middle of a “bull market” – a market in which stock prices are rising – they can begin to feel that they can do no wrong. At first glance, this might seem to be a great situation for a trader to find himself in, but the truth is it can lead to both addiction and greater risk-taking. Just like gambling, risky trading can be addictive because it has the potential to increase our dopamine levels – a hormone associated with feelings of desire. In a study, rats were given one drop of juice which caused their dopamine levels to rise. When this was repeated for a while, the onset of the dopamine rise started before the rats were given the juice. Researchers concluded that the increased dopamine levels indicated that the rats were longing for the next drop. This process is a very similar one to that in drug addicts – and, as it happens, stock traders. When risky trades pay off, traders experience an extremely pleasant surge of dopamine, a rush that they want to experience again and again. As if the power of dopamine weren’t enough, when the hormone interacts with testosterone, traders become willing to take even greater risks. During bull markets or bubbles, testosterone – a hormone which increases risk taking – interacts with dopamine, because testosterone levels increase whenever dopamine surges through the brain. A trader’s testosterone level increases as a result of making a killing on a particular day, which leads him to experience the Winner Effect. This testosterone boost increases the effect of the dopamine in his system, so that every win feels even better than the last. These repeated wins will cause the trader’s testosterone to rise, making him even more willing to take greater risks on the trading floor. As you’d expect, this can easily turn into a vicious cycle, and when enough traders experience these, a market bubble can form. Whenever a big stock market crash occurs, the whole world is affected. And the stress that traders go through as a result of that crash makes it harder for them to regain control of the market. During a crash, traders’ bodies undergo a strong reaction. Among other stress responses, the hormone cortisol is released, significantly affecting the brain’s functioning. Over a short period, cortisol can energize us to escape a threatening situation, but if it’s distributed for a prolonged time, it becomes harmful. First, cortisol influences our memory negatively. Under the influence of cortisol, traders tend to remember their losses and bad trades more than their wins, which lowers their testosterone levels and makes them more risk averse. Second, it inhibits the frontal lobe, which is the brain region responsible for rational thought. Because traders become unable to think clearly, they’re prone to believing in rumors about the market. In turn, these rumors make them even more afraid to take risks. Additionally, the locus coeruleus, a brain region which helps us select the stimuli we want to attend to, starts firing incessantly. This makes it almost impossible for traders to distinguish the signals from the noise, thus making it harder to make good trades. These physiological effects can lead to irrational behavior in traders, causing them to miss worthwhile trades, therefore increasing the market’s volatility. What’s more, the effects of stress during a market crisis are further exacerbated in that traders start behaving in mean ways toward each other. According to Robert Sapolsky, who studies primates, it’s common for stressed-out dominant males to start bullying weaker males. The exact same thing happens on trading floors during a crisis. For instance, it’s typical for middle managers to fire employees even before layoffs are officially announced, or – perhaps even more stressful – to strongly hint at impending changes in the staff, making everyone fear for his or her job. As you’d expect, this leads to an increase in the traders’ anxiety, thus worsening the effects of their stress response. As we’ve seen, the human body’s stress response can lead people to make bad decisions. But, knowing this, is there something we can do to help minimize the impact of our physiology on our decisions? Even though our resilience is genetic, repeatedly putting ourselves under moderate stress can help to toughen us up. For instance, one study has shown that young rats that are handled by humans – a very stressful experience for the rats – exhibit fewer stress responses as adults, and they live up to 18 percent longer. However, the stressor has to be moderate. Major stressors, such as separation from the mother, actually have the opposite effect. Therefore, in the recruitment of traders, those candidates who’ve experienced moderate stress in their past might be preferable, because they’re likely to not be as easily stressed on the trading floor. Another stressor that can fortify us is physical exercise, especially if it involves being exposed to cold weather. Exercise releases what are known as “growth factors.” These help our neurons to keep growing, which strengthens our brain against stress and aging. One study found that rats that swim regularly in cold water respond more quickly and powerfully to negative stimuli; they have a better arousal response. When those same rats are exposed to stressors afterwards, they are tougher than their counterparts. Researchers have observed the same effect in humans and speculated that this is one reason for the development of the Nordic practice of a sauna followed by a cold shower. Of course, even the toughest traders can become mentally fatigued by stress.  However, if they’re able to freely switch between tasks, they’ll experience less stress and will thus make fewer mistakes. Many work-related illnesses and mistakes occur simply because employees are given no power of choice in the work that they do at any one time, and therefore what they should pay attention to. But, if employees are able to voluntarily switch tasks throughout the day, they complain less about fatigue and often feel rejuvenated after switching tasks. You might think it’s merely a cliche of Hollywood movies, but the fact is that trading floors are populated mostly by young men. Since testosterone levels are at their highest in young men, their behavior is also the most volatile in response to the hormone’s effects. The solution? Enforce diversity on the trading floors, as this would have a calming effect on the market. First, we should consider hiring older men, as this would lessen the impact of testosterone on the market. In males, testosterone levels rise until they are in their mid-twenties and after that point they fall gradually until stabilizing around the age of 50. This means that older men are less susceptible to the effects of testosterone, and less likely to respond in a volatile way on the trading floor. Despite this fact, trading floors are hostile to older traders because their reaction times are slower and their cautious attitude is interpreted as fear. However, famous investors like Warren Buffett or Benjamin Graham actually achieved their success later in life, showing that traits such as caution and slowness needn’t preclude success. Second, we should hire more female traders. Currently, women constitute only 5 percent of the trading floor’s population, but – like older men – they’re also less sensitive to the testosterone-induced market frenzies. One reason is that women have a vastly different biology from men, and naturally possess only 10 to 20 percent of males’ testosterone levels, making them far less prone to the hormone’s effect. For instance, women don’t experience escalating testosterone that occurs in males, such as during the Winner Effect. Another reason is that women have a different stress response than men. While they can experience the fight-or-flight response in moments of physical danger, they most often show the “tend-and-befriend” response. Originally, “tend and befriend” referred to the observation that females protect their offspring and seek out a group (by “befriending”) for mutual protection. Transferred to the workplace, it means that women respond to stress by being extra caring towards others. Think back to the last time you were going through a particularly stressful period. How would you have responded to the opportunity to take an exotic vacation? Most likely, you’d have thought that this was perfect timing: a change of scenery would do you good. However, you’d be wrong. When we’re stressed, novelty – even the pleasant kind – actually adds to our physiological stress load, and can even make us ill. In one study, psychologists asked a group of men about life-changing events in their lives – such as divorce or the death of someone close; but also more positive events, like weddings and childbirths. They found that all such events, even the ones we tend to think of as positive, lead to an increased risk of illness and mortality. Why? The researchers believe that the novelty of changed living circumstances adds to our physiological load and makes us sick. Therefore, it’s best not to take an exotic vacation if you’re already under stress, as the novelty of the place will simply increase it – even though you might not feel that increase immediately. What we really need in times of stress is not novelty, but familiarity. However, it’s sometimes impossible to avoid putting ourselves in novel circumstances. In such situations, one way to decrease stress levels is to attain a sense of control. As one study showed, patients in pain suffer even more if they’re uncertain of when they’ll receive their next pain medication, or if they can’t administer it themselves. Doctors who allow patients to have some degree of control over their pain medication reported that those patients required less medication in general. One possible explanation for this effect is that being in control reduces stress, which in turn minimizes the experience of pain. So, when patients gain a little control over an otherwise difficult situation, they feel less pain and actually need less medication. The key message in this book: The behavior of traders in the stock market isn’t rational. Rather, it’s largely influenced by the trader’s physiology, such as hormone levels and the body’s muscle memory. Both during market bubbles and crashes, hormones like testosterone and dopamine have a great impact on traders’ behavior, and therefore a destabilizing effect on the markets. Diversifying the gender and ages of people on trading floors would have a stabilizing effect on the stock market.

Somewhere along the conversation, he told her that personal finance was so simple that everything you needed to know about it could be written on an index card. In fact, he was so convinced of this point that he proved it by grabbing an index card, writing down a set of rules, and posting a picture of it online. It wasn’t long before the picture went viral and the pair understood there was a book behind this idea. In the fleshed out version of this viral financial advice card, the authors explain in precise detail how you can gain control over your finances and why you should. The good news is that it really is simple. By adopting a few straightforward tips, you can begin saving for the future today. The trick is to make smart financial decisions, seek advice from the right people and start immediately! In these blinks you’ll learn: why you should pay for your financial advice; how your employer can help you save for retirement; and the secret to getting out of debt. We’ve all been there; you cash your paycheck only to see it disappear as you pay rent, cover utilities and buy groceries. And let’s not forget the ever-present threat of an unexpected car repair. So, how can you pull yourself out of this financial debacle and gain control over your money? Naturally, it starts with saving, but that’s easier said than done. After all, the median annual household income in America dropped by $3,000 between 1998 and 2013 as wages decreased or stagnated. At the same time, the cost of living has gone up. This perfect storm of plummeting wages and rising costs has resulted in some frightening statistics: a whopping 27 percent of US households have a net worth of just $5,000 or less, and 47 percent of Americans say they couldn’t come up with $400 in an emergency without borrowing money or selling something. Since so many people are struggling to get their financial houses in order, if you don’t have any savings, you shouldn’t feel bad. But you should take action. If you fail to come up with a savings plan soon, you’ll never be able to invest for the future or even pay off your debt. Think of it this way: if you save just 10 percent of your income every month, by the end of your first year you’ll already have a whole month’s salary put away! Here are a few tips to get you started: First, use cash instead of plastic. This may sound silly, but lots of studies have shown that people spend over 20 percent more when paying with a credit card or online than they do when they pay with physical money. Spending bills and coins is less abstract, so it’s harder for people to part with them. You can also set up an automatic savings account. These automatically deduct and save a portion of your paycheck every month, which means you don’t have to endure the temptation of spending it. Lots of employers can even reroute some of your salary toward a savings account for you. When your grandparents stumbled upon a must-have purchase that they didn’t have the cash to cover, they paid for it in weekly installments, eventually paying off the item in full. But today, no such delayed gratification is necessary. Credit cards have removed this barrier, and the average credit-card owning American has 3.7 cards to her name. However, this doesn’t spell financial freedom. In fact, it’s a recipe for financial doom. That’s because this rapid transition toward easily accessible, high-interest credit means that the average American household bears a shocking $7,000 in credit card debt. Here’s why: In the 1970s, the credit card companies realized how much money they could make from people racking up massive debts and never paying them back in full. The profits these companies now reap are a result of massive interest rates that are paid monthly by consumers who never manage to pay off the principle on their debts. That’s why you should always pay your full credit card bill, not just the interest. Unfortunately, only about one-third of credit card holders take this route. How come? Well, psychologists think it’s because of a concept known as anchoring. People see the minimum required payment prominently displayed on the statement and “anchor” their thoughts about how much to pay based on that minimum. If you fall into this category, or if you simply can’t pay off all your bills right away, just adopt this simple strategy. First, work out the Annual Percentage Rate or APR of each debt. This number refers to the interest that’s charged on a debt over the course of a year. It’s important because the fastest way to get out of debt is to pay off the debts with the highest interest rates first. So, make a list, ranking all your debts by APR, highest to lowest. From there, prioritize those with the highest interest while making minimum payments on the others. Once you pay off your first debt, just move down the list until they’re all gone. The budget people set when shopping for a house is generally based on the amount they can borrow. But invariably, people fall in love with a dream home; before long, they begin to wonder if they can stretch their mortgage just a little bit. Unfortunately, this is a huge mistake. Rather than reaching past your price bracket, you should assess what you can afford. To do so, there’s a simple rule of thumb: only buy a house if you can put down 20 percent of the purchase price. In other words, if you have $20,000 for a deposit, you can afford a $100,000 house. This is important because the bigger your initial deposit, the lower your monthly mortgage payments will be. You’ll have borrowed less money and therefore have less to pay off. In this way, a higher deposit can save you thousands of dollars over the lifetime of your loan. It may even result in a lower interest rate as well. That’s because smaller loans are less risky for lenders and they aren’t compelled to charge as much interest. Beyond that, the bigger your deposit gets, the less likely your house’s market value is to drop below what you owe on your mortgage. This is a real threat if the housing market crashes, and you need to sell your property urgently. After all, in such a case you likely wouldn’t have time for the housing market to recuperate. So, a 20 percent deposit is key. Once you’ve got one, you’re ready to start shopping for your mortgage. That being said, research has found that just about 50 percent of people do shop around for a home loan. Why should you? Well, consider the difference between settling for a $200,000 loan at 4.5 percent compared to shopping around for one at 4 percent. The first loan will run you an additional $700 a year. Over a 30 year period, that’s an extra $21,000 just because you didn’t take the time to look at your options. Imagine you’ve just started a new job and are signing your contract and other forms. You come across one that asks what percentage of your salary you’d like to contribute toward your retirement plan. You’re young and healthy, so you toss it in the trash. Just like that, you may have thrown away your future. This mistake can easily be avoided. That’s because the common failure to save for retirement often stems from faulty logic. People tend to think they’ll never retire while the majority of retirees report being forced to stop working sooner than they had planned. In fact, just 20 percent of people work past age 65. You never know when health difficulties, age discrimination, or a crisis in the family might take matters out of your control. Another common belief is that people have decades to save for retirement and there’s no rush. But compound interest complicates this assessment. For instance, if you save just $104 a month, starting at age 25, and put it in a pension fund that yields a 6 percent annual return, by 65 you’ll have saved $200,000. However, if you wait until age 45 to start investing in the same fund, you’ll need to deposit $430 a month to save the same amount by retirement age. So, how much do you really need to save? Experts estimate that you should put away 15 percent of your monthly gross pay to ensure a comfortable retirement. That sounds like a lot, but your employer could be your key to success. That’s because lots of employers offer an “employer match” for retirement savings. In such plans, an employer will match your pension contributions, – usually up to 6 percent of your annual earnings. So, make the maximum contribution you can to reap all of the benefits. If you don’t, you’ll be among the 25 percent of people who, according to studies, fail to take full advantage of their employer matching options. Just think of it this way: it’s the closest you’ll ever come to making money for doing nothing! It’s no secret that shopping for insurance can be a depressing and demoralizing experience; preparing for the future brings you face-to-face with all the horrible things that could happen to you and your family. Who wants to do that? But it’s even scarier to think about what would happen if something went wrong and you weren’t properly insured. What would your loved ones do if something happened to you? Would they suffer financially? If so, you need life insurance. A life insurance policy pays out when the insured individual passes away. But not all life insurance is equal. The best protection you can get at the lowest cost comes in the form of term insurance. This is a type of life insurance policy that’s limited to a set amount of time – in the author’s recommendation, a 30 year period. During that time, the policyholder makes an annual payment to keep herself covered, and the policy can be canceled on a yearly basis. If you don’t want it anymore, you just stop making your payments and your coverage goes away. But most importantly, when shopping for term life insurance, get a policy that has stable annual payments throughout its life. So, life insurance is key for covering the worst possible outcome, but things go wrong every day, and to keep yourself covered you’ll also want home insurance. A good home insurance policy is really insurance on your net worth since your home is likely to be your family’s most valuable asset. That’s why it’s crucial to know what any given policy does or doesn’t cover. So, when you shop around, think in worst-case scenarios like gale force winds destroying your home, a forest fire overtaking your town or severe flooding. Pose these scenarios to the insurance salesman and ask if the policy would cover you. But his word isn’t enough; you also need it in writing. Getting it down on paper will prevent vital claims from being denied due to technicalities. If you’re in the market for a financial advisor, you might come across people with titles as confusing as “chartered college planning specialist” or “retirement management analyst.” After all, financial advisors depend on convincing clients of their reputation. As a result, there are over 50 different job titles to describe people who specialize in financial planning for senior citizens alone! So, who should you trust for your financial advice? Well, there’s some good news on this front: there’s just one job title to look out for. It’s fiduciary, and you should always choose a financial advisor who follows the fiduciary standard. This is key since a fiduciary has a legal obligation to put your interests above her own. That means you can trust her to give you objective financial advice, to steer you clear of overpriced investments and to keep your interests at the forefront. Remember, while anyone can call herself a financial advisor if she isn’t a fiduciary, she’s just a salesperson trying to make a living off of financial products while posing as an unbiased advisor. These so-called advisors have zero legal obligation to put your interests above their bottom line. Sound financial advice isn’t free. Make sure that your financial advisor is being paid by you and you alone. This is important because lots of non-fiduciary financial advisors offer services for free, only to push you toward particular investments on which they collect a commission. By contrast, while the fees that fiduciaries charge can take multiple forms, they’re all valid. You might be charged an hourly rate that ranges from $50 an hour for advice on how to get out of debt, to $500 an hour for specialized investment advice. Certain fiduciaries may even charge a flat rate for an agreed upon group of services, like a budget review or comprehensive financial plan. Whatever tier you choose, find yourself an advisor that will give you sound advice and get your finances in order today! The key message in this book: Personal financial planning is the difference between a sound future and a deferred retirement. But the good news is that a few simple rules can de-stress your relationship to money and get your financial life in order. By planning early and often, you can get out of debt and ensure yourself a comfortable retirement.  Actionable advice: Support our social safety net  Government benefits sometimes get a bad rap, but the truth is that social programs like Medicare and Social Security make our financial lives much more comfortable and manageable. Without them, retirement might not be possible at all: 96 percent of all Americans rely on some form of government financial support, whether that’s a student loan, mortgage deduction or unemployment insurance, at some point. We all have an obligation to support these programs, and you can do your part by speaking up when they’re criticized. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s that dream vacation to Asia or learning to play your favorite instrument, all these things cost money, time and energy that most of us don’t have. But what if having the financial means to achieve your dreams and save up enough money for retirement were actually much easier than you thought? Well, meet Zoey, a fictional character who has the same problems as many of us. She works hard at a well-paying job but still doesn’t manage to break out of the cycle of never having enough money to achieve her goals. In these blinks, we’ll explore the parable of how Zoey managed to break out of the financial prison of her own making with the help of a wise old man called Henry. You’ll also discover how compound interest can make you a millionaire; why automation, not budgeting, is key to financial success; and how saving five dollars a day is enough to reach financial freedom. The main character in these blinks is Zoey, a 27-year-old Brooklynite who works at a travel magazine. Her job pays well, but living in New York is expensive. On top of that, she has both student loans and credit-card debt to pay off. And while her lifestyle isn’t extravagant by any means, she still barely manages to save any money at the end of every month. What’s more, this lack of cash has become a common refrain in her life – whether it’s the photography course she wants to take or her dreams to travel around the world, the answer is always the same: “I can’t afford it.” We pick up on Zoey’s story three years ago, during her Monday morning commute. As usual, before work, she bought a double-shot latte from her local cafe, Helena’s. Inside, the Brooklyn spirit was alive and well – art and photographs graced the cafe’s walls, and the place had a cozy, hipster vibe to it. But one print in particular caught Zoey’s eye – that of a little seaside village at dawn. Even though she only had a moment to glance at the photo while ordering her latte, something about it seemed to call out to her. Continuing her commute with her latte in hand, Zoey arrived at the World Trade Center station. An advertisement appeared on a screen containing a similar photo to that in the cafe. The photograph came with a message: “If you don’t know where you’re going, you might not like where you end up.” This message got her thinking about her own life – where was she going? What were her dreams? And what was she doing to achieve them? Before she could answer these questions, however, she realized she was late for work. So she continued on to her destination – One World Trade Center itself, home of the travel magazine where she worked. A few hours later, it was time for lunch with her boss, Barbara. But Barbara detected something was off about Zoey that day and asked what was on her mind. So, Zoey recounted the story of the print at Helena’s, and how she’d have loved to be able to afford such photos for her own living room. Barbara then gave Zoey a strange suggestion – talk to Henry, the elderly barista at the coffee shop where Zoey gets her morning latte. Ask him about the print and see what he says. The next morning, Zoey stopped by Helena’s to take a closer look at the seaside photo. A price tag sat beneath its frame – $1,200. A month’s rent for a single photo. Still, she remained, admiring the photo’s beauty, trying to figure out where it was taken and mumbled names of Greek islands to herself until someone behind her said, “Mykonos.” Nearly spilling her latte, she turned around to meet Henry, the barista Barbara had told her about. After they both admitted their admiration for the photo, Henry asked Zoey: Why didn’t she buy it? She shyly admitted that she couldn’t afford to spend that much on a single photo. Henry then said something that Zoey didn’t expect – he told her that if she could afford the latte she’d just bought, she could afford the photo. While Zoey politely brushed off this statement and hurried off to work, Henry’s perplexing claim stuck with her throughout the day. Wednesday morning arrived, and Zoey was back at Helena’s to pick up her latte. She noticed Henry standing in front of her favorite photo. After striking up another conversation with him, she asked if he’d explain his curious remark from the day before. It was at this point that Henry began sharing his Three Secrets of Financial Freedom with her. The first of these was that Zoey had to start to pay herself first. That meant that instead of seeing if there was any money left over for herself after all her expenses every month, she should commit to paying herself before anything else. That also meant that even before the state comes in and taxes her income, she should put some money aside for herself in a 401(k) retirement plan. Combine that with compound interest, Henry added, and the money would begin to add up. Just committing five dollars a day to yourself with 10 percent compound interest would mean a saving of $1,885 after just one year. And after 40 years? $948,611. All for the cost of the latte in Zoe’s hand. Zoey’s mind started racing – what if she also brought lunch to work from home instead of spending money at the cafeteria? How much could she accrue if she changed her work-week spending habits and cut her daily expenses by $25? Henry’s figures showed this would result in $3.4 million over 40 years. Zoey sure did have a lot to think about. Another morning, another latte. Zoey was having doubts about this amazing secret to getting her finances in order and decided to approach Henry again to ask him a few more questions. Luckily, he was ready to oblige. While she understood the whole “pay yourself first” part, Zoey explained, she didn’t see herself maintaining the discipline to keep doing that on a regular basis. Henry agreed that this was an unrealistic prospect. It was at that point that he shared the second secret to financial freedom: don’t budget – make it automatic. Sure, budgets might work great for corporations, Henry explained. But when it comes to individual financial planning, it just doesn’t work in practice. People are busy and don’t have time to keep track of every single financial transaction they make. The solution, Henry went on, was to set up an automatic payment system so that when she got her paycheck, a portion of that would automatically be transferred off the taxable – and spendable – grid. After all, you can’t spend money that you can’t access, right? Once the automatic payment system was set up, it would run itself. It would require no discipline or self-control. Think about most companies, Henry remarked, whether it’s your cable provider or local gym, they all automatically take money out of your account, right? They do it for the same reason you should do it – because it’s simple and it works. Zoey was starting to see the light. But then she remembered her friend telling her the previous night that 10 percent compound interest was a thing of the past. She asked Henry: How can one still go about getting such high returns in the modern world? Henry’s answer was simple. Since reliable market data collection began in 1926, the stock market has grown by more than 10 percent every year. Of course, that depends on the year, and the market will always go up and down. But even since the 2008 financial crisis, the trend has continued. In fact, the most conservative stock portfolio would probably earn you around 8 percent per year. It doesn’t matter if it’s 5, 8 or 10 percent, Henry concluded – the point is that compound interest applied on a portion of your pretax income will grow bigger over time. Just make sure it automatically comes out of your account every month. Before leaving Helena’s on Thursday morning, Zoey was introduced to one of Henry’s friends, Baron. Henry had helped Baron turn his life around and get his finances in order. Additionally, Baron told a surprised Zoey that Henry owned Helena’s! She was learning more about this mysterious financial whiz by the minute. That morning at work, Barbara came over to Zoey’s desk and asked her whether she’d talked to Henry. Zoey replied in the affirmative, but she was still having doubts. She was convinced that she simply wasn't good with money. Barbara decided it was time to share some of her own wisdom with Zoey, and started to explain the Three Myths of Money. The first myth, Barbara said, is that making more money makes you richer. While most people think they have a problem with a lack of income, the issue is usually more that they have a problem with spending. Those who make more money usually just end up spending more of it. The solution? To change the habits governing how you spend the money you already have. Barbara, for example, brought her own lunch to work every day, saving around $15 daily. The second myth, Barbara explained, is that one needs money to make money. Barbara had lost count of the amount of people who’d made remarks along those lines to her. As Henry had explained, it can start with as little as five dollars a day. What’s more, Barbara went on, is that you don’t have to be a mathematician or Wall Street investor to figure out how compound interest works. Quite the contrary – the goal with making money is that it should happen by itself, and that you don’t need to concern yourself with it all the time. Finally, Barbara revealed the third myth of money – that someone else will be there for you to fall back on when times get hard. Whether it’s the government or your family, at the end of the day, you can’t always expect to have someone to help you out. This is especially the case for us women, Barbara explained – we often hope that some Prince Charming will pop out of nowhere and swoop us off our feet when times get rough. But that’s just a fairy tale. Zoey needed to be her own Prince Charming. On her way to work on Friday, Zoey realized that she’d only heard two of Henry’s three secrets. So, she resolved to find out the third and final secret and stopped by Helena’s to acquire more wisdom from Henry. Henry was happy to oblige and started off by asking Zoey what was important to her. Not in the future, but right now. After a bit of soul-searching, Zoey said that she would love to learn how to take amazing photographs. And in the long term, her dream was to travel the world. After all, it often made her sad that she worked for a travel magazine, but she herself had never left the country. Well, Henry replied, it’s time to put the third secret into action. Paying yourself first, and making that automatic, are all well and good, but you also have to live financially-free in the present. How much does a good photography course cost, Henry inquired? About $600, Zoey answered. Henry smiled. Zoey needed to open up a dream account, it seemed. In addition to her 401(k), if she set aside an additional five dollars every day for six months, she’d have enough to take the photography course. But would the dream account be enough for her globetrotting plans? She'd still need to get enough time off work. Henry then explained to her the concept of the radical sabbatical, which meant forging the time for himself to travel to over 100 countries. One of the first places he went to was Greece. In fact, the very photo of Mykonos where this all began was taken by Henry himself. With the three secrets now in her grasp, Zoey knew what she needed to do. First, she sat down with her travel magazine’s HR guy and set up a 401(k) account. Then, she opened two dream accounts – one for her photography course and one for travel. Finally, she sat down with Barbara and asked if she could take her own radical sabbatical once every year. She could even work remotely while abroad. Barbara agreed on one condition – that Zoey send her a postcard. Three years have passed since, and Zoey has taken three radical sabbaticals. What’s more, the photos she’s been taking around the world are now being published in the magazine where she works. Zoey is achieving her dreams, and it all started with realizing the true value of a five-dollar latte. The key message in these blinks: Through this parable, we’ve learned the three secrets to financial freedom. To begin, always pay yourself first, preferably into a pre-tax account. Next, leave budgeting by the wayside, and instead automate your road to financial freedom. Finally, Zoey’s story showed us how we can live rich both now and in the future by opening up dream accounts. All in all, there’s no excuse for living an unstable financial existence – all you need to save is five dollars per day. In other words, the price of a latte.  Got feedback?

But how many of us trust our financial abilities enough to manage our own investments? Most of us are happy to turn our money over to experts, and let them do it. This is wrong: they charge enormous fees for their expertise and they often get it wrong. No, the best way to make the most of the stock market is to manage your own investments, but how? These blinks show you what factors you should look out for when judging the profitability of a share. If you follow their advice you stand to beat the market average by a decent margin. In these blinks you’ll discover the magic formula for profits; who Mr. Market is and how you can beat him; and how you can cheat the tax man. Your childhood belief that money magically appears under your pillow evaporated when you discovered the tooth fairy didn’t really exist. But as you grew older, this idea of magically increasing your wealth suddenly didn’t seem so crazy when you learned about investing in the stock market. Most of us have a rudimentary understanding of the stock market, yet because hardly any of us know how it works, we employ financial experts for help. Unfortunately, the majority of financial experts are not worth their fees. One expert we expect to make us high profits is the stockbroker. Many of us use their services, but stockbrokers aren’t the best people to trust with our investments. Stockbrokers get paid by selling you investment products, regardless of how profitable they are. They have no incentive to sell you the best products available; they simply need to sell you any products they can. People also rely on a mutual fund to manage their investments. Mutual funds, in which investments from many people are pooled, usually come with a high management fee. So although they often yield decent returns, by the time you’ve subtracted the fees, you’re often left with below-average returns. There is, however, one type of financial investor who can manage your investments well. An index fund such as Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) is a mutual fund which aims to match the market’s best performing companies, as opposed to trying to beat them. You may think that this would give you underwhelming results, yet, as index fund fees are lower, and because on average the market performs well anyway, index funds often provide you with very healthy profits. So if you’re happy with someone else managing your money, opt for index funds. But there is an even better way! If you want to maximize your profit, there is no substitute for learning to do it yourself, and the following blinks will show you how. If you were to draw a graph showing the stock prices of Google or Disney over the last five years, what would it look like? Probably a fairly straight, rising line marking stable increases in price, right? Wrong. Although there would be a general trend of increasing prices, the line would be jagged, depicting fluctuations which affect all stock, regardless of how successful a company is. For example, on 13 November 2014, the stock price of Google on the NASDAQ was $558.25, with its price ranging between $510.67 and $615.04 over the previous 52 weeks. On the same day, the stock price of Disney was $89.90, ranging between $68.80 and $92.00 over the previous 52 weeks. But why do companies’ stock prices vary so much? The real value of a company isn’t reflected in its share price; sometimes it’s undervalued, sometimes overvalued. One way to understand this is by thinking of the stock market as if it were an emotionally unstable person. Investment legend Benjamin Graham takes this analogy even further, by describing the market as a crazy person called Mr. Market. Mr. Market really wants to sell you shares in his company, but he’s volatile. Some days he’s incredibly optimistic, eager to sell at a high price, but on others he’s depressed, believing his company isn’t worth that much and therefore offering his shares at a lower price. You can exploit Mr. Market’s temperament by buying stocks when he’s in a bad mood and offering his shares at a low price. Then when he’s feeling better, you can offer to sell the shares back at a higher price. The following blinks will show you even more tricks for using Mr. Market to your advantage. If you want to stand a chance against Mr. Market, you need to ensure that you buy stocks when their price is below the company’s true value and sell them when the share price is above it. To find out whether the share price is too high or low, you should consider two numbers. First look at the earnings yield, meaning the company. This tells you what the business earns in relation to its share price. The earnings yield is calculated by finding the ratio of earnings before interest expenses and tax (EBIT), to enterprise value (EV). The EV is the market value plus the net interest-bearing debt. The EBIT/EV calculation has an advantage over the often-used price divided by earnings ratio (P/E) as it’s not influenced by debt and tax rates. Say an office building is bought for $1 million, with a mortgage of $800,000, and $200,000 in equity. If the building’s EBIT was $100,000, then its earnings yield (EBIT/EV) would be ten percent ($100,000/$1,000,000). If the interest rate on the $800,000 mortgage was six percent, the earnings yield on the equity purchase price ($200,000) would be 26 percent. That is, $100,000-$48,000 in interest expense = $52,000 in pretax income. ($52,000/$200,000 is 26 percent.) This earnings yield would change according to debt level, but the $1,000,000 purchase price, and its EBIT of $100,000 would stay the same. However, a high earnings yield isn’t enough. We need an additional calculation to tell us if the company is actually profitable. That is, we need to look at the return on capital (ROC). Although there are many variables that influence a company’s health, such as the value of its brands, its strategy, and so forth, the simplest variable to estimate is the ROC. ROC is calculated by dividing the after-tax profit by the book value of invested capital (the total amount of money invested by the company’s shareholders, bondholders, and so on). ROC reveals how effective a company is at transforming investment into profit. For example, if you spent $300,000 setting up a restaurant and made a profit of $100,000 in the first year, your ROC for that year would be 33.33 percent, which is good. Anything above 25 percent indicates that a company is doing well. So if you buy shares of companies that have a high return on capital at low prices, you’ll systematically buy into companies which are currently undervalued by Mr. Market. The previous blink showed you that when buying shares you should look at the earnings yield and ROC. But what exactly should you do with these figures? You need to use them to create the magic formula. The magic formula combines both the earnings yield and ROC into one a single measure. It starts with a list of the 3,500 biggest companies available for trading on one of the major US stock exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ, and ranks those companies on a scale between one and 3,500, based on their ROC. The company with the highest return takes the top spot. The same companies are then ranked according to their earnings yield and the company with the highest earning yield is placed at the top. Lastly, both rankings are combined. So a company which ranked number one on ROC, but at 181 on earnings yield, would have a total score of 182 (one plus 182). The companies with the lowest combined ranking therefore have the best combination between both factors of earnings yield and ROC. So what does this mean? It means you should be buying shares from these companies! The magic formula does a really good job over time. Over a 17-year period from 1988 to 2004, a portfolio of around 30 stocks with the best combined rankings returned on average about 30 percent per year, whereas the market average was a mere 12 percent. So the magic formula really pays off. If the magic formula is such a brilliant money-making strategy, why doesn’t every investment manager use it? One reason is that the strategy doesn’t always beat the market. On average, for five months of every year, the overall market average will beat a portfolio based on the magic formula. The same goes for 25 percent of all full-year periods. Even during the massively successful period from 1988 to 2004 – when a magic formula portfolio generated on average 30 percent profit per year – sometimes it actually performed worse than the overall market average for two or more consecutive years. In reality, professional money managers can’t afford to perform lower than average for long periods because they need to keep their clients satisfied all the time. It’s difficult to hold onto a strategy which might not work for months or years at a time, no matter how effective the strategy is in the long term. Money managers don’t use the magic formula because the window of time where they need to show profits to their clients is just too narrow. A manager who can’t consistently show their client a profit is highly likely to be fired, despite their promise that a profit will be made some time in the future. The bottom line is, although the magic formula works just fine in the long term, most professional investors can’t afford to perform below the market average for such a long time. You can, though. All it takes is some patience to stick with it during the good and the not-so-good times. We know the magic formula works, but to apply it in the best possible way, you need to take the following precautions. First, apply the magic formula when choosing stocks of large companies, not small ones. Smaller companies don’t have much to offer in terms of shares, so even a slight increase in demand can force their share price up. You may therefore find it challenging to buy their shares at a reasonable price. Applying the magic formula to larger companies is smarter. If a company’s market value (the number of shares multiplied by the stock price) is in excess of $50 million, this indicates it’s a large company. What you should do then, is own at least 20 to 30 large company stocks at a time. Just bear in mind that the fewer stocks you own, the higher your risk of straying from the average, healthy performance of the magic formula. Owning multiple shares can cushion the financial blow resulting from a negative industry event such as a tanker spill. It’s wise, then, to have your stocks in different industries. Finally, you need to be able to use tax laws intelligently to maximize your profit. This means holding each stock for roughly one year and then selling it. However, whether you sell them slightly before or after this date depends on tax. In the United States there is a lower tax rate for profits on stocks held for more than one year. So you should sell stocks which lost value before the one-year holding period ends. On paper, this decreases your yearly income and thus the taxes you will need to pay. However, for stocks which increased in value, do the opposite. Sell them after the one-year period is over in order to reduce your tax.

Bogle","summary":"Mutual funds are like chocolate bars: there are so many different kinds, and new versions are always popping up. How are you supposed to decide where to invest? One way is security. Pool your investment along with other people’s in a low-risk fund that’s highly diversified and avoids turbulent markets. Or you could include high-risk and high-reward funds, or funds that play in particular statistics. The options can get confusing and the last thing you want is to make poor decisions with your hard-earned money! This pack will hedge the odds in your favor, laying out a straightforward case for one kind of mutual fund: The index fund. These blinks explain why all mutual funds are not created equal, and why index funds are the only way to not get robbed by fees and expenses. In these blinks, you’ll find out the difference between a passive fund and an actively managed fund; why you should always choose the fund with the lowest fees; and how you can avoid market bubbles. Have you ever invested in the stock market? If so, you might have realized that evaluating the attractiveness of a stock is tricky business. That’s why many investors choose not to invest directly into stocks, but instead put their money in an actively managed fund. Here money is pooled from several investors and then invested into stocks by a specialized fund manager, who regularly evaluates and revises the stock portfolio according to the current situation. Unfortunately, that kind of investment is risky. Why? Because the costs of investing in such a fund are very high. As an investor, you’d pay the brokerage commissions, the fund manager’s fees and so forth. All those fees add up to a hefty chunk of your expected profits. If the funds perform extremely well, you might not mind those costs, but in the long run, actively managed funds are likely to yield you less profit than the overall stock market. How can that be? For one, speculating on stock prices is simply not a sustainable strategy. You might think that a fund can generate huge profits by, for example, buying stocks when they are undervalued and selling them later when they reach their true higher value, but in the long run this strategy can’t produce more earnings than what the underlying companies are earning, which is reflected in the overall development of the stock market. Add that pitfall to the high costs of the funds, and the result is that an actively managed fund will generate significantly less profit for you than a passive, low-cost index fund that merely mimics the performance of the overall market. In fact, if you had invested $10,000 in 1980, by 2005 you would walk away with 70 percent less if you invested in an active fund rather than an index fund, due to fees alone! Despite what you’ve just discovered about the costliness of funds, you might still be thinking of investing in an actively managed fund. Before you do, though, consider if those funds perform well compared to the overall stock market. Unfortunately, they probably don’t. Most funds go bankrupt or fail to generate significant returns. Investors pay huge fees to funds, deferring to financial experts who have a solid understanding of the stock market. However, despite industry knowledge or expertise, only 24 of the 355 mutual funds that existed in 1970 have outperformed the market consistently and remain in business. Armed with these facts, you’d be throwing your money away by paying for financial experts to manage your fund. Furthermore, even profitable funds can’t promise good performance in the future. You might decide to invest your money in the funds still outperforming the market consistently; those funds that have beaten the odds. However, even if you analyze their track record, the same conditions that caused the fund to perform well over the past 35 years may not repeat themselves in the following decades. For example, if a fund consistently outperformed the market in the last 35 years, the fund manager probably played a huge role in its success. But, the manager will inevitably retire at some point. How do you know the next one will have a similar rate of success? Also, future investment opportunities will differ from the ones of the past 35 years. How do you know the possibilities for future investments? You don’t! We’ve painted the picture of how poorly most funds perform, so you might wonder why people keep investing in them. First of all, investors often underestimate the true cost of actively managed funds. As you’ve learned, actively managed funds automatically come with high costs. However, fund managers rarely disclose the dollar amount. Instead, they boast about the high returns but forget to divulge what the investor will really earn after deducting all the performance and portfolio fees. Surprisingly, that omission occurs often: 198 of the 200 most successful funds in the latter years of the 1990s reported higher returns than the investors actually earned! Secondly, in many avenues of investing, people often tend to let their emotions and current market trends make important decisions for them. All too often, people make unsound investments because they let popular opinion and clever marketing sway their decisions. For example, recall the high-risk investments of the late 1990s. In contrast to the first half of the decade when people invested a mere $18 billion in the stock market, a whopping $420 billion was invested in the second half of the 1990s when the market thrived and stocks were overvalued. When the bubble eventually burst, people realized too late that they had given into the popular hype. This same principle applies to actively managed funds: investors pour money into these funds because everyone else is doing the same thing. So if you shouldn’t allocate your money to actively managed funds, where should you put it? Let's continue on to learn about sensible alternatives. Don’t let what you now know about actively managed funds persuade you to keep all your money under your bed. The index fund is your best alternative. In contrast to actively managed funds, index funds are much more cost-efficient. By definition, an index fund holds a diversified portfolio that reflects the financial market or a specific market sector. However, instead of betting on the market, index funds hold their portfolios indefinitely, eliminating the risks of making short-term, volatile bets while simultaneously minimizing operating costs. Because index funds track the performance of all stocks included in the index without betting on individual stocks, they’re also called passive funds. Since they simply hold shares across particular market sectors, you will not have to bear operating fees for buying and selling shares, financial consultants, or fund management. You will, however, reap the benefits of commercial net returns. Another advantage to index funds is that they’re likely to outperform actively managed funds in the long-term. You might argue that holding shares indefinitely instead of buying when stocks are cheap and selling when they’re expensive results in lost opportunities. However, you already learned that in the long term, the rises and falls of the stock market eventually level out at the real value of the stock. Because of that net effect, index funds usually outperform actively managed funds in the long run; they offer returns at the real value of the stocks while eliminating active management costs. The next blink will help you choose the right index fund. Each index fund comprises an expense ratio that represents management fees and operating expenses. These expenses, though typically totalling less than one percent, can add up in a long-term investment. For instance, the Fidelity Spartan Index fund has an annual expense ratio of 0.007 percent, while the J.P. Morgan Index fund’s is 0.53 percent. Both funds have expenses below 1 percent, but over longer investment periods like a decade, those tenths of a penny add up. Since index funds fluctuations follow the overall market, go ahead and choose the fund with the lowest cost structure, knowing that a company’s expense ratio doesn’t equate with its level of performance. Whenever you’re considering where to invest your hard-earned money, be skeptical when it comes to the latest investment fads. The fierce competition between index funds causes a continuous cycle of new trends. Index funds were invented in 1975, and today there are already 578 index funds competing with each other! Long-standing funds compete by trying to lower their costs as much as possible and thus lure in discerning investors. Meanwhile, new funds entering the market attempt to gain clients by promising larger rewards through new stock-picking procedures. Consequently, they also charge more. For example, The New Copernicans abstain from compiling their portfolios with stocks chosen by customary methods, like weighted market capitalization, whereby stocks are bought in proportion to the total market capitalization of each company, meaning  the total number of shares multiplied by the average share price. Instead, the movement might calculate the proportions of each stock in their portfolio based on, for example, how much profit each company earns, or how much they’ve paid out in dividends. Remember though, no matter how a fund claims to operate, it’s nearly impossible to know which stocks are over- or undervalued, so you should adhere to funds that retain a normal portfolio. Furthermore, since you can’t predict which new investment trends will be successful, you should remain cautious and keep low costs the priority. The key message in this book: Investing in actively managed funds is a bad idea: they only eat up your hard-earned money, while financial mediators make a fortune. Make more of your money by investing in an index fund.  Actionable advice: Reconsider what funds to invest in. Invest the majority of your assets in an index fund, and if you want to gamble with some of your hard-earned money, then place a small amount in actively managed funds. If, despite what you’ve read you still want to partake in the thrill of risking some money and making fast profits in actively managed funds, bet on no more than 5 percent. You can afford to risk this small amount but absolutely keep the majority of your assets in a safe long-term investment.

The son of an Italian immigrant who arrived in the UK without a penny to his name, he knew from the get-go that success was something he’d have to struggle for. Entrepreneurial to the core, he was cutting hair and overseeing the salon’s payroll by age 12. Fast forward to the mid-80s, and Stanzione was making a killing trading equities at the height of the financial revolution unfolding in Thatcher’s London. Then came the 1987 crash, which wiped him out. Others might have thrown in the towel, but Stanzione dusted himself off and got back to business. Within a decade, he’d remade his fortune, and then some. It’s been a rollercoaster ride for Stanzione. Along the way, he picked up some invaluable life lessons. First off, that persistence pays. Second, failure is part of your journey. Those core messages resonate throughout these blinks. If a near-bankrupt, non-academic and occasionally homeless social dropout like Stanzione can make it, so can you. The key is to recognize that your future is in your hands – if you want success, you’d better be ready to get out there and fight for it. But you don’t have to go it alone: start putting the advice in this practical, hands-on self-help manual to use, and you’ll already be well on your way to a more fulfilling and successful life. Read on to find out how to make better decisions; why mail order might just be the best business model in the world; and how to make your money go further. Do you love your life the way it is right now? Do you earn more than you’ll ever need and feel fulfilled by your job? If your answers to these questions are “yes,” then congratulations – you can stop reading right now! But what if you sometimes wake up dreading work or struggle to stretch your paycheck to cover all your wants and needs? Well, welcome to the club. Like millions of others, you’re not living your best life. But that’s about to change. Let’s get one thing clear from the get-go: turning your life around won’t be easy. Change is a long and occasionally arduous journey – but that can’t come as too much of a surprise. Whether it’s overeating, drinking too much, failing to save money or giving up on learning, most of us spend a good twenty or thirty years messing up our lives. Tidying that up takes time and effort. But here’s the silver lining: it can be done. So where do you start? Well, as an old Chinese proverb has it, a journey of a million miles begins with one step. The first item on your travel itinerary is breaking out of your comfort zone. It’s the most familiar place in the world and includes everything that has become so routine you do it on autopilot: commuting, grinding out another day at the office, watching TV on the sofa in the evenings and sleeping for as long as possible before it all restarts the next morning. The truth is that most people live in their comfort zones. They regard it as both acceptable and normal because they’ve given up on their old dreams. They’ve lost all hope of doing something dazzling and achieving fame and fortune – in other words, they’ve come to terms with the fact that their highest priority is simply getting by. It was this which moved Benjamin Franklin to remark that “most men die at 25, we just don’t bury them until they’re 70.” Think of this as your wake-up call. Your time on earth is too precious to spend it simply existing. In the following blinks, we’ll be taking a closer look at how you can get out of your rut and start truly thriving. First, let’s get down to basics and ask the most important question of all: What do you actually want? Ever heard the phrase “the squeaky wheel gets the grease”? It basically means that the loudest problems get the most attention. People blame their unhappiness on all sorts of issues, but the real culprit is usually much less obvious: they’ve never sat down and defined what they actually want in life. It’s like going to a travel agency and saying you want to be sent somewhere nice where you’ll find a great job, a perfect partner and where you’ll be happy – a vague wish that’s pretty much impossible to fulfill. You need to define your destination before you embark on your personal expedition, and here’s where to start. Imagine that the author himself knocked on your door and offered to take care of anything you asked for. What would you put at the top of your list? Well, let’s find out. Grab a pen and write down these headings: financial needs like bills that need paying, financial wants like that gold Rolex you’ve always dreamed of having and non-monetary aspirations like becoming a better public speaker. Now put your answers into sentences like these: “My personal goal is…,” “I will benefit from this because…” and “My projected goal will be achieved by...” This works best if your targets are positive, so, “I want a $750,000 townhouse” rather than “I need to get out of this terrible apartment,” for example. You should also err on the side of being ambitious. If you’re earning $40,000 right now, aim to bump that up to $100,000, rather than $50,000. But don’t forget to keep things realistic. If you want to leave that old walk-up and move into a beautiful four-story house with a view, you’ll also need enough money coming in to cover it! So, how does any of this help you? Think back to the beginning of this exercise. Chances are, your idea of what you wanted was pretty hazy. By now, you should have a much clearer set of goals. This is one of the most important steps you’ll take on your million-mile journey. In the next blink, you’ll learn how to start transforming that wishlist into a reality. The human mind is a bit like a memory stick. When we’re born, it’s blank, but as we grow, we gradually fill it with new skills and ideas. Some of the files we add, however, contain negative and hurtful comments, from adults who told us we were too clumsy to play soccer or not clever enough to be good at math. Those comments often end up creating negative feedback loops that hold us back later in life. But while the human brain doesn’t have a delete button, it can be rewired. Let’s see how you can record new, positive suggestions over those bad memories. For this exercise, you’ll need that list of personal goals. The first thing you’ll do is rewrite your aims in the present tense, as if you’ve already achieved them. So, say your goal was to lose ten pounds and buy your dream car in the next five years. Write: “It’s the year 2024. I’m at my ideal weight, and I have a Maserati parked in my driveway.”   This is your new private mantra. Repeat it to yourself every morning and evening before bed with conviction and enthusiasm while visualizing your new life. It doesn’t matter if you live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment while confidently stating that you own a mansion – the idea is to prepare yourself for the future. As Cary Grant once said when a reporter enquired how he’d become a Hollywood star, “I started to act like the person I wanted to be, and eventually, I became that person.” But don’t just take the author’s – or Grant’s – word for it. Ask any top athlete how they prepare for big events, and they’ll tell you that they don’t just train their bodies – they also visualize success. Consider Roger Bannister, the first man to ever run a four-minute mile, a feat many thought impossible. The key to his victory was his mental preparation: by the time he ran that historic race, he’d already completed it hundreds of times in his mind’s eye. That might sound like mumbo jumbo, but there’s a pretty straightforward explanation for how it works: visualizing your success reinforces a sense that things you’d previously thought unobtainable are actually within your reach. Bannister’s imaginary races, for example, gave him a mental edge – he was self-confident enough to ignore the naysayers and simply give it a go! Life is all about making calls. Many of the things that happen to you – good and bad – can be traced back to past decisions. Chances are, a fair few of your choices still haunt you. But it’s not just hindsight that’s twenty-twenty – in fact, decision-making can be just as effective, as long as you apply the right techniques. Take the so-called “Ben Franklin Method.” Say you’ve been offered a job in Germany, but you’re not sure whether to take it. Write down all the “pros” in one column, and all the “cons” in another. Give each factor – “better pay” versus “losing contact with old friends,” for example – a value from one to ten in terms of importance. All you have to do then is count up the numbers and see which side has the higher score. Then there’s the “Coin Method.” Have you ever been caught on the horns of a dilemma and later realized you knew which decision was the right one from the get-go? Well, here’s a shortcut. Take a coin and make heads “yes” and tails “no.” Now toss it and see how you feel about the result. The author uses this to make tricky investment calls: if the coin says “yes,” but he’s still unconvinced, he’ll trust his gut and go with “no.” Right, so you’ve made your decision – now you need to act on it. That’s the difficult part. Nothing stops us in our tracks like the fear of failure. But let’s be real: success won’t come to you if you don’t stick your neck out now and again. Put differently, the only insurance against never failing again is doing absolutely nothing. Remember, failure is all about perspective. Take it from Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. When he was asked how it felt to have failed 10,000 times, he answered that he hadn’t failed 10,000 times – he’d successfully found 10,000 ways that didn’t work, and was 10,000 times closer to finding a formula that would! Once you learn to adopt Edison’s stoical way of thinking, you’ll realize that setbacks are part of ultimately achieving your goals. That’s something self-made business guru Dan Pena knows all about. Over 200 banks rejected his business loan applications. Lots of people would have called it quits after two or three attempts, but he kept going. Today, he’s worth a cool $250 million. The American billionaire John Paul Getty was savvy about making money. His view? No one ever got rich working for someone else. In a sense, though, you’re already self-employed – the company you work for is a means to an end, and if you didn’t get paid, you’d stop showing up. That means that you’re working for yourself, but giving someone else most of the profits! That’s a great reason to consider ditching the nine-to-five slog and striking out on your own, but it’s not the only one. The world of work has changed dramatically in recent decades, and the old rules no longer apply. Even if you wanted it, steady lifelong gigs ending with a pat on the back and a gold watch when you retire barely exist anymore. The new corporate buzzwords are “restructuring” and “downsizing” – in plain English, layoffs. Those who don’t lose their jobs aren’t exactly living off the fat of the land, either. Pay rises are rare in the best of times, and economic downturns inevitably lead to perks being slashed and new responsibilities. Meanwhile, the list of qualifications you’re expected to bring with you into over-regulated, poorly paid jobs continues to grow.   Then there are promotions. Whatever they claim, most employers are still pretty old-fashioned about who they’ll help get a foot on the career ladder. If you’re a woman, disabled or just have a foreign name like Anglo-Italian author Stanzione, you’re likely to find yourself passed over at one point or another. Sounds pretty bleak, right? Well, here’s the upside: we’re living in a new golden age for entrepreneurship. In a way, it’s a return to the historical norm. A few hundred years back, virtually everyone was self-employed. Whether they worked a particular trade or produced goods at home in so-called cottage industries, most people relied on their own business acumen. It was only when factories came along that people started relying on companies to look out for them. There’s a simple reason that flying solo has once again become such a viable option: globalization. With the internet at your fingertips wherever you are in the world, an international lingua franca – the language you’re reading these blinks in – and the ability to transfer goods and cash across borders, you can work anywhere and anytime you please. How? Read on to find out! First things first: quitting your job and going it alone is a big call, and only you can decide if it’s the right one. Before you take the plunge, answer these questions: Is your job fulfilling? Is the pay good? Would you continue doing it even if you didn’t need the money? If any of the answers are “no,” it’s time to get out for your own good. After all, unhappy people overeat, drink, smoke too much and – eventually – burn out. So where do you start if you’ve decided you’re ready? Well, it’s time to learn about mail order commerce. The author has good reason to call it the greatest business model in the world – it’s how he made his millions. Here’s how it works. Mail order means selling goods or services to customers who’ve never laid eyes on your product and have been drawn in by ads, articles, blog posts or internet searches. If they want to buy your product, they order it over the phone or online. What you sell is down to you – it can be anything from bespoke kitchenware to golfing manuals. The neat part is this: getting started is simple, quick and, most importantly, cheap. Most businesses fail because they’re up to their eyeballs in debt before they’re even up and running. They need to pay for staff, premises, licenses, and permits. Mail order businesses don’t require any of that. You’ll be doing everything until you’re ready to expand. Your “office”? A website. Need a phone line? Hire an answering service. Outlay? The bare minimum, just somewhere to store your product. If your product is information – something we’ll look at later – you’ll need little more than a closet. Best of all, economic conditions are in your favor. Customers have never felt more comfortable ordering online or sharing their credit card details with third parties. Knocking together a professional website takes only a matter of hours even if you’re an amateur, especially if you use the services of companies like Wordpress. And thanks to reliable courier services and electronic downloads, even the smallest business has global reach. Does it work? Ask Richard Branson, the founder of the multi-billion dollar Virgin Group. He started out in a tiny apartment selling mail-order records, which he advertised in student magazines. Anita Roddick, the mind behind the multinational cosmetics chain Body Shop, first cut her teeth selling beauty products to customers who read her ads in magazines aimed at teenagers.   Now, what should you sell? Marketing expert Gary Hebert often plays a game with his audiences when he gives talks. What, he asks, would they choose as their advantage if they ran a burger stand in competition with his burger operation. The usual answers? The biggest stall, the best meat or the most prime location. Hebert concludes by telling them the advantage he’d chose: a hungry crowd. It might seem like an obvious point, but billions of dollars are squandered every year by businesses that have forgotten Hebert’s lesson – you can only sell something if there’s an appetite for it. So, here’s your first maxim if you’re considering the mail order game: know your market, and decide what you’re going to sell accordingly. Understanding and responding to changes in what people want is a central component of business acumen. That’s because people’s wishes change all the time. But if you can read these desires correctly, you’re more likely to profit from them. When Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Jurassic Park hit movie theatres back in 1993, for example, sales of wooden dinosaur kits in the British Natural History Museum shop tripled overnight! You don’t have to reinvent the wheel, either. As the author puts it, you’re often better served by being the second or third person to think of something, rather than the first, as both the risks and opportunities will have become clear. Think of it as letting someone else dip their toes in the pool to check the temperature before you jump in yourself. What really makes the difference is identifying easy targets: products with a proven record of exciting interest and getting hands reaching for wallets. Luckily enough, lots of the tools to conduct thorough market research are already at your fingertips. Even better? They’re usually free! Here’s a tip to get you started. First off, set up a Google Ads account. Don’t worry about placing your own ads at this point – what you want is the keyword tool, which will tell you what people are searching for on Google. When the author was writing this book, for example, he noticed that “golf swing” generated 450,000 searches in one month. That’s a huge potential market for anything from courses to DVDs to newsletters on perfecting your golf swing! The best mail-order products are small, lightweight, sturdy enough to survive transportation and hard to find locally. Most importantly, they’ll have a high perceived value, and they cost little to produce. In this blink, we’ll take a look at one type of product that fits the bill. Think back to all those people searching for “golf swing” on Google. What they were after was information. It’s one of the most sought-after products out there, and people pay good money for it. Best of all, getting it to market doesn’t require massive outlays. The author, for example, remembers once selling a four-page document for $65. The production costs? 65 cents for the paper and ink! So how do you sell information? One way is to package it as a “how-to” manual. The first step is to hit Amazon or eBay, and see what topics are doing well. Top-selling information categories usually include advice on money, dieting, computing, cosmetics and dating. Once you’ve chosen your subject, you have three options: you can either research and write the manual yourself, hire a freelancer to do it for you or purchase the reprint and resale rights to an existing publication. Next up, you’ll want to use Google Ads to find out how people are searching for your subject. Say you’re producing a manual on effective gambling strategies: you might discover that people are looking up “make money from horse racing.” That’ll tell you which keywords to use in your own ads, which you can then place online and in magazines specializing in your area. Finally, you’ll need to get hold of a list of people who’ve bought similar products and contact them directly. That’s surprisingly easy – googling “direct mail list brokers” should help you find plenty. Once you’ve produced your manual, you can use the same information to create another product: audio. It’s a great way of reaching out to today’s overloaded and time-poor consumers. For this, you have a couple of choices. You can either record the audio yourself using free podcasting software, or hire a voice-over artist for a couple of hundred dollars. If you get stuck with the tech, remember: you can outsource anything these days! Just think of Bill Gates. When it came to writing the code for MS-DOS, the forerunner to Windows, he simply paid someone else and licensed it to IBM! By now you should have a good idea of how to start generating new income. But here’s the thing: looking after what you already have is just as important as making money. Shopping, in other words, is a skill, and buying smart makes all the difference. It’s the reason some folks get along just fine on $50,000 a year, and others struggle with $250,000. The key is becoming more mindful about your consumer choices. It’s all about taking a step back before splashing out and asking yourself a simple question: Do you really need this, or is it an impulse purchase? If the answer is still “yes,” follow up with some other questions. Could you rent it for a couple of days rather than buying, for example? And, if you do buy it with a view to reselling it later on, how quickly will its value depreciate? Answer those honestly, and you’re much less likely to end up regretting your spending decisions. That said, sometimes there’s no way around it, and you’ll have to reach for your wallet. In those cases, it’s well worth taking a look at used products. That doesn’t mean heading to the thrift store, though. Think about consumer electronics – lots of big retailers offer money-back guarantees. When customers return their goods, the shop sells these virtually unused products at a discount of around 25 percent. E-commerce platforms are another good bet, especially if you decide that last year’s iPhone will serve you just as well as the latest model. But be careful: if a deal sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Exercise caution and always check out sellers’ ratings before hitting the “buy” button. You can also save a ton of cash on big purchases like cars if you know where to look. Most large car rental firms like Hertz sell used models, which are generally no older than six to eight months and are offered at a discount of up to 30 percent. But here’s the best tip of all: if you’re in the market for a car, aim to buy around Christmas. People’s minds are usually focused on the upcoming holidays and business is slow in most dealerships, which means you’re much more likely to find a bargain! The key message in these blinks: Anyone can turn their life around, earn more and find greater fulfillment. But here’s the thing – it’s a long journey. That said, the largest tasks can be accomplished by taking smaller steps. As the saying goes: the best way to eat an elephant is by taking one bite at a time. And that’s exactly how you’ll start turning your life around. Whether it’s learning to make better decisions, setting up your own business or making your cash go further, these blinks are a step-by-step guide to becoming your best self.   Actionable advice: Smile! You’ve probably come across the idea that if you don’t ask, you don’t get. That’s true enough, but it leaves out something vital: you’re much more likely to get what you want if you ask for it with a smile on your face. Smiling is a universal language – you can even hear it over the phone. Telemarketers often put mirrors on their desks, as they know that if they’re smiling while making their pitches, their sales figures will look a lot better at the end of the month! Got feedback?

But what if you don’t want to only enjoy your riches in the last part of your life? And anyway what if the stock market collapses and you lose all your savings? There has to be another way. Thankfully, The Millionaire Fastlane explains a better approach to getting wealthy. Starting with having the right mindset, and learning to think of wealth in a new way, you can forget about the old paths to wealth and end up young, rich and free to do what you like with your life. In these blinks, you will find out why a high income won’t make you wealthy; why looking for one “big hit” is misguided; and the secret to starting your own business. How do people get rich? Is it luck, or perhaps fate? A lot of people think so, which might be the reason why they themselves aren’t rich. If you believe becoming wealthy is out of your control, this mindset is jeopardizing your chances. You can control your future. It just takes planning. If you believe that it’s pointless to plan ahead, this puts you in a weak position to deal with life’s challenges. Without precautions such as creating a financial plan or arranging for health insurance, external events like losing your job, becoming ill or having to suddenly deal with a recession can cause you far more grief than necessary. Sometimes prioritizing the moment in terms of spending can have serious drawbacks. For example, if you live from paycheck to paycheck, suddenly finding yourself without a job would mean you can no longer pay your rent. If you refuse to take responsibility for your life, even earning an impressive income won’t keep you from going broke. If you think you have no power over your own life, it’s tempting to want to spend your money while you have it. After all, what if you were struck by lightning tomorrow? This is why people splurge on instant gratifications like expensive dinners and luxury cars. Yet having this mindset will drain your income and your credit range, because regardless of how much you earn, you’ll spend it all. We’ve all heard stories of how some rappers go from carousing about with the cash from a huge hit to losing everything in one year. Of course it’s possible you could be run over by a train tomorrow. But this is unlikely. And even if something terrible should happen in the future, you’ll be glad if you at least made some plans for worst case scenarios, like making sure you have a buffer of cash when you need it. We all know the strategy: get a good education so you can get a well-paid job, then work hard and save and invest your well-earned money. Then, after around 40 years, you’ll eventually be able to retire and enjoy your wealth. But there is a problem with this strategy. First, it might not actually get you where you want. There’s a ceiling to how much you can earn from a salary alone. Clearly, you can’t exactly keep raising your work hours indefinitely; it’s just not possible to work 1,000 hours a week! Nor can you request your boss to dish out a 200 percent pay raise, even if you’re an exceptional employee. The stock market, too, is unpredictable and out of your control. Thus, the stocks you invest in might plummet in value or simply grow more gradually than you expected. Finally, your savings and investments are probably going to be subjected to inflation and you might find yourself left with only a small fraction of the value you first invested in. Therefore, if you’re fortunate enough after some decades to save around $2.5 million, it may only be worth the equivalent of just $250,000 in today’s dollars. Add to that the impossibility of knowing whether you’ll even be alive to enjoy it. Even if your plan works out, when you get to the stage where you can finally reap the benefits of your money and time, you’ll be old. This strategy is based entirely on working really hard while you’re young, so that you can enjoy the rewards when you’re older. So here’s a better idea: to make the most of your retirement, retire while you’re young. Vitality and health tend to deteriorate as we get older and these are two qualities that enable us to appreciate free time. It’s far more enjoyable to go hiking when your joints don’t ache from arthritis. Some specialist fields like medicine require a prescribed education. But remember, enrolling in a formal education isn’t always the best route to wealth. Often, the expense of education cancels out the higher salary you’ll hopefully earn at the end of it. Whereas it is possible you’ll earn more with a college degree, especially if, for example, you go into business with an MBA, the financial setback is a formidable consideration. The College Board reports an average college degree (including room and board) sets you back nearly $60,000.  To afford this, you’ll probably have to take out a student loan, making your education even pricier. There’s also no guarantee that you’ll land a well-paying job after college. College-educated adults typically earn around $54,000 per year. If you also consider that completing a college education takes years, this leaves you with less time to earn money later. A conventional college education may also encourage you to think in conventional ways. After absorbing the key concepts of your field and studying specific tools to solve problems, you may find it difficult to think outside the box. In finance, this could mean that you understand how to calculate return on investment, but are ill-equipped to find a new, innovative way to judge investment value. The bottom line is, you can become rich and successful without a prestigious degree. Amazing business ideas don’t require formal degrees. However, you may need some special skills. For example, to develop a lucrative internet service by yourself, you need the skills to write code, but you don’t need a computer engineering degree. Bear in mind some of the richest, most successful people in the world never completed college. People like Bill Gates, Michael Dell and David Geffen. So, now we’ve uncovered the thoughts and strategies that may prevent you from getting rich and successful. What ways do work? And how do you define wealth anyway? How would you define wealth? When most of us hear the word, we tend to instantly think about money. But really, there’s far more to it than that. Wealth is a combination of things that make you feel fulfilled. Actually, it has three main components, each of which is necessary for us to feel happy with our lives. The first factor is meaningful relationships, including family; the second is our health and physical fitness; and the third is freedom. So being wealthy isn’t just about owning piles and piles of cash. Does a depressed and lonely person with an oversized bank account look like the picture of wealth to you? That being said, being financially independent does put you on the path to wealth, in particular because it enables you to have freedom. Sure, money isn’t all-powerful. Its impact is limited. For example, you can purchase the best health care with money, but no amount of money will transform your body into top condition. Nor can you spend cash in exchange for meaningful relationships. In the case of freedom, though, it’s slightly different. Once you have plenty of money to live comfortably, you no longer need to trade your time for money as you would do in a job. Therefore, when you find yourself in this situation, you can use your money to buy you the freedom to spend your time as you wish, to visit places you want to visit and generally do what you want. Being free means living where you want, traveling and enjoying your hobbies, even if they’re expensive. This is really how having a lot of money can increase your wealth. We’ve all skimmed those articles about some 20-year-old being presented with millions of dollars for their new internet company. It’s news like this that encourages the notion that becoming rich happens in a single moment. But really, it’s a process. Becoming rich doesn’t occur at the snap of a finger. Preceding every deal or offer is a well-thought-out plan and often years of work. Consider an elite basketball player’s contract. It’s the result of years of conscious practice and games, and giving up leisure activities that might jeopardize performance or take up valuable practice time. So stop praying for your one big break, because doing so encourages you to make poor decisions. Hoping for one big chance might influence you to gamble on minimal odds, like playing the lottery, getting into risky investments or auditioning for a game show. The unrealistic idea that one event will blast you to success will keep you from working in a way that might actually let you accomplish your goals. So what should you do? Make a plan! To become wealthy independently, you must create a product or business that is self-sustaining. This takes time. If you want to become so wealthy that you no longer need to work, you need to build a company or a product that generates income even while you’re not actually working. One great example is J.K. Rowling. Her Harry Potter books became the best-selling book series of all time and the movie adaptations were also immensely successful. As a result, Rowling became a multi-millionaire, and still reaps the monetary rewards from her books. This system is the most effective way of being rich, because your income is independent from your time. But to make it work, you need to find a market gap, create a solid business plan and learn all the necessary skills. Right from childhood, we’re taught to be consumers. We’re exposed to constant, pervasive advertisements in the media, and at home we’re taught to place value on Christmas lists and family brand preferences. The result? A constant desire for products.  If you really want to be rich, get on the other team and start thinking like a producer. Staying bound to a consumer mentality will limit you. When you view an ad from a consumer perspective, you focus on the product, the happiness it will bring you and how you can get it. All this prevents you from seeing behind the ad. If you look at the world as a producer does, a lot of useful information about marketing and product design will be revealed to you. You’ll understand which features make a product successful, and the strategy used to sell it. It’s even better to look for information on how companies produce a product, where they manufacture it and what their revenue model is. Just doing this can teach you a whole lot about different business strategies. The only way to get rich quickly is to start your own business, and seeing the world through a producer’s eyes will help you do just that. As you now know, the traditional get-rich methods aren’t reliable. As long as you have an employer, you won’t be in a position to become very rich. Since you can’t rely on winning the lottery next week, the only real option is to start your own business. Then when you’re more productive, you get more income! So, to begin your successful business, you need to have the strategy and the knowledge of a producer. You’ve probably heard this multiple times: find a way to cash in on what you love and the money will follow! But the truth is, customers couldn’t care less about your passions. All they want to know is what your business can do for them.   As the German proverb goes: the worm must be tasty to the fish, not to the fisherman. People will purchase your product only if it meets their needs or adds value to their life. Most of us are motivated by our own interests, not by the desire to make others happy. Therefore, if you want a potential customer’s money, you need to offer them something desirable in exchange. This means a product that solves a problem, meets a need or enables them to feel better in some way. In a crime-ridden neighborhood, for instance, this product could be safety locks or window braces, not glamorous handbags or organic cheese. If you really want to make doing what you love into a business, that’s fine, but you better be exceptional at it if you want to stand out from the competition. Because whatever it is you love to do, it’s likely you won’t be alone. Just think about the amount of people who desire to be famous singers, painters, actors or other kinds of artists. If you’re convinced your hobby should become your profession, be prepared. For example, if you want to be a professional actor, you’ll need to be among the handful of people who get offered role after role, or work for a theater company. To get to this stage requires years of training, experience and dedication. Remember, this commitment and excellence applies to all passions, not just the arts. If you wish to produce computers, for example, you’ll need to do it better than Apple, HP and all the other top brands on the market. Imagine you hear about an awesome new internet business. Your friends are raving about it and there are already several bestsellers telling everyone how they can get rich from it. It seems like a safe bet, so would you go for it? After all, everyone is sure it’ll pay off! Before you dive in, you should be aware that the easier it is to go down a business road, the less effective this road will be at making you rich. If anyone can enter a business, competition is going to skyrocket. Much like those passions so many of us love (mentioned in the previous blink), if it’s overly competitive, there’s too much supply, and if there’s too much supply, the prices will plummet. So to get rich in a business situation like this, you need to be extraordinarily good at what you’re doing. Hopefully you know that starting a business takes effort, so if it seems like a breeze to join a business, alarm bells should be ringing in your head. Starting a business is a series of actions and choices. Even a simple business like a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley means you need to seek out, finance and renovate a suitable property, insure it, get the official permits and paperwork done, all before you even start thinking about hiring staff and everything else that comes later. Also be aware that some founders of network marketing companies promise you can join simply by purchasing a starter kit and filling out an application. Again, you should treat this with suspicion, as you’ll probably be joining a business that’s not worth anything. Rather than ending up an entrepreneur, you may actually end up a paying client of the real entrepreneur: the network marketing company! The key message in this book: A lot of us try to safeguard our future the traditional way: find a good job, work hard for about 40 years and save everything we can for retirement. Yet this way leads to lifelong servitude and there’s no guarantee you’ll end up rich. There’s another way, though: pinpoint a good market niche, work out a business plan and take a few years of effort to build a system that generates income, even when you’re not working. Actionable advice: The next time you’re bored, learn something new.  The next time you’re bored, use the time to brainstorm or soak up ideas for a product. Listen to some talkback radio while you’re stuck in a traffic jam, or read an article in a tech or art magazine while you’re waiting at the doctor’s office. Study your new purchase. Look at the latest product or gadget you bought from a producer’s perspective. What are its selling points and features? How is it advertised and how would you describe the target customer? Considering these questions will help you get into the mindset of creating something you can sell and maybe even identify a market niche.

Stanley and William D. Danko","summary":"Millionaires are ostentatious. They live a glamorous life, with private jets and luxury cars, hidden away in enormous mansions in the exclusive Hollywood hills. Or is that all fantasy? The truth is far from the bling and bright lights. Most millionaires in America actually live what most people would call a normal lifestyle. What’s more interesting, though, is that living modestly is what made them millionaires in the first place. These blinks show you that if you’re dedicated and clever enough to plan your finances correctly, you too can follow the path to riches that many a millionaire has walked before you. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the guy driving a Bentley probably earns less than you do; exactly when you should start saving your cash; and why lazy kids get the biggest piece of their millionaire parents’ pie. If you were a millionaire, you wouldn’t hesitate to wear Prada and drink Champagne every day for breakfast, right? But despite the stereotypes, many actual millionaires purchase fewer expensive items than you do – and they are happy doing so. If you want to become a millionaire, you’ve got to learn to save responsibly at the moment when you first start to earn more money than you need to live on. The majority of self-made millionaires have modest backgrounds and achieved great wealth by saving their monthly earnings and avoiding spending cash on stuff they didn’t need. This simple rule is one way you too could become a millionaire, without ever actually making a million dollars a year. People become millionaires by controlling their budget and maintaining their affluence in the same way. They’re also practiced at thinking long term and planning for the future. A survey of millionaires found that for every 100 millionaires who weren't budgeting and thinking about their financial future, there were 120 millionaires who certainly were. Planning and structuring expenses is key if you want to become a millionaire. To start, set a goal, such as having a certain amount of cash tucked away for retirement. Then budget your expenses, living costs and investments. Mrs. and Mr. Rule are millionaires, and their main goal is to be financially independent when they’re ready to retire. By this time, they want to have saved some $5 million. To make this happen, the couple cleverly allocates their time and money so that they can continue to invest in their business while earning and saving money that can be used toward real estate purchases or home renovation projects. Many real-life millionaires are more interested in financial independence than owning a fleet of Rolls-Royce luxury cars. Financial independence plays an important role in well-being. Of those in the same income bracket, people who are financially independent are happier than those who aren't. But what does it mean to be financially independent? If you are able to continue the lifestyle you maintain now when you retire, and are able to survive a future financial crisis, then you are financially independent.   Financially secure people are clear about future goals, which enables them to organize household budgets according to personal priorities. Let’s revisit the Rule family again. Mrs. Rule is happy and financially secure. Even if she suffers a physical injury, she will never be financially dependent on anyone. She’s even in the position to put funds aside for her grandchildren, whom she hopes will graduate college one day. Many people can picture the prototypical American millionaire, the big-hat-no-cattle type – that is, a person who looks like a rich rancher but doesn’t actually own any cattle. They drive luxury cars but earn average incomes. And even if they earn a decent income, they struggle to accumulate wealth. In other words, these millionaires don’t have as much money as you’d expect. To calculate the expected wealth of a person, use this equation: the person’s age multiplied by the pre-tax annual household income, divided by ten. For example, Mr. Friend earned $221,000 one year. Since Mr. Friend is 48 years old, his expected wealth would be 48 multiplied by 221,000, then divided by ten, which equals $1,060,800. But by squandering his cash on luxury goods, Mr. Friend’s actual net worth is less than $260,000. He’s no millionaire! In fact, he’s a big-hat-no-cattle guy, also known as an under-accumulator of wealth. Simply put, he’s not worth as much as he could be. How do millionaires choose what to invest in? Clever millionaires know that dishing out on medical care for their family and investing in methods to make a business more productive is the way to go. Although these millionaires are often frugal in other respects, price is not an issue when it comes to buying investment services, getting tax advice or spending on medical care for themselves and their loved ones. Likewise, they know to buy products or services that improve their businesses, such as additional office space or computer software. Take millionaire Mr. South. He says he would never buy a Rolls Royce for himself, because in his lower-middle-class neighborhood, it would turn too many heads. Instead, he understands that using his money to pay for his grandchildren’s dental care makes far more financial sense. Smart spending also means smart planning. Millionaires spend a greater amount of time planning investments and often reap more benefits from them than those who neglect to plan. Moreover, if you want to increase your wealth by investing in specific businesses, you’ll need to plan as well as get some expertise. Everyone has at least one area in which they have considerable knowledge, so use this to your advantage when investing. For example, Mrs. Smith is an auctioneer who specializes in commercial real estate. Which industry should she invest in? Commercial real estate, of course. Mr. Long however knows a lot about antique furniture. Should he invest in high-tech securities? Probably not, as he should stick to what he knows best. We’ve seen how millionaires live, but what about the children of millionaires? In most cases, millionaire parents don’t raise their kids with much financial support. Although many millionaires are thrifty, they spend a great deal on economic outpatient care. This means their children receive monthly cash gifts, have the costs of medical treatments and education covered, and so on. But the more money adult children of affluent parents receive, the less they save, and vice versa. By financially supporting adult children, some millionaires cause them to be financially dependent and hamper them from being able to budget intelligently. Did you know that more than 46 percent of wealthy Americans support their adult children and/or grandchildren by offering gifts or cash of at least $15,000 each year? For example, since she was married, Mary gets $15,000 annually from her parents. She and her husband are in their early 50s, own expensive cars, live in a great neighborhood, are country club members and are involved in a number of non-profit organizations. From the outside, they look like millionaires, yet they’ve never earned more than $60,000 a year. The amount of money you spend and save also influences your children’s purchasing behavior. Every family has their own do’s and don’ts for investing and purchasing, and these budgets affect children who emulate their parents’ financial habits. So teach your children how to invest well and how to spend wisely! For instance, John is an under-accumulator of wealth (UAW). Whenever he gets a paycheck, he spends the money on designer clothes, a habit he learned from his parents who used to shop every Saturday. They bought just for the sake of buying, and now so does John. Who will receive your money after you die? A lot of millionaires claim it will be divided equally between their children. But in reality, some people are more likely to inherit than others. Housewives are one such group. Millionaires or affluent parents are aware of the fact that women tend to earn less than men, so they pass more money down to them. Especially housewives, who may have been “daddy’s girl” since childhood or didn’t finish college. They’re significantly more likely to receive a considerable inheritance. Consider Alice, who was always her father’s favorite. When she married a man who earned only a modest income, and quit school to stay at home with her two children, her father started economic outpatient care because he wouldn’t allow his daughter to live in a home that didn’t measure up to his upper-middle class image. In addition to women who stay at home, unemployed adult children often receive more cash gifts and inheritance than do working siblings. In many cases, the children of millionaires are unemployed or “professional students” who have never held a job, choosing instead to study all their life. Parents regard these children as requiring more financial support than their more independent siblings. Many cash gifts also are drawn from over-funded college savings accounts, which, when a child quits school, were no longer needed. Take Paul and Peter, brothers and children of a millionaire couple. Paul became an entrepreneur and moved far away from home, and became financially independent as he refused cash from his parents. Peter, however, moved back to his parents’ home after graduating from college as he didn’t want to be employed full-time. So now he receives cash gifts for housing, food, clothing and transportation from his parents. It’s no surprise then, that after the death of their parents, the financially dependent Peter received the inheritance. The key message in this book: The typical millionaire isn’t all Hollywood glitz and glamour. Many live well below their means, saving and budgeting money diligently and spending it intelligently. If you consistently adhere to these simple standards, you too could become a millionaire. Actionable advice: Cash looks better in your bank account than on your body! Next time you receive a bonus or get a raise, resist the urge to splash out on some flashy new gadget or trendy piece of clothing. Save the money and enjoy watching it grow in your bank account.

How was that experience? Did you get a sad sack who couldn’t convince a man on fire to buy a bucket of water? Or perhaps you had a smooth operator with a glistening smile and a $3,000 suit? As with most sales roles, a winning personality and the ability to convince others are skills necessary to close a real estate deal. However, it takes far more than that to create a successful, sustainable real estate business. As you’ll see in these blinks, by setting the right goals, knowing what motivates you and learning a few tricks, you can turn a fledgling real estate business into a true empire. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you need more sales leads than you think; what the four-minute mile has to do with being a real estate agent; and how Dr. Joyce Brothers finally got on television. When faced with a big new project, most people are so driven to get to work that they fail to realize how important good planning is to reaching the desired outcome. To find long-term focus and determination, you need to understand why you want to do something. This is the secret weapon of all high-achievers: they define a motivating purpose to help them maintain perfect focus. You can witness the power of purpose for example on the last day of work before you leave for vacation, when you probably complete much more work than usual. This drive is due to your new purpose – to wrap up loose ends and hit the beach! But every day isn’t the day before your vacation. To succeed, you’ll need something that gives you constant purpose. And when it comes to finding that constant purpose, intrinsic motivators, such as the drive to always be a better person, are better than extrinsic motivators, such as trying to earn a certain amount of money. Extrinsic motivators are goals that can be reached, but when they are, the motivation disappears. So think about what intrinsic motivator you can focus on. Once you’re focused, it’s time to set goals. It’s important to be ambitious here. After all, failing to reach a huge goal is better than falling short of a small one. This is why we teach children to dream big and that anything is possible. We shouldn’t tell ourselves anything different! So instead of progressively increasing the size of your goals, set a major goal straight away and let smaller milestones naturally form the steps along your journey to success. For instance, if your interim goal is to close $5 million in property sales, after which you shoot for $10 million, you might feel satisfied after attaining that first goal and lose motivation to achieve the second. This is why it’s better to aim for a major goal like $80 million and use the smaller milestones as inspiration to keep working at it. The success of all realtors, whether bullish and business-savvy or humble and obliging, depends on their ability to pursue three key objectives: leads, listings and leverage. The real estate business is a numbers game, which means to increase sales, you first need to maximize the number of leads you get. If you look at the process of selling property in reverse, there are no contracts without listings, and there are no listings without leads. Everything boils down to lead generation, since leads ensure that you can keep doing business! After all, an excess of leads means you can pick the best ones and focus on converting those leads to listings. On the other hand, too few leads will eventually mean lagging sales and failure. So once you have enough leads, you can move on to the next goal: listings. It’s to your advantage to advertise your services mostly to people looking to sell a home, rather than those looking to buy one. This is because doing so will give you greater exposure. Just think of all the prospective buyers who come to viewings and are exposed to your brand, possibly becoming customers later on. Essentially, listing for sellers is a way of getting free marketing to produce further leads and listings. And finally, by leveraging people, systems and tools, you can cut down your workload while maximizing income. For example, you can start employing other real estate agents and take a commission of the deals they close. Or you can make your job easier by hiring an administrator to manage your office and lead database, as well as direct your advertising and social media efforts. This will leave you with more time to focus on sales. Now that you know the strategies behind generating leads, listings and leverage, it’s time to learn how to execute these strategies effectively. So far we’ve touched on the key aspects of running a real estate business, but now let’s look at four important tools that will let you grow your business successfully and sustainably. Let’s start by introducing the first two of these tools. First is the economic model, an analytical tool that calculates the numbers you need to hit to reach your target income. In other words, once you’ve decided how much money you’d like to earn, the economic model helps you use records and statistics to determine how many leads you need to generate to reach this goal. For instance, if you want to earn revenues of $200,000, and you charge a 2.5-percent commission, you’ll need to sell $8 million worth of property. If your average closing price is $400,000, you’ll know that you have to sell 20 properties to meet your target. From there, knowing that your listings-to-sales conversion rate is 25 percent, the tool will tell you that you need to list 80 properties to sell 20. The final step is to calculate the required number of leads. If you have a lead-to-listings conversion rate of 10 percent, you’ll have to generate 800 leads to reach your goal. That’s the economic model, and it’s great in helping you determine from the start how many leads you’ll need to meet your financial goals. The lead generation model, our second tool, is the one that will help you secure those leads so you can acquire and maintain clients. How does it work? Good lead generation efforts involve frequent contact with prospective clients, but not so frequent that your efforts become annoying. When advertising to people that you have not had contact with yet, for instance via telemarketing or cold mailings, you can be fairly aggressive, contacting them up to 12 times yearly. With people you have met face-to-face, you can go into higher gear, reaching out to them eight times over the eight weeks that follow the meeting, whether by writing them a letter or sending them a fridge magnet or calendar as a gift. And for those people you know well, you should aim to communicate with them 33 times a year, sending birthday cards, personal emails, other real estate listings and general reports about the real estate market. These two tools, the economic model and the lead generation model, are powerful on their own. Next, we’ll learn about the two other tools which complete our real estate success package. In the previous blink, we introduced the first two tools that can help you put your strategy into action. Now let’s examine the other two, which define spending limits and maximize organizational efficiency. The third tool, the budget model, works by preventing you from using more money than you make. As soon as possible, you should begin limiting yourself to only spending money that your business generates. This might slow down growth, but just as it takes time for a concrete foundation to set, patience in these early days will provide you with a much stronger base going forward. On the other hand, if you don’t curb spending early, the future of your business will be far less secure. Just consider the dot-com boom. Expectations of rapid growth caused startups to make huge capital investments – yet once the companies’ true valuations came to light, all that money was lost. So how do you know when it’s ok to spend more money to pursue an opportunity? Think about it like a set of traffic lights: when you see a chance to increase your revenues, you have a green light and can increase your spending. But then, the light turns red, and you have to wait until you hit the revenue goal that justified the additional spending. Only then will the light turn green again. Finally, the organizational model will help you employ skilled people and free up your time to concentrate on the more important parts of your business. The first person you hire should be someone to handle administrative tasks, letting you focus on selling property. When hiring it’s important to remember that you get what you pay for – and it’s worth offering a higher wage to find and secure a talented, motivated employee. Think of it this way: if you want to employ a person asking for an annual salary of $20,000 more than you’re offering, consider that the employee only needs to generate an extra $2,000 per month in revenue to cover that increase. This is probably easily justified if the employee frees you up to make more sales. Know, however, that these tools are just templates. Your business, of course, will change as it grows, but if you start out using these basic tools, you’ll make the road to success just that much smoother. Once your business is established, your main goal will be to perfect your strategies in dealing with leads, listings and leverage. Remember again that you’re in the business of generating leads – they form the backbone of your real estate business! When marketing your business, yourself and your listings, all your efforts should be directed at generating new leads. This is where a well-defined lead-generation model will help. But naturally, leads are only good if they can be converted into listings – the all-important opportunities to make sales and maximize your business exposure. To ensure you get enough listings, track the economic model monthly to stay abreast of how many listings you need to reach your budgetary goals and how many leads this means. If you don’t, you won’t know what you need to do every day to earn you ideal income! It would be like traveling to a city you’ve never been to before without a map. You also need to define an organizational model to give you more leverage by allowing you to focus on what’s important. Your organizational model should be based on the needs of your business not only today but what they might be in the future. You need to consider whether to hire a person who can adapt to changes over time, or who instead has the specific skills to fit an immediate need. Last but not least, you must use the budget model to ensure your spending doesn’t exceed your earnings in the long term. In general, it’s important to remember that implementing the four models will take effort and discipline – yet your journey doesn’t end once these models are in place. Your road toward continual self-improvement is paved by the perpetual determination to modify and improve on these models. Now that you’ve mastered these practical tools, it’s time to get personal – and that means talking about the fear of failure. As humans, we are all naturally fearful – but when it comes to business, you need to let go of your fear of failure. In most cases, you’ll fail before you succeed. Only through perseverance will you make it far enough to see your hard work come to fruition. So instead of seeing failure as a negative, you should embrace failure as a necessary part of reaching the goals you want. Consider the example of a certain US congressman who went bankrupt not once but twice, lost a bid not only for a legislative seat but also failed in two congressional campaigns, two senatorial campaigns and a race to become vice president. This loser’s name was Abraham Lincoln, which goes to show how crucial perseverance is. It’s important to accept failure, but you also need to conquer the beliefs that hold you back, especially if those beliefs are based on a falsehood. For example, people used to think it was impossible to run a four-minute mile. But then, on May 6, 1954, Roger Bannister succeeded in this feat. And after the physical and psychological barrier of the four-minute mile was broken, it took a mere two months for Bannister’s record to be surpassed! The false belief of an unbreakable barrier had been holding everyone back. Whether on the track or in real estate, success is about visualizing yourself as a victor, and the truly great individuals can do this without someone else leading the way. Great real estate agents also know that they can never rest on their laurels. When you pursue personal success, there’s no finish line. Even the most skilled agents have limits to what they can charge for their time, but there’s no limit to how successful your real estate business can become. No matter how streamlined your sales process, how many deals you close or how big these deals become, your most valuable resource will always be your time. When you decide that you want your business to generate more passive income for you, it’s time then to work on your business, not on making more sales yourself. For instance, when you reach a point where you no longer want to work, a passive income of $100,000 a year might suffice, and attaining it can be simple. Here’s how you can do it. If currently you’re earning say $200,000 per year, you can pay a business manager half this sum to do your job while enjoying a steady stream of income with little active work. This dynamic is exemplified by one of the authors himself. As a teenager, Gary Keller charged $15 to mow lawns in his neighborhood. As his business grew, he hired friends to help out, paying them $10 per lawn and keeping the remaining $5 without lifting a finger. It’s even possible to earn millions of dollars in passive income by creating multiple businesses and leveraging your time by hiring others to run those businesses. As a successful real estate agent, you’ll be able to watch the figures generated by the four models, define your target passive income and determine how many agencies you’ll need to reach your target. At that scale, your organizational model will include managers, administrators and people specialized in helping both sellers and buyers in a single business unit that is then replicated across multiple entities. Once you’ve made the decision to switch to a passive income, your new focus will be accountability – for your decisions and how these decisions affect your business at large. Why is it that, even after receiving the same exact training, two people will produce entirely different results? A major difference between people who are successful and people who are highly successful is how much they focus their energy and in which direction they choose to focus it in. In business, it doesn’t make sense for a manager to focus on everything. Rather, you need to focus on what’s important. It’s also key to keep the Pareto principle in mind: 80 percent of your success comes from the top 20 percent of your resources. So when you’re getting started in the real estate business, you’ll probably have to work with every listing you can get just to keep yourself afloat. But once your business starts to thrive, you can start being pickier about which leads you pursue. Don’t spread yourself too thin. Instead, focus on your biggest leads and let other agents handle the smaller ones. As a business owner, you’ll still make a profit from your agent’s work and be able to spend your time more wisely. The key lesson is to focus all your energy on your goals and not to be deterred by failure. For instance, the famous Dr. Joyce Brothers applied to be a contestant on a game show but was rejected because, being a homemaker and psychologist, she wasn’t considered “interesting” enough. However, instead of giving up on her dream, she stayed focused and spent a year learning about boxing. She tried again and was accepted to the show, as now she was considered an interesting candidate. She went on to win the show’s grand prize and then leveraged her fame into a successful career as a celebrity writer and psychologist. Success comes in all shapes and forms, but all successful people have one thing in common: an intense level of focus. The key message in this book: Success in real estate boils down to leads, listings and leveraging resources. Once you’ve set up your business using these principles, you can step back and change your focus, growing your business while nurturing your agents to earn even more money for you.  Actionable advice: Plan the finances of your real estate future from the start. When getting started in real estate, begin by determining how much money you want to earn. Then use the economic model to understand exactly how many deals, listings and leads you’ll need to reach your goal. By following this strategy you’ll be able to set tangible goals right off the bat!

Maybe I should get in on that!” Well, why not? The financial markets are open to all, and there is a lot of money out there, waiting to be made. Just look at the vast wealth of George Soros or Warren Buffet. However, jumping into financial trading without knowing what you are doing is not wise. If you get things wrong, you could end up losing a lot. Therefore, before starting your new life as a trader, read these blinks. Based on the thinking of a market expert, they map out the basic rules every beginning trader should know. In these blinks, you’ll discover that every good trader is unemotional and calculating; why making money on the market begins with learning how to read a graph; and why you’ve got to study up on bulls and bears. Have you ever looked at famed stock traders like Warren Buffet and wondered why you can’t live like them? Well, you can! It’s challenging to get there, but if you’re cognizant of some early pitfalls, it’ll be much easier. As you take the plunge into trading, the first thing to be aware of is the danger of commissions. You pay your broker or bank a commission every time you do a trade – and if you don’t watch out, these commissions will eat up your trading money! Say you’re an active trader, doing two trades a day, four days per week, paying $10 per trade in commissions. By the end of each week those commissions amount to $80. Working 50 weeks a year, you’ll have paid $4,000 in commissions by year’s end! If you’re trading with $20,000 per year, that’s 20 percent of your budget spent on commissions alone. To minimize commission costs, make sure you do your research on various brokers and banks. Compare their services and commissions carefully to avoid paying more than necessary. Another common pitfall is slippage. Slippage means that your order could have been filled for less money than you paid. If you want to avoid this, you’ll need to make your orders the right way. There are two order types: limit orders and market orders. Using a market order is rather like saying, “give me a stock.” This guarantees you a stock, but you don’t know at which price. If the price has increased from $50 to $53, you are paying $3 more than you intended. Using a limit order is like saying “give me that stock for $50.” You won’t pay more than $50, but if nobody is selling at this price, you might not get a stock. Limit orders are definitely the way to go, since they prevent you from overpaying for stock. Paying too much, whether to brokers or for stocks, is one pitfall the new trader faces, but it’s not the only one. Most people think trading is like gambling. Why? Maybe because both seem like very risky ways of making money. But that’s not quite the reality. Though poor trading may resemble gambling, good trading is nothing like it. If you trade like you gamble, chances are your capital will disappear rather quickly, as gamblers don’t carefully control how much money they put down. But how do you know when you’re trading like a gambler? The inability to resist the urge to bet is a sure sign that you’re an inveterate gambler. If you ever have the feeling that you need to trade or that you just can’t stop, you are gambling. Try taking a one-month break to get those risk-taking urges under control. Another sign is when single trades begin affecting you emotionally. If the stocks move in your favor, you feel happy and powerful, but if the trade moves against you, you feel crappy. Emotional trading causes you to gamble away your money in search of positive feelings. A professional trader doesn’t get emotional, because she knows that trading is merely a way to make money. She doesn’t feel a personal connection to any given stock. Self-sabotage is also a common pitfall for traders, be they a beginner or a professional. In fact, one of the author’s friends did just this. As a pharmacist, broker and trader, he was unsuccessful, but prone to careless decisions. At the height of his trading career, he went on a trip to Asia, leaving open a vast position with no security at all. Naturally, when he returned, that position had decreased and all his capital was wiped out. How can you prevent a devastating mistake like this? It’s simple: Take responsibility for your actions and their consequences. Good trading also means taking responsibility for your own decision-making. Learn more about this in the next blink! All we ever discuss in trading is the market, but what does this term actually mean? Amateurs think it’s an entity in its own right; people with a scientific background often think it’s a scientific body; but professional traders know that it is merely a mass of people following trends. To become a successful trader, you must avoid the market crowd. But remaining an independent thinker isn’t always easy. In fact, human instinct impels us to seek out the safety of the crowd. A stone-age hunter, for instance, was more likely to survive if he joined a crowd of hunters, and even if there aren’t literally any saber-toothed tigers on Wall Street, those primitive impulses still affect your everyday trading. Such impulsive decision-making is quite dangerous, however, and can suck people into disastrous trades. One historic example is the Tulip Mania, which took place in Holland, in 1634. The prices of tulips were increasing and everyone thought that this pattern would continue. Many people abandoned their businesses to go into the tulip business. Ultimately, however, it all collapsed, leaving people broke and destitute. So how do you stay away from the crowd? Start by identifying the most important types of group behavior in the market. Let’s consider the market in terms of two groups: bulls and bears. Bulls bet on prices going up; bears, on prices going down. When prices are rising, it’s because bulls are on top, optimistic that things are going well. When prices are going down, it’s because those pessimistic bears are ascendant. To work out whether you’re in the midst of a bull or a bear market, you’ll need some tools to analyze crowd behavior more closely. Chart analysis is one incredibly effective way to do this. Read on to learn more. Have you ever seen a chart of a stock, or an index like the S&P 500, and yet remained unsure of its meaning? With classical chart analysis, you’ll be able to identify price patterns and benefit from them. But first, you’ll need to understand how a bar chart is constructed. It all comes down to the following five elements: opening prices, closing prices, the highs of a bar, the lows of a bar and the distances between the highs and lows. The opening prices tend to show the amateurs’ opinion of the value, since they are often acting in the morning before going to work. The closing prices reflect the decisions of professional traders. If closing prices are higher than the opening prices, this means that professionals are probably more bullish than amateurs, and vice versa. That’s exactly the kind of knowledge you’ll need in order to discern whether you’re in a market of bulls or of bears. The high of each bar reflects the maximum power of bulls, while the low of each bar displays the maximum power of bears. This is something to keep in mind when deciding at what point in time to buy and sell your shares (which we’ll learn more about in the next blink). Finally, the distances between the highs and lows reflect the intensity of the conflict between bulls and bears. If you want to estimate activity in the market, it’s this distance you’ll need to pay attention to. An average-sized distance represents a cool market; a distance half the average size indicates a sleepy market; and a bar double the average size marks an overheating market. Slippage is normally lower in quiet markets, so avoid getting into the market when there is a huge discrepancy between prices, a clear indicator that the market is overheating. You’ve learned how to read a bar chart and what it tells you about the market. However, there are two more elements that a bar chart reveals, elements that will help you grasp the mood of a market. To find the first of these, we’ll need to examine the price level. When buying is so strong that it reverses or interrupts a downward price trend, we’re witnessing support. You can imagine support as the floor that you bounce a basketball on. Every time the ball hits the floor, it bounces back up. You can find a support level in a chart by connecting two or more lows on the chart with a horizontal line. A support level exists, because people in the market have memories. If the price of a stock was falling and stopped at a certain level and then increased, traders would remember this low level and be likely to buy when prices approach it again. When selling is so strong that it reverses or interrupts an uptrend, the market is demonstrating resistance. Imagine a ball being tossed up, hitting the ceiling and dropping down. In this example the ceiling would be the resistance level. Using chart analysis you can find resistance levels by connecting two or more highs in a chart with a horizontal line. From 1966 to 1982, there was a major resistance level for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (a major US Index). Every time there was an uptrend into the area between 950 and 1050, the uptrend was interrupted and reversed. Traders called this resistance zone “a graveyard in the sky” because it was so strong. Essentially, you should begin selling when you hit the resistance level – before prices go down – and buy at the support level – when prices are at their lowest. In fact, many traders usually buy at support and sell at resistance zones, which also helps entrench these levels even further. There are so many things you can trade: stocks, options, ETFs and futures, to name just a few. Each group has its benefits and drawbacks. Stocks are what we most commonly trade. They’re great for beginners, as they’re easy to understand. Yet this doesn’t mean that you can be careless when trading stocks. In fact, it’s crucial that you stay meticulous when deciding how many you try to trade. The author monitors only a single digit amount of stocks during the week, but some of his friends watch several dozen at a time. How much take on is up to you – just be sure you can manage it effectively. No matter what you choose to trade, there are always two criteria they should meet: liquidity and volatility. Liquidity is the average daily volume of traded shares. The higher the liquidity, the easier it’ll be to trade. The author himself learned how important liquidity is when he got stuck with 6,000 shares of a stock of which only 9,000 shares were traded per day. To get rid of them, he had to do several trades, paying commissions and slippage. To ensure you never find yourself in this position, concentrate only on stocks that are traded at a rate above a million per day. Volatility is average short-term movement in the price of the stock. The higher the volatility, the more opportunities there is to make money – and lose it, too! We can measure volatility with a beta, which compares the volatility of a certain stock to its benchmark, a general figure, such as a market index, that reflects the health of the market. For example, if you have a beta with a value of two, that means that if the benchmark rises five percent, stock is likely to rise ten percent, and vice versa when the benchmark falls. It’s advisable for beginners to focus on low betas, as this limits the amount you could lose when trading. What you want to trade depends on your preferences and skills, but always keep volatility and liquidity in mind. No matter how great your profits are in trading, without proper risk management, all your capital could disappear in minutes. If you want to be secure, you’ll need to follow two key rules. The first of these is the 2% rule. This prohibits you from risking more than 2 percent of your trading equity on a single trade. In order to implement this rule, you’ll need to take a few factors into account. We can illustrate this with an example. Say you have $50,000 of trading capital in your account. The 2% rule dictates that you can only risk $1,000 (=50,000 X 0.02) per trade. Now, suppose you want to buy a stock worth $50, and to limit your risk of losses, you set a so-called stop order at $48. A stop order means that when the price of the stock falls to a given amount, the stock is automatically sold. In our example, you risk $2 per share. If you are allowed to risk $1,000, you can buy a maximum of 500 shares. The 2% rule is one of the most effective ways of minimizing your losses. The second rule you need to implement is the 6% rule. This rule dictates that you can’t open any new trades for the rest of the month if your total losses in the month plus the risk in open trades reaches 6 percent of your trading capital. Let’s take a look at the 6% rule in action. Start by calculating this month’s total losses, then add your current risks in open trades. Using our earlier example, this risk is $1,000, or 2 percent (500 shares with a risk potential of $2 per share). Finally, add these two numbers together. If the sum equals 6 percent of your capital, you’d best abstain from opening new trades before the month is up! Know the saying “you can only improve what you can measure”? The same goes for trading, except it’s not just mere measuring that you should be doing. The cornerstone of successful trading is record keeping, because it helps you develop and maintain discipline. In trading, the importance of disciplined record keeping is comparable to weight control. If you don’t know your weight and don’t know if you are gaining or losing it, how can you get the results you want? The same is true for trading. If you don’t keep an eye on how much you are gaining or losing, how can you ensure you improve your strategies in the future? Maintaining a trade journal is one of the most effective ways to keep records. Reviewing your trades in your journal one or two months after you’ve sold will help you prepare for future sales. Oftentimes, trading signals that seemed vague and confusing at first become clear when you review them a month or two down the line. Journaling can also prevent emotional trading, as you’ll see for yourself how much feel-good trading costs you. And what’s more, you’re bound to find a pre-existing template online that suits you! One of the main things you should be looking for in your journal entries is your personal equity curve. This will help you determine whether you’re making money or losing money in the long-term, and reveal whether your trading system is up to scratch. If your equity curve shows a downtrend, it may be a call for you to pay closer attention to your system, or your discipline, to see what needs tightening up. The key message in this book: Success on the market is determined by knowledge, focus and discipline. With a firm understanding of the traps of individual and crowd psychology, and confidence in classical chart analysis, you’re well on your way to earning your living as a trader.  Actionable advice: Test the waters before you take the plunge! If you’re interested in trading, why not open a virtual portfolio as a test? If you think finance is something you’re interested in, you can prepare yourself by broadening your knowledge of it. This background reading will give you a head start as you embark on your career in trading, and may well prove helpful in other areas of your financial life, too.

There’s rent to pay, kids to feed and suddenly your car needs an expensive repair. And at the end of the month there is nothing left over to do the things you want to do.  What you need is a financial plan tailored to your life and needs. It might sound scary or boring, but, as these blinks will show you, making your own personal financial plan will not only take the stress out of your life, it can also be a lot of fun. And when you notice that a few simple changes will free up money to do the things that you truly value, you’ll find it easy to stick to the program and make even more changes. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to turn budgeting into a game; why you should give your Amazon shopping cart a break; and why you shouldn’t rely on CNBC for investment advice. The foundation of every successful financial plan is the answer to a simple question: Why is money really important for me? Take a moment and think about this question before reading on, and write down your answer at the top of a piece of paper. You’ll need it later. Asking why money is important to you helps you to define what you value, which in turn will help you develop a financial plan that fits your individual needs.  As an example, think about the last time you went to the doctor. Your doctor doesn’t give every patient the same medication. They first need to ask what’s wrong in order to determine a fitting treatment. The same goes for financial plans. Knowing why you value money will aid in the examination of your financial situation. Only then can you develop a “treatment” that will work for you. Someone who wants to save money to travel the world and someone who wants to have a secured pension will likely have financial plans that look totally different from one another. Whereas one might want to invest in an RV, the other might want to invest in a good pension fund. Knowing why you value money also helps you assess whether the way you spend your time reflects your values. Imagine that you value money because it gives you the financial freedom to spend more time with your family. Now imagine that you run an independent business and spend all weekend on Twitter trying to increase your followers to grow your personal brand. You spend so much time on Twitter that you interrupt dinnertime conversations with your family to reply to tweets and check your followers. Are you really living according to your values? Now that you’ve determined why money is important to you, it’s time to formulate some goals to guide your financial future. Think back 20 years: would you ever have predicted that free apps like Skype or WhatsApp would cause your phone bills to plummet? The future is unpredictable. Your financial plan, and the goals that support it, should be flexible enough to cope with this unpredictability.  The first step in developing your goals is accepting that it’s not always possible to predict the future. You can think of financial planning like planning your vacation. Even though you set some goals, like places to see or things to do, you should leave some room for the unexpected. For example, you can’t enjoy a bike ride and a picnic if there’s a storm outside. Why not alter your plan and visit a museum instead?  It’s the same with financial planning. Your goals aren’t set in stone, so be willing to alter them if you ever get off track.  Let’s say that one of your goals is to pay off your $40,000 student loan in three years. Suddenly, there’s a financial crisis that leaves you unable to save as much as you planned. Instead of sticking to your previous plan, you could readjust and settle on paying off $28,000 in the same amount of time. Once you’ve come to terms with the fact that the future is unpredictable, it’s time to start writing down some goals. But what should your goals be? Imagine this was your response to the why question: “Money is important because it will help me give my kids the best opportunities and keep them safe.” Some of your goals could be things like: In two years I want to have set aside enough money to co-finance my son’s studies Next year I’d like to send my daughter on a three-month foreign exchange trip  I want to set up some emergency funds in case my kids don’t find a job right out of college No matter what your goals are, remember: you can always adapt them as your situation changes.  Your values and goals serve as your guide no matter where you want to be financially. However, before you can actually make any decisions about where to take action, you first have to understand your current situation.  Having a clear understanding of your assets and liabilities will help you take the necessary steps to reach your goals.  But imagine that you don’t know – or don’t want to know – your exact financial situation. Without this information, how can you possibly know what you need to do to get where you want to be? To discern your current financial situation, make a simple balance sheet. Draw a T shape on a piece of paper, putting your assets, such as your investments and savings, on the left, and on the right your liabilities, such as your mortgage and debts. Simply subtract your liabilities from your assets to figure out your net worth. Write that above the T. Once everything has been laid out on the table, you’ll have a clear view of where you stand and can determine your first steps. For example, if you realize that you owe $5,000 in student loans, your first action might be to make a plan to pay them off.  Aside from being helpful in determining next steps, understanding your financial situation can relieve your financial anxiety and make it possible to take action. Imagine not being able to pay your mortgage, and hesitating to call your creditors for weeks. But once you finally call them, you discover how much you owe and are able to make a reasonable plan about how to move forward. Or you might realize that you still owe lots of money on a car you hardly ever use. Selling it could help you inch closer to freedom from debt.  Now that you understand the basics of setting up a financial plan, the following blinks will offer practical tips on how to spend and save money efficiently in order to free up resources to invest intelligently and achieve your goals. In essence, budgeting is about taking a good look at how you spend money and making adjustments in order to achieve your financial goals. To budget well, it’s crucial that you understand where you’re spending and whether your spending is in line with your goals and your values.  Many of us think that budgeting and tracking expenses is tedious and boring, more like a punishment for those who lack discipline than a tool of the financially successful. In reality, financial success is only really possible if you budget well, tracking how you spend your money, measuring that against your goals and values and adjusting accordingly.  For instance, if one of your goals is to travel more but you spend 30 percent of your income on partying and fine dining, financing your trip to Vietnam is going to be difficult. You’ll have to make some changes to turn this dream into a reality. Begin by making a list of your fixed monthly expenses, looking for places to cut or shift costs. Try looking at it as a game or challenge. Try to make a conscious effort to spend less money. Instead of using public transport, take your bike to work. Instead of eating out for lunch, pack sandwiches. Instead of going to the movies, take a walk through your neighborhood and discover places you’ve never paid attention to before. Once every two months, tot up how many days you were successful. Another challenge you could try is to make as few transactions as possible in a week. If you have a spouse or partner, you can even compete against each other. If your vice is impulse-buying books on Amazon, then next time you fill your virtual cart, leave it for a few days and then check if you really want those books after all. Not only are these challenges fun, they also help you to realign your spending habits and make clear which things you really need to spend your money on and which things are superfluous. Contrary to popular wisdom, rules of thumb like saving such-and-such a percentage of your income each month aren’t all that useful in achieving your financial goals. In the same way that your financial plan is personal, your savings plan should be too. The goal should be to save as much as you possibly can – an amount that will depend on your unique situation. Once you’ve determined how much you can save, you can make life a lot simpler by automating the process. Let’s say you can afford to save $300 a month. By automating the transaction, you get to spend less time thinking about whether to spend or save. You might eventually forget about it altogether, and be pleasantly surprised that your savings have grown years later.  In addition to saving, you should be paying off your debts, starting with the one with the highest interest rate. Paying off debts is essentially an investment in your financial future. If you’re racking up debt on your credit card for things that don’t align with your goals, then you’re ensuring that you’ll be busy paying interest on your debts down the line rather than saving for what you actually want to do. In essence, you’re saying “no” to the goals you set and “yes” to something else. If this “something else” is really important, you might want to revise your goals. You’ve now identified where your money is coming from, how you spend it, and you have a plan to pay off your debts. The final blink will look at the last step in your financial plan: investments. There are innumerable businesses, initiatives and institutions that promise a return on investment if you fork out some money. So how should you know where to invest? Should you follow the advice of your friends, family or authoritative-sounding finance people on CNBC? You could, but then you’d be speculating and not really investing, i.e., making investment decisions with your gut rather than your head. To make the best investments, you need to look at investment as a science.  A good way to avoid financial mistakes and risk is by consulting academic journals and other peer-reviewed publications about investing. People have been trying to make their money grow for a long time, and experts have been studying investment for years. Predicting how a stock will perform in the future is a complex business, certainly not one that intuition alone will help you decipher.  Before you make any investments, study them as if you were a scientist. Otherwise you might make decisions that you later regret.  In addition to treating investment like a science, it’s important to mitigate risk by diversifying your portfolio, or spreading it over many different types of stocks. No single stock is going to be your golden ticket to wealth, and if such a stock exists, you can’t count on finding it. How many of us could have predicted that Facebook would become this big when it first went public? How many of us could have predicted the financial crisis of 2008? Instead of trying to find that miracle stock, you should instead spread your risk over as many sectors as possible. While some of them might lose value, others might appreciate, helping to balance out any potential losses.  Your portfolio should be quite mixed, including national and international companies, big and small in many different sectors. This way, you have the best chance of turning a profit and reaching your financial goals. The key message in this book: A financial plan begins when you ask yourself why money is important to you and create goals that reflect your answer. After that, it’s a simple matter of assessing your spending, savings and investment and making adjustments that put you on track to achieve those goals. Actionable advice: Talk about finances with your partner. If you share finances with a spouse or a partner it’s important for them to participate in financial planning in order to see which of your values overlap and which are incompatible. This way, the two of you can work toward a financial future that’s a win–win for everyone.

Rather than offering a manual with step-by-step instructions, these blinks outline a thought-provoking and sometimes controversial investment philosophy. In these blinks, you’ll learn: Why most commonly-held ideas pertaining to the current market are usually wrong. Why market forecasts are typically useless, even when they’re right. Why psychology plays such a powerful role in market cycles. Why a dumb financial decision can sometimes make an investor look like a genius. If you want to become a successful investor, you need solid grounding in the basics. So let’s start with a simple definition: investing consists of putting money into assets and expecting an increase in value. Taking it a step further, successful investing means buying mispriced assets (assets that are priced too low), selling them later at a higher price and earning a profit. It sounds simple, but mispricings are rare. Why? Because most of the time, there are thousands of participants actively gathering information about various assets and evaluating them diligently. When this thorough assessment is indeed the case, the asset’s price doesn’t stray far from its intrinsic value – that is, the price the asset is actually worth. And when an asset is priced appropriately, which is typically the case, it’s hard to profit from it. Still, in practice, mispricings do occur. For example, in January 2000, shares of Yahoo sold at $237 apiece. But then by April, share prices had fallen to $11. If you had owned the stock, your investment would have suffered massive losses. And how do we account for this sizable fluctuation? Well, the price must have been wrong on at least one of these occasions. In general, mispricings make profits and losses possible in a big way. But as we mentioned, detecting these mispricings is a difficult task. So if your investment goal is to earn higher-than-average returns, your thinking has to be different and better than everyone else’s. This is called second-level thinking, and it works like this: first-level thinking says, “It’s a good company; let’s buy the stock.” Second-level thinking goes beyond the conventional wisdom by saying, “It’s a good company but everyone thinks that, so the stock is probably overrated and overpriced; let’s sell.” This approach is so effective because it acknowledges the fact that all the investors put together actually make the market. Second-level thinking takes all these other investors into account in order to beat the market, not just submit to it. The oldest rule in investing is also the simplest: “Buy low, sell high.” That might seem blindingly obvious, until you try to put it in practice. And then you start to wonder, what’s low and what’s high? To answer that, there has to be some objective standard. And for our purposes, the most useful one is the asset’s intrinsic value. In fact, coming up with an accurate estimate of intrinsic value is the ideal starting point for successful investing. You would do this by analyzing a company’s general attributes, which are called fundamentals. Fundamentals analysis involves asking questions pertaining to the company’s economic well-being — such as, is the company earning a profit? Can it repay its debts? Making this kind of accurate estimate of intrinsic value is the cornerstone of successful investing, because it will then allow you to spot (and buy) assets when the current price is lower than their intrinsic value. The relationship between current price and intrinsic value is crucial, and yet many overlook it. Some people say, “We only buy asset A,” or “A is a superior asset class.” These statements sound a lot like, “We’d buy this asset at any price.” But that’s not a smart way to make financial decisions. In other words, if someone offered to sell you her car, you’d find out the price before buying it. It works the same way with assets. So, to be sure that the price is right in relation to the asset’s value, a prospective buyer should also look at two other factors: psychology and technicals. Technicals have nothing to do with value. They occur, for example, when a market crashes and, in order to avoid total bankruptcy, investors sell regardless of price. Psychological factors, like greed or fear, also exert a powerful influence on price. Consider collective fear of buying, which occurs sometimes during economic instability; since no one buys it, the asset’s price is too low relative to its intrinsic value. Investing requires us to deal with the future. But since we can’t predict what will happen with any real certainty, risk is unavoidable. Investment risk is always present, even when it’s hard to recognize. This is especially true when prices are high, since they’re ever more likely to fall. High prices are due to excessive optimism and insufficient skepticism that prices will remain high. So perhaps paradoxically, the prime element of risk creation is the belief that risk is low – maybe even non-existent. But this isn’t actually true. In fact, as long as prices can fall, risk persists. And as we discussed above, in some ways risk becomes even more dangerous in good times, when the possibility of loss is hardest to imagine. For example, it’s hard to truly estimate the risk of buying a home in California. The house may or may not have construction flaws that would cause it to collapse due to an earthquake. Is there a way to find out if this is the case? Wait around for an earthquake, and see if the house collapses. This instance illustrates a general principle: Risk is only really observable when negative events create great losses. And yet, as we outlined above, risk is an unavoidable aspect of the investment process. Thus, serious risk assessment is necessary to make wise investment decisions. Since most of us are naturally risk averse, whenever we’re thinking about taking an investment, we have to consider whether it justifies the risk. Risk assessment is especially important because ultimately, the amount of money you gain or lose in a particular investment doesn’t say anything about the level of risk you took initially. That’s why the risk has to be assessed on its own – apart from the investment’s intrinsic value or any other factors. Although there are very few sure things, when it comes to the world of investments, there are two rules we can always count on. Rule number one: Most things are cyclical, due to the nature of humanity. Mechanical things move in a straight line, but humans don’t. People are emotional, inconsistent and mutable. And more specifically, when investors become emotional, it creates cyclical patterns in markets. Consider the credit cycle – which is the increase and decrease of access to credit over time. During a period of prosperity, when bad news is scarce, risk awareness totally disappears. As a result, banks give access to credit with very low restrictions. In extreme instances, banks will even finance borrowers that aren’t worthy of being financed. Then, when losses occur, banks get discouraged. Risk awareness rises, and along with it, so do credit restrictions. Starved for capital and with a lack of credit, some companies face bankruptcy. And then at that point, the process reverses: with fewer competitors offering customers lines of credit, banks can demand high percentage returns and better creditworthiness. Over time, better standards lead to prosperity and on it goes, ad infinitum. This scenario exemplifies why processes involving humans tend to be cyclical. This leads us to rule number two: Some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss arise when others forget about rule number one. Ignoring the cyclical nature of markets and extrapolating trends is dangerous from an investment standpoint. And in fact, this kind of thinking is precisely what leads to bubbles: Buyers don’t worry about whether a stock is overpriced because they’re so sure that someone else will buy it from them. But eventually, the cycle reverses and the market crashes. When this happens, buyers may be forced to sell regardless of price in order to avoid bankruptcy. And for an investor, this is the perfect moment of opportunity: There’s no better investment than buying from someone who has to sell, regardless of price, during a crash. Most investors tend to follow the trends. Superior investors, however, do the exact opposite. In fact, bucking trends is the key to successful investment, because crowds make errors with an almost mathematical regularity, creating insane market turbulence. Markets swing from overpriced to underpriced constantly: When more people want to buy than sell, the market rises; when the market rises, even more people become buyers, inflating the market even more. The value of the asset hasn’t changed, but the cost has gone up immensely. Figuratively speaking, the top of the market occurs when the last person buys the stock. At this point, the market cannot climb any higher, so it begins to plummet as soon as one of the buyers moves to sell her stock. The cause of these wild extremes? The so-called wisdom of the crowd, which creates (and inflates) these overpriced or underpriced assets. For this reason, the most profitable investment decisions are by definition contrarian: Buy when everyone else sells and vice versa. Bargains are an investment holy grail and since, as outlined above, they’re usually based on irrationality or an incomplete understanding of the market, a good place to start looking for them is among assets that are controversial or scary, unpopular or unknown. Make it your goal to find underpriced assets which are perceived to be considerably worse than what they really are. In other words, if nobody owns something, demand for it can only go up. And if the asset goes from taboo to even just tolerated, it will perform well for you. Although it might feel uncomfortable at first, the best opportunities exist where others wouldn’t dare go. If you follow market forecasts, then you know that these investing tools can sometimes be right. However, the key question isn’t whether they’re sometimes right, but whether forecasts consistently provide actionable and valuable information. And frankly, the answer is no – market forecasts are of little value. You might notice that sometimes when people predict the future, it looks like the recent past. That doesn’t mean the prediction is wrong; in fact, most of the the time future repeats the past. But once in a while, things turn out very differently. Predictions about market movements are most useful when they correctly anticipate real change, since it’s only at these moments that we stand to lose or earn a lot of money. But unfortunately, forecasts are least likely to correctly predict real market change. Consider the fact that few forecasts correctly predicted the global credit crisis and massive economic meltdown of 2008. A year later, forecasters were equally confounded by the first signs of economic recovery. Therefore, since forecasts are of little value, investors need to have a good sense of the present market situation. No one can predict the future, but smart investors will work to understand the given moment in terms of market cycles. Figuring out where we stand in a market cycle gives us valuable insight into future events, but it doesn’t mean we can ever know exactly what’s coming next. It’s impossible to know future, but it’s not that hard to understand the present. All we need to do is “take the market’s temperature,” so to speak. We might ask: are investors optimistic or pessimistic? Does the media say we should buy stock, or avoid the market altogether? These valuable questions will help you determine a smart course of action When it comes to analyzing the financial market, plenty of people are going to follow similar lines of reasoning and reach similar conclusions. And yet, people who arrive at the exact same conclusion often behave differently. That’s because psychological factors don’t influence everyone the same way. In fact, some of the biggest investment errors come from these psychological factors, like greed, fear, ego and envy. These forces can drive us to pursue high returns by accepting high levels of risk. Greed is perhaps the most powerful of these psychological forces. It’s strong enough to vanquish our aversion to risk, caution and other elements that usually keep us out of trouble financially. Like greed, fear can also act powerfully, causing us to make serious investment errors. Although you might think this emotion corresponds to risk aversion, in fact, fear can manifest as panic, preventing us from taking constructive and necessary action when we should. In addition to these psychological sources of error, investors can also make analytical mistakes. These are more straightforward, occurring when we don’t have enough information, applying the wrong analytical processes, making computational errors or accidentally omitting something pertinent. Analytical mistakes are relatively easy to avoid — it’s a matter of being careful. Furthermore, in order to achieve investment success, we must also avoid making the kinds of psychological errors we outlined above. Why are these emotional factors so sticky? Investment usually involves high levels of risk, especially if we’re seeking high returns. And striving for such great success sometimes results in failure, which can be crippling. On the other hand, trying to avoid losses by taking on less risk might not lead to astounding returns, but it won’t bankrupt you. And ultimately, if you care about protecting your money, trying to avoid losses is better than striving for phenomenal results. Every now and then, someone takes a huge risk that pays off. And although it’s great to be on the receiving end of such a scenario, it’s worth remembering that winning a gamble is the result of luck and boldness, not skill. Indeed, luck plays a huge part in investment. When it comes to the markets, a great deal of success is a matter of being in the right place at the right time. And moreover, success can also entail being in the right place for the wrong reasons. In fact, outcomes often hinge on totally random events. For example, someone buys a stock because she expects a certain development; that development doesn’t occur, but the stock performs well anyway – which makes the investor look super insightful, even though she was just lucky. As you can see, it’s important to create an investment approach that anticipates random events, whether lucky or unlucky. That’s why investors should commit to a strategy that will serve them through a variety of scenarios. This consists of finding the right balance between offensive and defensive investment tactics. An offensive tactic means accepting high levels of risk in pursuit of gains; on the other hand, defensive tactics build on the avoidance of losses, rather than the risk for profits. Since few people have the ability to switch tactics to match market conditions on a timely basis, a mix of these two approaches is what will best serve you through a variety of scenarios. The key message in this book: Successful investing requires a deep understanding of both the technical and psychological forces that create market cycles. There are many different elements in play, including plenty of risk; thus, dealing with risk is a crucial part of the investment process. Ultimately, successful investing requires us to recognize and avoid common pitfalls.   Actionable advice: Before making any investment decision, start by “taking the market’s temperature.” The next time you sit down with your financial portfolio, ask yourself key questions to understand the current moment in the market. You might ask: are investors optimistic or pessimistic? Does the media say we should buy lots of stocks, or avoid the market altogether? These kinds of questions will give you insight into the market’s possible future course – if things are up right now, then there’s a high likelihood they’ll come down, and vice versa. Understanding this should help you determine a smart course of action with regards to your own investments.

With their smartphones, iPods, consoles and designer gear, they seem to have it all. To someone who grew up a decade or so ago, today’s kids are materialistic, spoiled even. Why is this? These blinks show you where this materialism has come from. Incredibly it doesn’t come from parents putting too much consideration on money, but from too little talk about it. Rather than educating their offspring about the value – and cost – of money, parents simply buy them whatever they desire. We need to change this if we want the next generation to be full of more rounded, less spoiled individuals. So let’s get blinking and learn how we can turn things around. In these blinks you’ll discover why children should start working as soon as they are able; why if your child can count they are old enough for an allowance; and why you shouldn’t pay your children for doing chores. What would you say is the most unlikeable trait of kids today? Some parents would say stupidity, un-exceptionality and even violence. But the most common answer by far is that they’re spoiled. Oftentimes when people think “spoiled” their next thought is “money.” This leads many parents to believe that focusing on money when raising their kids will spoil them. But this simply isn’t the case. By definition, being spoiled has little to do with money. Actually, there are four basic qualities that all spoiled children have in common. First, they tend to have practically no chores, tasks or responsibilities to others. Second, they don’t have to follow rules or adhere to schedules. Third, they receive too much time and attention from their parents. And fourth, they often have many material possessions. With the exception of the last point, none of these have anything to do with money. In fact, money, whether an education in it, or responsibility for it, can actually help prevent your kids from growing up spoiled. Because children who learn about money also learn thrift, curiosity, generosity and patience – qualities that most would consider the opposite of “spoiled.” For instance, what better way to teach generosity than by giving the opportunity to give? Not just that, you can also promote patience and thrift by encouraging children to save money or learn to make do with the money they have. Unfortunately today, talking to children about money is taboo. Why? Because we’re embarrassed to discuss our wealth or how it compares to that of our neighbors with anyone, much less our children. So we put the topic off-limits. This in turn denies kids the opportunity to learn about money and they become spoiled. In order to ensure your kids grow up to be well-rounded people it’s essential to break down these barriers. But how? So an education in money is essential to raising a well-grounded child, but how can you achieve that? Oftentimes a child will raise the topic of money themselves. Maybe their classmate made a comment that got them interested or they overheard you and your partner discussing the subject. However it happened, something piqued their interest and they want to know more. A common reaction to your child asking you questions like “how much do you earn?” is embarrassment. What if they compared your income to those of their friends’ parents or started asking for more expensive gifts? But instead of brushing the question away, the best thing to do is to ask a question in response. Ask them, “why do you want to know?” Here’s why. Many times children who enquire about money are interested in the subject for a specific reason. For instance, the question “are we poor?” could be related to a fear of moving houses. While the question “are we rich?” could stem from a compassionate desire to buy something for a friend who can’t afford it. Once you’ve established why the child is asking the questions, it’s essential to give them an honest answer, never lying or sugarcoating your response. But being open with your kids about money isn’t enough. You’ll also need to involve them in financial decisions. How? You can show them bills to explain how everything you do requires money. Or, when you pay for something, ask your child to guess its cost and correct them if they’re wrong. This second tip is helpful because kids have little understanding of money’s value. For instance, they might think that a new car costs $100. By showing your children the real costs of things you help them understand what money is actually worth. Did your parents give you spending money as a child? Can you remember how much? Many kids receive an allowance and their parents are doing precisely the right thing. That’s because allowances are excellent practice for children to learn about money and how to spend it. So as soon as your child can count, start giving them a small sum – for instance, $1 per week. But never base your child’s allowance on the chores they do. Why? Because it’s important for kids to know that household responsibilities like washing the dishes are done because they need to be, not because of a financial incentive. If your child protests, remind them that you don’t get paid for these tasks either. Once you’ve given your child an allowance that’s independent of their chores let them spend it how they wish, allowing them to make mistakes. If your kid is like most kids they’ll spend their money on useless rubbish like too much candy, the latest fads and cheap plastic toys. It’s in your best interest to let your child make these mistakes knowing that with every dollar they waste they’re learning the importance of budgeting. But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t talk to your kids about their spending habits. A good strategy is to explain to your child the various purchase options they have and the difference between what they want and what they need.  For instance, they can buy the expensive new boots that everyone at school has, or they can buy the durable ones that will last for years longer. Between your explanation and your child’s practice, they’re sure to become better budgeters. As your child gets used to spending their allowance you should raise it slowly, thereby incrementally increasing the amount of responsibility they have. We’ve all seen the heart-warming joy in a child’s eyes when they’re handed the toy they wanted so badly. But while giving to children feels good for both parent and kid alike, it can be tempting to give too much. As parents, it’s easy to think that your children always need more things to fit in with their peers. Therefore, spending money on your kids can seem like a straightforward way to help them gain acceptance. This concept is known as full provisioning and its logic works like this: If your child’s friends have TVs in their bedrooms, your child needs one too. If everyone at school has a new smartphone, your kid is entitled to the same. If you don’t buy your children what the other kids have won’t they be bullied and alienated from their peers? While the temptation to give your kids everything is palpable, by doing so you’re training them to define themselves through their possessions. On the other hand, children who don’t get everything they want at the drop of a hat learn patience through waiting. But how can you strike a balance between teaching your child patience and ensuring they aren’t shunned by their peers? Try the Dewey rule, which says that your child should be in the 30th percentile of stuff. This means that while they won’t be the first of their friends to get a new gadget and won’t get things as soon as they ask for them, they will eventually get some of what they want. In other words, if they’re in the 30th percentile, they’ll be the seventh of ten to get that gadget. This isn’t a hard and fast rule but instead works by teaching kids the importance of waiting for things. This will help them think more about what they ask for and enjoy things more when they finally receive them. While you can’t always say no to your kids, it’s important to remember that love can’t be bought. As a parent, it’s your job to find a happy medium. Do you ever consider what life was like for kids in the past? If you go back just a century and a half most children’s lives were pretty terrible. Instead of playing or going to school, they worked long shifts at backbreaking jobs. Thankfully, many countries now have laws prohibiting child labor. After all, childhood should be about learning and enjoyment. But maybe we’ve gone a bit too far in ensuring kids don’t work. Many parents today believe their children shouldn’t work at all. And this leads to their kids missing out on beneficial opportunities. How? Safe and comfortable work can teach children a variety of skills that will aid them later in life. For instance, just experiencing a work environment builds communication skills as you speak with colleagues and customers. Working also teaches reliability as well as responsibility since you’re required to arrive on time and do a good job. Lessons like these will give your child a leg up when they enter the adult workforce. Remember, giving your child work experience doesn’t require them to be in a professional setting. Making your kid responsible for additional household chores can provide the same learning experience. So working teaches kids helpful lessons, but the other obvious benefit to your child getting a job is the ability to earn spending money of their own. With a regular income your child can purchase their own things, taking the pressure off you to buy them stuff. Not just that, but spending cash they’ve worked hard for helps instill the value of money in children. Because they’re much less likely to waste money they’ve earned than money they’ve been handed. Your child might even help make purchases that you alone could never afford for them, like a college education, a car or even a horse. But most importantly, experience of work is a major boost to a child’s modesty and independence. The most important value to instill in your kids is generosity. That’s because people who are willing to give to others certainly cannot be considered spoiled themselves. You can nudge your child in the right direction by encouraging them to be generous when they can. How? Just take a look at the example of California mother Olivia Higgins. Her two kids were always asking her about the homeless, why they existed and why the family didn’t give them any money. It’s actually quite common for kids to ask these questions, and just as common that parents are too embarrassed to honestly answer them. But Higgins is different. She seized on this as a golden opportunity to teach generosity. Instead of simply giving her kids money to hand out she came up with the idea of donating “giving bags” comprised of various provisions. The kids were involved in planning the contents of the bags and the whole family went around distributing them. Can you think of a better way to get into the giving mind-set? But kids also need to understand their own privilege and that there are others with much less than themselves. Teaching children perspective is essential, but as we know, most parents are too embarrassed to talk about wealth and social class. You can give your kids perspective by honestly telling them how much wealth your family has and getting them to volunteer to help the less fortunate. You don’t need to do anything huge like sending them to Africa to build schools. In fact, simple efforts like working in a soup kitchen or homeless shelter can offer the same enlightenment and insights. The key message in this book: Money really does make the world go round, and a financial education doesn’t just fill a bank account – it also determines the kind of person one becomes. So, in order to raise well-rounded, generous and enlightened children it’s necessary to be open and honest about money. Because the only way children will learn the value, importance and limits of money is through a hands-on education.  Actionable advice: Limit your child’s desire for material possessions by limiting their TV time. One of the most common ways for children to learn about and desire toys, clothes and all manner of purchasable items is through advertisements seen on television. By monitoring your child’s TV consumption you can control the amount of advertisements they see and curb their desire for stuff.

Take someone like Dr. Dre, who started as a DJ in Los Angeles’s South Central district, moved on to become a successful producer and is now the owner of a headphone empire, as well as a high-ranking executive at Apple Music. Stories like his can be inspiring, but are also easily dismissed as something that only a happy few can achieve – specifically, those with exceptional talent and timing. But there is also power to be found in being broke. These blinks will offer insights into how being broke can help us achieve greatness, based on the experience of self-made men and women. In these blinks, you’ll find out how a poor immigrant turned an ice cream truck into a restaurant empire; why trying to reach new customer demographics can be a bad thing; and which successful computer company was founded by a guy who couldn’t operate a computer. Have you ever had to come up with something for dinner when you’re stuck with only two or three ingredients? If so, you might remember that limitations like this can often result in some of the tastiest meals. This is just one example of the truth in the old saying, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” Or, to put it another way, being short on resources can generate real creativity and inspiration that would otherwise never emerge. Having a million dollars to launch a business doesn’t mean it will be successful. On the contrary, already being rich can take away the passion and innovation that long-term success requires.   But with an empty bank account, it’s clear that your only chance for success is to dig deep and become innovative. It’s like being a basketball player who has one shot to win the game, but they’re at half-court with only a second left on the clock; there’s no other option but to go for it and take the spectacular shot. It’s also important to realize that innovation comes from a singular vision that starts from the bottom up, not the top down. It doesn’t matter if it’s entertainment, fashion or technology, ideas grow organically from the ground up – they aren’t inspired by executives dumping a bunch of money on a project. And when an idea really takes off, it’s usually because people respond enthusiastically to something real and authentic. Take Art Basel, for example, one of the world’s biggest art fairs, which takes place in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Miami Beach. While it has many established artists on display, many visitors get more excited about the unfunded street artists who are seen as being more genuine and “authentic.” This played a key part in coauthor Daymond John’s success with FUBU, which stands for For Us, By Us. The clothing line was inspired by the way real people in the streets were dressing, not by designer studios. You can also think of your brand as a personal relationship with your customer; like any good relationship, it has to be built on solid foundations. So be true to yourself – otherwise, the relationship is doomed to fail. If you’re familiar with the Rocky movies, you know that Rocky’s career falls apart when he lets his success get to his head and starts throwing money around. To get back on top, he realizes that he needs to rediscover his passion and hunger to win. A similar principle applies to business, as being hungry can keep you focused on your growth and help you stay realistic about what’s within reach. Just look at Capital One bank’s Small Business Confidence Score. This score is determined by a number of questions about a business's hiring plans, future outlook and the current economic situation. What the scores show are that overall confidence is at its highest rate since the 2008 recession, and that’s because small, hungry business owners know how to stick to business plans and use small steps to make great strides. A great way to stay hungry and successful is to think like a shark by knowing your waters while keeping focused on your target. On ABC’s reality TV show Shark Tank, one entrepreneur after another pitches their product or idea to investors. And if there’s one thing the show teaches, it’s that investors want to hear that an entrepreneur has a clear understanding of both their market and their goals. In one case, the show’s investors rejected an affordable athletic shoe company called Forus because the entrepreneurs had their target market down, but still wanted to expand in a way that took them well outside that market. With this in mind, an investment would have done them a disservice by encouraging them to focus on the wrong demographics. This is why an entrepreneur who uses the trunk of their car to sell a cheap product might have a better chance with an investor. If they can sell 50 units in under five minutes, it proves that they have a perfect understanding of their market. Some people are born with certain advantages while others start out at a disadvantage – but even if you have to work harder than others just to get on equal footing, don’t let it get you down. Being at a disadvantage and having few resources is actually a proven a recipe for success. In fact, immigrants to the United States are twice as likely as US citizens to start their own business. Rocky Aoki came to the United States from Japan in the 1960s, and in order to pay for his restaurant management classes, he rented an ice cream truck that he drove around New York City. He eventually saved up $10,000, which helped convince his father to invest in his restaurant, which went on to become the popular Japanese restaurant chain, Benihana. Rocky wanted his son, electronic dance musician Steve Aoki, to find his own success without relying on Rocky’s money. So, when Steve was 19 years old, he used the $400 he had to help start a music label by the name of Dim Mak Records with his friends. Their office was his apartment, which was regularly packed with up to 13 interns. Steve and his friends would self-produce a seven-inch single and sell it out of the back of their car after Steve’s DJ gigs until they could afford to make another one. While Steve did eventually max out ten different credit cards, today he’s a hugely popular musician with a successful label and lifestyle brand. As the Aokis show us, sometimes you have more resources at your disposal than you may think. If you’re a homeowner, you might have equity in your house that you can invest. But if you’ve taken out a loan, make sure you put money aside so you can make payments until your business starts earning money. Extra money can also come from small things you don’t need. If your car is just sitting in a garage every day, maybe you can sell it, like Steve Jobs did with his car to help buy the components for the first Apple computer. It may be that not everyone will notice or appreciate your authenticity, but it’s important to stick to your guns nevertheless. For instance, Acacia Brinley was recognized for her trendsetting Tumblr page, but her posts received a fair amount of negative feedback as well. Even so, the “selfie queen” of social media didn’t let this stop her. Remember that you don’t need to please everyone; it’s far more important that you remain true to yourself. Being broke only means you can't spend money to make things look fancy. Instead, use the Power of Broke and the fact that you’re in a can’t-lose situation to let your personality shine through. When Daymond John started FUBU, he knew he was going to be competing for shelf space with other clothing lines. But through his brand, he could show how much his community and clothing meant to him. And it didn’t take any extra money to do so. In fact, John used the Power of Broke, which forced him to spend very little money extremely wisely, to display his authenticity to the black community. John was one of the first designers to give his clothes away to hip-hop artists, who in turn wore them in music videos and helped solidify FUBU’s place in the fashion world. John then focused on Black Entertainment Television (BET), a US cable network that focuses on the black community. This way, John could reach his target audience easily, cheaply and directly. Since the Nielsen ratings company used very few black households to measure ratings when John started out, BET appeared to have a very low amount of viewers, so they charged very little for advertising. This worked in FUBU’s favor, as it allowed the brand to reach a wide audience for very little money. This is the kind of opportunity that you should keep an eye out for when things are looking bleak – one that allows you to stay in your market and stay authentic. Too many companies have gotten used to the idea of using “other people’s money” to do business. And though the thought of funding might sound appealing, there is such a thing as too much help. When you consider looking for investors, make sure you don’t risk losing control of your business. Bringing an investor on board means giving up a percentage of your business, which could also mean cutting into your already small profits or growing more quickly than you can handle.   The better kind of growth is one that is slow, profitable and under your control. Furthermore, bringing in outside capital also means having to rewrite your business plan, which can cause you to lose focus as well as control. Instead, be like Gigi Butler and stick to your vision, even when funding is nowhere to be found. Butler was determined to open a cupcake shop in Nashville, even when banks thought she was crazy and refused to give her a dime. Butler’s prior employment was as a cleaning lady for Nashville’s upper crust, so no one was willing to help fund her dream. But after maxing out credit cards and emptying her bank account down to her last 30 dollars, Gigi’s Cupcakes was finally open for business. And, sure enough, customers lined up out the door. Not only was Butler able to pay off her credit card debt, she maintained total control over her business and her profits. Today, there are Gigi’s Cupcakes locations in 24 states with $35 million in annual sales. Sometimes debt is impossible to avoid, so don’t let it get in the way of your vision. When you start turning a profit, you might be tempted to put it back into your business, or simply to enjoy it. But the smartest thing to do is to pay off your debts so that interest rates don’t eat away at your earnings and your accounts can start looking healthy and prosperous. Far too many businesses have gone under because of debt that got out of hand, so don’t be one of them. So far, we’ve seen how the Power of Broke can be applied to give hungry and focused entrepreneurs a leg up in the business world – but these same principles can be used by the major players as well. After all, most big corporations started out as small businesses, and they should all continue to use the same strategies that got them to where they are today. Yet, when companies get rich, they tend to start throwing money at problems rather than coming up with creative solutions. Take marketing, for instance; you could easily throw away millions on ad campaigns and forget about using free or low-cost resources like social media. One can only wonder why 38 percent of the current Fortune 500 companies don’t have an active Twitter account. Let’s look at a smart campaign from years ago, before the era of social media: General Mills, a company with an enormous marketing budget, wanted to reintroduce its struggling Nature Valley granola bars. Even though they could have spent millions putting ads in every grocery store, they stayed tightly focused and targeted places with active young clients, such as ski resorts and outdoor gear shops. Since then, Nature Valley has gone on to be one of General Mills’ top-selling brands. The Power of Broke can also be applied to an entire industry. At the start of 1970, cigarette advertising was everywhere in the United States, from radio and television ads to billboards and magazines, featuring beloved icons like the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel. Later in the year, however, the US government announced its intention to tighten advertising restrictions for tobacco companies; meanwhile, Chinese cigarette companies were planning on making their first foray into the American market. Rather than throwing money and lobbyists at this potential problem, the American tobacco industry saw an opportunity that wouldn’t cost a penny: they accepted the government’s advertising restrictions. The US brands knew they already had a strong hold on the market, and they also knew that without billboards and TV commercials, the new foreign brands wouldn’t stand a chance. Coca-Cola has been around so long that you can be forgiven for thinking it’s always been a success. But like any other global brand, it had to start somewhere. It’s possible to pinpoint four different phases that you need to get through patiently before your brand can go global. The first stage is the item, which is your product in its most basic form: no label, no marketing, nothing but a product that satisfies a need. So you might have a coffee maker that doesn’t even have a logo or name yet. The second stage is the label, which is when you give your product a name that sets it apart and makes it memorable. This way, after customers see it for the first time, they’ll know to ask for it by name the next time they’re in the market. The third stage is the brand, at which point you create a logo for better label recognition, as well as an identifiable style around your product. This stage accounts for the money spent on advertising and marketing, ensuring that people will seek out the product and will easily spot it on a crowded shelf. The fourth and final stage is the lifestyle, which is when your brand has grown to the point that customers have come to expect a certain level of quality and experience. This is the stage at which a product can become a status symbol, as is the case with Nike, Apple and FUBU. By leveraging the Power of Broke in each of these phases, companies have a greater chance of making it. As your product moves through these stages, you might encounter some sort of crisis, and this is when you’ll need to be patient. As the Harvard Business Review confirms, businesses that survive recessions do so by cutting costs and continuing to invest in growth, which you might do by, say, increasing funding to your research and development department. This way, you’ll be prepared to launch when the inevitable upswing comes around. The office supply chain Staples made it through the 2000 recession by shutting down underperforming stores, while increasing its overall workforce by ten percent. When the recession ended, Staples had actually become more profitable than it had been beforehand. These days, remarkable technological advances are a seemingly everyday occurrence. It’s a great time for small businesses because it’s easier than ever for them to get the funding they need. For starters, the cost of technology is extremely low. Every year, it gets cheaper and easier to maintain a website and store massive amounts of data online, which makes it less risky and costly to take potentially lucrative chances. Other great tools for small businesses are crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which allow entrepreneurs to raise money for their ideas while maintaining strict control. Honey Flow is just one example of a crowdfunding success. The company posted a five-minute video to Indiegogo about their dream to start an innovative beekeeping and honey-extracting business. They had hoped to raise $70,000 to make it to the label phase, but ended up raising an astounding $12 million, becoming the most successful Indiegogo campaign ever. Today, it’s easier than ever to turn creativity into success, even if you’re not particularly skilled. FUBU’s Daymond John couldn’t draw or sew anything more than a straight line, but it didn’t keep him from starting a clothing line. Even short basketball players who seemingly can’t compete with their taller peers can end up having successful careers by using their speed and agility to their advantage, or perhaps by managing or coaching a team if they’re passionate enough about the sport. But one of the best paths to success is to come up with creative solutions for those who need help doing something. Michael Dell wasn’t a computer genius; on the contrary, he started Dell Computers with the goal of coming up with a computer that would be more user-friendly. You don’t need to be a rich genius to become a successful entrepreneur. With the Power of Broke, all you need is some creativity to find the right idea, and a willingness to embrace change and overcome the challenges along the way. With these traits in place, there’s nothing to lose – and no limit to your possibilities. The key message in this book: It doesn’t take a lot of money to launch a business. In fact, not having money forces budding entrepreneurs to rise to the challenge with creative and innovative solutions that otherwise may not have occurred to them. There will always be challenges in the business world, but you can use the Power of Broke to stay prepared for anything that might come your way. Actionable advice: Follow Daymond John’s Shark Points for Success: Define your goal so you know where you’re headed. Do your homework: analytics are key, as is knowing the competition. Be passionate about what you do. You are the brand, so be aware of how you carry yourself. Keep moving forward, keep scheming and always be ready to challenge your competitors. Got feedback?

How do they even know what they want? Do you? Even though the specifics may differ – some of us desire to learn a skill, others to start a family and yet others to simply grow and harvest a garden – we still all share an underlying desire for growth and abundance. Most of the time, our desires and wants seem constrained by resources – time, money, opportunities. But what if someone told you that you could create these things for yourself and that there is an inexhaustible amount of them waiting for you if only you’d learn how to think in the right way? According to the author, Wallace D. Wattles, you can. Along the way, you’ll also learn why competition isn’t a viable way to happiness; why cultivating an attitude of gratitude is important; and how all the resources for a happy and fulfilling life are well within your reach. Just about everyone wants to be rich. People who don’t have money want to acquire it and people who do have it worry about losing it. There are those who might try to put this desire for wealth in a bad light, but, actually, it’s only natural. The three core components of your life are your mind, body and soul, and to live a successful, happy life, you need to nurture them equally, which requires certain material goods. For instance, you can’t fully celebrate your body if you can’t afford good food, comfortable clothing and a safe, cozy place to sleep. Similarly, you can’t enjoy your mind without books, education and other intellectual stimulation. And, finally, you can’t celebrate your soul without love and the means to show love to others. This last one may seem odd, but here’s the fact of the matter: love is most often demonstrated by a desire to give material gifts. In other words, someone with nothing to give can’t enjoy love or relationships to their fullest potential. So how can you get rich enough to nurture these three aspects of your life? Well, first of all, you should know that, contrary to what many think, people don’t become rich just because they were born to rich parents or with great talents, but because they behave in a certain way that is conducive to accumulating wealth. Another common misconception is that not everyone can be rich because there’s only finite amount of riches in the world. According to the author, everything in the world is composed of the so-called Original Substance. The different elements we see in nature are just different manifestations of it. Luckily for us, the Substance is always regenerating, meaning that our natural resources will never run out. So with this abundance in mind, it’s only natural for humans to want to acquire and experience more things. This also means that nobody is poor because of any inherent dearth of resources, but rather because they don’t understand their power and the inexhaustible riches within their reach. Simply put, you and every other person has the right to be rich because you’re a part of nature, which abounds with riches. What do you think the first step to getting rich is? Is it buying stocks? Starting a company? Actually, the initial step begins with something much more fundamental: your thoughts. Thoughts are everywhere, and according to the author, by impressing your thoughts upon the Original Substance, you can cause the object of your thought to be created. That’s how everything on Earth was created; everything you can perceive in nature, including the sky and the universe, is the product of a thought in the Original Substance. That’s why, by imagining something using the power of thought, you can bring about its creation. As you do so, remember that God wants you to become rich so that you can better help others. You’re a creator, not a competitor, which means your goal is to get whatever you want in a way that helps and elevates everybody else as well. For instance, God wants musicians to have the best instruments so that they can create music that will also inspire others to strive for greatness. This all being said, it’s not enough to just believe in Original Substance and hope that it will give you all you need. You also need to live by the Law of Gratitude. This is a natural principle that states that the more grateful you are for the Substance, the more you’ll attract good things. So if you’re a talented musician but can’t afford to buy a new guitar, rather than complaining about it, be grateful for the guitar you already have. Know that, in time, the Original Substance will provide you with greater opportunities and better tools. Now that you know that you can attain your desires through the power of thoughts, it’s time to learn how to think the right way. To get started, use your imagination to imbue the Substance with a clear and specific picture of what you want and a strong purpose to obtain it. For example, say you want a house. Picture it in all its detail. How big is it? What are the rooms like? From there, keep this clear picture in your mind, like a sailor who harbors a thought of the port where he intends to anchor. In addition to the image and purpose, you must also have a powerful faith that you can attain whatever you want, that it is there for you and that you need only reach out and grab it.   Once you’ve learned how to think correctly, then you can use your will to maintain this thinking and move forward on your path to riches. But remember: on this journey, the only appropriate way to use your will is upon yourself, not on anybody else. After all, you can’t know what is good for anyone but yourself. Never force someone to work for you, and never take things from others through manipulation. The former is a form of enslavement; the latter, of theft. If you want that big house, your only route is to imagine living in it until it becomes yours. Ignore those who tell you that you’re too poor to afford it and keep the clear image of success in your mind. Alright, so the power of thought is an incredibly powerful tool for creating your own reality. But action is still required to get things moving. While your thoughts can attract the things you want, only your actions will make them truly yours. And because you can’t act in the past or in the future, the present is the only moment you’ve got, so you’d better act now. That means, regardless of the circumstances you find yourself in, you’ve got to act to prepare yourself for the future you want. If you merely invest energy in visualizing your ideal future and do nothing to work toward it, success will never actually materialize. It’s common for people to stall here because they believe their environment isn’t right for the action they want to undertake. If you find yourself facing this problem, there’s a simple solution: just change your environment or improve it through your own actions. In other words, use your present environment as a tool to arrive at a more hospitable one.   It’s also important to do as much as you can during each and every day, so you make quick progress, but without overworking yourself. Doing your utmost doesn’t mean completing a ridiculous number of tasks every day, but instead applying all of your faith and purpose to making progress toward your personal goals. Many people make the mistake of spending their mental energy in one place and their physical energy in another. But if you concentrate your whole being, mental and physical, on whatever act you engage in, then every action will be successful. Having such successes will then attract further success and, pretty soon, you’ll get into a rhythm. So if you already know that you want to earn more money, don’t procrastinate. Start working toward your goals today and believe that you will eventually succeed. Have you ever been really good at something that you also really like doing? If yes, you know what an incredible feeling it is, and you’d probably agree that every person should strive for such an experience. Finding the sweet spot where talent and enjoyment intersect will help you perform better, thereby helping you succeed. And what could be better than getting rich while doing what you love? To get started, develop your skills. For instance, if you have a desire to paint, you must first develop the ability and artistry necessary to succeed. But whichever field you choose, you must have faith in it to attain increase, meaning the kind of advancement that everybody strives for. This desire of increase pervades the universe; every little thing seeks advancement and development. And by having faith in what you do, you’ll give the impression of increase, which, in turn, will attract more genuine increase. Therefore, even if your job is something seemingly unimportant, like merely selling candy to children, you should have unwavering faith in its importance in creating increase, not just for you, but for everyone around you too. When you show this kind of faith, it will make people believe that by connecting with you, they too will achieve increase for themselves. This is why doctors and teachers, who are often filled with faith in the importance of their work, will never be without work, and this attracts more increase. Just follow the desire to do what you most love doing and know that you are advancing personally. If you can manage that, there is no end to the success you can enjoy. The key message in this book: The universe wants nothing more than for you to live an abundant and prosperous life, so you should embrace your natural desire to be rich. Material wealth will allow you to nurture your mind, body and soul, while also inspiring and compelling others to do the same.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Known as the “Oracle of Omaha” or the “Sage of Omaha,” he can frequently be seen in the media sharing his opinion on business and politics. But few know what it is he actually does and even fewer how Buffett came to occupy the position he’s in today. In these blinks, we delve into the life of Warren Buffett and follow him from his early life to his first business endeavors to his current status as an American sage of modern business. His story offers an intriguing and educational glimpse into the business of life. In these blinks, you’ll find out how Buffett managed to make his first investments at age 11; Why Buffett’s investments are like a snowball; and how friends like Kay Graham and Bill Gates influenced the Sage from Omaha. Warren Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on August 20, 1930 – a mere ten months after Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that sent the country plummeting into the Great Depression. His father, Howard, was a well-liked stockbroker who managed to sell reliable securities and bonds during this bleak period. As a result, unlike many other families, the Buffetts were able to bounce back from the crash and live comfortably during the 1930s. However, this didn’t mean things were easy for the young Warren. His mother, Leila, was an overbearing parent, quick to fly into a rage, an unfortunate tendency that resulted in her needlessly shaming and blaming her children. Stuck at home with this abrasive and unpredictable parent, Warren was eager to find an escape. More often than not, his older sister Doris was the target of their mother’s rage, but Warren also sought ways to avoid his mother’s temper, and he found it in numbers, odds and percentages. One of the reasons he loved school was that it got him away from home and taught him more about mathematics. After his first-grade classes let out, Warren and his friend Russ would sit on Russ’s front porch and note down the license plates of passing cars. Their parents thought this was so they could calculate the frequencies of each letter and number appearing on the plates, but in reality, the boys secretly believed their notes could help the police catch bank robbers, as the street was the only possible getaway route from the local bank. Sometimes he was able to get away from home by spending time at his dad’s office on the weekends, where he happily wrote the numbers of stock prices on the office’s big chalkboard. The young Warren’s interest in numbers, probabilities and statistics was noticed and encouraged by other family members. At the age of eight, Warren received a book on baseball statistics from his grandfather, a gift that delighted Warren. He devoted hours on end to memorizing every page. He received another gift from his beloved aunt Alice: a book on the complex card game bridge, which sparked a lifelong obsession. With these wonderful books, Warren could sit happily in his room, away from his erratic mother, and spend time in the company of more comforting and reliable companions: numbers. If there’s one thing that fascinated Warren more than numbers, it was money. When he was nine years old, Warren was already making money by selling packs of gum and bottles of Coke to his neighbors. A year later, he was selling peanuts at football games at the University of Omaha. Warren’s interest in money intensified in 1940, when he spotted a book at the library called One Thousand Ways to Make $1,000. The ten-year-old Buffet was instantly inspired by it, and confided in a friend that he planned to be a millionaire by age 35. He was certainly proving himself to be a determined kid: by age eleven he’d saved up $120, which was a whole lot of money in 1941. He used that money to make his first investment. He bought six shares of the company Cities Service Preferred – three for him and three for his sister Doris. In high school, the odd jobs continued; he sold golf balls and bought pinball machines that he rented out to barber shops. But his wages really went up when he started delivering newspapers. In 1942, his family had moved to Washington, DC, after his dad was elected to serve in congress as the Republican representative for Nebraska’s second district. It was here that Warren started delivering papers and selling subscriptions on three different routes, one of which contained three popular apartment buildings that were home to many US senators. Since Warren earned a portion of the collected subscription fees, he was a highly motivated paperboy and a stickler for making sure his customers paid up. Remarkably, he was earning around $175 per month at this time – more than most of the teachers at his school. Before long, his savings had grown to $1,000. In 1944, at the ripe old age of fourteen, Warren filed his first tax return. He cited both his watch and his bicycle as deductions, and payed $7.00 in total. Considering Buffett’s all-consuming interest in money and numbers, it’s unsurprising that his classmates labeled him as a “Future Stockbroker” the high school yearbook. It was also unsurprising that Buffett chose to study accounting and business at the University of Nebraska. As he moved out of his family home and onto the college campus, it became apparent that he was a pretty messy guy. Indeed, his first roommate was so annoyed by Buffett’s messiness that he decided to move out after the first year. But his roommate was perhaps more frustrated by Buffett’s ability to effortlessly memorize entire sections of textbooks, which he could then recite back to his teachers verbatim. This gave Buffett more time to listen to music and not pick up after himself, much to the annoyance of those who had to work harder to get passing grades. Since Buffett found college rather easy, he was quite surprised when, after applying for a graduate program at Harvard Business School, he received a letter of rejection. But this proved to be a fortunate failure. Buffett was accepted by Columbia University, where he studied under Benjamin Graham, the author of the book Intelligent Investor and a man whose mentorship left quite an impression on Buffett. Buffett loved Graham’s book dearly, so when he found out he was teaching at Columbia, he forgot all about Harvard. He was also excited about another class that was being taught by David Dodd, the author of Security Analysis, yet another book that Buffett had memorized. Both of these teachers taught Buffett valuable lessons and fundamental investment strategies. For example, Buffett learned about the importance of investigating a company from top to bottom in order to determine its intrinsic value – the amount of money it’s actually worth. This value is then compared to its perceived value, which is how much the stock is currently selling for on the market. When a company’s intrinsic value is far higher than its perceived value, it may be what Graham called a “cigar butt” – an undervalued businesses worth investing in. Graham’s success rested in large part on the realization that there’s a good chance that perceived value will eventually rise to meet intrinsic value. Throughout college, Buffett was uncomfortable around girls. His shyness was so severe that he even enrolled in a public speaking class, hoping it would boost his confidence and make him feel less awkward. When he took this class, there was one young woman in particular that Buffett wanted to impress. Her name was Susie Thompson, and though her father took an instant liking to Buffett, it took a good deal of persistence before Susie warmed up to his awkward charm. A nervous wreck, and too eager to impress, Buffett initially came across as arrogant and privileged. But once Susie gave Buffett a chance, she realized that his posturing was just a symptom of his awkward shyness and, eventually, she fell in love with his charming vulnerability. The two got married in 1952, and Buffett kept busy teaching classes and working at his dad’s old investment firm. Their first child, Susie Alice Buffett, was born in 1953, the same year Buffett got the job he’d been dreaming about for years – working for Ben Graham’s investment firm, Graham-Newman. Buffett quickly became the rising star of Graham-Newman, even though he soon realized that he actually hated being a stockbroker. He couldn’t stand the thought of picking the wrong investment and losing someone’s hard-earned money. So he soon began plotting his own partnership. After the birth of his second child, Howie Graham Buffett, Warren’s plans to become his own boss became a reality. In 1956, he launched Buffett Associates, Ltd. The idea behind this partnership was that it would only include friends and relatives, and there would be simple rules behind every investment so that no one could be disappointed or have unrealistic expectations. At the same time, Buffett’s reputation was given a boost by his mentor and former boss, Ben Graham. Shortly after Buffet left his firm, Graham decided to retire and close up shop. But on the way out, he recommended Buffett as a reliable man for his clients to invest their money with. In his first year as his own boss, Buffett began a series of eight partnerships based on different sets of friends who gave him anywhere between $50,000 to $120,000 to invest. Each time Buffett started a new partnership, he made sure everyone understood his philosophy. He would tell his potential partners how he only invested in undervalued stocks, and that any earnings would then be reinvested in these same stocks. In a way it was like rolling a snowball down a hill: what starts as a small handful eventually grows bigger and bigger. He also made sure they knew he wasn’t the kind of investor who would cash out when a stock hit a certain number – he was patient. And this patient consistency paid off. At the end of 1956, his partnerships beat the market by 4 percent; at the end of 1957, it was 10 percent, and at the end of 1960, it was 29 percent. The snowball was rolling. By the start of the 1960s, Buffett was already managing over a million dollars. At this time, the stock market was on an upward swing; unlike many other investors, however, this shift in the market didn’t change his way of doing business. He still searched for undervalued companies, and when he found something he wanted, he bought up as much stock as possible. This often meant earning a seat on the board to make sure that the executives didn’t do anything foolish with the investors’ money. Remarkably, while managing millions of dollars, Buffett was still doing all of his own paperwork. But in 1962 he decided to make things less complicated and dissolved all of his individual partnerships into a single entity: Buffett Partnership, Ltd. Around this time, Buffett’s success was starting to expand beyond Omaha to Wall Street, where he was gaining recognition as one of the few major players who didn’t work in New York City. However, some established moneymen remained skeptical and predicted that he’d go broke any day now. One person who recognized Warren Buffett’s talents early on was Californian lawyer and part-time investor, Charlie Munger. The two like-minded individuals became fast friends after a long lunch in 1959 – a friendship that inevitably led to a fruitful business partnership. Munger’s perspective opened Buffett’s eyes to bigger possibilities and helped him realize that you could still play it safe while moving beyond those “cigar butt” stocks. Indeed, the Buffett partnership would soon be taking a huge leap forward, thanks in large part to a certain stock that Buffett picked up at just the right time. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, few people were paying attention to any other story. But, by then, Buffett was a creature of habit, and he continued digging through the back pages of the newspapers, where he came across a story about a soybean scandal involving American Express. A subsidiary of American Express had certified that certain storage tanks contained soybean oil, but they were later revealed to be filled with seawater. As a result, American Express stocks took a severe hit. But this didn’t worry Buffett; he knew the company would bounce back. So when prices hit rock bottom in January of 1964, he began gradually pouring money into American Express: $3 million at first, and then, by 1966, $13 million. Naturally, American Express did bounce back, and it brought the partnership unprecedented rewards, enough for Buffett to start buying entire businesses. One of the first buyouts was a business that would come to define Buffett – the small Massachusetts textile manufacturer, Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett’s research showed that its intrinsic value was $22 million, which meant it should be selling at $19.46 per share. Yet it was selling at only $7.50 per share. In 1965, after some negotiation, Buffett got controlling interest in Berkshire Hathaway by purchasing 49 percent of the company at a little over $11 per share. That same year, Warren and Susie earned an additional $2.5 million, thanks largely to the American Express investment, which meant that Buffett had more than met his goal of becoming a millionaire by age 35. Even though Buffett is closely associated with Berkshire Hathaway now, the company was so problematic that Buffett would come to regret ever getting involved with it. But Buffett isn’t the kind of investor who likes to cut his losses, a philosophy that goes back to before his involvement with Berkshire Hathaway. In 1958, Buffett made a similar purchase of a company in Nebraska called Dempster Mill Manufacturing, which made windmill and water irrigation systems. But things quickly fell apart: he put the wrong management in charge, the company went bankrupt and he decided to liquidate the company’s assets. As a result, people lost jobs and the neighboring community openly expressed their dislike of Buffett. Determined to never let this happen again, Buffett wanted to be sure that the right person was in charge of Berkshire Hathaway and that the business stayed alive. This presented many challenges since the costs of textiles was on the rise during the 1960s and 1970s and the company’s machinery was in desperate need of modernization. But Buffett never wasted money, so he was extremely hesitant about injecting additional capital into a company that held no real promise of turning a profit. All this meant that Berkshire Hathaway would continue to be a burden as a textile manufacturer. Nonetheless, Buffett kept it alive by continuing to purchase winning stocks in its name every chance he got, eventually giving Berkshire Hathaway one of the world’s best stock portfolios. Despite the problems presented by Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett was doing extremely well. His investment partnership was in such good shape that he decided to close its doors to new members and tighten his investment rules. More and more technology companies were emerging in the late 1960s, which prompted Buffett to make a new rule: he would never buy stock in a company that offered a product or service he didn’t fully understand. Buffett liked things “easy, safe, profitable and pleasant,” which led to another rule: no involvement with businesses that had potential or proven “human problems” such as impending layoffs, plant closings or a history of executives fighting with labor unions. Even after Buffett became a millionaire, he remained a notoriously shabby dresser, a man utterly unconcerned with his outward appearance. Far more important to Buffett were the details and characteristics of the people who were in charge of his businesses. Reliable businesses have reliable management, so when Buffett made his acquisitions, he made sure they were being run by good people. One of the main reasons Buffett decided to purchase the Baltimore department store Hochschild-Kohn, as well as Associated Cotton Shops, which ran a string of retail stores, was the people behind the scenes. Buffett got in the habit of sitting down with company managers and getting to know them well. He wanted to make sure they were enthusiastic people that he could trust. For a while, Buffett had his eyes on an Omaha insurance business called National Indemnity. But it wasn’t until he met with Jack Ringwalt, whom he immediately recognized as a great manager, that he decided to buy. These were smart moves, and by the end of 1966, the partnership was doing better than ever, outperforming the market by 36 percent. Buffett regarded the managers of these business – as well as his investment partners – as family. And as the 1960s came to a close, Buffett began offering to buy out his partners. It was a way to wind down the partnership so that he and Susie could focus more on personal endeavors. Susie continued to hope that her husband might retire, or at least devote more time to his kids, who were quickly growing up without much involvement from their father. Susie was also busy: she pursued a singing career and got involved in the pressing social issues of 1960s America, attending civil-rights and anti-war protests. Even Warren, who mostly steered clear of politics, couldn’t help but get involved. In 1967, he became the treasurer for the Nebraskan office for Democratic presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy. Warren’s move into politics had a lot to do with the death of his father, who was a devout Republican. After his father died, Buffett could finally express his own political views without worrying about disappointing him. Back when Buffett was delivering newspapers in Washington, DC, he dreamed of one day owning his own paper. And when he made $16 million in earnings in 1969, he was finally in a position to realize that dream. That year, Buffett purchased a controlling interest in the Omaha Sun. Not only did this fulfill one of Buffett’s dreams; it would eventually lead to a cherished award. In 1972, the Omaha Sun published an investigative article on Boys Town, a local shelter for homeless boys that dated back to 1913. When the article was written, this shelter had become a huge 1,300 acre compound, with it’s own farm and stadium, being run by a priest named Father Edward Flanagan. Curiously, though, it housed only 665 boys – and there were 600 employees. It seemed like something fishy was going on, so Buffett helped the Sun’s editor commission an investigation. And Buffett’s hunch led to a major scoop. Boys Town had in fact been stockpiling donations, grants and funds, amassing around $18 million per year. The article – “Boys Town: America’s Wealthiest City?” – ran on March 30, 1972, earning Buffett’s paper the Pulitzer Prize for outstanding regional journalism. The story immediately went national and led to reform regarding how non-profit organizations were run. After this success, Buffett then set his sights on a national newspaper: the prestigious Washington Post. By the summer of 1973, Buffett owned over 5 percent of the Washington Post and was even developing an extremely close relationship with its publisher, Kay Graham. The following year, he joined the newspaper’s board and started attending Graham’s lavish dinner parties. He spent many nights awkwardly attempting to mingle with famous guests like the actor Paul Newman and trying not to embarrass himself in front of respected senators, diplomats and dignitaries from around the world. When you’re as active an investor as Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, you’re bound to pick up a couple of troublesome companies. When Munger noticed Blue Chip Stamps, it was 1968 and it was common for housewives to collect trading stamps – which functioned much like coupons – when they were at grocery stores and gas stations. But with the rise of the women’s liberation movement in the 1970s, trading stamps became passé – unpleasant tokens of a less liberal time. Much like Berkshire Hathaway, Blue Chip was now on life support; it was only alive because Buffett and Munger were buying winning stocks under the company’s name. So, to help Blue Chip, Munger bought 8 percent of Wesco, an undervalued savings and loan company. Buffett liked Wesco, too – but so did Santa Barbara Financial Company. In fact, SBFC wanted to merge with Wesco. But Buffett saw SBFC as an overvalued company that would only be bad news for Wesco. So he flew to California to talk with Betty Caper Peters, the surviving member of Wesco’s founding family, and convinced her to call off the merger. She did, but the decision sent Wesco’s stock plummeting from $18 to $11 per share. Buffett and Munger felt bad about this, so they offered to buy their majority stake at $17 per share. But it didn’t end there: Santa Barbara Financial filed a complaint with the Security Exchange Committee (SEC) claiming Buffett and Munger purposely overpaid Wesco in order to ruin the planned merger. 1974 was a tense year. The SEC launched an investigation into Buffett and Munger’s tangled web of over 30 companies. This included five parent companies, such as Berkshire Hathaway and Blue Chip, that each owned five or more other companies, which in turn owned other companies and so on. They weren’t hiding anything, but the complicated structure made the SEC highly suspicious. Buffett was extremely anxious. He knew that even being named in a finding of wrongdoing could ruin a reputation forever. Thankfully, in the end, the SEC only issued one warning for a disclosure violation in Blue Chip’s past – and no individuals were named. The increasingly close relationship between Warren Buffett and the Washington Post’s publisher, Kay Graham, initially upset Susie. But she eventually began a romance with her tennis instructor, and wrote a personal letter to Kay, telling her that she was free to have her own relationship with Buffett. However, in 1977, with the children out of the house, Susie decided it was time for a radical change and made arrangements to move to San Francisco. In many ways, Buffett never grew up. Though nearing fifty, he was still a messy man who loved cheeseburgers and ice cream. He also remained far more devoted to his business life than to his family. Despite all this, Susie still loved him and wanted to make sure he was taken care of. So when she left, she hired Astrid, a young woman Susie knew from a nightclub, to cook for and look after Buffett. Buffett was shocked by Susie’s departure, but after many tearful phone conversations, he finally understood that she needed a life of her own. Astrid eventually moved in with Buffett, a development that surprised both Susie and Kay, as well as Howie and Susie, Jr. Then, in the middle of all this, a nasty legal battle began that would take years for Buffett to resolve. In the late 1970s, Buffett and Munger had added another newspaper to their collection: the Buffalo Evening News. Part of their plan was to add a weekend edition to the paper which they would introduce by offering the first five issues for free, followed by a discount price. But their competition in the area, Buffalo’s Courier-Express, filed a lawsuit, claiming that this offer constituted unfair practice. The judge stunned Buffett by ruling in favor of Courier-Express. In his decision, the judge said it was unlawful to sell free newspapers, and if the public wanted to subscribe to the weekend edition they would have to renew their order every week. Buffett naturally appealed this harsh decision, and, in 1981, he finally won – but by then the paper had lost millions of dollars. Another company that Buffett is now closely associated with is GEICO, an auto insurance company that Buffett first noticed back in college. It was actually one of the first stocks he recommended to clients during his brief time at his father’s old firm, but it wasn’t until the 1970s, when the company was in crisis, that he became closely involved. In 1976, Buffett joined GEICO’s board to help it out of bankruptcy by revitalizing its management. At that time, an executive named John Gutfreund, who worked at the Wall Street trading house Salomon Brothers, helped Buffett raise funds to get GEICO back on its feet. Buffett was grateful for Gutfreund’s help and he tried to repay that favor when Salomon Brothers faced some problems of its own. In the early 1980s, hostile takeovers become a standard way of doing business on Wall Street; junk bonds were used to make brokers rich and everyone was racking up debt by making deals based on credit. Buffett, who always paid with cash, hated these practices, and he didn’t like the brokers or analysts indulging in them, either. But when Gutfreund asked for his help in 1986, Buffett agreed to join the board of Salomon Brothers. Buffett had such a reputation for being associated with stable and reliable companies that having him on your board was a clear sign to everyone that the company was in good hands and not vulnerable to a takeover. However, Buffett never suspected the trouble that lay ahead. In 1991, an employee named Paul Mozer was caught in a massive scandal. He’d broken federal laws multiple times by illegally bidding in government auctions. Making matters worse, management was made aware of this before the news spread but hadn’t taken proper action. During the fallout, Buffett was made interim-CEO and he put together new leadership and reforms. Crucially, he used his contacts to plead his case and successfully prevented the Treasury Department from barring Salomon Brothers from future auctions. Warren Buffett’s reputation took a downward turn in the 1990s. As technology stocks became all the rage, Buffett remained utterly uninterested in the NASDAQ. People began saying he was behind the times, an irrelevant old man. Remarkably, Buffett never concerned himself with these opinions, as he was doing just fine without technology stocks. Actually, he was doing better than fine: between 1978 and 1991, his net worth jumped from $89 million to $3.8 billion and rising. And since becoming CEO of Berkshire Hathaway in 1986, that company’s stock continued to soar, trading at $8,000 per share in 1991 and soon topping $10,000. His career is proof that you can stay relevant and successful while steering clear of the NASDAQ. Buffett was one of the few people who recognized that the only thing tech stocks did reliably was make investors unhappy in the long run. Nonetheless, he did make a small investment in one company. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates agreed to meet at a Fourth of July party in 1991, even though both of them went in thinking that they would have nothing to talk about. But that meeting led to a conversation that lasted the rest of the weekend, and they went on to remain close friends. Afterward, Gates began attending Buffett’s annual shareholder meetings, which eventually became so popular that scalpers could sell a ticket for $250, and, in the end, Buffett bought 100 shares of Microsoft. Buffett and Gates also began meeting regularly for bridge games, along with Charlie Munger and Kay Graham. Throughout the 1990s and the 2000s, these two were neck-and-neck for the title of richest person in the world. But it was their friendship that opened Buffett’s eyes to his real place in the larger world. After taking a trip to China with Gates, Buffett realized how lucky he was to be born in Omaha. He clearly saw that he’d had advantages that many people in the world did not, a realization that only reinforced his humble and thankful attitude toward life. Buffett’s predictions about internet companies being a disappointment to investors were already coming true in the early 2000s, and the publications that called him irrelevant in 1994 were now rebranding him as a prophet. But this turnaround wasn’t much comfort in 2001, when his dear friend and companion Kay Graham passed away. Their 30-year relationship had been extremely close, and he was devastated for weeks after her death. Then, two months later, on September 11, 2001, things only became worse. Buffett took what he learned from both of these events – that we’re living in uncertain times – and began investing in companies that offered some sense of certainty. This is what drew Buffett to businesses like Fruit of the Loom and companies that made farm equipment and children’s clothes. However, another period of reevaluation was just around the corner. In 2003, Susie was diagnosed with stage 3 oral cancer. Even though they were no longer living together, Susie and Buffett remained close. And though he was often reduced to tears, he recognized how important it was to take this time to care for Susie. Susie passed away in 2004. Buffett was heartbroken, and he spent days in bed, unable to talk to anyone. But when he finally emerged, he had gotten in better touch with his own feelings and had a desire to be closer to his children. He now believed he’d figured out the secret to life: “...to be loved by as many people as possible among those you want to have love you.” He also knew what he wanted to do with all his money. He gave 85 percent of Berkshire Hathaway, which was worth $36 billion at the time, to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and he divided another six million dollars between Susie’s charitable foundation and the other foundations set up for his kids. The key message in this book: For much of Warren Buffett’s life, he had a one-track mind – rolling his snowball. This meant constantly investing and reinvesting the earnings. His relatively simple but thorough method for picking stocks to invest in had nothing to do with business trends or technology. Though he could calculate a company’s monetary value quite quickly, he found success by paying attention to the human element of a business.  Actionable advice: Use Buffett’s “20 Punches” approach to investing. Imagine you have a card that gives you only 20 chances to invest in your lifetime. Each time you make an investment, someone punches a hole in your card and you lose a future investment opportunity. If you use this philosophy, you’ll be much more diligent about the investments you do make.

But when things come crashing down, is it fair to blame the individuals who work in finance, or should we rather look at how the banking system is set up? These blinks try to answer this question by telling the story of Tom Hayes, the infamous math wiz who ended up taking the fall for the banking industry’s reckless habit of manipulating interest rates. From the innocent lunch-money deals he made as a teenager to him being designated the criminal mastermind of the “Spider Network,” Hayes’s story is laid out in full. You’ll learn how the most common benchmark interest rate index in the world – Libor – was manipulated, and what happens when traders, brokers and bank executives are left to operate without oversight. You’ll also learn how Hayes’s mild Asperger’s got him in trouble; that Hayes managed to make $10 million in just one day; why Hayes was the only banker to be convicted. Even as a child, Tom Hayes had a knack for numbers and knew how to cut a favorable deal. In 1995, when he was just 15 years old and living in Winchester, England, Hayes lent his lunch money to a friend with a 50-percent interest rate. This way, for every five pounds he loaned out, Hayes would earn himself a nice profit of £2.50. Around this time, he also became fascinated with the slot machines that could be found at local pubs. Hayes would watch one intently, figure out its pattern and always jump in at the right time to win a payout. Unfortunately, Hayes’s mathematical ingenuity seemed to come at a cost, as he was always bad at socializing and making friends. During his days at school, Hayes was bullied for his tendency to dress quite neatly, with a sharp blazer. Lacking a positive male role model didn’t help matters, either. After cheating on his mom, Hayes’s father left the picture quite early on. But the reason Hayes struggled with relationships was likely a mild and undiagnosed form of Asperger's. All the symptoms were there: He could focus intensely on complex mathematical problems, he always avoided making eye contact and when he was upset, he could snap into a fit of rage. What comforted Hayes was the reliable logic of math, and that’s what drew him toward the stock market. In 1999, while at the University of Nottingham, he interned at UBS, an international Swiss bank, and learned some of the basics of trading stocks and bonds. From there, Hayes became hooked on the intricate world of finance and, in the fall of 2001, landed a permanent job at the Royal Bank of Scotland. While working at the Bank of Scotland, Hayes was introduced to the complicated business of Libor, a common benchmark that stands for London Interbank Offered Rate and is used around the world to determine interest rates. Libor is determined by having certain banks around London regularly submit the average rate of what it costs for them to borrow money. This rate essentially reflects how much other banks are charging them to take out a loan. Once these numbers are submitted, they’re averaged out, and this figure becomes the current Libor, which is used as a benchmark for a variety of purposes, such as mortgages. Other countries have their own version of Libor. For example, Japan has the Tibor – the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate – for the yen. But Libor is popular worldwide since the British pound is considered to be one of the stronger and more stable currencies. But here’s the problem: there was no system to verify that submissions from banks were accurate. For the longest time, banks were simply trusted to submit the true numbers. Now, by the time Tom Hayes began his career in finance, Libor was already the go-to benchmark for banks around the world. If you were to look at the fine print of any loan or credit-card payment, you’d likely see a reference to Libor. Hayes also learned that Libor played a big role in derivatives, which were becoming increasingly popular at the start of the 2000s. A derivative is like a contract that banks can use to insure themselves against certain risks – such as a client failing to make mortgage payments. So, when Bank A sets up a mortgage, they can also buy a derivative that says Bank B will pay Bank A if the customer defaults on that mortgage. But this is just one kind of derivative. Banks were creating derivatives as insurance for just about every deal they were making. And Libor influenced the value of many of these derivatives. Tom Hayes quickly became a success in finance. It was like his brain was perfectly wired for this kind of work. So, in 2006, after making millions for the Royal Bank of Scotland, he accepted an offer to work for UBS, but this time for their branch in Japan. Hayes continued to prove how well his math skills could be put to work in the complex world of derivatives and fluctuating interest rates. He became so adept at navigating the Japanese market that his name was soon recognized as a powerful force in that part of the financial world. It was at UBS that Hayes first understood it was possible to make money by manipulating Libor. All Hayes had to do was reach out to his brokers, who would then convince the people in charge of submitting their bank’s Libor information to change the numbers. After a couple early successes, a regular procedure emerged: First, Hayes would buy a bunch of derivatives with values that would increase depending on the rising or falling of Libor. And, depending on the kind he bought, he would then call his brokers to tell them what he needed: for Libor to either go up or down. Tom’s brokers then reached out to the Libor submitters, often offering them a nice reward, with directions on which way they needed Libor to go. Most of the time, the submitters went along with the plan, and everyone got a payday, especially UBS. However, unbeknownst to Hayes, the brokers had found a significant shortcut for this system: One of the brokers, Darrell Read, knew someone named Colin Goodman who possessed another popular spreadsheet, which he would share with other bankers every morning. One of the features of Goodman’s spreadsheet was a suggested Libor rate for submitters to enter. So all Read had to do to make Hayes and UBS happy was convince Goodman to put the appropriate number in his spreadsheet. It turns out that Libor submitters, like a lot of people, are pretty lazy. And rather than looking back at all of the bank’s transactions to calculate the average cost of borrowing money, they simply copied Goodman’s suggestion. So how did Hayes compensate the brokers for going along with his scheme? One of his go-to rewards was a switch trade. This involves two traders, Trader A and Trader B, using a broker to set up a million-dollar trade. First, the trade would go in one direction, from A to B, and then a short while later the same exact trade would be made in the other direction, from B to A. This way, everything between the traders evens out, and the broker gets two hefty commissions worth thousands of dollars. Another more traditional reward was simply wining and dining the brokers and traders. Now, it’s important to realize that Libor manipulation was encouraged by the bank executives. Mike Pieri, Hayes’s boss at UBS, was perfectly aware of the Libor manipulation. Hayes is confident that if Pieri had ever told him to stop messing with Libor, he would have stopped. But UBS was making obscene amounts of money thanks to Hayes’ tactics, so naturally, Pieri never made the slightest effort to stop him. In 2007, Hayes was making as much as $10 million a day for UBS; in 2009 alone, he brought in well over $100 million. The executives at UBS were happy, and they tried to keep Hayes happy by promising him big year-end bonuses. But UBS wasn’t the only bank interested in Hayes. Citibank executives also knew of his talent for making money. After UBS failed to deliver on their bonus promises, Citibank successfully wooed Hayes to its team, with the help of a $3-million signing bonus. And just as before, Hayes’s new Citibank boss, Chris Cecere, was eager to give Hayes whatever he needed to work his magic with Libor manipulation. Citibank CEO, Brian McCappin, also helped out by making calls on Hayes’s behalf so that other banks would cooperate. At this point of the story, it’s important to keep Hayes’s personality in mind and remember that, ever since he was a kid, he’d had a hard time making friends. This problem continued into his adult life, and you could even say it grew worse in the banks’ aggressively macho work environment, where people casually curse up a storm and enjoy coming up with offensive nicknames for each other. Hayes worked alongside bankers with nicknames like “Abbo,” which is short for “Aboriginal,” and “Derka Derka” – a sobriquet for a Kazakhstan-born trader referencing the way Arab people in the South Park movie talk. Hayes tried to fit into this aggressive workplace and, like others, he would scream obscenities at people when he didn’t get his way. But everyone in the office grew tired of Hayes’s intensity and felt that he constantly took the yelling and temper tantrums too far. What they didn’t know was that Hayes’s had an undiagnosed case of Asperger's that was a significant contributor to his social ineptitude. So everyone at UBS was all too happy when he left for Citibank in 2009 – everyone, that is, except for his boss Mike Pieri, who felt deeply betrayed by Hayes and was thirsty for revenge. As Hayes’s bad luck would have it, Pieri was about to find a perfect way to get his revenge. Following the financial crisis of 2008, the public was eager to see rich bankers land behind bars, and investigators were beginning to notice that something odd was going on with Libor. One of the first to recognize Libor’s strange fluctuations was Wall Street Journal reporter Carrick Mollenkamp. He realized that even though the banks had just suffered through a financial crisis, and some had even declared bankruptcy, the Libor didn’t reflect any of this. So it wasn’t long before the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Justice Department and Britain’s Serious Fraud Office followed up on this. And, by March of 2009, these agencies sent out formal inquiries to many banks, including one to UBS. Mike Pieri responded to it. Just before Hayes turned 30, Britain’s Barclays bank responded to the CFTC’s request for information with direct evidence of their Libor tampering. Hoping for leniency by being as cooperative as possible, Barclays even included a recording of two Barclays employees talking about receiving executive orders to manipulate Libor. It was now becoming clear that the banking industry was home to a new kind of rampant, systemic wrongdoing. And, as more evidence came in, Hayes found himself being singled out as the one “bad apple” behind it all. Especially damning were the testimonies of his former colleagues and vengeful boss from UBS, who supplied investigators with sufficient information to have Hayes arrested on December 11, 2012. By now Hayes had a wife, Sarah Tighe, and a young son, and the escalating case against him so depressed him that one day he turned to Sarah and asked her, in all seriousness, “Wouldn’t it be better for you and our son if I weren’t alive?” This suicidal thinking is a good example of how Hayes’s coldly logical mind worked, but he eventually snapped out of it and found the strength to fight back. When it came time to enter a plea, Hayes had decided that he didn’t want his son to grow up thinking he was a criminal. So he responded with a firm, “Not guilty.” His defense attorney painted an accurate picture of Hayes as a product of a corrupt system that had already been manipulating Libor long before he figured out how to do it on his own. Despite what his former colleagues might say, he was no criminal mastermind. The term “Spider Network” was invented by Chris Cecere, Hayes’s boss at Citibank, who joined the chorus of people that were dodging blame by casting Hayes as the architect of a vast criminal web. The defense even explained that Asperger’s had made Hayes highly susceptible to the influence exerted by his bosses. When the people in charge supported his efforts with the Libor requests, Hayes had felt no need to question it. The truth is, it took a lot of cooperative and coordinated effort for Libor rates to be adjusted so that Hayes and others could benefit from them. While Tom Hayes may have been a difficult person to work with, the Libor scandal happened because the financial system taught brokers and traders to make money however they could. Nevertheless, when it came time for a verdict, Hayes was the only one to be convicted, and it wasn’t a mere slap on the wrist: he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Sarah Tighe was in tears when the sentence came down, and while at the time of writing an appeal is in the works, she and her son are without a husband and father. Unfortunately, there were too many people who disliked the awkward and annoying Hayes’s, and they were all too willing to lie and point the finger at him rather than take a portion of the blame themselves. Six other brokers, including Hayes’s longtime broker, Darryl Read, were also put on trial in England, but none were found guilty; they all blamed Hayes and characterized him as a monster. Meanwhile, at the University of Southampton, in England, at least one person is trying to fix the corrupt and broken system from the ground up, by teaching future traders. Alex Stenfors is a former trader who was fired from Merrill Lynch due to his involvement in the Libor manipulation. Much like Hayes, he saw himself as a cog in a system that fully supports lying, cheating and stealing in order to win. So he used his unemployment as a chance to get a PhD at the University of London. His thesis was a description of what really happened during the Libor scandal. Now Stenfors teaches a class that includes a presentation he calls “Risk Takers, Rogue Traders and Rotten Apples.” It grapples with the sociology behind the cutthroat and ethically corrupt financial system. However, even after Stenfors has spent an hour detailing the ugly realities of high finance, he still gets approached by young men eager to dive into this amoral abyss and get rich quick. The key message in this book: After the 2008 financial crisis, people wanted to see rich bankers behind bars for the way they carelessly played with the financial system. While it’s true that traders and brokers make high-stakes gambles with millions of other people’s dollars, we shouldn’t necessarily only blame them. They’re the product of a system run by greedy CEOs and banking executives who encourage this behavior and reward it with obscene bonuses. If we have any intention of avoiding another crisis, we shouldn’t be locking up people like Tom Hayes. We need to find a way to fix the system itself. Got feedback?

The second door is the VIP door, where the celebrities and billionaires slip straight through. And then there’s the third door. Most people don’t even know it exists, but it does. You have to step out of line, run around the back of the club, bang on the door, maybe sneak through a kitchen. You’ll need a little chutzpah and a little initiative, but there’s always a way. The world’s most successful people went through the third door, ignoring the queue in their determination to get ahead. In these blinks, you’ll follow the path of an ambitious young man on his quest to track down and interview some of the most successful people in the world and learn the secrets of how they got ahead. In these blinks, you’ll learn how braving an important phone call got Bill Gates’s career off to a flying start; how re-engineering your sleeping pattern could give you a competitive advantage; and why biting off more than you can chew isn’t necessarily a bad idea. Alex Banayan was supposed to become a doctor. At least, that was his parents’ plan for him. But at 18 years old, a month into college as a pre-med, he realized this wasn’t the path for him. One day, while reading a biography of Bill Gates instead of studying, Banayan started wondering. Bill Gates had become the richest man in the world and revolutionized the software industry. But how? How did he go from a regular 18-year-old kid, just like Banayan, to becoming the wealthiest man in the world? Banayan started looking into other successful people: How had Steven Spielberg, a guy who didn’t even get into film school, ended up as one of the most successful directors in history? What did Lady Gaga do to pivot from waiting tables to nailing her first record deal in 2006? Banayan couldn’t find a book that gave him the answer to these questions, so he decided to write it himself. Why not? He’d arrange interviews with Bill Gates and of other legends, travel across the US to meet with them, write up his discoveries and share them with his entire generation. Getting the interviews was one thing, getting to them was quite another. The hard part, he quickly realized, would be funding the travel to all those interviews. But as luck would have it, the game show The Price is Right was being filmed a few miles away. Winning the show was how he’d fund his quest. Some googling told him that the wackier the behavior at casting, the more chance of getting selected for the show. So when he turned up on set, Banayan hugged janitors, danced with security guards and flirted with old ladies. It worked, and he got selected. He didn’t actually know how to play the game though, so began chatting to his fellow contestants. One kindly old woman, who said she’d been watching for 40 years, took a shine to him. She advised him to always guess low, as guessing too high would get you eliminated. Hours later, with studio lights shining in his face, Banayan won the final prize – a sailboat, retail price $31,188, which he sold days later for $16,000. His quest could begin. After reading Tim Ferriss’s phenomenally popular book The 4-Hour Work Week (2007), Banayan became obsessed with meeting the author. At a conference where Ferriss was speaking, Banayan hid in a bathroom during the speech, realizing that its location gave him the best chance of intercepting Ferriss as he came off stage. When Ferriss finished talking, Banayan sprung out and snatched a quick chat. Ferriss seemed interested in Banayan’s mission and said he’d get in touch. But time passed with no contact from Ferriss, so Banayan started emailing Ferriss’s assistant. Business books say that persistence is important, Banayan reminded himself. The author was undeterred at receiving no reply, even when Ferriss’s assistant rejected the request. In total, Banayan sent 31 emails, one of which claimed that a one-hour interview with him, a college student, would be one of the best investments that Ferriss, a multi-million selling author, would ever make. Staying upbeat, Banayan always ended his emails with a cheery “Thanks in advance!” Then one day, out of the blue, Ferriss agreed to talk. Persistence works! Or so the author thought. When they met, Ferriss talked a little about persistence. Ferriss got his first big break after he tried to build a relationship with a certain startup CEO. Ferriss had emailed the CEO asking for a job, and was turned down 12 times. Eventually, Ferriss emailed to say he’d be in the CEO’s neighborhood the following week – a total lie – and that it would be great to stop by. When the CEO said ok, Ferriss jumped on a plane from New York to San Francisco to “casually” meet him. Ferriss got the job. But in telling the story to Banayan, Ferriss wanted to be clear about one point: There’s a difference, he said, between being persistent and being a hassle. Ferriss was never rude, and while he was persistent, he got the balance right. He didn’t email ten times a week. He told Banayan not to say things like “Thanks in advance!” because it sounds rude and entitled. Instead, say something like “I totally understand if you don’t have time to respond.” Months later, when reading through old emails, the author realized that Ferriss had been trying to save Banayan from himself. Only then did he understand how much he had to learn. When a contact at Microsoft said he could get Banayan an interview with Qi Lu, Banayan wasn’t sure what to think. Any interview was good news, but he’d never even heard of this guy. But Banayan’s interest was piqued when he learned that Lu was one of the tech world’s rising stars. At 27 years old, Qi Lu was earning just $27 a month. Fast forward to his 47th birthday, and he was a president at Microsoft. Qi Lu grew up in a poor village in China. As a child, he wanted to be a shipbuilder but wasn’t strong enough, so he focused on his school work and ended up studying computer science at Fudan University. There, he had the spark of inspiration that would change his life. He realized that one thing in life is constant – whether you’re rich or poor, you only have 24 hours in a day. That led him to think that sleeping less could give him a competitive advantage over his peers. So he started to re-engineer his sleep pattern, cutting out one hour, then another and another. At one point he slept just one hour a night, forcing himself back to consciousness with an ice-cold shower, but this was too much to keep up. Eventually, he settled on a sustainable four hours a night, and he’s stuck to that ever since. By reducing sleep and working extra hard, Lu managed to publish five research papers on the topic of model checking in computer science astonishingly early in his academic career. One day, a visiting professor from Carnegie Mellon came to give a talk on the same topic. Lu made some perceptive observations and impressed the professor with his research. The professor suggested that Lu try and study in the US, saying he would waive his $60 application fee – $60 that Lu didn’t have. That encounter might feel a little lucky, but it was only by carving out an extra few hours in the day that Lu had been able to deliver his research papers. As he said himself, luck is a little like a bus: If you miss one, another will come along. But if you aren’t prepared, you can’t jump on. These days, Qi Lu is so productive that at Microsoft his colleagues say he works twice as fast as anyone else. They even have a term for it – “Qi Time.” After his initial success in talking to Qi Lu and Tim Ferriss, Banayan hit a brick wall. Qi Lu had helpfully passed on an interview request to Bill Gates, but the message came back that Gates wouldn’t meet. Banayan embraced “Qi Time,” getting up at six o’clock every day to write more cold emails requesting interviews. But the only consequence of more emails going out was more rejections coming back in. Eventually, “Sugar” Ray Leonard, a six-time world champion boxer, agreed to an interview at his California mansion. Banayan had written to the boxer saying that he believed the younger generation could learn from his advice. When Leonard first started boxing as a child, he was skinnier, shorter and younger than the other kids. He knew that he needed an edge. One morning, as the yellow school bus pulled up to collect him, Leonard didn’t get on. Instead, as it pulled away, he chased it, running all the way to school. He did the same on the way home, and the same the next day. Day in, day out, rain, wind or snow, he chased the school bus. Leonard said that, as a child, he didn’t have as much boxing experience as the other kids. But he did have the heart and the desire to improve. Years later, in 1981, twelve rounds into a welterweight world championship fight against the then-undefeated Thomas “The Hitman” Hearns, he was getting badly beaten. His left eye was so swollen that he could barely see. But he was able to summon what he called his hidden reservoir – a buried reserve of strength and determination. It’s the reserve that allows a mother to lift a car off a trapped child, Leonard said. We all have it, and success comes to those who can tap it. When Leonard stood up for the 13th round, he exploded in a whirlwind of adrenalin and concentration. In the 14th round, with his opponent limp on the ropes, Leonard was the champion of the world. Banayan explained to Leonard how he wasn’t getting far with his mission. Leonard told him not to let anyone tell him that his mission, his dream, isn’t possible. Stay in the fight, the boxer said, find your hidden reservoir, and you can do whatever you want to do. It’s always good to have a mentor in life. For Banayan, that mentor was Elliott Bisnow. A 20-something kid who dropped out of school and built a company, Bisnow Media, with his dad, that would go on to sell for 50 million dollars in 2016. In 2008, Bisnow also co-founded Summit Series to provide fun conferences for entrepreneurs and the world’s elite. Impressed at how much Bisnow had achieved so young, Banayan got in touch. They met days later in LA and quickly became friends. Bisnow helped Banayan access a world of entrepreneurs and taught him invaluable lessons. The key one was to bite off more than you can chew. Summit Series began when Bisnow wanted to meet more young entrepreneurs. Most of us in that situation might decide to go to networking events, or perhaps move to a bigger city. Not Bisnow. Bisnow cold-called young entrepreneurs, asking if they wanted to get a group together and hang out for a weekend. He gathered 20 young leaders, including the founders of TOMS Shoes and the websites Thrillist and CollegeHumor, and took them for a weekend’s skiing on his own money. He didn’t actually have the money, instead he put the $30,000 in upfront costs on a credit card. Then he began cold-calling companies to ask if they wanted to sponsor a conference of the top young entrepreneurs in the US. Companies started saying yes, and Summit Series was born. Bisnow was out of his depth. He had to ask his mother what food he should provide. Granola bars? Apples? He had no idea. But he worked it out, and ever since, he’s tried to live by the philosophy that you should bite off more than you can chew – be ambitious, aim high and work out the details later. It certainly worked for Bisnow. Summit Series is now a huge enterprise, and very popular among the business and cultural elite. Attend an event, and you might hear Richard Branson telling entrepreneurial tales in the morning, listen to national poetry slam champion IN-Q in the afternoon and hear Erin Brockovich discuss social justice, all in the same day. Bisnow and his co-founders even bought an entire ski-resort in Utah to act as a base for an exclusive, entrepreneurial community. Bisnow is the living embodiment of what you can achieve if you aim high. When Banayan tried to approach Bill Gates for an interview, he got this message from Gates’s office: he would never get an interview while he didn’t have a publishing deal. So Banayan set out to find a publishing deal. The key to this was finding a literary agent. From that point on, Banayan’s motto was “get a literary agent, get Bill Gates.” Banayan read books about how to get published and approached literary agents by the handful. He’d met plenty of entrepreneurs through Bisnow, and asked those with book deals to introduce him to their agents. He was doing everything right, but only getting rejected. There was one literary agent left on his list, and she such was a superstar – she’d even rejected Tim Ferriss for his first book – that it seemed pointless even to approach her. It was Banayan’s college friend Brandon who changed his mind. Brandon was a bookworm and told Banayan a story he’d once read about Walmart. It was the year 2000, and brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart were being hit hard by online shops like Amazon. Walmart was panicking about losing market-share, so they tried to replicate Amazon’s tech and strategy. But it didn’t work. One day, a new executive tried something: She hung a banner up in the office that said, “You can’t out-Amazon Amazon.” Soon afterward, Walmart’s market share boomed as they focused on executing their own business strategy, not copying Amazon’s. Banayan, Brandon explained, was Walmart. All he’d been doing was copying other people’s strategies for success. He’d been pitching to literary agents as if he was Tim Ferriss, but without the platform and fame that Ferriss had. Since Banayan had started his mission, he’d studied how successful people got ahead. But while that’s a good way to learn, he discovered he couldn’t tackle every problem that way. On this occasion, he needed his own playbook. That night, unable to sleep, Banayan got up and wrote an email to his number-one-target literary agent. Instead of repeating his usual spiel, he wrote out why he believed in his mission. He wrote that together, the two of them could change the world. The email was more like a teenage love note than a professional email, but he sent it. A day later, she offered to represent him. After securing his book deal, Banayan eventually persuaded Bill Gates’s office to set up an interview. Researching ahead of the meeting, Banayan discovered an incident that he felt explained Gates’s early success. It resonated with Banayan, who had always suffered from nerves when he needed to make an important phone call or conversation. The lesson? Sometimes you have to break through your discomfort. Aged just 19, Gates and his partner Paul Allen heard that a computer company, MITS, had released the first minicomputer onto the market. Gates saw an opportunity, and the two of them wrote to MITS proposing to sell software to run on the machine. After getting no response, they debated how to follow up. Neither Bill nor Paul wanted to make the phone call. Both were nervous. Eventually, Bill took the leap. Taking some deep breaths, he told the founder of MITS that they wanted to come in and present some software. It worked, and they got the meeting. There was one small problem – the software didn’t exist. But eight weeks of hard work later, they presented their new code, signed a deal, and made the first of many millions of sales. Having the bravery to make that phone call ultimately kicked off their success. When the interview finally took place in Gates’s office, Banayan asked him for advice on negotiation and strategy in the early days of your career. Gates had two key pieces of advice: Firstly, if you’re young, you need a way to blast through people’s skepticism. When Gates went to sales meetings, he would overwhelm people with his expertise, talking fast and in great depth about programming language and software platforms until it was clear that he wasn’t some dumb kid. Secondly, he surprised Banayan by saying that when establishing Microsoft in the early 1980s, he prioritized strategic positioning over immediate profit. When Microsoft began selling to IBM, he took the decision not to push for too much money to ensure he got the deal. He knew that rivals to IBM would emerge and that the prestige of working with IBM would help Microsoft sell to these rivals as well, securing higher profits. The lesson was clear: when starting out, take the position that will help you in the long term over short-term profits. One day, at a party hosted by his friend, Miki Agrawal, founder of the period-proof underwear business THINX, Banayan saw Tony Hsieh, CEO of online shoe retailer Zappos. Hsieh was walking around with a clipboard that had “Wishes List” written on it, explaining that, for one day, he was acting as fairy godmother. When Hsieh asked Banayan what he wished for, Banayan knew straight away. I want to be the Zappos CEO for the day, he said. His 20th birthday was coming up soon and he wondered if he could shadow Hsieh. Hsieh was a little surprised, but agreed. While giving him marketing advice, Hsieh told Banayan that he should consider his end goals for the book. Most people don’t consider what their goals are, and if they do, they’re often not honest about them. In doing so, he helped Banayan understand that it’s okay to embrace your ego. Hsieh himself had written a bestseller, Delivering Happiness. For Hsieh, when he wrote Delivering Happiness, one motive was definitely vanity and ego. He thought it would be nice to tell his mum and dad that his book was number one on the bestsellers lists. This surprised Banayan, who’d always thought of an ego as a bad thing. But Hsieh went on to explain that it’s worse to have an ego and deceive yourself that you don’t. In reality, it’s better to accept that you can accommodate an ego alongside other goals, such as wanting to inspire young entrepreneurs. The other lesson Banayan learned from his time with Hsieh was the power of asking for help. While shadowing Hsieh in and out of meetings and through a company-wide presentation, Banayan noticed Zappos employees throwing him a few jealous looks. One approached him to say he’d worked at Zappos for years and dreamed of shadowing the boss. How did Banayan get so lucky? Later that day, while thanking Hsieh for his time, Banayan asked the CEO why he didn’t let his employees shadow him sometimes. Hsieh looked blank. He’d be happy to, he said. But no-one ever asked him if they could. Banayan pursued Warren Buffett for an interview for months. He even flew to Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, in the hope of bumping into him, only to discover he arrived at the same time as the worst snow-storm for 30 years. Banayan never met the “Oracle of Omaha,” and instead spent time in his hotel room shivering from the cold. Having read everything there is to know about Buffett, he picked up a few lessons in success. The first was to find out what people need and use that to get access to them. In 1951, after Buffett finished his studies, he set himself up as a stockbroker. But every time he tried to get a meeting with a local businessman, they turned him down. Who wants to meet some young guy with no track record, trying to sell stocks? So Buffet thought of a different approach: He started calling business people, telling them he could help save them from paying too high taxes. Now they finally wanted to meet, and Buffett was able to kick-start his career. Banayan figured out that maybe people don’t want to talk to you for the reasons you want to talk to them, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t talk at all. You just need to figure out what they want. He received a similar lesson when he met Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and the first drug infusion pump, among other innovations. Kamen explained that sometimes it’s best to look at a problem from a different angle. Not so long ago, there’d been something of a crisis in science and technology education in the US. Many people saw this as an educational crisis and tried to solve it by improving the education system – tinkering with course content and training new teachers. Kamen, however, believed that it was a culture crisis. He created a competition called FIRST – a non-profit which treats high-school engineering like sport by running national and international robotics competitions screened on NBC and NASA TV. FIRST has now impacted millions of lives. So, Kamen said, don’t get frustrated if you don’t break through. Reframe the question in a way that allows you to find a solution. After hearing who Banayan was interviewing, one man said he didn’t feel worthy of being on the list. He was also, by some distance, the happiest guy Banayan had met. Steve Wozniak was, alongside Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. But unlike Jobs, or Gates, or Buffett, Wozniak has never been seen as a business tycoon, largely because he left Apple in 1985. When Banayan ate lunch with Wozniak in Cupertino, California, Wozniak oozed happiness. He seemed to genuinely love his life, from his loving relationship with his wife to the cuteness of his dogs and the excitement of his upcoming road trip. Why all this happiness? Wozniak was happy, he said, because he felt he was living life on his own terms and doing what he wants to do, not what society dictates is the right thing. For example, early on in the Apple story, Steve Jobs was the obvious choice for CEO. Where Wozniak was going to fit into the executive team wasn’t so clear. The last thing he wanted to do was manage staff or deal with internal politics, so he told Jobs he wanted to be a simple engineer. This was something he already knew he loved and was happy to continue doing. Maybe society says that you should reach the highest position possible, Wozniak said. But is that really what’ll make you happiest? Wozniak’s determination to live life on his own terms also meant living by his values. This often put him in conflict with Jobs. When Apple was filing its initial public offering in 1980, Jobs and Wozniak were all set for a huge payout. Both would become ultra-rich. But Wozniak discovered that Jobs had refused to give stock options to some employees who’d been with Apple since the beginning. Wozniak saw these people as family. After all, they’d helped make the company what it was. But Jobs wouldn’t budge. In the end, Wozniak gifted some of his own shares to the old employees, so they too could share in the financial reward. The day Apple went public, they became millionaires. Of the two men, Jobs has gone down in history as the more successful. But as Wozniak sat back, opening a fortune cookie and laughing happily, his success seemed obvious too. The key message in these blinks: We all have the power to make little choices that can alter our lives forever – to pick up the phone and make that first sales call, bite off more than we can chew, or simply follow our vision. You have the power to choose. You can accept the inertia in your life and continue waiting in line for the First Door. Or you can duck out of the line, run around the back, and take the Third Door. The choice is in your hands.  Actionable advice: Have a pipeline.  Whatever you’re trying to achieve, build a pipeline of opportunities. Say you want to work in a startup. Don’t concentrate on just one, or two. Build a pipeline and approach them all. You’ll never know which one of your hundred startup CEOs woke up this morning thinking “We really need a new sales guy.” Building a pipeline is one way of increasing the chances that you’ll get lucky.

Most of this advice is hogwash, but some of it isn’t. These blinks present a simple and straightforward plan based on advice from distinguished financial expert Dave Ramsey. If you follow his plan, you’ll stand a greater chance of getting your finances in order and becoming financially secure – that is, reaching financial fitness – something we all dream of. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you aren’t as comfortable as you think you are; why it might not be worth it to attend college; and why you shouldn’t eat an elephant in just one sitting. Would you say you’re financially comfortable? Many of us feel secure enough in our finances, even though we all could use a few extra dollars. You probably have a job, and perhaps a car and house, and financial difficulties therefore seem far, far away. But no matter how secure you may feel at this moment, financial insecurity may be closer than you think. Imagine you suddenly lose your job: What would you do? Would you be able to pay your bills? Unlikely. Financial security is often more illusory than we think. Take the author’s client Sarah, for example. After her marriage she and her husband calculated their joint annual income to be over $75,000, and they had only a few debt obligations between the two of them. Feeling comfortable with their earnings and their debt, they proceeded to take out a large mortgage on their house. But that’s okay, right? They could afford it. Or could they? One day Sarah discovered that she was losing her $45,000-per-year job. Suddenly, they faced foreclosure on the house.    As in Sarah’s case, sudden financial setbacks can put us quickly in dire straits. What can we do? One way to avoid unpleasant surprises is by taking action before it’s too late. Change things now. It’s easy not to feel this sense of urgency, to think instead that you can simply carry on until things turn sour, and then change. But this is totally irresponsible. Financial difficulties sometimes creep up on you, and before you know it, you’re in trouble. It’s like the proverbial frog in the pot of water: As the water slowly heats up, the frog doesn’t realize that it’s being boiled alive and will let itself die. This is what is happening to you right now. Your financial security could be slowly collapsing around you, and you have no idea. It’s time to make a change. In our modern world, we are constantly encouraged to go out and buy stuff – a house, a car, a huge TV, you name it. And how exactly are we supposed to pay for all these things that we simply must have? With credit, of course. Debt today is so ingrained in our lifestyle that it’s hard to imagine living without it. You probably have a decent amount of debt yourself, whether in the form of student loans, a mortgage, credit card debt or car payments. In fact, debt is so embedded in our society that one of the author’s clients felt okay with having $72,000 in debt on a rental property and $35,000 on credit cards and student loans. Though debt seems to be ever-present, it is absolutely not the path to financial happiness, and instead leads straight to financial difficulty. Take one of the most common forms of debt: the credit card. Credit cards, which feel essentially like free money, give users incredible spending power. In the long run, however, they can hurt our financial strength. In fact, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, 69 percent of people who file for bankruptcy say it was caused by their credit card debt. Interestingly, while many people use debt to create the appearance of wealth, genuinely wealthy people tend to avoid debt entirely. In fact, 75 percent of people on the Forbes 400 list said the best way to build wealth is to become and stay debt-free. And some of the most successful companies, from Walgreen's and Cisco to Harley-Davidson, are run completely debt-free. If these companies and individuals are able to find success without the burden of debt, then can’t we do the same? So far, we’ve established one way not to establish financial security: trying to spend our way to success using credit. So what can we do? You’ll need to start by creating a step-by-step plan that charts the route to financial fitness. Although you know you need to change the way you approach your finances, you must also realize that you can’t change everything at once. Instead, you should do yourself the favor of proceeding slowly, one small step at a time. Just think: if you had to eat an elephant, you wouldn’t even think to try and do it all at once. You would start maybe with a foot per day, moving eventually to the trunk, then the body, eating bit by bit. You want to take the same approach with your finances. If you try to attack different areas all at once – for example, your mortgage, credit card and 401k – then you’ll dilute your efforts and, ultimately, fail. So, go slow and take small bites. But where do you start? The first step on your Total Money Makeover is to grow a starter emergency fund, a $1,000 chunk set aside in case of a rainy day. In fact, Money Magazine estimates that 78 percent of us will experience a major negative life event, such as an unexpected pregnancy or car problem, in any given ten-year period. You’ll want to be prepared for when this happens. And while $1,000 won’t cover that much, it’s nevertheless a useful start and will reduce the likelihood of having to go into debt. But remember: this fund is only for emergencies, and if you have to take anything from it, you should replace it as soon as possible. Once you have your emergency starter fund set up, you’re on your way to turning your finances around. Now it’s time to get your debts sorted out. Step two of the Total Money Makeover is to create a debt snowball. Everyone knows that if you start rolling a small snowball along the ground, it will, in no time at all, turn into a veritable snow boulder. The same thing happens when you pay off your debts. Here’s how: Start by listing all your debts in order of size, from your tiny phone bill to your massive mortgage. Then it’s time to get serious about paying them off, starting with the smallest. As the small debts start to disappear, you’ll get inspired to tackle those bigger, trickier debts. After you’ve started rolling your debt snowball, it’s time to turn your attention back to your emergency fund. The goal of step three is to grow your emergency fund so that it could cover your expenses for a three to six month period. Of course, everyone has different spending needs, so this number isn’t fixed. However, it often ranges from $5,000 to $25,000. To make things more concrete, if your family earns $3,000 per month, aim to save $10,000 or even more.   Now let’s say you succeeded and have a bigger emergency fund. You’ll find that this gives you the confidence to continue on the path toward financial freedom. If, as you pay off your debts, you have to use some – or even all – of your savings and retirement funds, you’ll have an emergency fund that’ll cover you for half a year. That allows you to get on with your life securely and confidently. Everyone has big worries about the financial situation they’ll face after retirement. We ask ourselves: Will we have enough money to live comfortably in our golden years? In order to overcome such fears, we turn to step four of the Total Money Makeover: A dignified and secure retirement will require you to invest 15 percent of your income. Although this might seem like a lot, there are a number of reasons why it’s worth setting aside that kind of money. For starters, old age simply wouldn’t be any fun if you had to rely on others to maintain a comfortable living. This is especially true if you are hoping to live off government pension plans. By the time you reach retirement age, the chances of our inept government providing for a dignified life are negligible. It can be tempting to put aside less for retirement so that you can focus on things like your children’s college fund or quickly paying down the mortgage. But your kids’ degrees won't feed you after you retire, and too many senior citizens live in a paid-for house with no disposable income. Once you have committed to putting away 15 percent of your income, where exactly should you invest it? For the best returns, the author recommends mutual funds. Throughout history, the stock market averages just below 12 percent in returns. Mutual funds take advantage of this trend, and thus make for an excellent choice for long-term investment. One tip is to select funds that have a solid track record of winning for more than five years, ideally for over ten. Make sure to diversify your investments across various funds to ensure profitability. Here’s a another good rule to follow: allocate 25 percent to growth and income (or blue chip) funds, 25 percent to growth (or equity) funds, 25 percent to international funds and the final 25 percent to aggressive funds, i.e., ones that are riskier but can give higher returns. Nearly every parent dreams of sending their child to college, and many parents are prepared to let themselves and their children go into debt to fund this dream. But as we’ve already discussed, debt is to be avoided at all costs. Funding college with debt should not be considered a tenable option. A college loan will hamper your child for a long, long time. The current generation of students has earned the nickname “generation debt” with good reason – they graduate from college with an average of $25,000 to $27,000 in debt, and it’s not going away anytime soon. So how should you pay for college? One way, of course, is to win a scholarship, or to simply save up enough in cash to foot the bill. Yet, there is another way: using an Education Savings Account (ESA) and funding it in a growth-stock mutual fund. If you were to invest $2,000 a year in a prepaid tuition plan, from the birth of your child until their eighteenth birthday, you would end up with $72,000 worth of tuition. However, if you instead used an ESA funded by mutual funds (which average 12 percent), you’d have $126,000 to spend on education and living expenses. And as long as you use this account to pay education expenses, the money is tax-free. But, even with this option, you must ask yourself whether a college degree is the right thing to invest in for your child. In his book Emotional Intelligence, about successful people, Daniel Goleman states that only 15 percent of success can be attributed to training and education. The remaining 85 percent is attributed to attitude, perseverance, diligence and vision. These latter qualities will take you much further in life than some piece of paper with the words “degree” scrawled on it. So does your kid need to go to college? If getting there means going into debt, then certainly not. So how long have you been paying off your mortgage? Often, they take decades to finally pay off. Step six of the Total Money Makeover is about paying it off as soon as possible. For most people, this is the final hurdle on their path to financial fitness, and paying it off will leave them absolutely debt-free. However, there are many pitfalls that can prevent you from finishing off your mortgage. It’s your job to avoid them. For example, you’ll hear it suggested that you should borrow money against your home, taking advantage of low interest rates and investing your money in the stock market. But this is terrible advice. Imagine, hypothetically, that you borrow $100,000 against your home at  8-percent interest and invest it in stocks with 12-percent return. In this scenario, you stand to make $12,000 in profit. After paying the interest on your mortgage, in this case $8,000, you’d have a healthy $4,000 left over. Not so bad. But that doesn’t take into consideration all the taxes and fees that go hand in hand with playing the stock market. In the end, you’re left with around $1,000. Hardly worth it for such a huge risk. Another misconception is that it’s possible to take out a 30-year mortgage with the promise to pay it back in 15 years. But you will inevitably run into expenses that take you off course – high heating bills, dog vaccinations, sick children and so on. And if they aren’t compelled by law to do so, virtually no one ever makes the extra payments necessary to pay off a loan that quickly. However, it’s often better to simply take a shorter mortgage out anyway. In comparison to a 30-year mortgage at 7 percent, a 15-year mortgage will earn you a savings of $150,000 over the course  of the mortgage. Think about what you could do with that kind of money. At this point, you’re right on the brink of financial fitness. You’re on the last leg of your journey, with just one final step to go. Once you are debt-free and have begun to save for your future, it’s time to start building up your wealth. Surround yourself with experts, people like tax advisors, CPAs, estate-planning attorneys, etc., who can offer you sound advice on what you need to do with your money.   And no matter what, stick to your plan. As you grow older, you’ll find yourself more inclined to react to small changes in the market, especially if you fear a downturn is looming. But don’t fret! These small blips are nothing compared to the market’s trend of long-term growth. Finally, understand that financial fitness doesn’t mean living like a Scrooge. Have fun with your money when you can. Fun is a crucial element of the Total Money Makeover. Should anyone wear a $30,000 watch? Drive a $50,000 car? Or live in a $700,000 home? Absolutely. But only if they can actually afford them. You have to learn to spend your money only on what you can afford, and forget the rest. When the right opportunity presents itself, you should also be prepared to give your money away. Giving money away is just as fun as spending it, and possibly even more rewarding. It feels good being generous – but you need to have before you can give. At last, you’ve completed your journey to financial freedom. Now it’s time to enjoy it, living in comfort, happiness and security. The key message in this book: For most people, financial security is little more than a comforting illusion. However, you can turn your financial situation around by following seven “baby steps” that put you on the path to a debt-free and financially successful life. Actionable advice: Learn to live your own life.  You probably have some friends who appear to be pretty well off. Yet, a lot of people appear to be doing better than they actually are. Debt allows for this illusion, but it will eventually crumble beneath them. So don’t measure yourself against your peers.   Suggested further reading : MONEY: Master the Game by Tony Robbins Do you want to master money, and make it work for you?

Work your own hours? Only have clients you want to work for? Many do, and this is why so many people are becoming freelancers. And yet, for all these plus sides, being a freelancer can be a struggle. All freelancers know the pain of not being able to go out with friends because of a late running project, or begging for rent money from parents because work is going slow. But it doesn’t have to be this way. You can have the freedom and security, but how? The following blinks contain 12 secrets that every freelancer, no matter what their expertise might be, should commit to memory. In these blinks you’ll discover why every good freelancer needs a buzz piece; why you should turn your day into a jigsaw; and why you need to live in the middle of a wealthy triangle. Every freelancer, no matter how relaxed they seem, is constantly under pressure. Even when business is booming and money is flowing in, certain fears linger in the back of the mind. What if work dries up next month? What if a competitor undercuts me next week? However, these fears aren’t a reason to reject freelancing. Rather, by accepting the realities of constant pressure in freelancing, you’ll unlock the first secret to success. Because it is always possible that work will dry up, or a rival will snatch your clients, you’ll need to prepare yourself for the moment catastrophe strikes. Use the acronym IDEA to memorize the four techniques that will help you think positively, no matter what the situation. First, you’ll need to Invest in your success. There’s a whole host of coaching services, books, teleseminars and online resources available on how to make your freelance business prosper. So use them! Learn from the achievements of successful freelancers, and learn from their mistakes. In short: invest in learning and get as much information as you can. Next, Develop an unshakable belief in yourself. Think of J.K. Rowling, Warren Buffett and Stephen Spielberg. If they strike you as people who’ve achieved what you’d never be able to, think again. They’re normal people too, and just like you, they had to start somewhere. Nobody ever got anywhere without a big dose of self-belief. But you’ve also got to Expect that this belief will be tested. There are always times of self-doubt. Before her worldwide success, J.K. Rowling found it hard to get published at all, and money was very tight to say the least. Just remember that these dark moments are always temporary. Tell yourself that they’ll pass, and they surely will. Finally, be sure to Absorb that satisfying feeling of success. If your business is going well, enjoy it! It’s exactly what you’ve been working so hard for. With the IDEA acronym in mind you’ll always have something to guide you when the going gets tough. Now that you’ve uncovered the first secret to success in freelancing, it’s time to dive in. It all starts with finding the right clients. As a freelancer, you take on the challenge of finding your own work. Which of course means finding clients who want your skills and expertise. But who are these clients? Where are they? And how can you attract them to you? Enter the second secret of freelancing: the Master Marketing Formula. This formula will lead you right to your desired clients in five steps. It starts with some list-making. Compile 150 to 200 names of organizations and industries where your skills, experience and knowledge will give you the best chance of attracting clients. It’s vital that you get specific with this. Suppose you’re a freelance marketing consultant who is highly experienced in working for marketing managers in midsize, up-and-coming software firms. This narrowed focus will allow you to determine which potential clients suit your skills best. On to the second step, in which you start generating leads. Start working your way through the list of companies that you’ve drawn up and making contact with those parties. If they seem interested, provide them with additional compelling information. Outline your area of expertise and highlight your previous successes in a way that demonstrates just how suitable you are for their needs. If your lead is genuinely interested, then it’s time to make step three happen: turn them into clients. Provide them with any extra information they request, and give them more. Offer as much help and assistance as you can so they can see how great it would be to work with you. Prospect still with you? If so, let’s move on to the fourth step of this formula. Give your client a quote for your services. If you and the client are happy with the agreed price, then close the sale! And what if you don’t get the job in the end? Follow step five and don’t give up! Instead, stay in contact with the prospect. This way you’ll be the first person they think of when they have a new project and need a freelancer. This formula is a powerful tool for finding the work you want to do. But if you want to open up your options even further, then you might want to put the third secret of successful freelancers into action. What is it? Find out next! As we found out back in the first blink, there are inevitably times when work is scarce. If you want to give yourself the best chance possible of always having a project on your hands, then the third secret is something you should consider: writing a buzz piece.  Usually a short report between five and ten pages long, a buzz piece will help you to position yourself as an expert in your industry. You’ve got a whole range of options when it comes to format: a workbook, checklist, toolkit, how-to guide or a simple list of tips are all great choices. It’s choosing the right topic for your buzz piece that is more of a challenge. Take Dave, for example. As a graphic designer, he put time and effort into a buzz piece that described how to design an effective logo. But after sending it to 350 companies, he didn’t receive the response he was hoping for. In fact, he hardly received a response at all! His structure and content were great, so what was the problem? He’d chosen the wrong topic. Think about it: Who’d be interested in a special report on drafting logos? Other graphic designers. Dave had created a buzz piece that did indeed demonstrate his expertise, but he was addressing his colleagues when he should have been addressing potential clients instead. By changing the topic to choosing the best logo for a business, Dave received a far better response from prospects. Of course, a buzz piece with a great focus is nothing without a great title. All you need is a headline that makes a prospect think something along the lines of “Wow, that sounds interesting, I could really use this information.” The title of Dave’s second buzz piece was “A Five-Step Strategy for Selecting the Perfect Logo Design,” a perfect example of how your title can draw clients in. Put time and effort into a well-focused buzz piece with a title that does it justice and you’ll have something to be proud of. Next time you want to give a prospect your business card, give him a free copy of your buzz piece, too. Finding clients is one hurdle for freelancers, but keeping them is a whole new challenge. With the right strategies, however, maintaining existing client relationships while building new ones will be a breeze. One great strategy that every freelancer should be making use of is the Marketing Effectiveness Matrix. By assessing your MEM, you’ll know exactly which marketing strategies are the best for attracting and maintaining your clients. We can think of marketing as comprised of four quadrants. The first quadrant contains tactics that are highly effective and time efficient. This includes encouraging work with existing clients and direct mailing. The second quadrant entails tactics that are effective, but take a little more time to develop, such as public speaking, networking or e-newsletters. Third quadrant strategies require some effort, but give you little in return most of the time. For example, posting on online job boards or developing a social media presence. The fourth quadrant represents tactics that take up lots of time, but don’t give you much in return – cold calling is a typical example of this. Now that we know which quadrants do what, which should you focus on? That’s right, the ones that give you the best returns. A smart freelancer will therefore use a combination of strategies from quadrants one and two. The way you approach quadrant two depends on your specific area of expertise. Techniques from quadrant one, however, can be applied to any discipline. Every client you gain is an opportunity for repeat business, but only if you treat them right. It’s vital that you develop strong personal relationships with clients. For example, let’s say you’ve started working as a freelance copywriter for a company. Instead of just doing your job and saying goodbye as you flee the office, you could ask to be introduced to other employees, then strike up a few friendships. If you stay in touch with coworkers even after your project together is completed, you’ll be the first person they think of when there’s another project on the horizon. If there’s one thing freelancers complain about, it’s the fact that their jobs are either incredibly busy with lots of work, or exhaustingly slow with every prospect out of reach. Little do they know that this problem is quite simple to solve! The easiest way to avoid those slow periods in your freelance work is by keeping in touch with previous clients. That means both email and phone, so you can maintain your relationship after the project is over. But what if you’ve already dropped out of touch? It’s not too late! You can add them to your monthly e-newsletter, or even just drop them a message that looks a little something like this: “Hi, came across this article recently. Thought you’d find it interesting.” Sent with your business card, it’s a gentle reminder to your client that yes, you do still exist! Encouraging repeat clients isn’t the only way you can minimize the time spent twiddling your thumbs. Another way is to use the Discover, Identify and Position (DIP) Technique to focus your work. Imagine you’re a US freelance photographer of Egyptian descent, and with lots of experience. First, discover your passion. What is it that sets you apart? For you, your Egyptian heritage, love of traveling to that country and strong knowledge of its art and culture. Next, identify the market you could work for. In your case, you might want to focus on companies that offer services and products related to Egyptian culture or history. Finally, think of your position in that market. By looking at what you’ve discovered and identified, you can position yourself as skilled freelancer for importers and exporters of Egyptian goods, Egyptian tourism firms and Egyptian-to-English translation services. With the DIP technique, you won’t have to scramble for work, because you’ll already know exactly where and how to get it! How much is your work worth? That’s a question that scares many solo professionals. Why? Well, as an emerging freelancer it can be very difficult to find an appropriate fee. Charging an hourly rate often seems like the easiest option, but don’t be fooled! There are some significant disadvantages to it. Firstly, clients don’t like it. One freelancing expert even noticed that when he told clients that he charged services per hour, they began speaking faster on the phone immediately! When you bill an hourly rate of, let’s say, $45 per hour, your income is determined by the number of hours you work each week. So if you spend 35 hours per week working on projects for clients, your income will be around $45,000 annually. That’s not bad, but you will never get much better, and you have to consider that you won’t get paid for hours you spend on bookkeeping and marketing. Being a project pricer is far more advantageous. Project pricing means that you provide your client with a fixed price for the project work. One of the benefits of this type of pricing is that your client won’t know the amount of hours you spend on the project, and you won’t have to prepare tedious timesheets for him. You can charge far more for your expertise. This means that as you get better and faster at your job, prices go up, instead of going down as your hours shrink. Who wouldn’t want their commute to work to be as short as walking into the room nextdoor? Working from home is one much-coveted benefit of freelancing. But working at home can make it incredibly hard to concentrate. Luckily, your lack of focus is easily solved with two clever techniques. The first of these is the 50 Minute Focus, which will help you structure your workday as efficiently as possible. The 50 Minute Focus means selecting the project you need to work on for the day, setting an alarm for 50 minutes and getting to work. Don’t check your emails, don’t take a break and don’t let your mind wander. If that sounds hard, remember that you only have to do it for less than an hour. When your timer rings, stop working and do something that lets your mind unplug completely. When you’re ready, do it all over again. One freelance graphic designer and mom found that the 50 Minute Focus took her productivity to a whole new level. She used to spend all day working, getting distracted constantly. But after adopting the process she found she could do all her work in just three 50 minute focused sprints! Another invaluable technique to keep yourself productive is the Jigsaw Puzzle Visual. Picture the tasks on your to-do list as pieces of a larger puzzle. Less urgent tasks are smaller puzzle pieces, while more important ones are larger. As you work on these tasks, keep updating how your pieces fit together. For example, suppose your puzzle has four pieces: your direct-mail campaign, a current client project, a commercial real estate opportunity, and preparing the proposal for an article you want to write. After finding out that your proposal has been accepted, you’ll need to reprioritize your time so that you can spend a few hours each week writing it. Thus the article piece of the puzzle will grow, which means other pieces have to shrink. This technique is incredibly helpful, not just because it keeps you aware of your priorities, but also because it reminds you that using your time productively isn’t about working more. It’s about fitting things into the bigger picture, so that you get things done without burning out! There comes a time in your freelancing career when you spend almost all of your time on work, while your personal life suffers as a result. But it doesn’t have to be this way! If you want to maintain a strong cash flow but also catch a break when you need it, then start thinking about how you can maximize your passive income.  Active income is everything you earn while you work. Passive income is money you can earn in your sleep. Sounds crazy? Let’s look at an example. A scout sells lemonade every hot Sunday afternoon. He earns ten cents for each beverage he sells to his neighbors. But when his mother calls him in for dinner, he has to stop selling. As a result, the dimes – his active income – stop rolling in. Now let’s imagine this scout is clever, and publishes a neat little recipe book on how to brew the perfect lemonade. Assuming the book sells well, this scout can earn money even while he plays football with his friends. That’s the benefit of passive income. Start brainstorming what alternative, passive streams of income you can create from your skills, and you’re on the way to becoming a wealthy freelancer. A very common problem freelancers face when it comes to work–life balance is that the more they earn, the less free time they have. Living and working in the Wealthy Triangle means you’re at the point where you have a) great income, b) freedom to choose the jobs you want, and c) the flexibility of a real freelancer. By following all the steps in these blinks, you’ll reach your maximum earning potential. Then compare this with how much you need to enjoy your life. Earn that amount as efficiently as you can, and you can then enjoy the free time you’ve worked for! The key message in this book: Be sure of the goals, income and lifestyle you want to have as a freelancer and stay focused on every project, without losing track of future prospects, projects and streams of income.

This commercial savvy has often been presented in a negative light; however, in spite of these goyish aspersions, the ability to produce wealth that’s often ascribed to Jewish people is now generally recognized as a positive and enviable attribute. But why have Jews become successful in business and how can it serve as inspiration for others? Jewish prosperity in business is rooted in the books and oral history that make up the Jewish religious canon. In combination with Jewish traditions, the Torah, Talmud and other sources have inspired and guided Jews for millennia. These blinks reveal how you – or anyone who wants to succeed in business – can draw inspiration from these sources as well. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a minyan is a good way to make business connections; that a good leader must first be able to follow; and what the Star of David teaches us about change. If you’re familiar with Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, you know that the Jewish character of Shylock is portrayed as a greedy and vengeful loan shark who’s only interested in money. Unfortunately, this derogatory portrayal of the Jewish businessman has persisted. In addition to this negative image, there are many false theories about why Jews have tended to have business success. One absurd theory suggests that Jews evolved in such a way that moneymaking is simply part of their DNA. Jews have survived countless periods of persecution, so it’s been suggested that only wealthy Jews survived these ordeals since they could buy their way out. Therefore, the future generations of Jews were born with a so-called “money gene.” Another nasty theory is that all Jews are cheaters. However, this enduring myth is refuted by the Torah, the holy book that defines Jewish law. It specifically calls for people to maintain an honest reputation when doing business. Any instances of cheating would be a direct offense against God. Then there’s the conspiracy theory that Jews are part of some secret society. While it’s true that community is an important part of Jewish life, Jews also tend to be very argumentative, so it’s ridiculous to think they could keep some secret organization together and under wraps. People also often think of Jews as possessing superior intelligence. But intelligence generally doesn’t increase monetary gain since people with higher IQs tend to become academics and scientists, not business leaders. When Jewish people do become successful, it’s because they’ve received a good education at home and in the synagogue. A Jewish home is often filled with books, and the centrality of education in Jewish life is why Jews throughout history have had high literacy rates. This is also why, even though Jews only comprise 0.2 percent of the world’s population, there is a disproportionately large number of books published every year concerning Jewish themes. In addition to the Torah’s teachings, there are also oral traditions that continue to be passed down. A common lesson is to sacrifice present pleasures for future benefits – a reminder that putting in hard work today may well lead to a successful business tomorrow. It’s not uncommon for corporations and businesses to be demonized by politicians and the media. And this can turn people’s attention away from the job creation and the charitable work that comes from the private sector. On a more personal level, a healthy business venture can also make people feel better about themselves. It’s not unlike someone being part of a clinical trial and being given a placebo: the patient often ends up feeling better just by being part of the program. The same can happen when someone is part of a noble business pursuit. Due to the teachings of the Torah, Jews will apply this kind of morality to doing business and earning money. Jewish wisdom teaches us that success only comes if the business has the approval of our friends; it’s this approval that creates the passion and drive behind the endeavor. We’re also urged to be virtuous and ethical. When we see ourselves as morally upright, running our business in an honest and ethical fashion, we’re less likely to enter illegal or immoral territory. Of course, if someone gets away with cheating, they’ll probably be tempted to cheat again. However, this can be prevented by atonement. Atonement – being “at one” with God – is an important part of Judaism. By atoning, one can “reset” after committing a bad deed. But to reset one has first to learn from what one did wrong and diminish the temptation to repeat the behavior. Here’s a little-known fact: Jews joined the banking profession in an effort to perform a noble service and help others. Jewish tradition views lending money, as opposed to giving money away, as a charitable act. By lending, others can start their own business and retain their independence and dignity in the process. This goes against another misconception: that Jews became bankers to escape oppression. Christians and Muslims tend to subscribe to a literal interpretation of the Bible that prohibits charging interest. But the oral traditions that were passed down – the Jewish laws that were not written in the Torah – taught Jews that there were moral circumstances that permit charging interest. Now that you know some of the noble reasons for getting into business, let’s take a look at how tradition can lead to successful business relationships. In a traditional Jewish workplace, coworkers are not unlike friends and family. But for these kinds of relationships to develop, they have to be genuine. People can sense false intentions, so it won’t work if a friendly environment is forced. You might think of friends and family as being separate from business, but they can actually be a good source of inspiration. For Richard Simon, his personal relationships lead to him becoming a pillar of the publishing world. As a child, Simon saw how much his grandmother and her friend loved doing the Sunday crossword puzzle together. But they would always finish it by Tuesday, which left them with four puzzleless days. Sensing a market for a book full of puzzles, Simon took the idea to his friend Lincoln Schuster, and, before, long the publishing giant Simon and Schuster was born. The communal nature of traditional Jewish life also provides a helpful network of connections. Traditional Jewish prayer requires a quorum of ten men called a minyan; every synagogue in every city has one. So whenever a Jewish businessman is traveling, he can join a minyan and find a number of opportunities to form new relationships. And since this kind of network is always growing and evolving, there are always new possibilities. There are also teachings that can help form successful new relationships by allowing people to better understand themselves and how others perceive them. Once we clearly understand how others see us, we can change things about ourselves that might be hindering a successful relationship. These lessons about self-change are taught by Mussar, a body of ancient Jewish literature. In this context, “change” doesn’t simply mean changing how you appear; it also means changing who you really are. And with this understanding, relationships can take on a deeper, even spiritual, meaning. Are you a perfectionist? Do you end up working longer and harder than others because you’re never satisfied until things are absolutely flawless? Well, trying to be perfect is a fool’s errand because, in fact, nothing is perfect – especially when it comes to business. There is a Jewish belief called “ethical capitalism,” which reminds us that people are taught the ways of business by others and that this, in turn, can lead to corruption. It also reminds us that it’s wrong to blame capitalism for the mistakes of a few capitalists. It helps to look at business as an inanimate object. You can’t blame an object for causing problems; you can only blame the people who misuse it. Bernie Madoff is a perfect example. His Ponzi scheme cheated people out of millions of dollars by means of fraud and false trust. So we must hold Madoff accountable, rather than blaming capitalism. Being moral in your business practices is a challenge since most actions can have both good and bad effects. When we look at the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and the railroad tycoon George Pullman, we see two people who improved society at a great cost to others. Carnegie is considered to be one of the biggest robber barons of the nineteenth century. And though Pullman pioneered US railway expansion, he exploited his workers by charging them higher rates for housing and food. Some workers for the Pullman Company owed more than they ever earned. But business, though far from perfect, doesn’t have to be evil, and there are Jewish traditions that show how one can work morally within the business system. They say business is driven by greed. But Jews are taught that you must provide for yourself before you can help others. By turning people into customers, business is considered dehumanizing. But Jewish tradition offers a different perspective: business emulates God’s creativity by being a source of growth and inventiveness. Business is also sometimes blamed for creating inequality. However, without business, there would be no wealth to sustain the economy. And it’s the government – not business – that’s responsible for just redistribution of this wealth. What comes to mind when you think of a great leader? There have been many great leaders over the years, and Jewish tradition shows us that there are certain characteristics that they all share. One of these characteristics is the ability to follow. Leaders often are, or were, followers. Even Moses, one of history’s greatest leaders, had a mentor: God. Leaders also have a vision and a goal, and they are persuasive in telling people how they’ll achieve it. God’s vision was the world we see before us, and his goal was the Sabbath. That’s why Jews celebrate the Sabbath every Friday night. And leaders aren’t afraid of necessary confrontation. The necessity of confrontation is driven home by the tale of Joseph. Joseph’s brothers, envious of the favor shown him by their father, plotted to kill Joseph. One of these brothers, Judah, instead of confronting his brothers, compromised and suggested they sell Joseph into slavery. This cost Judah his role as leader. If he had stood up to his brothers, it’s likely they would have listened to him and never attempted to kill or enslave Joseph. Leaders also use the power of faith. The power of faith can come in different forms. The most obvious is perhaps daily prayer. Less obvious is the ability to have faith in oneself and to instill that personal faith in others so that goals are achieved. And leaders carry themselves with a respectful presence. There’s a reason the Talmud, an ancient collection of rabbinical doctrines, calls the lion the “King of Beasts.” It’s not the biggest or strongest animal, but it earns its respect through its regal posture and careful movements. Another thing to consider is that there is no single definition of a leader, and that they fill many roles: guiding people through change, being an inspiring role model or helping people develop, for example. More often than not, people don’t become leaders by learning these skills; the role is thrust upon them under extraordinary circumstances. Many believe that New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani would never have been considered a notable leader if it hadn’t been for the chaotic and tumultuous events of 9/11. But this event brought out the leader in Giuliani, and he did an able job of guiding the city out of crisis. Many people fear change. Yet, as we grow older, we’re always learning and changing, even if we’re not aware of it. Judaism teaches us to embrace the fact that all humans are unique and that they continue to change throughout their lives. Once we learn to accept this change, we can then learn to profit from it. The Star of David provides clues for us to follow. The star is comprised of two triangles. The three points of one triangle represent three fixed entities – God, humans and the physical world. The other triangle’s points represent openness to change. Change, though often initially painful, is beneficial in the long run. Some companies go out of business when faced with change. For example, many companies went under when steel replaced cast iron as a construction material in the nineteenth century. But for those that hung on, innovations were soon introduced that allowed them to switch over to the new material, get rid of expensive equipment and retrain or replace employees. In the end, the change brought profits that outweighed the initial loss. Judaism shows us that change is easier to accept when it arrives gradually, which is why events that honor a marriage or a death take place over several days. Moving forward is a matter of staying connected to the parts of your life that will never change and remaining open to the things that should or have to change. This applies to successful business, too. Stay rooted to the company’s core values and mission statement, but don’t close yourself off to other opportunities. Disney does this well. It maintains a commitment to wholesome family entertainment, but that doesn’t stop it from buying other companies like Miramax to produce more adult-oriented fare. But be sure that you’ve actually set your roots in the company, and not, for instance, in capital from investors. Here’s a cautionary tale: there was once a successful family of jewelers in Montreal, and, in the late 1990s, the sons moved the business to Los Angeles to take advantage of the dot-com boom. The economy soon tanked and the jewelry business started losing money. This prompted the sons to move the business back to Montreal, to their roots, and, sure enough, success returned when they did. People also fear the uncertainty of the future. However, you can minimize uncertainty by making accurate predictions – something that’s not really that hard to do. The Talmud is explicit about how the wise are different from the prophetic: While a prophet can look into the future, the wise can look at today’s events and see what consequences they’ll have tomorrow. You don’t have to be a genius to see what the future has in store. You can actually train yourself to figure it out, but, to do that well, you must keep your ego and ambitions out of the equation. Ego can obscure the obvious. For instance, the crucial difference between Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill, two of history’s most intelligent British politicians, is that Chamberlain’s ego prevented him from seeing Hitler for who he really was. Churchill’s sight, on the other hand, remained unclouded by ego and ambition. To make an accurate forecast, you don’t need to become an expert on every business trend in the world – just the ones that directly affect your business. So, if you work for a tech company, stay informed on regulations that might change how people use the internet. And if you’re in the auto industry, pay attention to trade regulations, which might change the price of materials. Foreseeing the future comes from careful interpretation of both the present and the past. Generally, a steady and stable economy will stay that way unless an outside force brings change. The price of gold, for example, usually remains steady when inflation and civil unrest are at a minimum. However, investors recently noticed that gold prices were remaining stable despite inflation, which is when they realized that Russia was selling off its reserves to counteract inflation and keep investors buying. When Russia stopped interfering, the price of gold went up as predicted. Other things to keep an eye on are patterns and trends. These can be especially helpful in industries like fashion, where trends can help predict what will sell next year. The old adage that \"time is money\" is certainly true. However, there’s more to the equation than that. In the Talmud’s story of Joseph, we also learn that we are money and that money is part of us; it’s impossible to separate the two. Everything we possess – time, dignity, persistence, creativity energy – can be quantified in terms of money. And once we accept this notion, we can move forward and have a healthier relationship with money. Money can also create a bond of trust. This happens every time someone receives a check after performing a service. Money serves as a symbol of reputation as well. For instance, Ford paid nine billion dollars to purchase Jaguar and Volvo not because the companies’ assets were worth that much. Ford was buying their reputations. One of the Jewish terms for money is “zuz,” which, in English, means “to move.” Therefore, money is something that naturally moves between people; when it doesn’t, economies can go into recession or fall apart completely. So money isn’t meant to be kept hidden away or stashed under a mattress. It’s far better to follow Jewish wisdom and use that money for charitable purposes, which can spark the creation of even more wealth. Jewish tradition holds that giving money to charity is more spiritually beneficial to the giver than to the receiver. There’s no rational explanation for this – it’s just the right thing to do. The United States even bases its tax laws on this principle, which is why donations to religious and charitable foundations are not taxed. In fact, one of the best ways to increase your income is to give your money away. No one likes doing business with someone who seems desperate to cling to every penny. It’s better to have a reputation as a giver since most people want to be involved with charitable causes. But remember: though charitableness can come with rewards, you should mainly give because it’s the moral thing to do. Here’s another apt adage: “Life is a journey, not a destination.” One should learn to regard business the same way. This means that we shouldn’t be counting the days to retirement. There’s no reason to stop earning money when we hit a certain age. To retire is to stop providing value to society. It’s also to limit your potential. So pretend you’re an Olympic athlete running the 400-meter dash. You don’t come to a full stop once you hit the finish line; you keep going, even though you’re slowing down. And don’t fixate on the end goal. Focusing on retirement can give you a distorted view of life that may cause you to slow down before you even get there. Instead, be one of the many people who’ve remained active and productive in their later years. At age 65, Harlan Sanders was virtually penniless. He was tired of trying to survive on a small monthly retirement check from the government. And so, for the next 15 years, he sold fried chicken and began the empire known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, now known as KFC. Many people are fooled by three lies that get told about retirement. The first is that work has no real value – that it’s just a means to an end. From this perspective, the only reason to work is to one day no longer have to. Jewish tradition teaches us otherwise. Work has value for the worker and humanity. It gives them dignity and transforms the world around them. Another lie is that we become weaker and less productive in old age. But unless you have an extremely physical job, you’re likely to become more productive as you get older. As you continue to grow your network of contacts, you’ll have more and more opportunities to generate wealth. The third lie is that people are meant to be consumers, not creators. But as we’ve seen in these blinks, spirituality and creating wealth can go hand in hand, and as we get older our connection to our spiritual selves only gets deeper. The key message in this book: We can create success and wealth in business by looking to the ancient teachings and wisdom of Judaism. These principles can be applied to many business situations in the modern world. Actionable advice: Be a numinous networker. It’s easy to think of networking as a way to make quick connections to improve your business. But try thinking about these connections in a deeper, more numinous way – in other words, as deeper, more spiritual relationships. Your business networks should be treated like long-lasting and fruitful relationships that benefit both you and the people you’re working with. Got feedback?

It’s a question we’ve all been asking since the 2008 financial crash. Few people are better placed to answer it than Jim Paul, a city trader who went from hero to zero after losing everything by doubling down on a poor investment decision. It’s often said that pride comes before a fall. But the most important lessons are those we learn when we pick ourselves back up. Paul began his journey back to the top by analyzing his previous behavior and asking himself what psychological factors had shaped his decision-making. These blinks examine the lessons Paul learned along the way. You’ll learn why traders make bad choices, the real key to success in turbulent markets and how to make rational – not emotional – investment decisions. In these blinks, you’ll also find out why understanding loss – not making money – is key to success; how following the crowd can lead us astray; and the difference between financial gambling and sound investment strategies. Jim Paul always wanted one thing in life – to make money, as much of it as he could. Decades later, he was on top of the world and had just made $248,000 in a single day. He’d reached the top young and was brimming with self-confidence. Paul landed a job in futures trading and was soon known to everyone on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. An imposing six foot three, he had a big voice and wasn’t afraid to bark out orders. That’s when things started to go wrong. His unshakable self-belief would prove fatal. Paul was interested in the soybean oil market. Supplies were running low, but demand was buoyant. Prices would rise. Anticipating a spike in the market, Paul bought up positions – a commitment to buy at a later date. Sure that he’d read the market correctly, he exceeded the limits on positions set by the Chicago Board of Trade. Paul’s conviction was so great that he managed to persuade his customers, friends and even his office assistant to get on board with his plan. Why wouldn’t they want to be part of it? They were all going to be rich! Then the market started to turn. Paul didn’t budge. Things had been looking good for months. Now there was political instability and the threat of grain sanctions. Bad weather damaged bean crops. Soybean prices began to dip, and Paul’s losses started to mount. For months, he lost $20,000 every day. Both his clients and other traders had already jumped ship, but Paul remained convinced. He knew the market would turn and they’d regret their decision. The writing was on the wall, but Paul was so confident of his skill as a trader that he couldn’t see what was happening. He was about to lose everything. The end finally came when his manager fired him and seized his assets. By that point, he’d already lost $800,000, half of it borrowed from friends. So why did Paul stick to his decision when all the evidence was pointing the other way? We all love the idea of a shortcut to fame and fortune. Head to your local bookstore, and chances are you’ll find plenty of advice on how to get rich. But it’s hard to know who to trust with so many people out there giving tips. So who do you listen to? Sadly, there isn’t a single trick for getting rich. The gurus of the business world are full of sound advice. Unfortunately, much of what they say is contradictory. Ian Templeton, one of the most successful investors of the twentieth century, tells you to “diversify your investments.” Sounds sensible, right? But along comes Warren Buffett with a net worth of $100 billion and tells you the exact opposite. “Concentrate your investments,” he suggests. That’s pretty confusing. Take a look at any of the books out there telling you how to invest, trade and make a fortune, and you’ll know that the greatest multi-millionaire investors don’t agree on much. So what do they see eye to eye on? There’s one bit of vital advice: Don’t lose money! Warren Buffett has two solid rules when it comes to investing. The first? Never lose money. The second: Never forget rule number one. He’s not the only one. Wall Street legend Bernard Baruch’s top tip was to “learn how to take losses quickly and cleanly.” Jim Rogers built a fortune of $300 million. His nugget of wisdom? Don’t lose money. These investors followed their own paths to the top. Getting rich is personal. What they all had in common was that they knew how to minimize their losses. When Paul set about rebuilding his empire, he realized that his future success depended on internalizing this lesson. How should loss be understood? What’s the best way of processing it? Most importantly, how can losses be avoided – or at least minimized? In the following blinks, we’ll take a look at what Paul learned. “Loss” is an unpleasant word. It reminds some of us of departed family members or friends. Even when we’re just reminded of a ball game or a bet, the term has negative connotations. The same psychological reaction affects the behavior of market traders. But there’s nothing inherently wrong with loss. Think of a greengrocer. He knows that one or two apples out of a hundred will be rotten. That’s a loss, sure, but he accepts it as a fact of life and doesn’t get too upset about it. Business is like that. You sometimes lose. The problem is that people often take it personally when they lose in the markets. They feel they did something wrong and have trouble accepting and controlling their losses. We all hate making mistakes. That makes it easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. Emotions can cloud our judgments and make matters worse. Take the soybean market. Your analysis tells you that prices will rise so you decide to buy. But then they start to fall. You’ve lost $100,000, and your investment is looking shaky. What do you do? A coldly rational thinker will tell you that your analysis was flawed and that the best tactic is to cut your losses. Walk away and take the hit just like the greengrocer when he finds a rotten apple. Traders, however, don’t always follow cold logic. They’re humans like the rest of us! They make emotional decisions and take it personally. Where does that leave them? They can say, “I’ve made a mistake and lost $100,000 because of it.” Or they can double down on their original decision and say, “the market is wrong, and I’m right, it’s just a matter of time before it turns around.” Admitting mistakes is never easy. That’s why traders ignore the evidence and wait for the market to shift. The danger is that it often won’t. And when that happens, an acceptable loss quickly snowballs into something much more serious. Imagine playing heads or tails and betting on the outcome. You toss a coin six times and get a straight run of heads. How’s the coin going to come up on the seventh toss? It has to be tails, right? Even though it might seem like a statistical inevitability, it simply isn’t true. It’s logical fallacies like this which make it so inevitable that we’ll make bad calls about the likelihood of different outcomes. Logic tells us that there’s a fifty–fifty chance of heads every round and that no single throw has any bearing on the next. But we’re not creatures of pure logic. We want to see patterns where none exist. Traders do this all the time. Say you’ve invested in lumber, but it’s having a bad run. The price dips one day, then again the next, and again the day after that... Reason tells you to reevaluate your investment. But basic human psychology isn’t like that. “If you just hold out a bit longer,” it whispers, “the market is sure to turn.” At that point, you’re not using reason to assess the market – you’re gambling. Irrationality of this kind is risky enough when it comes to discrete events. It’s even more hazardous when it comes to continuous events. A discrete event is a one-off. Like a horse race or a game of blackjack, it has a predefined beginning and end. You might regret betting on the wrong horse or card, but your losses are fixed. You play once and you lose once. But what if you were betting on a horse race that stopped and restarted every 100 meters? Your horse is bringing up the rear after the first hundred meters, but number nine now looks like a good bet. You swap horses, and the race resumes. Imagine it continues in the same way, and new bets are placed after every section of the race. You can play – and lose – again and again. Because you can now keep betting indefinitely, the risk of accumulating ever-larger losses is much higher. Markets are a bit like a horse race without a finish line. Our psychological make-up predisposes us to make bad calls in a situation where the opportunity to place new bets is unlimited. No wonder traders sometimes keep racking up losses until they face a disastrous wipeout! If you’ve ever watched a game of soccer, you’ll have seen supporters in the stands bellowing at the referee and the opposite team’s players. It doesn’t change a thing, and few of us would ever dream of behaving in the same way in another setting. So what’s so special about a soccer match? We feel powerful and uninhibited in a crowd, and that’s an infectious feeling. We copy each other when we’re part of a crowd, and we enjoy seeing our actions mirrored by others. It’s a form of affirmation. That’s why a chant or a Mexican wave spreads like wildfire through the stands of a stadium. But because it’s contagious, crowd behavior can also be dangerous. That’s especially true when it’s fear that’s animating the crowd. We’re much more likely to take our cue from others when we’re motivated by a fear of missing out on something. If we’re scared of losing money or think there’s an opportunity to make it, we’re more likely to follow the crowd. Traders know this better than most – many of their worst decisions are the result of a crowd mentality! A classic example of this is the Dutch tulip mania of the seventeenth century. Traders in the Netherlands were obsessed with tulips, and the price of bulbs skyrocketed. Soon enough, a single bulb was worth as much as the average person earned in a decade. This was crowd behavior in its purest form. People bought tulips because everyone else was doing the same thing. The bubble burst, and investors were wiped out. Hindsight is twenty–twenty. “Why on earth did I put so much money into tulips?” many must have thought after the frenzy had subsided. “Tulips aren’t worth that much!” But as we also know from soccer matches, it’s hard to remain calm and collected when the crowd is going wild. Emotions take control when you’re in the moment and following the lead of those around you. You don’t have to be part of a physical crowd to be affected in this way. The crowd is also a state of mind. We’re part of it every time we make a snap decision on the back of a bit of advice we heard or an article we read about the latest investment craze. The investment-banking firm Morgan Stanley enjoyed a great run of success throughout the 1980s and 1990s. What was their secret? In a word, planning. Morgan Stanley was known in the business for its forensic attention to detail. Both best- and worst-case scenarios were included in its scrupulous planning process. There were occasional complaints that this slowed the firm down. But as one of the firm’s traders put it, “we don’t make mistakes.” The reason for this painstaking planning was simple. A good plan reduces the likelihood of emotions taking over the decision-making process later on. To prevent that, it’s vital that you ask yourself the big questions before you invest. What sort of investments will you be making – long-term or short-term? What rules will you set to guide your decisions? Will you be the sort of trader who waits for timber prices to hit a predetermined target before buying? Or are you more likely to be the investor who offloads their soybean portfolio when bad weather has been forecast? Don’t just answer these questions in your head. It’s important to put pen to paper so that you’ll have a mission statement to refer to if things go south. A plan is a good start, but you’ll also need a trusted source of information. Solid investment decisions are based on a clear-eyed analysis of the situation rather than the hearsay of the crowd. Start with the facts, not your hunches. Whether you choose to base your analysis on recent stock-volume figures or price-to-earnings ratios, it’s important to stick to your sources if you want to avoid following Jim Paul’s example of doubling down on a bad decision despite all the evidence. As the famous psychologist Edward de Bono once observed, “a person will use his thinking to keep himself right.” So don’t rely on your thoughts or emotions — focus on the facts. A solid plan is essential, but it’s not enough. In our next blink, we’ll turn to the final building block of success. It’s hard to stop when you’re having fun in a casino. Sure, you might have lost a little money but the night is still young, the drinks are flowing and who knows – your luck might just turn. But as anyone who’s been in that situation will tell you, the easiest way to lose money is to fail to get out in time. Take Bob. He’s a trader who trusts his gut. He got a great deal on timber and snapped plenty of it up at $30. He knows it’s going to hit $50 by the end of the month. Nice work if you can get it! Then the market takes a nosedive, and timber hits $20. “Well, that’s markets for you,” Bob thinks. “I’m in it for the long haul; I’ll get my money back soon enough.” His pals on the trading floor all agree that the price will recover and Bob sticks it out. When it plummets to $10 months later, he’s forced to accept a massive loss. So what was Bob’s mistake? He racked up unnecessary additional losses because he didn’t have a fixed exit strategy. We’ve seen that markets are a lot like a horse race without a finish line. It’s up to you to turn this continuous event into a one-off. That means setting a limit on how much you’re willing to risk losing and getting out once you hit that point. You can set your threshold in different ways. You might want to peg it to a concrete figure or a performance indicator like a percentage reduction in trade volume. Or you could keep it simple and say you’ll get out by a specific date. Whatever you choose, planning your exit before you enter a market is the only surefire way of ensuring that your decisions won’t be affected by emotions, logical fallacies or the behavior of the crowd. The art of sound investment is knowing how to cut your losses and get out in time. Plan your exit before you enter the market. How much can you afford to lose? Once you’ve got a number, stick to it – it’s the only way that you’ll know you’re making reasoned decisions, not following your gut or the crowd. The key message in these blinks: Financial losses quickly spiral out of control when we make emotional decisions and don’t think clearly. Careful, rational planning sets you up for success. There are a hundred ways to get rich, but there’s one thing everyone who has made – and kept – their fortune has in common: they know how to avoid and minimize losses.  Actionable advice Analyze your decision-making process Take a moment to think about how you make your financial decisions. Do you always start out with a clear plan and guidelines to which you can refer later? Or do you sometimes make impulsive decisions or find yourself going along with the crowd? Be honest! Remember, to err is human. But once you start recognizing how emotions can get the better of logic and start dictating decision-making, you’ll have taken the first step to making better decisions.

He was given a pair of wings that allowed him to fly, and he took full advantage. Unfortunately for him, he got a little carried away. Despite warnings not to, he proceeded to fly as high as he could, so high that the sun started to melt the wax that held his wings together. Within seconds, his wings fell apart and he plunged to his death. This famous fable on the dangers of hubris can be easily applied to the story of Long-Term Capital Management, a huge hedge fund which dominated the financial markets in the 1990s. Like Icarus, they found themselves riding high, with profits through the roof, and yet they also went too far. These blinks will provide you with an important reminder that no company, no matter how important, can hope to cheat the market. In these blinks you’ll discover why we are far from rational; and why academics might not be the best financial advisors. It’s a fair bet that you’ve probably never heard of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a long defunct fund management company. The 1997 Asian financial crisis or the 1998 Russian default, however, are two events that are probably much more familiar to you, as they brought the financial world to the brink of collapse. LTCM had an important role to play in both. LTCM was a hedge fund founded in 1994 by trader John Meriwether. Hedge funds manage the pooled investments of small groups of mostly wealthy investors. Unlike their cousins, mutual funds, which manage the investments of a larger, more economically diverse group of investors, hedge funds are subject to very little regulation, meaning that there are virtually no limits to the size of the fund or where it can be invested. This lack of regulation makes hedge funds a ripe environment for investment in riskier financial products, such as derivatives. Like all other hedge funds, LTCM managed their investments with a strategy called arbitrage, whereby hedge fund managers purchase or sell financial products in the hope or knowledge that their price will change in their favor in the near future. To demonstrate this, imagine that one company sells different stock in two markets. As both stocks represent the same company, you’d expect them to be the same price. However, sometimes the price of the stock in one market may dip below the other. When this occurs, you have an opportunity to quickly buy this stock before the prices reach equilibrium again, after which you can sell that stock at a profit. In reality, the dynamics of the market don’t create these clear-cut scenarios. In fact, most arbitrage strategies rely on tiny, rapidly disappearing discrepancies in the price of financial products. This gave LTCM an advantage. They used academic calculations and predictions as well as the latest computer software to recognize the opportunities and exploit them quickly. Using this strategy, LTCM became the largest hedge fund ever. So what happened? Hedge funds bet on tiny discrepancies between the present and future price of financial products, which means that they need large investments to make any significant profits. Despite the huge funds they had received from their wealthy investors, it wasn’t enough. To earn the greatest profits, hedge funds need to leverage, i.e., they need to borrow in order to maximize their potential returns. So, LTCM borrowed heavily, and encouraged investors to make large investments. Many banks were more than happy to lend huge amounts to the company, because – at least in theory – LTCM’s strategy contained very little inherent risk. They were betting on financial anomalies, such as changing interest rates, that were thought to be little influenced by market swings. Even if the market did take an unforeseen downward turn, profits wouldn’t be greatly affected. At least that was the idea. Institutions such as Dresdener Bank in Germany and Banco Garantia in Brazil gladly lent to LTCM, as they thought profits were guaranteed. To give you just a small example of how much LTCM could raise through leveraging, consider that with only $1.25 billion in investment capital, they could borrow enough to invest about $20 billion. As history will tell, banks made these investments because they simply didn’t understand the risks. LTCM had enormous control over investments and borrowed money, and could invest wherever they wanted. The banks, on the other hand, had no control over where their money was spent. At the time, this was fine. After all, LTCM were the “experts.” Blinded by profit potential, they failed to examine and evaluate the true economic strength – or weakness – of the hedge fund. As more and more banks were rushing in to lend money, the funds’ leverage rate skyrocketed. It eventually reached 30 times the amount owned by the fund, leaving the company at enormous risk if things started to go wrong. Now that you understand LTCM’s essential strategy, the following blinks will demonstrate how they managed to become so successful. Many people believe that there is a gap between the knowledge and opinions of high-minded academics and the conditions of the “real world.” This is no less true in finance. There is assumed to be a massive chasm between the professors and their theories and the real, dog-eat-dog world of trading. LTCM believed that for them, things would be different. Their plan was to apply the expert knowledge and theories of academics to the real world. So they recruited some of the biggest names in economics and trading, hiring people like 1997 winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton to sit on their board of directors. The policy worked, and many investors were enticed into investing in the company due to its management by such luminaries. Even universities and similar institutions were persuaded to invest in the fund. St. John’s University alone put in $10 million. One of the reasons people were so interested in investing was because the academics believed they had eliminated risk altogether. Often, sly salespeople will downplay the risks involved in your investment. But not at LTCM. In fact, they were very up-front about the potential downsides. They did this partly out of cockiness: they felt that with their team of academics they could calculate risks with such precision that the hazards would be easily manageable, or even be eliminated entirely. Their arrogance was fuelled by incredibly complex mathematical formulas based on careful historical analysis of the market. By scrutinizing how the market had reacted to events in the past, they hoped to predict how it would react in the future. This, they thought, gave them the ability to recognize and circumnavigate risks and crises before they occurred. This academic approach was a major lure for investors, and contributed to LTCM’s enormous success. In the 1990s it was hip to invest in hedge funds. People saw them as new, exciting, and above all incredibly profitable financial products. Many wealthy individuals and companies wanted desperately to get a piece of the pie. Yet even in this love affair with hedge funds in general, LTCM stood out, both in terms of popularity and borrowing. During the mid-1990s LTCM was two-and-a-half times as large as the second largest mutual fund, and an incredible four times the size of its closest hedge fund rival. They also controlled more assets even than huge investment banks, like Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley. Banks were practically fighting to lend to them for a number of reasons. For one, banks had a relatively large amount of lendable capital due to many years of advantageous market conditions. What’s more, the banking world desperately wanted to become a part of this money-making behemoth. They even offered LTCM loans for insignificant fees – the ones they used when lending to each other. For example, for every $100 borrowed, the fund was charged mere pennies. And they borrowed far more than $100. Just imagine how much they must have been borrowing when you consider that despite the special terms, they were still paying $100 – $200 million a year in bank credits! For all the love LTCM was getting, it looked much healthier than it actually was. Part of this was simple deception: although they reported their assets and liabilities quarterly to the banks and monthly to investors, these reports weren’t always transparent, and often provided only generalized summaries of accounts. Their success could not last forever, and soon the signs of danger became unmistakable. Despite the popularity of the academic models used by LTCM, they had one fatal flaw: human error. The models assumed that the financial system was a rational, predictable entity directed by rational, predictable people. But it’s not. By our nature, humans are irrational and panic easily, a fact which caused enormous problems for LTCM. These problems began in the 1997 Asian crisis, as the booming Tiger economies, such as Indonesia and South Korea, took a downward turn. This posed a problem for LTCM in that it placed limitations on the places and products in which they could safely invest. In times of uncertainty and insecurity, the normal thing to do would be to invest in bonds, which, although not very profitable, are very secure. LTCM decided to walk a different path. Their models were telling them to increase their share of a riskier financial product: equities. According to the models, times of crisis were great opportunities to make money. So they gave the strategy a shot, and in doing so added more risk. They began investing in paired shares – essentially different stocks in the same company. For example, they invested in Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport England, both of which comprised the international conglomerate Royal Dutch Shell. Despite knowing very little about these products, they invested very heavily, as the models told them that everything would work out. They had already seen a slight dip in profits once the crisis hit in the summer of 1997, but they didn’t let that dissuade them. They continued to follow their models – which eventually led them off a cliff. As you’ve seen, LTCM enjoyed a period of unprecedented success. But it wasn’t built to last. Our final blinks will investigate the mistakes that ultimately led to LTCM’s downfall. The models that the academics and experts at LTCM developed were centered around the axiom that, if disrupted, markets will always revert to their natural position. Think about it like a swing: you can push a swing and it will rise and fall until it eventually returns to its natural resting position. The same thing was supposed to happen with markets, according to the models. This was the reason that the fund chose risky strategies during the Asian financial crisis. They saw the downturn as a small blip in the market which would eventually stabilize and earn them a whole lot of money in the process. However, this didn’t happen. The market didn’t return to normal, and instead most people continued to act “irrationally,” doing things like pulling out of shares and investing entirely in bonds, which are far more secure. But LTCM’s models told them not to follow this trend and to continue taking risks, so they did. And it cost them: after the Asian financial crisis, LTCM suffered several months’ worth of losses for the first time in its history. LTCM’s sheer size actually made it more difficult for them to make money from their risky investments. As problems and losses started to mount up, the ridiculously high leverage rate of LTCM became a millstone: they had to follow the models and take risks in hope of earning enough to pay back their mounting fees and debts. As time progressed, they became even more reliant on the possibility of the big return promised by the models. Reversing course was no longer an option. They had to keep pressing on. Finally, the models failed completely and reality set in. According to LTCM’s models, the probability of losing everything in a single year was only one in a septillion (or ten to the power of 24). In other words, it was virtually impossible. And yet, on 17 August 1998 the impossible happened: the Russian government defaulted on its debts and devalued its currency. This sent shock waves through the market. It wasn’t just that the Russian economy was tanking, but no one – not even the IMF – had stepped in to help them. In essence, they had been left to the wolves. Investors realized then and there that they wouldn’t always be saved. If the worst happened, they were on their own. This realization initiated a mass exodus from the world’s markets. People sought only the most secure bonds possible, and everything else was sold. This was terrible news for LTCM. According to their calculations, the most they could lose in a single day was $35. Yet in reality, their losses actually stretched to $533 million. Due to their huge debts and lack of capital, LTCM needed to sell quickly to stay solvent. But no one wanted what they had to offer. The few organizations and banks that were interested in hedge funds were thus in a very strong bargaining position. The fewer buyers there are in the market, the more severe the losses for the seller. By the end of August, LTCM had lost 45 percent of its capital, had reached a leverage rate of 55 times that capital, and were stuck with $125 billion in assets which they couldn’t sell. As the fund started to lose money, banks demanded that they open up their books to demonstrate that they could pay back their loans. When the banks discovered just how many risks the company had been running, they started to attack (or short) the fund in order to recuperate their losses. Their last hope was to join forces with a bank in hopes of preventing total collapse. As LTCM started to topple, the banks, many of whom had recently acted against it, had a realization: “If this fund goes bankrupt, we lose our investments.” And because so many of them had invested in the fund, a collapse would wreck the market. Many banks and investors began looking into ways of taking control of LTCM and rescuing it. LTCM wasn’t eager to let banks into the fund. They feared that if LTCM lost control, all its earnings were in danger. But as time passed, their position only worsened, and they were left with no other choice. But who could even buy such a large fund? The sheer size of LTCM meant that no single bank could hope to rescue them without help. The banks considered simply letting LTCM go under, so each bank absorbed their own losses. With this option, only one or two banks would face any serious risk, and the rest would have been able to survive. The problem, however, was confidence: if they let yet another financial institution crash – and so soon after the Russian crisis – any confidence that was left in the market would be annihilated. So the Federal Reserve, understanding the dangers of this situation, stepped in to help create a consortium of banks whose combined resources could deal with LTCM. This consortium did succeed, but in their desperation to save the fund, they gave the bosses of the failing LTCM enormous negotiating power. For example, despite the fact that the fund had failed, one of LTCM’s founders, John Meriwether, managed to keep his assets (including his home, car, etc.) and avoid any personal debt. Within only a few years he was back again, this time with a new hedge fund. Despite LTCM’s early success, if you look at its overall performance you’ll find that it lost 77 percent of its capital in a time when ordinary investors more than doubled their money.    The key message in this book: As you’ll see with the rise and fall of one of the United States’ largest hedge funds in history, even the best models can’t protect investors against the irrational behavior of their fellow human beings.

Of course you do! Who doesn’t? Even so, most of us harbor negative emotions about money and the people who make it. All this negativity is keeping you from realizing your economic potential. That’s a shame because, as you’ll see in these blinks, you have the power to change your situation. All you need to do is get into the right mind-set and overcome the notions that are holding you back. Let’s get to work on making you a badass at making money! In these blinks, you’ll learn that wanting money doesn’t make you greedy; why you have to get out of your comfort zone if you want to become rich; and why Jim Carrey wrote himself a $10 million check. Money is a complicated subject. Some people love and obsess over it while others have come to despise the stuff. And while there are those who desire money, there are also those who feel ashamed over having so much of it. Our culture has many negative beliefs about money, like it being the reason people turn into greedy and selfish monsters. But this is a myth. Making money is what allows people to break free from financial constraints and use their time and energy for the things they care about. This is how philanthropists and activists are able to start charities and spread the word about important issues. Often, our attitude to wealth will fluctuate between good and bad. If you visit a friend who has an impressive widescreen TV, you might feel the desire to buy a similar TV. But then you might see a person you don’t like bragging about owning the exact same TV. In an instant, you feel disgusted with yourself for ever wanting such a pointless luxury item. Another misguided belief about money is that if one person gets rich, it means someone else stays poor. This idea stems from what’s known as a lack mind-set, which leads us to believe that there just aren’t enough dollars or resources to go around. But think of it this way: If you eat a sandwich, do you think someone in another country is having their sandwich taken away? No, the real scenario is that you eat your lunch to have the energy to work and create opportunities for others to do their job, thereby making it possible for them to afford their own sandwiches. Sincero used to be plagued with negative ideas about money, and as a result, she wasted much of her youth with low-paying jobs such as catering, babysitting and knitting. But now she’s here to help you avoid wasting another minute and begin a healthy and lucrative relationship with money. On its own, money isn’t good or bad – it’s a blank slate. It’s up to us to decide how money will be put to use – for good or evil. Certainly, there weren’t any evil intentions when the concept of money was invented back in ancient times. People just wanted a better way of doing business than bartering, which had become a royal pain in the ass. Back in the day, if you wanted a nice fur coat, you might have to build a stone wall. Or a nobleman could be asked to trade his daughters in exchange for a seaside castle. Negotiations like these could take a lot of time and involve a lot of yelling; whereas with currency, if you wanted a camel, all you had to do was open up your change purse and pay for it. So rather than being evil, it’s more accurate to recognize money as an efficient way to get things done. Think of it this way: Are all cars evil because some people are filled with road rage and scream obscenities when they get behind the wheel? Are all computers inherently evil because some people use them to commit crimes? It’s true that people around the world have done horrible things for money, but the blame should be placed with the individual perpetrators of these acts and not with the cash. Here’s an exercise to help you disassociate money from evil, greedy characteristics. Since these negative qualities are usually reserved for people, try writing two “Dear Money” letters, as if you were addressing a person – one that explains your negative feelings and one that explains at least a few positive feelings. Once you’ve finished, read the letters out loud. At this point, you’ll realize that your negative feelings don’t hold up to logic, while the positive things all make sense. To continue nurturing a positive attitude toward money, express your gratitude when you get paid and treat these occasions as the blessings they are. Even though we’re taught to accept the things we see and hear as reality, the truth is far more complex. Since our five senses are being processed by our brain, we’re creating an illusion – our own unique universe in which we constantly live. So it’s really important that our brains are processing things in a positive way and creating a prosperous universe. At any given moment, we can interpret things as being either good or bad, and it’s easy to only view things negatively and get stuck in a bleak worldview. So you might think to yourself, “I’ll never be able to afford a vacation, so why even bother trying to save up money. Screw it, let’s just waste it on junk food, at least that’ll make me happy for a little while.” This kind of thinking can last a lifetime. Alternatively, you can start putting positive thoughts into your universe and experience opportunity and good fortune. People who accomplish great things, like ascending a mountain in a wheelchair or escaping poverty, don’t do so by thinking negative thoughts. They change their situation by putting out positivity and grabbing opportunities when they happen. This kind of attitude could change your financial situation, just as it did for the author. Sincero once found herself in desperate need of money, so she thought about people she might reach out to. One person who came to mind was a client who’d once taken a coaching class she offered. Over a year earlier he’d signed up for a basic offer at $25 per hour. Now, she thought, maybe he’d be interested in upgrading to the premium package at $300 per hour. But when she opened up her email, there was already a message in her inbox from the very client she was thinking of, asking her how much she was charging these days! It worked out because the positivity she was putting out allowed the universe to respond with the perfect solution. When you exchange money with someone, it’s not just a physical transaction; you’re also putting either good or bad energy into the universe. That’s why it’s important to make the right kinds of transactions to bring good fortune back your way. For example, if you made $50 raking up leaves on your neighbor’s lawn, this puts out different energy than stealing $50 out of someone’s pocket on a crowded subway train. Naturally, offering a helpful service is positive, while stealing is negative. If you’re an employer, you’re also putting out energy when you pay your workers. So, if you’re ripping people off and underpaying them, you’re giving out bad energy and creating a negative relationship. But if you’re being honest and paying your employees the right amount, the relationship and energy will be positive. You should always be aware of the kind of energy being created in these money situations and strive to keep all your dealings positive. You should also think of how you can channel this energy so it can continue to generate more good in the world. For this to happen, you shouldn’t focus your energy on one single thing, but rather be open to all good possibilities. By focusing on just one person or possibility, you’re blinding yourself to the infinite number of other opportunities that await and can provide more positive money. It’s a lot like finding the man of your dreams. If you’re focusing all your attention on one guy, your happiness is therefore completely under his control, whether or not he decides to return your feelings. So instead, focus on recognizing the qualities of the person you’re looking for, and you’ll soon find there’s more than one guy out there who can bring you the positive love you’re looking for. If you’re feeling like your anti-money beliefs are still too deep-seated to shake, here are some more ways you can break free. One of the best ways to start thinking differently is to dive right in and take a bold move toward making your dreams come true. Sincero’s dream was to be a successful life coach. To help her make that transition she had a choice of paying $15,000 for a group class or $85,000 to be taught by an experienced coach in one-on-one sessions. She knew that one-on-one sessions would be far more rewarding, even though the cost was more than she made in a year. But she committed herself to finding a way to come up with the money. It was a big step, but it forced her to stop thinking “no way” and start thinking “there must be a way.” Once you leap into the great unknown, there are bound to be lingering doubts and worries. But instead of ignoring them or letting fear take over, write them down as a way to acknowledge their power and move on. Even when Sincero was standing in line, ready to sign up for the coaching lessons, she was bombarded with fears that she was making the wrong choice. These wobbles are usually irrational. She worried that if she succeeded, her father would feel useless because he no longer had to help her out financially. You might have similar thoughts or believe it’s too late to change, but it’s all nonsense! Any subconscious worries can be altered to create a new narrative for your success story. Sincero imagined a new image of her dad being proud of her success and realized that in reality, he’d be happy that she was finally able to support herself. You don’t necessarily have to pay for a therapist to change the narrative in your head. In fact, it’s best when you can prove to yourself that you have the power to think positively and control your own destiny. Generally speaking, people don’t become rich unless they want to. So naturally, it’s important to tap into your desire for money if you want to start banking the Benjamins. The key to unlocking that desire is to get specific about why you want money and how much of it you need. Then you can set solid goals for yourself. A famous example of how well this can work comes from the actor Jim Carrey, who wrote a $10 million check to himself when he was broke and desperate for a job. Carrey dated the check three years in the future, and sure enough, this act sparked his motivation and his career. By the time the date on the check arrived, he’d landed his biggest role yet in the movie Dumb and Dumber, which earned him enough money to cash that check. A goal like this is effective because it’s specific. When you’re precise about the goal and how meaningful it is to you, it increases the likelihood of the goal becoming a reality. Think of it as placing an order with the universe. Now, you wouldn’t place an order at a sandwich shop by saying, “One sandwich, please.” You have to tell them what kind of bread, whether you want mayo or mustard, and so on. This way, you’ll get what you want – and the same goes for getting what you want out of life. Being specific also provides a great boost for your determination. A sandwich is great, but a sandwich with all your favorite ingredients in just the right proportions is what gets your mouth watering. But being specific doesn’t mean limiting yourself. Remember to stay open to the surprises the universe has to offer. This concept is known as surrendering to universal intelligence. Let’s say you’re a writer and you’ve set a goal for the month to find ten new publications that you’ve never sent samples to before. This is great, as long as it doesn’t blind you to what your old contacts may have to offer. The world is full of opportunities and a true badass doesn’t let them slip by. The key message in this book: Many people have negative associations with money that keep them from their full earning potential. By adopting a positive outlook on life and opening yourself up to the universe, you’ll find that good things can happen, and wealth can be part of a harmonious, happy life. The universe wants to provide you with money, so take control and become a badass at making bank! Actionable advice: Create a positive environment for yourself. If you decide to transform your financial reality, make sure you avoid all the naysayers and doubters and surround yourself with people who believe in your potential to realize your dreams. You should also spend time in places and doing activities that form your ideal life. If there’s a car you hope to buy in the future, take it for a test drive. If there’s a neighborhood you want to move to, spend time in its cafe’s and parks. Being in these environments is a great way to help keep you inspired and motivated. Got feedback?

In the years that followed, public pressure forced the financial gods to re-organize their small Manhattan kingdom. Young Money shows us Wall Street through the eyes of young financial analysts, who enter business fresh from their Ivy League ivory towers, only to find Wall Street less comfy than they'd imagined. They’re paid enormous salaries, but the punishing work schedules they’re assigned make you wonder: Is it worth it? In the following blinks you’ll learn how an arts major can easily become a Wall Street analyst; what the top one percent’s secret club gets up to; and how earning $100,000 a year might not make you much richer than someone working for minimum wage. Scoring a job on Wall Street seems like a rare honor. But in fact, companies on Wall Street are as eager to hire a smart young person right out of college as graduates are to make it to Wall Street. Wall Street firms begin their search early to ensure they get only the best graduates, and that means bagging them before they’ve finished their degrees. Well before other fields even consider setting up interviews, Wall Street firms start pursuing young minds on university campuses. As early as the fall of their senior year, most Wall Street firms inform student applicants about job openings. Take a look at the statistics: the majority of Ivy League graduates who have job offers prior to graduation are going into the financial sector. That’s 46 percent in Princeton in 2006 and 28 percent in Harvard in 2008. The best Wall Street companies spare no expense on enticing the smartest young minds and ensuring the hiring process is as simple as possible. But although it’s an easy process, it’s also aggressive. Top firms hold presentations on campus, often boasting Jay Z-style promotional videos. One presentation by Morgan Stanley at Penn’s Wharton Business School spouted phrases like “Boundaries will be shattered,” and “In the finance world, every day is a new day,” to a pop-rock soundtrack. As well as the presentations, companies also provide interview workshops, treat potential candidates to expensive dinners and follow up with phone calls. The interest they show in exceptional students is comparable to “polite stalking.” So do any students actually fall for these gaudy presentations? You’d be surprised. When we think of Wall Street we think of finance, right? Of course, but it’s not essential to have a background in finance in order to work there. All Wall Street firms want to hire students from the best schools – period. Wall Street firms look specifically to Ivy League colleges such as Harvard, Penn and Brown when they’re hiring. This means all students there are very well positioned to land a job on Wall Street, even if they’re an arts major. There are some exceptions, however. Young analyst J. P. Murray (some names in these blinks have been made up to protect interviewees’ anonymity) was one of the few recruits to Credit Suisse who came from a regular college rather than an Ivy League school. So what is the main attraction of Wall Street for students? Sometimes it’s simply because it’s the easiest thing to do when they graduate. Wall Street recruitment begins with a \"two and out\" plan, meaning that graduates are hired as analysts for only two years at first. Because the pay is so alluring, and because students often graduate with massive debts, heading to Wall Street seems like a pretty grand idea. After all, two years’ work seems like a fairly good trade off for paying your loans and gaining valuable business skills. A lot of students think this way and this results in a class of \"accidental financiers” who spurn the threadbare job market and snap up an early offer, convincing themselves it’s just for two years. So, picture yourself with $100,000 in student debt and add to that the uncertainty of what to do with your life after you graduate. Of course Wall Street is going to seem appealing, even if finance isn’t exactly your passion. It does seem tempting, but the following blinks will reveal some pretty heartbreaking stories from young financiers. All right, so you’ve gotten yourself an enviable spot on Wall Street. Or so you thought. Now let’s see exactly what that entails. A first year analyst on Wall Street will typically work themselves to the bone. They are known to clock up 100 hours of work a week, meaning 16-hour weekdays and ten hours on Saturdays and Sundays. If you add commuting times on top of this, you wouldn’t be the only one wondering how they even find time to sleep. For the majority of analysts, the hardest thing about the long hours is that they need to be constantly available. They might find the odd hour to sit around, but they are also expected to jump into action and start collecting information for the next project at 3 a.m., or on Christmas morning if necessary. They basically work non-stop, even if their actual working time is \"only\" 16 hours per day. Ricardo Hernandez, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, sometimes works what is known as the \"banker nine-to five,” starting at nine o’clock one morning and finishing at five o’clock the following morning, for weeks at a time. In case the long work hours weren’t a big enough drawback, the way young analysts are treated by bosses is also appalling. Most first-year analysts are dealt with unfairly by their superiors; every time you put a foot wrong, expect to be yelled at for it. The reason? It’s always been like that. What if you perform well? Then you can enjoy your annual bonus – but forget about encouragement and support. When Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Chelsea Ball made a mistake with a newsletter she was supposed to compile, none of her bosses stood up for her. Even though they had access to the information and could have spotted the error easily, they chastised her for adding confidential information which she couldn’t have known was confidential. When you’re a Wall Street analyst subjected to massive daily pressure while putting in 100 hours a week, the consequences are serious. What usually ends up happening is that most young analysts barely have a personal life. Seeing how little time he had for her, the girlfriend of Derrick Havens, an analyst at Wells Fargo, eventually proposed an ultimatum: the job or the relationship. While she understood the long hours and the constant need to be on call, Derrick chose work over a romantic dinner one too many times. Yet, faced with the ultimatum, Derrick chose work, and threw away a four-year relationship. There are a few factors that keep analysts at Wall Street cocooned in their office buildings. Some firms have in-house gyms, coffee shops and even barbers. This way, bosses limit the contact employees have with the outside world. Aside from having an adverse effect on relationships, working around the clock also affects physical health. Extreme sleep deprivation, huge stress levels and limited movement make a dangerous cocktail that often ends up endangering the health of Wall Street analysts – a risk they claim to be ready for. One extreme example is Arjun Khan, a young analyst at Citigroup. Arjun was diagnosed with Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes organs to collapse. It’s not likely that the disease itself was directly caused by his work, but Arjun’s lifestyle habits, such as never exercising, staying up all night and partying with colleagues, likely exacerbated his condition and finally landed him in the hospital. From there he was forced to seriously review his career choice. During the protests after the 2007 market crash, young analysts could relate far better to the protesters than the older, more seasoned Wall Street professionals. Occupy Wall Street was a movement against everything Wall Street stood for, including the insatiable and ruthless pursuit of power and money. Older bankers, however, weren’t so concerned, as they didn't think the protesters’ demands were credible. But the younger analysts felt differently. They were the same age as the protesters themselves, and many of them had friends or family members who backed the movement. For instance, when protesters marched under Goldman Sachs analyst Jeremy Miller-Reed’s window, he felt he was on the wrong side of the glass. He started to lie about his job when he spoke to others, because he was ashamed to work there. Miller-Reed was aware of what Wall Street represented to many, but other young analysts appeared not to understand the full impact of their work. For a lot of Wall Streeters, their job is like any other. Even though they earn more money than people in most other industries, they still fall within the \"99 percent\" of the population. They almost never get to have their say on deals and are often assigned mundane support work such as working on Excel sheets or pitch books. This is why one J. P. Morgan analyst was angry that the public didn’t differentiate between the people at the top and the juniors like himself. He even went so far as to say it was like accusing all the athletes on a team of a heinous crime, when only one is guilty. So far we’ve focused on first-year Wall Street analysts. But what happens to those who decide to stay on after 12 months? Working on Wall Street starts to have a major impact on the personalities of the people who work there. After the first year, most analysts finally get to enjoy some spare time and freedom. Many of them start seeking out more easygoing positions, such as jobs in private equity or hedge funds. Although most young analysts on Wall Street just want to get through the first two years and leave, they often end up changing their minds. Some analysts succumb to the temptation to stay on because they get accustomed to the atmosphere and to maintaining a secure, well-paying job. Suddenly this seems a lot more appealing than changing careers. But for those who acknowledge the Wall Street mentality and continue, slight personality changes begin to take place: they go from being upbeat, happy graduates to frayed, short-tempered worker bees. Relationships with others start resembling business transactions, and cynicism becomes a normal reaction. Remember Derrick, who chose his job over his girlfriend of four years? Those who stay on Wall Street can easily become part of the \"one percent,” but they pay the price with their values and morals. When the author approached top Wall Street executives to ask what their lives were like, he only received PR-department answers. He therefore decided to sneak into the induction dinner of Kappa Beta Phi, a secret club founded in 1929 for the top one percent. Once there, he witnessed an extravagant dinner with a stage full of \"neophytes,\" each of whom was expected to do a trick. The grand finale of the humiliating show included the newcomers wearing Mormon missionary outfits, singing about God’s plan for them to earn seven-figure bonuses. If you’re weighing up the pros and cons of working on Wall Street, first make sure you consider what alternatives are available. Being on Wall Street for two years might seem like the path of least resistance for some, but it’s unlikely to be a route that will make you happy. It’s easy to forget that two years can be a long time when you’re trawling through tedious, almost meaningless work which prevents you from having any free time. People with creative potential shouldn’t forgo their talent for the security of a lucrative job. Society pays a big price when individual talent and creativity are squandered. Jeremy Miller-Reed, the Goldman Sachs analyst, eventually had an epiphany and decided to leave Wall Street in order to start his own company. He announced this with a Facebook status update reading \"The nightmare is over.\" Miller-Reed understood that Wall Street’s monetary compensation was ultimately not worth it. So how much do young analysts receive for selling their soul? The figure might sound impressive before you understand the sacrifices they make for it. Most analysts on Wall Street earn a base salary of about $70,000 per year, topped with a yearly bonus of between $20,000 and $90,000. Clearly these are salaries not to be sniffed at; even with a bonus of \"only\" $30,000, this places the analysts among the top earners in the country. However, when you take into consideration the number of hours they work, this sum turns out to be rather underwhelming. One analyst took into account his overtime and what this would amount to as an hourly wage. The result was around $16. Not exactly worth toiling away for 100 hours per week. Finally, let’s take a look at the future of Wall Street and its analysts. The 2007 financial crisis had a massive impact on Wall Street and on the desires of graduates to sign up. A number of regulations were introduced for financial institutions, and there was a drastic fall in profits. This in turn led to a shake up involving layoffs and diminished bonuses. All of a sudden, a position on Wall Street was no longer a secure option for talented college graduates. A two-year contract couldn’t be guaranteed and bonuses shrank, so the money no longer compensated for the sacrifices junior analysts were expected to make. The public protests against Wall Street also affected young people’s opinions of it. After Occupy Wall Street, many college students began to see the industry very differently. Students began blogs and wrote articles in college papers in order to dissuade their peers from being lured into working there. Their efforts were successful. The percentage of Harvard graduates who took jobs in finance after their diplomas dropped from 28 percent in 2008 to 17 percent in 2011. Not put off yet? While a job on Wall Street doesn’t make you evil, and no one can say that it should be forbidden, you should always ask yourself first if finance is your real passion. Because if not, you’ll find the costs of working there far outweigh the benefits. The key message in this book: Working on Wall Street as a young analyst is far less glamorous than most people think. The perks often come at a price of countless sleepless nights, 100-hour work weeks and extreme pressure. However, after the 2007 financial crash and the Wall Street protests that followed, the new public consciousness may well have saved many creative people from landing a job that destroys their lives.

Improving your life isn’t as simple as staring up at a firework-lit sky and whispering a couple of sentences to yourself. Sure, the intent is there, but you also need to follow up on your verbal promises with some solid planning and action. This is where these blinks come in: Michael Hyatt guides you through the necessary steps to make your New Year’s wish a tangible reality, so you’ll never spend another year regretting all the things you could’ve or should’ve done. Full of historical examples and personal anecdotes from the author, Your Best Year Ever will show you that reaching your goals is never an impossibility. In these blinks, you’ll discover why it’s good to develop an addiction; the author’s greatest failure; and who was first to run a mile in under four minutes. Let’s start by picturing where you want to be in 12 months. What do you see? Some of the more common desires are to be free of debt, physically fit, a happy family life, a good relationship, master a hobby and feel spiritually well. The good news is that you can have all of this. Measuring your progress in ten areas of your life will allow you to see what you need to improve. These interrelated aspects are mental health, physical health, spirituality, intellectual life, marriage or partnerships, parental life, friendships, job, hobbies and personal finances. These components are key to living a fulfilling life, which is why it’s important to work consistently on improving them. To begin, rank yourself from zero to ten on each of the aspects previously mentioned. This way you will be able to identify the areas in greatest need of improvement and regularly mark your progress by comparing the results. Moreover, it will give you a clear indication as to where you should be focusing your efforts. These ten aspects are connected to and influenced by one another, and therefore improvements in one area will most likely result in growth in other areas as well. For instance, a relaxing home life will allow you to concentrate better at work, while a rich social life will lead to a higher chance of meeting a partner. Likewise, performing poorly on certain aspects could have negative impacts on other areas too. You may lack energy in the workplace if you’re not physically healthy, while not having any hobbies could negatively affect your marriage. Working on all these aspects might seem like a daunting task, but the following blinks will show you how to overcome your worries and devise a practical plan to bring about change in your life. Most of us lug around a lot of baggage, or mental blocks, that determine what is and isn’t possible for us to achieve. One such mental block is false assumptions. Humans continuously make assumptions about the world and themselves. These are often wrong and create a barrier to our progression. These assumptions can be thoughts, such as “You’re not the creative type,” “You’re ugly,” “You can’t hold down a job,” or “The recession means nobody will buy your product.” These are almost always self-inflicted and objectively untrue in most cases. What’s more, we also set up physical barricades with our minds. Pilots once thought it impossible to fly faster than the speed of sound, and athletes believed that no human could run a mile in under four minutes. The ones that broke through and achieved the seemingly unthinkable are those who dispensed with the negative narrative and went about proving that it was, in fact, possible. This is the mentality that former United States Air Force general officer Charles Elwood “Chuck” Yeager had when he broke the sound barrier in 1947. In 1954, athlete Roger Bannister also ignored the impossible narrative by running a mile in three minutes and 59 seconds. By dispelling common knowledge about physical limitations, both Yeager and Bannister succeeded where others had failed. Since then, numerous airplanes have broken the sound barrier, and many runners have recorded one-mile runs in under four minutes, now that the perceived limits have been surpassed. By revising the perceived limits, not only can you improve yourself, but you can even change the world. In 1963, it was the belief of many that the civil rights movement wouldn’t amount to anything. Most said that non-violent efforts would never achieve change and that racism was far too deeply ingrained in American society for anything to be done about it. Dr. Martin Luther King, however, refused to take these perceived beliefs as undeniable truths and led a peaceful protest march of 200,000 people to Washington, where he gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. With this speech, King replaced the taken-for-granted worldview with an alternative perspective – knocking down the mental blocks in many American minds and opening them up to change. It might’ve been a primary school teacher who told us we’re hopeless at art, or it could’ve been last month’s failed attempt at dieting. Whatever the case, past experiences can contribute to our negative thinking and keep us from moving ahead. A bad experience in the past can affect our confidence in future circumstances. A good example of this is comparing the 80% of teenagers who make New Year’s resolutions to the 30% who do so aged 60 and older. This discrepancy is because the older people get, the more failures and setbacks they’ve experienced, and so they are less optimistic about their desires coming true. But this is a false assumption, and you shouldn’t let past experiences affect your actions in the future. Instead, use those previous failures as useful advice. The author’s greatest failure occurred when he was working all year for a client – an up-and-coming author working on landing a big publishing deal. Toward the very end of the year, the client stopped taking his calls, and just like that, the author had wasted 12 months on someone who’d decided to go with another publisher at the last minute. Now, the easy choice would’ve been to give up and look for another job. Instead, the author used what he’d learned over those 12 months to improve his company in a number of ways. For instance, he realized that he should never focus on just one client, and instead spread his net wide. He also learned never to assume that a client would be appreciative of his work. To minimize the risk, he now asks his clients to explain exactly what it is they want out of the partnership. As important as it is to set future targets for yourself, it’s also critical that the goals you set are attainable. Let’s take a look at how you can achieve this in the next blink. Some targets that we set for ourselves are so unrealistic that even the world’s greatest geniuses wouldn’t be able to attain them. On the flip side, sometimes the goals may be so easy that we lose motivation to try and achieve them because so little effort is required. The key to ensuring high enthusiasm levels is striving for a goal that’s within your capabilities, but one that also requires a reasonable amount of effort. To set the right goals, you need to find the discomfort zone. Let’s say you’re planning to write a book. Winning the Nobel Prize for literature is a desirable goal, but it’s also quite unreasonable for a first-time writer. Furthermore, such an ambitious target could prevent you from starting altogether. Conversely, if you set your sights too low and allow yourself to finish your first draft in 6 months, you’ll end up taking too long and probably never get around to finishing. Instead, find a happy medium, which the author calls the discomfort zone. For example, give yourself three months to finish the first draft, and then another three to complete the second. Setting goals is important, but don’t be delusional. It’s possible to exceed the discomfort zone and break into the delusional zone, if you’re not careful. Just as an athlete who overtrains will end up pulling a muscle, setting delusional targets will result in you undermining yourself. One example of this is the automobile company General Motors. In 2002, they set a target to obtain 29% of the US market. This absurdly ambitious goal almost bankrupted the company. Employees were required to wear badges with the number 29 on their lapels so that they were constantly reminded of the goal. The staff became so fixated on sales numbers that they sold cars with zero-interest loans – costing the company money and affecting its bottom line. It effectively undermined the business and put the 29% target even further out of reach than when they started the initiative. If General Motors had considered it more thoroughly, they would’ve realized that the goal was delusional and this misadventure would’ve been avoided. Imagine you had to read a long book like the Bible. That’s almost a million words – a rather daunting task. To make this a more attainable goal, break up the task into 20-minute chunks every morning, and you’ll have read the entire Bible in a year. When you split up mammoth tasks into short-term goals, the rewards can be very satisfying. Humans get addicted to daily tasks, particularly if they’re done over an extended period of time. This also applies to tasks that were born from the discomfort zone. A task that we enjoy can turn from a stick to a carrot, that is from a punishment to a reward. People who intend to read the Bible might find it daunting at first, but once they get started, they’ll enjoy the spiritual and peaceful moments that accompany the task. The key action, though, is to work on the task until you become addicted. Some of you may have heard that it takes 21 days to get addicted to a habit, but some tasks only take a few days before an addiction forms, while more complex ones can take over 200 days. According to researchers from University College London, the average number of days for a task to transition into an addictive habit is 66. To make it easier to become addicted to a task, you need to introduce rewards into the system. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean buying yourself a new suit once you shed those 20 pounds. Rewards for completing discomfort zone tasks are more like feelings of gratitude and pleasure, and simply noticing your progression toward your long-term goal can be rewarding enough. You can also increase your enthusiasm levels by turning your task into a game: Tick off a daily task on your calendar, and try to see how many days in a row you can achieve it. Phone apps can be very handy here. The author uses an app where you’re instructed to drink a glass of water before watering a virtual plant. By turning it into a game, the app takes the mundane task of drinking water throughout the day and makes it more enjoyable. To stick to a task and remain positive, you need to form an emotional attachment to it. In other words, you need to understand why that task makes you a better person. Start by identifying your main motivations. Jot down a list of reasons for doing a particular activity, then pick out the strongest points. If your goal is to work out more, some of the reasons could be “I’m sick of being fat,” “I want to prove to myself that I can succeed,” and “Exercise makes me more productive and happy.” It’s important to disregard how other people might value your reasons. What’s most significant is that they resonate with you. Once that’s done, you need to constantly remind yourself of your main motivations. Say you find yourself heading to the fridge. In a situation like this, it’s useful to have your list of reasons at hand. As you reach for a snack, remind yourself why you want to be more healthy. Looking at the list will divert your attention away from your temporary desire and prompt you to consider your longer-term, more meaningful targets. To motivate yourself even further, let your reason define you as a person. Anders Ericsson, a researcher of psychology at Florida State University, studied the motivation behind the many hours of practice guitarists and other musicians put into honing their craft. He discovered that a crucial element of their dedication was that when they perform well, and their talents receive recognition from their peers, their actions became part of their identity. In other words, identifying as musicians drove them to become better at making music. This is no surprise, as humans are social beings, and the way we identify ourselves is in relation to others. In the following blink, you’ll learn how to benefit from this group identification so that you can experience your best year yet. In addition to identifying your primary motivations, one key factor to living a successful year is having a good group of people around you. This means finding individuals who can support your goals – either those who have the means to see them come to fruition or those on a similar path who can offer encouragement and advice. People are a readily available source of knowledge and experience that we can tap into. They could be a member of a community or a mentor, and many are more than happy to pass on their skills and lessons to those who seek it. Joining a community is one way to find supportive people to help you with your quest. For example, people who want to lose weight join dieting groups such as Weight Watchers and are more likely to drop the pounds than those who go it alone. Similarly, alcohol and drug addicts have a higher chance of staying clean if they go to supportive meetings, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. According to psychologist Henry Cloud, this is because positivity is contagious. We are more likely to succeed when part of a community due to four key reasons: firstly, we can learn from other group members; secondly, competition within the group helps our performance; third, we are held accountable to the community; and fourth, we motivate and encourage each other. Another avenue from which we can seek help is through tutoring. It’s easy to conclude that if we want to improve at the piano, we should hire a piano teacher. If we want to learn Spanish, we should find a language tutor. But when it comes to improving our lives, many of us wouldn’t consider hiring a life coach, or even a fitness instructor. The author was guilty of this oversight. For a couple of years, he was stuck on a particular level of fitness and didn’t know how to improve. His friend suggested he get a fitness instructor, and since then, not only has he gained new and invaluable advice on different exercise techniques, he also gained a new gym buddy. Through this new avenue of support, he broke his personal records and reached new levels of fitness. Creating your best year requires individual effort, but it’s equally important to make sure you have a good network supporting you. The key message in these blinks: To have the perfect year, you need to take a holistic approach to improving yourself and distribute your efforts equally over ten different aspects. The goals you set for yourself must be realistic and clearly identified so that you have the motivation to change. Finding a strong support group and becoming addicted to daily tasks will also help you achieve a fulfilling life. Actionable advice: Express gratitude. The first thing you should do when you wake up in the morning is take a few minutes to yourself to thank the universe, God, yourself or anyone, for everything that you already have. Say thanks for being healthy, for having people who care about you, for having access to clean water. Being grateful will help keep you positive and hopeful and remind you of the small victories you’ve already made. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Your two-room apartment is overflowing with baby stuff and suddenly feels a little too small. Maybe it’s time to buy a house? However, as we all know, buying a house is a huge investment, and there are many questions that need to be answered before you take the step: Can you afford it? What’s the best area to buy in? Should you give it a luxury makeover? You probably have a lot of preconceived ideas and assumptions about buying a house. You might think that just because you’re single and living in the city, buying a house is not an option. You might think it doesn’t matter what time of year you buy a house. You might even think that buying a house is always a good investment. As these blinks will show, all of these assumptions are wrong. In these blinks you’ll learn where you should buy; why that new fancy bathtub you just installed won’t make your house more valuable; and how a single word can have a huge impact on a house sale. Most of us associate homeownership with a family. But buying a home can be as advantageous for a single working woman as it can be for a family of four. How can you know if buying is right for you? It could be because buying saves you money. Zillow developed a tool called the break even horizon, which can help you determine whether it makes more financial sense to buy or rent. Here’s how it works. The break even horizon compares costs over time to determine how long it will take for the home you purchase to cost less than it would to rent the same property. It does this by calculating inflation and tax rates as well as property value. If you use Zillow’s break even horizon tool and find out that you could actually save money by buying a house, you’re ready for the next step: deciding where to buy. When choosing a neighborhood, it’s important to consider how it will transform in the years to come. After all, buying property is a huge investment and real estate prices are directly linked to location. So, while it may be tempting to buy the best property in the most desirable area, a wiser financial decision is to buy property in up-and-coming neighborhoods. Luckily, by following market trends you can determine how a neighborhood will change over time. For instance, a part of the city with bad roads or little commercial activity can become a booming center of commerce in just a few years. How? Say you knew that a developer planned to build a shopping mall in the area by next year. A major commercial attraction like that would likely draw a new group of people to the area and start transforming the run-down neighborhood into a hip and attractive one. As the atmosphere of the neighborhood improves so will the housing prices, thereby making your investment a sound one. Has anyone ever told you that buying the most run-down house in an expensive neighborhood is a good investment? Well, they’re wrong and you’d be surprised to hear just how disastrous that decision can be. Think of it this way, when you buy the worst house in a wealthy neighborhood you are also buying the house with the least potential to rise in value. You might think that the surrounding properties will increase the value of your own. But in fact, being the cheapest house in the area will only arouse the suspicions of prospective buyers. Why? They’ll wonder why the house is so much cheaper than those around it and assume something is amiss. Take the Marcus family. They bought a small bungalow in the lovely Fort Worth, Texas suburb of Eagle Ranch that was valued in the bottom ten percent for the area. While every other house increased in value, the Marcuses’ house lagged behind by four percentage points. On the other hand, buying the worst house in the hottest neighborhood can be a great investment and the key is to find gentrifying neighborhoods. What are they? A gentrifying neighborhood is one that used to be run down but is turning around as young people and artists move in. As the cultural climate changes, more wealthy people are attracted to these neighborhoods and property values skyrocket as renovations take place. For instance, at the turn of the twentieth century, Manchester was home to many wealthy steel barons but fell into disrepair as they left for the suburbs. However, since 2008 the inner city has been experiencing a revival as young people move into the cheap properties, thereby sparking gentrification that sends property values soaring. So the next time you’re looking to buy property, remember that the future of the location is key when you’re picking a prime area for investment. Do you remember in 2002 when President George W. Bush took measures to increase homeownership among low-income Americans? He declared that owning a home was a crucial part of the American Dream and should be accessible to everyone. Unfortunately, for some this dream turned into a nightmare. That’s because home ownership isn’t for everyone, and here’s why. For starters, government incentives for banks to issue mortgages to low-income families end up hurting those they are meant to help. Take the example of Atlanta police officer Darrin West. West bought his $130,000 townhouse using a $20,000 government-backed loan as down payment. In 2008, when the housing bubble burst, Mr. West and countless other Americans with government-backed mortgages could no longer afford their payments. They defaulted on their loans and their homes now belong to banks. Another reason homeownership isn’t for everyone is that it can be much more difficult to handle unforeseen circumstances when you own a home. Consider this, when you own a home somewhere you have an incentive to stay there. In order to do so you’ve got to keep up with your mortgage payments, often for decades. What happens if all of a sudden you have a major unforeseen expense or need to move? Say one of your children fell ill and you got slammed with a $10,000 bill. How could you pay it when all of your assets are tied up in your property? Or what if your company changes locations and you have to move to keep your job? You might have to choose between your job and your home. For these reasons renting can be a good choice for those who need the flexibility to move easily when finances demand it. Don’t assume that owning a home is necessary to leading a happy life. For some people it’s not even desirable. Most of us take it for granted that high-end remodeling will boost the value of our homes. Making things fancy increases their value, right? The truth is, high-end improvements return less on their investment than mid-range remodelling. Why? Because of the law of diminishing returns: at a certain point your investment returns less. While upscale remodelling is about style and aesthetic, mid-range options tend to be more functional. And functionality sells. Often when prospective buyers view a property the first question they ask is “does it have all the essentials?” Therefore, a pragmatically remodeled house is more marketable than one with luxury facilities. Consider a bathroom that’s in terrible shape, the mirror is cracked, the sink drips and the toilet won’t flush. A mid-range renovation would significantly increase the desirability of the space by making it more usable. But going the whole nine yards with the renovation wouldn’t change the functionality of the space and therefore wouldn’t make it much more valuable. So basic renovations are a better investment than luxury ones, but should you even remodel at all? Before you decide it’s important to remember that the value of your renovations will decrease over time. For instance, some facilities decrease in value as technical progress is made or as new things come into style. If you do decide to remodel you should factor in the value lost to depreciation. Say, for example, you do a total remodel of your home and it increases the property value by $24,310. In one year’s time that increase would drop to only $22,000, meaning that your investment has depreciated by $2,310 in just one year! So the next time you remodel make sure to go with the mid-range option to ensure the maximum return from your investment. Selling your house isn’t as simple as listing it and waiting for the offers to come rushing in. Selling property requires strategy and the key is to know when to sell. In fact, certain seasons are better for selling real estate than others. In many places summer is the best time to sell your house. This makes sense, because who wants to move in the cold of winter? But the weather isn’t the only reason summer is a good time to sell. Families with children are more likely to buy a new home during the summer because they won’t want to have to take their kids out of school when they move. So don’t lose track of time, take advantage of the prime selling season by listing your property early in the year. Just consider the fact that in 2011 and 2012 homes put on the market at the end of March sold faster and for over two percent more than the average for houses listed during the rest of the year. But listing your house at the right time won’t ensure you get a good price for it. The way you describe your property is also essential. Consider the description “modern”. You might think that a modern home is one with all the newest improvements, but the word actually refers to houses built in the 1950s and 1960s, a drawback for many buyers. Other adjectives like “cosy”, “cute”, or “charming” have different meanings for different people – in short, they’re not concrete enough. No matter how you describe your house, keep in mind that homes listed with longer descriptions tend to fetch more because buyers are more likely to view houses that are described in detail. So the next time you list your home make sure to do it in the prime season and don’t spare any details when describing it. The key message in this book: If you decide to invest in a home, you can boost its value by scouting out property in up-and-coming neighborhoods, choosing mid-range options when you remodel, and, when you’re selling, list it for sale at the right time of the year to get the best price. Actionable advice: Consider the school district. One factor which is often overlooked when buying a home is whether the property is located in an area with good schools. Even if you don’t have kids, make sure you buy a property close to a popular school. This will make it an attractive option for families, increasing its value.

Being successful is matter of figuring out what you’re good at and parlaying that skill into a career. Once you identify your special talent, this will free you to focus on what you enjoy and what you’re good at. This way, you can perform to the best of your ability and in tandem, succeed. That’s the story of Sophia Amoruso. She had a knack for negotiating discounts on coveted vintage clothing and then reselling items for a healthy profit. The venture started as a hobby, but the thrill and challenge eventually drove her to establish her own clothing empire. The author was simply being herself and doing what she was good at; that’s what made her successful. But she was able to find this path as she had accepted her own strengths and weakness. Accepting yourself is incredibly important – because as mentioned above, people are different. There are extroverts and introverts, and each type has an environment that works best for them. Extroverts flourish when they’re interacting with others. This personality type is well-suited for working on Wall Street, for example, where you have to push and shove and shout to make trades. But such an environment would be a nightmare for an introvert. In Amoruso’s case, her inner introvert blossomed thanks to social media. She built customer relationships online, where she could interact with fans in a measured, non-aggressive way. If you want to achieve greatness, it’s important to realize that no matter how motivated you are, there’s no straight line to success. And in fact, trying to follow a straight path will only limit you, as you might miss out on new and surprising opportunities. Imagine an aspiring astronaut who has spent years with his head buried in books. During his first zero-gravity flight test, he discovers he has severe motion sickness. Even though he spent his whole life training to be an astronaut, his laser-like focus prevented him from finding the right path that would truly suit his abilities. So choose a more serpentine path – yet know that you might have to take a few odd jobs along the way. Some people resist this, but you’ll see that you can learn something new with each opportunity. Although she was an anti-capitalist, Amoruso once took a job working at a large commercial bookstore chain. She started with a bad attitude and carried a lot of prejudices, but ultimately acquired customer service skills that would later set her own business apart. There are unexpected advantages to following an unconventional path. There is also, of course, the other side of the coin: failure. Failure can happen to anyone – so don’t fear it, own it! Chances are, if you aren’t succeeding at something, then what you’re doing isn’t fueling your inner passion. If it were, it would be effortless. That’s exactly what Amoruso discovered. Prior to starting her own business, she’d had her fair share of failures, dozens of jobs from which she was either fired or quit. At the time, she thought the reason things weren’t working out was because she was lazy. But the truth was that these jobs simply didn’t work for her. Yet when she was collecting clothes and bargaining and selling her creations on eBay, Amoruso could work all hours of the day without even once checking the clock. Once you’ve figured out what you love to do, how can you succeed in doing it? Start by becoming an expert in your field, and learn everything you can. If you’re in the business world, the best way to gain expertise is through experience. For Amoruso, this meant building her own company from scratch. In the beginning, she did everything herself: bought the clothes, packed and shipped them to customers. This ensured that she knew the whole business, inside and out. And so when items didn’t sell, she would adjust her marketing approach, through changing text or images on her website. By being so adaptable, she gained lots of experience and knowledge about what exactly her customers wanted. During the first few years, Amoruso also styled all her own fashion shoots. In the process, she did much more than sell clothing; she offered young women an immersive, inspiring fashion experience. She did this by choosing approachable, cool-looking models and dressed them in a quirky way that her customers loved and wanted to copy. Ultimately, customers didn’t just connect with her product, they also connected with each other, creating a powerful community. This approach gave her fledgling business a major advantage over other vintage shops on eBay, many of which had dull photos and poor marketing. So when she moved from eBay to her own site, her community followed. And their loyalty didn’t end there. Her customers loved NastyGal so much they shared their find with friends. This word-of-mouth marketing helped Amoruso grow her customer base. By working hard and building experience, the author developed expert insight into what her customers wanted. But what really helped her succeed was that she was able to put all this expertise into building an influential, loyal community. There are no stupid questions. But there are questions that go unanswered because they were never asked in the first place. So if you want to do something, you have to start by asking for it. Think about it this way: If you don’t tell people what you want, you’re never going to get it. It’s simple! You have to vocalize your hopes and dreams if you want people to help you achieve them. Amoruso learned this one day when she was trapped on the side of the road during a heavy rainstorm. Although she didn’t have a dollar on her, she took a chance and held out her thumb to hitch a ride from a Greyhound bus. The bus stopped, and the driver let her ride for free. This lesson hit her like a lightening bolt: Ask, and you shall recieve. Another important aspect of getting what you want is trusting your intuition. That means knowing which rules are okay to break. After all, to build a successful business you have to be creative and break some rules. It’s not about seeing the world in black and white, but rather in shades of gray. Being more flexible in your thinking will also prevent you from worrying so much about whether you’re doing something right. Instead, break some rules, cross some lines – and make something new. Yet not all rules are meant to be broken. Amoruso learned this when she was busted for shoplifting. After paying a fine to avoid jail time, the author was humbled by her experience. She decided that the only rules worth breaking were arbitrary ones, like wearing last year’s shoes to a fashion party. So when it comes to breaking rules, don’t waste time by breaking the law. Unless you really feel like learning a different lesson in jail. So we’ve learned that there are some rules you can break, and others you can’t. But there’s also the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Basically, this means if you put positivity out into the universe, you’ll receive the same in return. And what’s more, by focusing on what you like rather than what you don’t, you’ll free up energy that you can then pour back into your passions. Amoruso was tempted to ignore this advice when a friend copied the entire NastyGal website and tried to pass it off as her own. If the author had dwelled on this incident and stayed angry, it only would have helped her competitor, who would have used the opportunity to steal customers who weren’t getting the great customer service they were used to. But the author didn’t cave. She didn’t waste time plotting revenge, and instead rededicated herself to her business. As Amoruso learned, you can’t worry about what others are doing or thinking. If you spend your time obsessed with others, you’ll neglect the innovation and creativity inside of you. High school was miserable for the author. She was always paralyzed with fear by what others thought of her. So she left school early. Ultimately, she realized that worrying about what others think of you only wastes time and energy. So to stay focused and ignore the noise, create sigils. These are small words that are encoded with your goals. To make a sigil, jot down your goal in a word or short phrase and then slice it up, removing or combining whatever letters you want until you’re left with a pictogram no one else understands. These private codes can empower you to think positively about your dreams and stay motivated. Now that you know to stay positive and be true to yourself, how do you apply these skills to your entrepreneurial goals? The next blinks will show you how. When we’re children, creativity comes from paint sets, crayons and paper dress patterns. But as adults, we learn that problem-solving too is inherently creative. And when you combine creativity with business, you can set yourself apart. A creative entrepreneurial approach relies on questioning everything; in doing so, you create options for your business. Accepting the status quo will only limit you. For example, NastyGal does not heed the fashion-industry standard of thin, flat-chested models. The company rather established a reputation for creatively dressing different body shapes and marketing its products to women with curves. This innovative approach to styling wasn’t just a creative choice; for NastyGal, it was also a smart business decision that helped generate revenue. However, creative people sometimes get so swept up in the more imaginative aspects of their work that they ignore the more practical business side. It’s important to balance the two. While the author enjoyed thinking about the font on her website and the photographs she used to showcase her products, she also devoted plenty of energy and attention to acquiring and retaining customers. She always considered the shopping experience from her customer’s point of view, while making sure the aesthetics were consistent and unique across the site. Through this, she connected her entrepreneurial side with her more creative talents. Creative people can often be especially effective at marketing, so think of focusing your energies here. It’s a way of tapping your inner artist while also growing your business. Some people think that just because they’re a stylist (or some other creative type) that they can’t also be a businessperson. Thinking this way is negative, and almost guarantees that you will fail. As an entrepreneur, it’s important to choose the right team of employees and investors. But how? The best sort of team to work with is honest, hard-working and loyal. The author learned this one year when the NastyGal’s warehouse chief quit during the crucial Black Friday shopping period, leaving the warehouse in the lurch. Yet a number of motivated employees jumped in to help. They packed boxes, fulfilled orders and made sure the whole operation ran smoothly. They went above and beyond their job descriptions to make sure the company didn’t miss any customer orders during a critical time. For a CEO, a staff like this is a dream. Knowing that you can count on employees makes it easier to sleep at night. And meanwhile, as you and your team are hard at work, make sure your investors are supporting your efforts, and not undermining them. Investors are there to help you grow your dreams, not impose their own. As Amoruso personally experienced, some investors can be bullies. One potential investor, for example, asked the company’s male senior executives whether the author, as a woman, had trouble managing money. His small-mindedness was totally out of sync at a company like NastyGal. Especially one built from the ground up by a woman who’d never even taken out a business loan. Eventually, the author found investors who understood that she was starting a movement, not just a fluffy site for women to waste money. In the end, it’s important that you hold on to your principles and refuse to compromise, just for financial gain. Certain decisions might seem appealing in the short-term, but they’ll only cause problems in the long run. You know how some people have a glow? It’s all about confidence; when you feel good in your own skin, you look good too. This holds true both on a personal level and on a business level. If you know what you are as a company, you’ll be able to feel comfortable and confident following your own path. Otherwise, you’ll just get distracted by every new trend that springs up in your industry. With NastyGal, the author learned that it’s important to represent a business persona as a kind of girl who can talk to anyone, even a stranger. Maybe it would be more “cool” to seem aloof, as some competing brands do, but that kind of unfriendliness hints more instead to a lack of confidence. And as we all know, you can’t buy confidence. Sure, great clothes can help, but only if you have the smarts to back them up. This means listening when others are speaking and having the courage to form your own opinions. It also means knowing when to delegate a decision to someone with more expertise or experience. Never insist that you know everything, as it will only alienate. Instead, remain humble and confident. If you follow these suggestions, you’ll be naturally attractive to everyone you meet. And if you pair that with a fantastic dress? You’ll blow them away. The key message in this book: Becoming a successful entrepreneur isn’t about doing well in school, it’s about figuring out what you really love and letting your passion drive you. So if you want to succeed, ask for what you want and find a way to connect your entrepreneurial side with your creative talents. Most importantly, be confident! Actionable advice: Create a sigil, or a small word encoded with your goals. Lost sight of your goals and need a boost to get back on track? Write down one of your dreams in a word or short phrase and then literally slice it up, removing or combining whatever letters you want until you’re left with a pictogram no one else can understand. This small, private code will empower you to think positively about your dreams and stay motivated. Suggested further reading: Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office by Lois P.

Whether it’s your phone buzzing in your pocket with the latest tweet, a colleague interrupting you in the middle of an important task or the daily barrage of emails, your time is constantly being stolen from you, minute by minute, hour by hour. And once you’ve lost that time, you can never get it back again. To remain focused and make sure these time thieves don’t get the upper hand, you need to keep a few tricks up your sleeve. These blinks will get you started. In these blinks, you’ll learn why the number 1,440 is so important; about the 321-Zero system; and how many books George W. Bush read throughout his presidency.   Do you ever wish you could have an extra hour in the day to read, exercise or hang out with the people you love? Well, you can and there’s no magic required! But first, you need to understand how precious time is. That’s why the first secret of time management is learning that time is your most valuable asset and that, once it’s lost, you can never get it back. A good way to monitor this precious resource is by breaking it down. For instance, there are 1,440 minutes in a day, each of which should be invested wisely. To remind himself of this fact, the author taped a “1,440” poster to his office door. It reminds him of the limited time in each day. But why use minutes? Why not think about the 86,400 seconds that every day offers? Well, there are a bunch of daily tasks that you can actually do in a minute, like knocking out 30 sit-ups, reading a poem or watering a plant. This fact makes minutes key to monitoring your time. Okay, now that you appreciate how valuable time is, it’s time to start prioritizing it. This is where the second secret comes in: determine and prioritize your most important task, or your MIT. This is the single task that will have the biggest impact on your life or work. Just take Therese Macan, a professor at the University of Missouri-St Louis. She found that one of the most important productivity determinants is the ability to identify priorities. So pinpointing an MIT is central to time management. For instance, if a senior executive sets a goal of developing a new app, her MIT might be to hire a new programmer. Or the MIT for a start-up CEO could be to prepare a great presentation to land a major investment. Research has shown that having a daily MIT, whatever it is, results in greater levels of happiness and improved focus. Lots of people are weighed down by never-ending to-do lists. Take a look at yours. How many of the tasks have been lingering there for weeks, unnecessarily stressing you out? You probably have at least a few such tasks, and the best way to deal with them is by pulling out a good old fashioned calendar. Here’s where the third secret comes into play: ditch your to-do list and pick up your calendar to de-stress your day. Research has found that an average of 41 percent of items on to-do lists never actually get completed. One of the reasons for this shocking statistic is that the tasks on such lists usually aren’t accompanied by a note stating how long it’ll take to complete them. As a result, tasks that are more difficult or less important generally get left undone. That might not be such a problem, except for the fact that the unfinished items on your to-do list will inevitably produce a lot of stress that could just as easily be avoided. In fact, researchers from Florida State University discovered that you can avoid this stress by simply coming up with a plan to complete a task. The Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller offers a good example. She succeeded at spending time with her family, completing her school obligations, training for the Olympics and even doing media interviews, all by scheduling time for important tasks. This strategy is known as time blocking or time boxing and, incredibly, all it requires is maintaining a detailed calendar. By doing so, Miller forced herself to prioritize tasks that would bring her closer to achieving her goal and, to this day, she keeps an almost minute-by-minute schedule. However, you’ll inevitably encounter tasks on your calendar that you can’t accomplish. When this happens, instead of letting them drift into the past, simply reschedule. For example, if you usually make it to the gym at noon, but have a flight to catch at the same time, simply move your workout to earlier in the day. Everyone’s been there: an important deadline is creeping up and, instead of working on the project at hand, you’re planted in front of a screen – scrolling through Facebook, texting a friend or watching your favorite TV show. Procrastination is a tough one, but, luckily, there are strategies to break free from it and start getting things done. This is where the fourth secret comes in: procrastination can be overcome by imagining your future self. After all, you don’t procrastinate because you're lazy, but because you don’t have sufficient motivation. Imagining yourself in the future can fix this problem and it’s as simple as asking yourself two questions: “What pleasure will I get by doing this thing?” and “What pain will I feel if I don’t do it?” For instance, if your goal is to work out every single day, but you can’t get yourself to exercise, just imagine having a huge beer belly and feeling totally sluggish. Such a mental routine will get you off the couch and onto the treadmill. At the same time, being honest about the actions your future self will take can also help you achieve your goals. For example, if you know you’ll be inclined to eat unhealthy snacks during a future break, you can protect yourself by throwing out all the junk food in your house. You could even go a step further by filling the house with healthy options like baby carrots and hummus. From there, you can move on to the fifth secret: there will always be more to do; you can’t do everything. And, actually, that’s fine! In fact, prioritizing and scheduling the tasks you want to do is much more valuable than crossing off as many items as possible. Just take President George W. Bush as an example. He knew there would always be more to do. So instead of trying to do everything, he made it his priority to read tons of books, since he found it therapeutic and educational. As a result, he read some 95 titles during his presidency! Have you ever had an incredible idea while shopping for groceries or walking the dog? Wouldn’t it be great if, instead of straining to remember it later, you could just jot it down right then and there? That’s why the sixth secret is to always have a notebook handy. After all, writing down your thoughts helps you hold onto them. Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson says he never would have built his business empire without his trusty notebook. He was so committed to writing down his ideas that, one time when he had a business idea and no notebook, he wrote down the thought in his passport! For him, if an idea doesn’t get written down, it could be lost forever. Taking notes by hand also helps your memory. For instance, the psychologists Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer found that students who hand wrote their notes during a TED talk were better able to recall the material than students who took notes on their laptops. Writing down your thoughts is crucial – as is maintaining control over your schedule, which is where the seventh secret comes into play. It says that you should avoid checking your email too often, lest other people dictate how you spend your time. In fact, contrary to popular belief, constantly checking emails is unproductive. That’s because the anticipation felt when checking your inbox is comparable to pulling the handle of a slot machine. Often, you check your messages, and there’s nothing new. But sometimes there is a new message. This unpredictability is addictive, and one begins to check more and more often, hoping for the hit of dopamine that a message affords. Obviously, this costs you time and interrupts your focus. A good way to untether yourself from your email is by unsubscribing from newsletters by using a program like unroll.me. But you can also adopt the 321-Zero system. To do so, just limit yourself to three email checks per day, while trying to get your inbox to zero in just 21 minutes. If you’ve ever had an office job, you know how incredibly boring meetings can be. But that’s not the only problem with meetings. The eighth secret is that most meetings are inefficient and you should only schedule them as a last resort. In fact, a 2015 survey found that 35 percent of respondents considered weekly status meetings to be a waste of time, for these two primary reasons: First, in accordance with Parkinson’s law of triviality, meeting participants tend to waste lots of time on insignificant issues. Second, extroverts usually dominate meetings, making others less likely to participate. As a result, valuable information might not be shared during such gatherings. That being said, if you absolutely have to have a meeting, opt for a stand-up affair rather than a sit-down one. This might seem odd, but researchers at Washington University found that meetings during which participants stand result in better collaboration, less attachment to ideas, higher levels of engagement and more effective problem-solving. The Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, offers another good tip: by scheduling meetings based on increments of five or ten minutes, she’s able to have up to 70 meetings a week. If she stuck with the standard 30-minute block she would never be able to accomplish this. In other words, controlling the timing of meetings will prevent people from sucking up your time. This is key since other people will constantly ask you for things, a fact that dovetails nicely with the ninth secret: achieve your immediate goals faster by saying no to most things. After all, every time you say yes to something, you’re saying no to something else. The Olympic rower Sara Hendershot is a good example. She’s a pro at saying no to social and other engagements. This hard-learned skill enabled her to keep her eyes on the prize in the lead up to the 2012 Olympics in London, where she qualified for the finals. As a cherry on top, research has even found that people who tend to say no in response to requests for their time are happier and have more energy.  By now you know that it’s essential to spend your limited time on tasks that will have the greatest impact. The tenth secret can help you do that. It says that by applying the Pareto Principle you can uncover shortcuts to success. Here’s what that means: In the 1890s, the Italian philosopher and economist Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto found that 20 percent of the pea plants in his garden produced 80 percent of his healthy peapods. He extrapolated this 80/20 rule into the general principle that now bears his name. It can be applied to a number of areas. For instance, by applying the 80/20 rule to your employees, you might decide that the majority of your salespeople should be let go since they’re your lowest performers. From there, you could focus your energy on the remaining 20 percent, who already generate 80 percent of your sales, by giving them rewards and greater levels of support. The end result will likely be an overall improvement in sales. Or you could use the 80/20 rule in your personal life by analyzing the tasks you do on a weekly basis, then identifying which of them has the greatest impact. That being said, you can also accomplish more by critically assessing the tasks in front of you. The eleventh secret is designed to help you do that. It says that leveraging your skills and delegating work will increase your productivity. Just take a 2013 experiment published in the Harvard Business Review by the professors Julian Birkinshaw and Jordan Cohen. It found that 43 percent of workers were unsatisfied with the tasks they do at work. By simply training employees to slow down and ask themselves a few questions, the study’s authors were able to identify important tasks, freeing up an extra eight hours per week. The first question they had people ask themselves was, “How important is this task to the company?” Then, “Is there anyone else who can complete it?” And finally, “How could this task be accomplished if I had half as much time?” On a normal day in the office, do you ever have difficulty focusing? Most people do and a little bit of advice here can go a long way. This is the twelfth secret, which says that grouping your work into recurring themes each week will make you more effective. A great example comes from Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square. He says that the secret to running both his companies was to have a theme for each day. For instance, on Mondays, he would focus on management; Wednesdays would be dedicated to marketing; and Sunday would be reserved for reflection, feedback and strategy for the next week. Or take the entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan. He recommends theming each week based on three types of days to stay focused and remain invigorated. The first type is called a focus day, which is for vital activities like revenue-growing tasks. The second type is called a buffer day, which is for catching up on emails, returning calls, having meetings, delegating tasks and doing paperwork. And finally, a free day is one on which no work should be done. This last type is reserved for vacation, family time and charity work. Another simple way to boost your efficiency has to do with tackling small tasks. This is the thirteenth secret, which says that you should immediately take action on tasks that’ll take fewer than five minutes to accomplish and avoid returning to the same task over and over. Just consider the straight-A student Nihar Suthar. He completes five-minute assignments right away, avoiding a long list of tiny tasks. Or take the author. His sister Debbie recently emailed him, but instead of writing her back, he called her to make sure they could talk. By scheduling a call in his calendar and thereby saving the mental energy he would otherwise spend trying to remember to get back to her, he decided to handle this task immediately. If he had instead put it on a to-do list or left it in his inbox, he probably would have never remembered to address it. Imagine waking up at six in the morning, working out for 45 minutes and then whipping together a delicious, high-protein breakfast. It might sound difficult but the fourteenth secret shows why it’s essential. It says that dedicating the first hour of each day to a morning routine will enhance your health – mind, body and soul. In fact, starting the day with a workout is a great way to get your creative juices flowing. Just consider the New York Times best-selling author Dan Miller, who starts off each day by meditating for half an hour, then working out for 45 minutes while listening to audio programs. He avoids checking the news or looking at his phone during this time, devoting his first hour to positive and inspirational experiences. He even claims that his most creative ideas come to him during this daily “me time.” From there, you can further increase your energy and well-being by eating a healthy breakfast and drinking lots of water. This is huge for the best-selling author and podcast host Shawn Stevenson. He considers energy to be everything, and so he starts off each day with what he calls an inner bath. He simply drinks 30 ounces of purified water to jumpstart his metabolism by flushing out waste. In fact, according to the fifteenth secret, energy is paramount. The secret is that productivity isn’t about time, but about maintaining focus and energy. That’s why Francesco Cirillo came up with the Pomodoro Technique – a method designed to reduce distractions and boost productivity. His approach involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, devoting your full attention to a single task for the full 25 minutes and then taking a five-minute break before repeating the cycle. Author Monica Leonelle found ample success with the Pomodoro Technique after realizing that she didn’t have a single spare hour in the day. By using the Pomodoro Technique, she recharged during her breaks, maintaining steady energy throughout the day and, with the help of other techniques, went from writing 600 words per hour to 3,500! The key message in this book: Highly successful people consider time to be their most valuable asset. By applying their most effective life hacks – which do everything from prioritizing tasks to boosting your energy and keeping you focused – you too can make the most of your time.  Actionable advice: Design a morning routine! When forming your morning routine, use the LIFE S.A.V.E.R.S system developed by the success coach Hal Elrod. This acronym will help you include the most important things. S stands for Silence to foster gratitude and meditation A is for Affirmations of goals and priorities V is for Visualizations of your ideal life E is for Exercise R is for Reading And the final S is for Scribing in your journal.

Well-intentioned tips on how to nail your dream job are endless, covering everything from the perfect time to send in your application to the pitch of your voice when speaking to the interview panel. But with so much to think about, it’s easy to lose sight of the real essentials. That’s where these blinks come in. They break down the interview process and remind us of the handful of critical elements that will ensure a successful application. You will find out why looks matter more than books; why the ideal interview would last 60 seconds; and what you really need to tell your future boss to grab his or her attention. Have you ever been nervous before a job interview? Well, you’re not the only one. Employers get worried before interviews too. After all, they’re under tremendous pressure to make good hiring decisions because bad decisions cost their company money. Just remember that for every employee who’s sacked, the company has to pay three times their monthly salary plus all the costs of hiring and training a replacement as well as fixing their errors. Tony Hsieh is the CEO of the top online shoe and clothing store, Zappos. Hsieh says that bad hiring decisions have cost his company upwards of $100 million! These costs accrue because the people recruiting new employees are required to make rapid decisions. They receive hundreds of applications and, after reviewing several candidates, find these potential staff members all start to blur together. That’s why the 60-second strategy is necessary to secure the job you want. It’s all about grabbing the attention of your interviewer with concise answers of 60 seconds or less. Such brevity is important in a world that’s moving faster than ever. People are used to communicating through text messages, Twitter updates of 140 characters or less and news clips of just one to three minutes. Since everyone is affected by these rapid forms of communication, holding a person’s attention can be a gargantuan task. That’s especially true for job interviews, as employers want to make a fast hire and will get distracted by long-winded or rambling answers. By sticking to answers of 60 seconds or less, you can communicate your point quickly and in the right language, easily explaining why you’re the right person for the job. You just learned that when a recruiter has to interview lots of people for a job, the lines between the candidates often blur together. Luckily, there’s a strategy that can help you stick out from the crowd. It’s called the 5 Point Agenda. To succeed, it should be based on your five most marketable qualities and skills. By paring things down, you can focus your interviewer on your biggest strengths, especially those that match the company’s needs. Once you’ve outlined these five points, mention them throughout your interview. By stressing the qualities you want the interviewer to focus on, you’ll help her remember your skills and make her believe that you’re the right fit. Imagine you’re applying for a job as an online graphic designer. Your 5 Point Agenda might be: first, you have ten years’ experience with a popular online retailer. Second, you have a massive portfolio of original design work. Third, you’re experienced in building websites. Fourth, you’ve got stellar editing skills. And fifth, you’re fluent in three languages. Don’t forget, your 5 Point Agenda also needs to stick to the 60-second rule. But, the traits you put on your 5 Point Agenda shouldn’t be the same every time you prepare for an interview. Actually, before every interview, you should make a new, customized 5 Point Agenda that corresponds closely to the job for which you’re applying. To be successful at this, your primary abilities need to fit the objectives and goals of the company. Once you’ve made sure that’s true, you can customize your agenda in three simple steps. Begin by writing out your main experiences and the responsibilities you’ve so far held. Focus in particular on the work strengths and skills at which you excel. Research the company by looking them up on websites like LinkedIn and Glassdoor or asking friends or colleagues with connections at the firm. From there, you can determine which of your skills are most relevant to the employer and tailor your 5 Point Agenda accordingly. It’s no secret that job interview anxiety can lead to nervous rambling. It also shouldn’t come as a surprise that long-winded speeches aren’t the best way to land a job. So, it’s critical to handle tough interview questions with composure, and there are three factors that are essential for doing so. First, you should do some solid basic preparation, so you have answers for the most common interview questions. You should also research the products and services in which the company specializes. Second, be prepared with specific examples of how you’ve performed in the past, which show you’re qualified for the job. Employers want to be certain that you can do the job you’re applying for, and specifics will help you convince them that you can. You might describe a situation in which you solved a challenging problem or helped save money and time. That being said, your examples don’t have to be restricted to work. Feel free to throw in positive achievements in volunteer positions, student organizations, and the like. And of course, don’t forget to mention that you’re excited to take on new tasks and develop into a true asset for the company. The third and final essential is to be prepared to sell yourself as the ideal worker persona. This is important since employers like to categorize people neatly. Millennials are dismissed as technology-obsessed and entitled, while it’s assumed that older employees are less driven or innovative. You need to fight these stereotypes. To guide the interviewer’s assessment of you, make sure your answers set you apart as an ideal worker. That means being a quick and dedicated learner with stellar communication and computer skills. You should also be flexible and have a success attitude, which means you’re focused on productivity and ways to improve your performance as well as that of the company. As your interview wraps up, the employer will likely ask if you’ve got any questions. At this moment, you’re being handed a golden opportunity to make a good impression, but it’s also a chance to figure out if the job is the right one for you. Interviewers pay a great deal of attention to the questions that job-seekers ask. What you’re curious about can say a lot about you, which makes it essential to avoid queries related to salary or payscale. While some applicants will blurt out whatever comes to mind, this will only make them seem silly and unprepared. Instead, take the time before the interview to write a list on a piece of paper that you can take out when asked for questions. Doing so will demonstrate to the employer that you really took the time to research the company and consider how you can help it succeed. For this purpose, it’s appropriate to prepare around ten to 15 questions. From there, you can also ask the interviewer about something that he brought up during the interview that made you curious. Or, if your questions were answered over the course of the interview, be sure to say so explicitly. For example, you might say, “looking over my list, the questions I had regarding your training policy have been clearly answered.” And, finally, although it’s been said already, it’s important to stress that you should never ask a salary or benefits-related question in an interview. Just take the opinion of a top manager at AT&T who claims to judge prospective hires primarily on the questions they ask, which he says reveal a lot about their motivation. For him, if a candidate only asks salary-related questions, they come off as solely concerned with money and disinterested in the actual job. That’s not to say you should never ask these questions. It’s just a better idea to ask them once you’ve been offered the job. The modern office may have a relatively casual dress code, but appearances are still a huge factor during interviews. It’s simply not OK to dress casually for a job interview. If you don’t present yourself appropriately, you’ll have lost the job without even opening your mouth. This is especially relevant during the initial round of interviews. In the first few moments, employers will analyze your appearance and decide if you look right for the job. They’ll focus primarily on your clothes and your personal hygiene. Dirty, wrinkled clothing or missing buttons are an instant recipe for failure. Beyond that, your clothes should be clean and well fitting, your nails clean and trimmed and, if you’re a woman, you should avoid going overboard with makeup. Instead, stick to tasteful applications and simple, appropriate jewelry. By presenting yourself neatly, you’ll show the employer that you’re capable of representing the company. Enter with your most polished foot forward! But looks aren’t everything. You must also practice your nonverbal communication skills as well as your eye contact and handshake. Nonverbal communication is essential as it can be greatly revealing. That’s why your movements, gestures and facial expressions make a good impression during an interview. To nail this, start your interview in the best way possible. Smile at the recruiter and offer her a firm handshake. Don’t wreck that first impression with a subpar handshake. From there, focus on eye contact, which is crucial to a successful interview. Being able to maintain eye contact will show the employer that you’re confident and trustworthy. And finally, don’t be afraid to smile, as long as it’s natural. Nothing sends a warmer message than a brimming, sincere smile. The key message in this book: Interviews are an art, and anyone can land the job they want by following some helpful pointers. To impress your interviewer, answer her questions in 60 seconds or less while tying your responses to your main strengths, experience, and the skills relevant to the position for which you’re applying.  Actionable advice: Send a handwritten thank-you note to follow up after your interview. Sending a handwritten note after an interview will automatically set you apart from the crowd as few people will take the time to make such a gesture. Be sure that you write this thank-you letter on professional stationery, including a short message thanking the employer for their time and reiterating your interest.

Everything from the color of the sky to the number of fingers on their hands can spark their curiosity; they want to know the reasons behind everything. But then, as we grow older, we tend to lose this thirst for knowledge and learning. We tend to accept things as they are, and stop asking the simple question of “why?” These blinks show you why it is vital that we rediscover our love of finding things out, and why our culture, careers and even democracies depend on our curiosity. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the founder of Wal-Mart actively encouraged taking rivals’ ideas; how curiosity can help save a moribund relationship; and why our society depends on our curiosity toward our leaders. Everyone has heard the saying “knowledge is power.” We all know that knowledge is essential, but what’s the best way to acquire it? The secret to gaining knowledge is curiosity – the more curious you are, the more information you'll collect. By collecting more information, you’ll be better equipped to react to changing situations, since you'll be able to consider more options. Better still, you might even be able to anticipate changes before they happen. Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, understood the central importance of curiosity. He held regular meetings with his top 500 managers every Saturday morning. Each time, he'd ask what they'd seen when visiting Walmart's competitors. He was curious to know every detail about his rivals, in case they had any interesting new ideas. The knowledge he gained from these meetings allowed him to optimize his stores; Walmart has fairly comfortably held onto its position as the market leader. Collecting information like this is always important. You never know when you'll need any given piece of information, but you'll be glad to have it when the time comes around. A good strategy one of the authors uses for obtaining more knowledge is to have curiosity conversations, and he's had many of them over the past few decades. Curiosity conversations don't have a specific purpose, but they've often served him in unexpected ways. For example, in 1992, he had a conversation with Daryl Gates, the chief of the LAPD at the time, who was notorious for his autocratic style of leadership. He didn't think much about the conversation at the time, but when he was working on a film about J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI, a few years later, he thought about Daryl Gates; their conversation had given him an insight into the thoughts and behavior of people in powerful positions, and he used Gates as an inspiration. When you possess a deep curiosity about something, your desire to learn more about it will let you push past just about any obstacle that presents itself. Curiosity helps you overcome your fear of rejection, because it motivates you to keep pushing each time you are told “no” until you finally get a “yes.” One of the authors, Brian Grazer, has plenty of personal experience with overcoming rejection, but his keen sense of curiosity was especially important in earning his first taste of commercial success with the film Splash. The film told the story of the love between a mermaid and a human, and at first, no one was interested in making it. He could have easily given up and started on an entirely new project, but he kept going because he was so curious to see how the film would turn out. He continuously tweaked his strategy for getting the movie made, and eventually he got a “yes.” His curiosity pushed him all the way and the film turned out to be a surprise hit. You should also be curious about your fears themselves, because that’s precisely how you can come to understand and confront them. Here’s an example: Because he's a renowned movie producer, Grazer is frequently asked to give speeches, and he admits that he's always dreaded such occasions. But once again, curiosity can come to the rescue. First he became curious about the origin of his fear, and he realized he was actually afraid of being unprepared. So he started thoroughly preparing for every speech by asking himself tough questions about his goals, his audience and the nature of his speech. This curiosity for even the smallest details helps him prepare carefully and deal with his nerves. These days, he’s not afraid of giving speeches at all. Life is often about telling stories, not only for writers or film directors, but also for anyone sharing an anecdote among friends or even trying to sell a product. When it comes to telling a good story, curiosity plays a key role in more ways than one might think. Curiosity allows you to collect the information you need to tell a good story. When you want to engage your audience, you need to know something they don’t. Always staying curious helps you bring together interesting experiences that you can tell others about later. For example, Brian Grazer has long been curious about the work of intelligence agencies. Over the years, he’s managed to have curiosity conversations with two CIA directors and a number of intelligence agents from other countries like the United Kingdom and Israel. These conversations are what gave him the idea for 24, a fast-paced TV series about an intelligence agent, with an hour of storyline elapsing over the course of each hour-long episode. The things he learned in his curiosity conversations helped him make the show as realistic and entertaining as possible. Curiosity doesn’t just help you write a good story though – it helps you grab and hold the audience’s attention. Whenever you watch a film or TV series, or read a book or newspaper article, it’s your curiosity that entices you to read on. A good title makes you curious to read an article; the cliffhanger at the end of an episode makes you curious about the next one. Make someone curious about your story and they’ll want to know the rest of it. Make someone curious about your product and they’ll try to find out more. When listing the factors most essential to running a successful business, curiosity might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but it’s actually a powerful business tool. Why? When you’re curious about other people’s thoughts, you collaborate with them more effectively. Curiosity fosters cooperation. Grazer uses this strategy as the head of his production firm. He strives to lead by asking questions, and avoids giving direct orders whenever possible. He also encourages his employees to ask questions of him. This gives people more opportunities to explain and reflect on their work. They’ll become more confident about their work’s positive potential and be more aware of any flaws. Mutual curiosity often leads to meaningful dialogue, which can inspire innovation and help unearth solutions to any problem. Additionally, curiosity doesn’t just help your relationships with your colleagues – it helps you connect with your customers too. If you’re looking to buy a new TV, for instance, you won’t be pleased with a salesperson who aggressively pushes the TV they assume is best for you. You’ll be much more appreciative of a person who tries hard to find out what you want, then tailors their suggestions accordingly. So a curious salesperson will make you feel more comfortable. They’ll be better able to find what you want and you’ll be much more likely to want to go back to their store. Anytime you’re offering something to a customer, be sure to find out exactly what they need. If you’re curious about what they truly want, you’ll be better equipped to serve them, which also means you’ll be more likely to make a sale. As we’ve seen, curiosity motivates us to explore the world around us and gain more knowledge, leading us to have new and exciting experiences. But we should also direct it toward the things closest to us, like our friends and family. You might think you already know everything there is to know about your loved ones, but chances are you actually don’t. Stay curious about the lives of people you care about – it’s a sign of respect and it strengthens your relationships. But it can also be easy to lose your curiosity about loved ones, especially in long-term romantic relationships. If you get trapped in a routine, you might find yourself asking your partner “How was your day?” every evening, and just getting the same answer. So instead, try asking more specific questions. A question like “How did your meeting with that new client go?” shows that you’re genuinely interested in your partner’s day. It shows that you remembered they had a meeting in the first place, and that you care about how it went. A lack of curiosity is definitely a sign of a deteriorating relationship. The good news is that it’s easy to revive a relationship by being genuinely curious. Curiosity is what helps you connect with people in the first place. When you meet someone – whether you’re in a bar, a business meeting or an airplane – you don’t get to know them just by saying “Hi!” and launching into your life story. You ask them about their own story first. Nearly everyone would rather be asked questions than be told a story they didn’t ask to hear. Think about a good first date: if you’re interested in the person, you’ll enjoy asking them questions and telling them about yourself. Curiosity brings people closer together. When was the last time you voted? Did you feel well informed beforehand? Were you confident about your decision? Curiosity isn’t just a tool for enriching our personal and business lives – it’s an important component of democracy too. If we aren’t curious about the institutions in our society, we can’t hold them accountable for whatever it is they’re doing. Every election invites us – or even obliges us – to be curious. You need to know about the candidates, their political views and the plans they have for the future; you can’t make a good decision otherwise. Of course, this curiosity can take up a lot of time and effort, but consider the act of reading a newspaper or watching the news on TV: when you take in news, you’re essentially outsourcing your curiosity to journalists, whose very job it is to be curious and hunt for the most important stories. Throughout history, curious people have always been agents of social progress. They’ve led our society to where it is today. In Europe, for example, the Church held immense power before the Enlightenment. As an institution, it decided what people were allowed to think, and the questions they were allowed to ask. It suppressed curiosity in ideas that went against its teachings. But gradually, people managed to break free thanks to extremely curious scientists like Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton. They kept asking tough questions about their world and the answers they found propelled their societies into modernity. Curiosity is still considered dangerous in some parts of the world today. The Chinese government, for instance, censors a great deal of the internet to keep its citizens away from information that might help them threaten the established system. After looking at all the great benefits that curiosity brings, it might seem as if you can never have enough of it. However, it is indeed possible to have too much curiosity. Too much information can be distracting or demotivating, so it’s important to know what your limits are. Sometimes, when you’re confident about what you’re doing and you don’t want to get distracted, it’s good to be anti-curious about other people’s opinions. For example, Brian Grazer has produced some movies that weren’t commercially successful, despite the fact that he himself thought they were very good. His unconventional films like Rush and Frost/Nixon were always unlikely to attract the same audiences or success as A Beautiful Mind or Apollo 13. But he was determined to get them made, so he had to stop listening to people who thought he was making the wrong choice. It’s not always easy to know when you should tone down your curiosity. You have to be confident about your opinions before you can know when to stop listening to the opinions of others. Grazer has worked in the film industry for decades, so he’s confident about his tastes. He knows which films are well written, so he can recognize a good idea like Frost/Nixon even when others don’t. Frost/Nixon wasn’t a big hit at the box office, which wasn’t a surprise, but it received five Academy Award nominations and was applauded by critics. Sometimes it pays to keep a lid on your curiosity and go with what you already know and believe. The key message in this book: Curiosity is what drives us to learn and encourages us to seek out new experiences. It’s a critical part of achieving success in business, getting closer to your loved ones and growing as a person. It can help you overcome fear, amass useful knowledge and gain surprising insights. Curiosity is an important lifelong asset, so don’t let yours fade! Actionable advice: Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Even if you’re talking to a complete stranger, questions allow you to learn. They also show the person you’re talking to that you’re interested in them, which is vital to forging strong relationships. Suggested further reading: The Eureka Factor by John Kounios and Mark Beeman The Eureka Factor (2015) looks at the remarkable phenomena of insights and creativity, and how the two are intertwined. By laying out the latest scientific research, it sheds light on how insights work, including what supports and hinders them. In addition, it provides powerful advice on how everyone can train themselves to have more eureka moments. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

In a word, adaptability – the ability to change with the times and piggyback on technological and social changes to achieve success. Adaptability is a skill that’s becoming indispensable in today’s frenetic world of business. Markets and consumer tastes are fickle, and nothing is as likely to land you in hot water as complacency. That’s something business strategist Max McKeown knows a thing or two about from his work with clients like Microsoft and Sony, who’ve mastered the art of anticipating the future and changing course accordingly. But don’t just take his word for it. In these blinks, we’ll analyze adaptability in action everywhere from a small Italian village battling post-financial crisis austerity measures, to the boardroom of a multinational coffee chain and the post-war British car industry. Along the way, you’ll find out why Ford turned down a US government bailout proposal in 2008; how Netflix almost came unstuck by pushing adaptability too hard; and why it sometimes takes a radical to do the right thing. In 2009, American golf star Tiger Woods’s position in the sport’s global rankings took a nosedive. By 2011 he’d slipped from number one to 58th place. It was an odd sight, especially since Woods had been known for his incredible consistency since bursting onto the scene in 1996. So what went wrong? Well, it was a sign of the golfing god’s mortality. Life is unpredictable, and even the most successful people can’t always dodge the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. It turned out that Woods’s on-field performance problems had roots in his personal life. In 2009, the media ran a story about him crashing his car outside his house. Neighbors told reporters they’d seen his wife chasing after him with a golf club in her hands. Rumors of substance abuse and infidelity began circulating and major sponsors including Gatorade and Gillette dropped their formerly prized sponsee. Woods didn’t let any of that get to him, however. In fact, he demonstrated just how important adaptability is when you’re faced with setbacks. He continued working hard, even as his stats slipped, and learned how to deal with the media pressure he was under. His perseverance paid off. By March 2013, he was back at the top of world golf rankings. That makes Woods a poster boy for what the author calls, “High adaptability, high achievement people,” or HAHAs for short. That’s a pretty fitting acronym: HAHAs are people who can laugh in the face of adversity and, over time, claw their way back to the top. What sets them apart is their ability to focus on solutions rather than problems. They look on the bright side of life even as things seem to be falling apart around them, and they remain determined to achieve their goals. They’re also typically unafraid to ask for help and reach out to people who can support them in their struggle to reassert themselves. But these blinks aren’t just about golf. Now that we’ve seen what adaptability looks like in practice, let’s take a look at how it works in business contexts. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the US government offered to bail out car manufacturing giant Ford. Despite being up to its eyeballs in debt and looking like it might go under any day, the company ultimately turned down the proposal. There was a good reason for this refusal. Chairman Bill Ford was convinced that companies that fail to adapt fail, period. Sure, an injection of government cash might have solved Ford’s short-term liquidity issues, but it wouldn’t have gotten to the root of the problem – its longstanding failure to adapt to the new realities of the automobile market. The company’s board of directors and its managers decided on an alternative strategy and hatched a plan they called “The Way Forward.” At the heart of this roadmap was a reappraisal of Ford’s relationship with the environment, an issue it had long sidestepped. If the carmaker wanted to remain relevant to American consumers, it would have to move toward their views on environmental matters. What followed was a pretty radical overhaul. Ford downsized by around 25 percent and implemented a system to produce cars more quickly. Most importantly, it shifted to manufacturing smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. The carmaker dodged a bullet, but the company almost left it too late. A better idea than waiting it out and hoping for the best would’ve been to take a leaf out of Toyota’s book. The Japanese corporation is a master at adapting to changing market conditions, a characteristic that allowed it to increase its share of the global car market from 7.3 percent in 1995 to 15 percent in 2005. So what’s the secret of its success? Well, the company has a solid reputation for quality products, but what really sets it apart is its constant search for improvements that satisfy changing consumer preferences. This allowed the company to stay ahead of the curve and anticipate changes in the market long before competitors like Ford saw them coming. To take just a couple of examples, Toyota was already developing low-emission cars in 1992 and hybrid petrol and electricity-powered vehicles in 1995! In the summer of 2011, the Italian government was facing financial issues. Deciding to cut back on expenditures, it introduced a reform to incorporate villages with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants into larger administrative units headed by a single mayor. But one small village called Filettino resisted these measures. It understood that adaptability sometimes means swimming against the current. As far as the villagers were concerned, reacting to new developments didn’t mean rushing into old reforms or embracing change for change’s sake. In their view, one way of adapting was to defend the status quo, and that’s precisely what the mayor of Filettino decided to do. Defying the government, he declared the village’s independence and issued its own currency. It was called the fiorito, meaning ‘flowering’ in Italian – a reference to the settlement’s belief that it would continue to flourish. The village looked to the past for inspiration, harking back to the age before unification when Italy was ruled by many small city-states, kingdoms and principalities. In the end, its act of resistance preserved Filettino’s independence and sense of community. Headstrong Italian villagers aren’t the only beneficiaries of swimming against the current, however. Bucking trends and following one’s own path has also helped a number of companies thrive. Take Levi Strauss as an example. Manufacturing jeans is traditionally a resource-intensive operation. The finishing process alone requires around ten separate washes and gallons of water. If the jeans have a special pattern or a fade effect, that requirement increases even further. That was accepted as a given until the American firm decided to shake things up. Rather than simply going along with the idea that the only thing that matters in business is generating profits, Levi Strauss began factoring environmental considerations into their calculations. Soon enough the company had figured out a way of finishing jeans without using any water at all. By using stones to soften the fabric and rinsing them with a special type of resin, the company cut its water consumption by an incredible 96 percent! It was a regular day in New York in 1985 when Pedro Bach-y-Rita, a Spanish teacher who’d lived a happy and successful life in the city for many years, suddenly collapsed. He’d suffered a massive stroke and was left paralyzed. The doctors treating Bach-y-Rita claimed there was nothing they could do for him. But they were wrong. What they had underestimated was how adaptable humans are. Both of Bach-y-Rita’s sons were in medical school when their father fell ill. Unhappy with his doctors’ diagnoses, they decided to physically re-educate him from scratch, as though he were a baby. The first task they set themselves was teaching him to crawl using kneepads and the support of a wall. Once he’d mastered that, they began setting more difficult tasks like catching balls, which were designed to train his motor systems. Bach-y-Rita made remarkable progress under their supervision. He was soon sitting and, a little later, walking. Astonishingly, within a year he was back at work teaching Spanish at the City College of New York, where he remained until his retirement. So how did Bach-y-Rita regain control over his basic motor functions despite the serious brain damage he’d suffered during his stroke? It comes down to the plasticity of the human brain. Essentially, the undamaged parts of his brain took control of the damaged areas. Bach-y-Rita’s son Paul returned to medical school after helping his father. He later became one of the first scientists to verify the theory of neural plasticity – the idea that the human brain’s capacities and functions aren’t set in stone but can adapt and change. In one experiment, Paul demonstrated that blindfolded participants were able to catch balls thanks to a head-mounted camera which relayed images to their brains through sensory receptors on their tongues. That’s a shining example of how different neural pathways and neurons in the brain can adapt and tackle new tasks, like interpreting images. When people first fail at a task, they tend to lower their expectations and claim that at least they learned something from their mistakes. The crucial question, though, is what past failures teach us: Do we learn how to fail, or how to improve so we don’t fail again? Adaptability is, in large part, the art of learning from mistakes – ideally, the mistakes of others! Take the British automobile industry. In the 1950s, virtually every carmaker was set on developing ever more powerful – and fuel-guzzling – vehicles. They were so fixated on this goal that they overlooked a massive segment of the market: young, urban and environmentally-minded people. The advantage thus passed to German competitors who were churning out popular, compact microcars like the Messerschmitt KR200. As a result, British brands were being crowded out altogether. Did that make them change their approach? Hardly. There was, however, one notable exception: a small team of auto engineers at the British Motor Company headed by designer Sir Alec Issigonis. Observing their peers’ stubborn refusal to change with the times, the team decided to spearhead the production of a new style of car – the iconic Mini marketed by Morris Mini-Minor. Learning from the mistakes of others and adapting to new consumer preferences quickly led to success. Over the following decades, the British Motor Company went on to sell over five million Minis. That said, you can take learning from mistakes too far, as PepsiCo found out in 2009 when it developed a new brand image for Tropicana orange juice. When the company’s massive marketing campaign backfired and sales plummeted by 20 percent, PepsiCo panicked. Realizing that the branding made the product look anonymous and cheap rather than promoting awareness of its quality, they scrambled back to square one. Instead of making a few minor tweaks and fixing the mistake, they reverted to the old branding. The upshot? They blew $33 million to change absolutely nothing! In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the shutdown of all weapons development research programs expected to take longer than six months to reach completion. It was a costly miscalculation for Germany. Why? Because experimentation is the cornerstone of effective adaptation. The mistake would haunt Nazi Germany as the tide gradually turned against it in the Second World War. While German scientists were shackled to short-term targets, their Allied counterparts were given free rein to experiment with new weapon technologies for as long as they pleased. When defense scientist William Butement came up with an idea to develop a proximity fuse, for example, he was encouraged to delve deeper. A proximity fuse is a useful piece of gadgetry if you’re in the middle of a shooting war. A bomb fitted with the fuse’s radar technology will only detonate when it’s sufficiently close to its targets. Older bomb types, on the other hand, used standard timers that often exploded long before – or after – they’d reached their targets. Needless to say, the bombs with the proximity fuses did the most damage. Crafting the perfect proximity fuse took time and dedication, and it was only after years of experimentation with prototypes that the finished article was ready for deployment. It came just in the nick of time. In 1944, a German counteroffensive caught the Allies off guard and the outcome of the Battle of the Bulge hung in the balance. Lucky that they had the perfect weapon to beat back the onslaught: artillery units equipped with lethally accurate proximity fuse shells. Experimentation also has its uses in the metaphorical war between businesses. Take Apple, a company that has long been synonymous with a culture of experimentation. When its new products meet a negative reception, it shelves them and gets to work on a superior alternative. You may or may not remember Apple’s first handheld computer – the clunky, error-prone Newton. The Newton crashed and burned and Apple responded by going back to the drawing board. The result? Its designers used the prototype to develop the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Learning to drive is thrilling. The world suddenly becomes broader as exciting new possibilities come into focus. But you have to be careful. It’s easy to get carried away and put your foot down. That’s when things go wrong and you find yourself at risk. The same thing happens to businesses when they push too hard: the wheels come off and they crash. Take Netflix. The company understood that the future of movie watching was streaming before any of its competitors, and it steamed ahead. What was the problem, then? It was too quick for its subscribers, who were still satisfied with the old offer which allowed them to rent DVDs and stream for $9.99 a month. In 2011, Netflix decided to push its customers and split their offering into two separate components: rentals and streaming, now priced at $7.99 each – a pretty hefty price hike for people who wanted to continue using both services. The decision didn’t go down well. Netflix hemorrhaged a million subscribers and the value of its shares fell by 25 percent. The service did eventually recover, of course, but if it hadn’t been so hasty it would have achieved its current success much sooner. Failing to anticipate changes in the market is even more damaging, however, as Blockbuster found out. Founded in 1985, the movie rental business quickly grew over the following decades. By 2008, it had thousands of stores across the US. But despite its dominant position in the market, it was caught entirely unawares by the streaming revolution. Even worse, it failed to launch its own streaming service while Netflix began establishing itself. That would have been simple enough – after all, Blockbuster held all the aces: it was a household name with a large customer base and plenty of capital. But Blockbuster wasn’t nimble enough to adapt to new realities. It continued focusing on customer experience in its bricks-and-mortar stores even after a new CEO was hired in 2007. By 2010, the writing was on the wall. Blockbuster declared bankruptcy and was gobbled up by the American TV company Dish Network. It’s easy to look good when the economy’s booming and you’re backed by a reputation built up over decades. But success can breed complacency. The result of taking your eye off the ball? You lose sight of your goals. Take Starbucks. Everything had been plain sailing for decades when it hit the rocks in 2007. The coffee chain’s chairman Howard Schultz had an idea about what had gone wrong: its dominant position had incubated an arrogant outlook and the company had stopped taking care of its customers. He was right. Formerly loyal patrons weren’t happy and had started going elsewhere in search of their coffee fix. That same year, Starbucks closed over 900 stores and fired 1,000 of its employees. That was the end of the growth policy championed by the company’s CEO between 2002 and 2007, Jim Donald, who had become obsessed with opening more and more stores. The mad rush to expand had resulted in Starbucks losing touch with its founding values. In the end, Starbucks scraped through this rough patch. So how did it turn things around? Well, it had a leader who was prepared to push through radical reforms: Howard Schultz. One of the first things he did after taking charge was to close 7,000 Starbucks stores in the US and give every barista extra training to help them up their coffee game. When a test revealed that McDonald’s had better-tasting coffee than Starbucks, Schultz introduced new roasting and grinding processes. None of that was rocket science. Schultz simply understood that a coffee chain has to do two things to retain its customers’ loyalty: prepare a great cup of joe and offer a selection of delicious cakes and pastries. But sometimes it takes a radical visionary to do the commonsensical thing. By 2010, his policy had paid off. Starbucks had recovered and its revenue increased to $10.7 billion! That just goes to show how important adaptability is when you’re struggling to get ahead or just treading water. While you shouldn’t rush change, it’s worth keeping an open mind, experimenting and seeing what incremental changes you can make to improve your situation. The key message in these blinks: Adaptability is all about looking ahead, reading the signs and using the prevailing winds to chart your course. Once you’ve mastered that art, you can plan ahead and avoid being caught off guard by sudden changes. That’s especially true in business. The most successful companies consistently demonstrate an ability to change with the times, experiment with new solutions and adapt themselves to customers’ changing desires and needs.  Actionable advice: Believe in the impossible. What stops us adapting? Well, nothing throttles innovation like the belief that some things are simply impossible. Take it from American biologist George Church. He was convinced he could design a machine that could decode the entire human genome. Ignoring the naysayers, Church pressed ahead with his vision and constructed his device. While the procedure initially cost a staggering $3 billion, Church managed to reduce the price to just $5,000 over the years. Today, there’s a real chance that it might become affordable enough to be integrated into routine medical testing, opening up the possibility of all sorts of medical breakthroughs! Got feedback?

Elliott, PhD, Laura L. Smith, PhD","summary":"Does your own anger scare you sometimes? For instance, did you ever find yourself yelling at your terrified children or your bewildered partner, seemingly unable to stop? Do you go berserk when you’re steering your car through heavy traffic and the driver in front of you is less than competent? Or do you worry that your short temper will eventually harm your career? If you feel that your negative emotions control you, rather than the other way round, these blinks are for you. You’ll learn about the many things that nourish your rage and ways to avoid them. You’ll get to understand how, ultimately, it’s your thoughts about a situation that determine whether or not it annoys you in the first place. And you’ll also discover how to talk to your sulky and provocative teen without lashing out; why balancing on one leg can be an anger management skill; and how to foretell that you’re about to have a temper tantrum. Everybody knows how much damage anger can do. After all, it’s a powerful emotion, and if you don’t know how to control it, your anger can end up hurting you and those around you. When under the influence of an angry outburst, people can do things they wouldn’t normally do; they might drive like a maniac, hit a loved one or destroy the property of another person. But beyond that, people who are easily upset and prone to violent outbursts are difficult to relax around since they might pounce at any moment. Nobody wants to be that person, but too many people end up yelling at their partners or some other innocent person because they’ve suppressed all the rage they feel against, say, their bully of a boss. And it’s not just other people who suffer from your passionate fits. Getting too wound up too often can actually hurt your health. For instance, a perpetual state of anger can produce ulcers and lead to high blood pressure. So, rage can be a destructive force, but if you know how to harness it, it can also fuel many constructive pursuits. For example, you might be scared to leave a toxic relationship because you’re unsure about your ability to survive on your own. But one day, you grow so sick of your situation that your anger becomes stronger than your fear and all of a sudden you’re walking out the door. It’s in moments like these that fury is fueling your action, but in a way that’s helpful – not hurtful. Righteous rage has even led people to productively transform their communities. Just take Nelson Mandela, who, enraged by the racial injustice he witnessed in his lifetime, harnessed his emotions to start a powerful movement against the racist, apartheid regime of South Africa. You can be like Mandela, too. Use your anger to make your world a better place in which to live. Do you ever feel your anger suddenly overcoming you like a rogue wave? Well, you might need to pay closer attention to your body. That’s because every sudden wave of anger is preceded by subtle physical cues; controlling your anger begins when you learn to identify those cues. Just moments before you’re overcome by a fit of rage, your body sends you signals that let you know it’s coming: you start breathing faster, blushing, sweating and tensing up your jaw and hands. This means that if you pay careful attention to your body and learn to notice these sensations, you’ll have a real chance to calm yourself down before it’s too late. But what should you do once you identify an impending explosion of anger? First, remind yourself that your peak rage will only last five or ten minutes. This is such a short period that you can easily wait it out. To do so, take a few deep breaths and remember that this feeling will pass. You should start to calm down. Then, give your brain something else to think about. For instance, you might switch your attention to a vacation you’re planning, do something silly like counting the moles on the face of the person in front of you, or try to balance on one leg. Once you’ve changed your breathing and switched your attention away, come back to the situation and try to see what’s good about it. For example, if you’re stuck in traffic and getting annoyed, you could think about it as an opportunity to relax and listen to your favorite album. Finally, it’s easy to react to your mistakes with rage, but you can just as easily see every mistake you make as a lesson in self-acceptance. Just remember, no matter how you’re treated by other people – or the world – only you are responsible for your feelings. Annoying things happen every day – people are rude to you, your car breaks down, maybe your beloved cat throws up all over your favorite carpet. These are all perfect opportunities to get into the unhealthy habit of brooding. Brooding breeds anger, and an irritating mishap can easily trigger an unstoppable wave of rage if you think about it too much. For instance, say your cat did vomit on your rug. You might think to yourself, “Why didn’t it get sick on the tiles instead of the expensive carpet?” You might even start to wonder if it was deliberate. From there, you’ll easily start thinking about the fallout of the incident, about how long it took to clean up, how it made you late for work and filled your living room with a foul stench. At a certain point, there'll be no turning back and you’ll be coasting toward an emotional explosion. This happens to everyone, and thankfully there’s a way to control your brooding. Just confine it to a specific period. Try brooding for 15 minutes at 6 p.m. every day and write down exactly what you intend to brood over each time. Then, spend this time brooding regardless of whether you feel like it or not. If obsessive thoughts pop into your head outside of this time, just make yourself postpone them. You’ll find your inclination to brood becoming weaker and weaker. However, setting aside negative emotions like this is easier said than done. So, to help distract yourself from thoughts that feed your anger, use pleasurable activities that engage your mind and draw your attention away from brooding. This might involve taking a relaxing stroll through a museum or along a beach. The following visualization can also help: picture yourself shooting your negative thoughts into the sky or launching them into a cloud. Then envision them floating farther and farther away. Unless you’re a hermit, there’s always going to be somebody who’ll try to pick a fight with you. But you have a choice – you don’t have to lash out in return. It’s completely up to you to deal with the provocations of others without losing your cool, getting into a shouting match, or worse. That’s because it takes two parties to fight and even if someone provokes you incessantly, hostilities can only break out if you play along. Say your teenager is trying to draw you into an argument to let off some of her angst: She comes home from school upset, responds to your loving welcome with a sneer and slams the door to her room, telling you to leave her alone. In situations like these, it’s essential to remember that it’s your daughter’s stroppiness that’s speaking, not your own. This simple reminder will help you keep your calm. Next, you can ask yourself whether or not you want to argue with your daughter. If you don’t, simply respond peacefully by saying, “It seems like you’re upset.” By acknowledging her feelings in this way, you’ll show her that you understand but are not willing to engage with her petulance. Simply put, just because someone is being angry toward you doesn’t mean you need to respond in kind. However, in other cases, wounds from the past can exacerbate your feelings in the present. To deal with this type of anger it’s essential to address the painful past events and make peace with them. Say your father used to ridicule you publicly and, as a result, you now find yourself furious whenever a friend playfully teases you. The only way to deal with this and act respectfully toward your friend is to address the hurt you still feel from your father’s actions. To start, admit that the events of the past still affect you and find someone with whom you can talk about them. Then ask yourself how you can reconcile these memories. What do you frequently say during an angry outburst? Something about telling people to back off, or a warning that you’re running out of patience? In that case, it’s likely that your anger is caused by stress, a serious situation that needs to be addressed. But first, a bit more about stress. There are two types of stressors and both impact your health. First, major stressors. Some things can flip your life completely upside down. These big-time upsets are things like losing your job, getting pregnant or moving home. But there are also loads of minor stressors that are experienced on a daily basis. Think of deadlines, cold sores or a disruptive work environment. So, there are two categories, but surprisingly enough, the minor ones are just as bad for you as the major ones. That’s because they happen every day and therefore make up a sizeable chunk of your overall stress load. This is important because stress, especially chronic stress, is known to produce all manner of undesirable health outcomes. It can raise your blood pressure, cause depression and exacerbate pretty much every long-term disease. That makes keeping your stress under control essential. Start by defining some of your stressors as challenges, rather than catastrophes. Some major stressors, like getting pregnant or moving, aren’t necessarily bad, they’re just scary because they mean huge life changes. As a result, you can make them less stressful by simply changing your outlook. For example, instead of seeing the need to move home as a horrible unforeseen event, take it as an opportunity to do the best job you can at a tricky task. Simply determine any potential problems – like repainting your old apartment at short notice – and start brainstorming solutions. Just remember, if you don’t learn how to handle your daily stress, it’s going to catch up with you one way or another. Everyone knows how cranky kids get when they don’t have enough sleep, and, if you’re lucky, they’ll be merely grumpy. In the worst case scenario, they’ll throw a violent temper tantrum. So, how does this relate to anger management as an adult? Well, as a grown-up, you likely won’t throw yourself on the floor screaming, but sleep deprivation will still increase your irritability. Getting too little rest might set you up for an irate outburst. People generally feel a lot better if their brains are well-rested. After all, a good night’s sleep lets you see the world with clarity and optimism. Here’s how to help yourself get the high-quality slumber you need. First, try to avoid all caffeine and nicotine after dinner. These stimulants prevent you from sleeping well because they activate your nervous system. Second, avoid eating too late in the evening, because a full stomach can disrupt your sleep as well. Then, to keep your mind from spinning around thinking about work, or other stressful scenarios, put your smartphone away. On top of this sleep routine, getting regular physical exercise is a great way to make yourself feel happier and more relaxed. What’s more, it’s pretty difficult to be angry after a hard workout. Once you’ve made these changes to improve your sleep and deter your anger, adding a gratitude habit can help you be happier and even less prone to rage. When people are angry, it’s often because they’re not getting what they want, whether from a partnership, a job, or life in general. One strategy to change such situations is to focus on the things you do have and be grateful for them. Hence, a gratitude habit. To incorporate this technique you should begin every day by making a mental list of everything you’re grateful for, like the roof above your head, the delicious coffee you’re about to enjoy or the beautiful sun in the sky. By focusing on the things you appreciate you’ll feel happier about your life overall. The key message in this book: If you don’t control your anger, it’ll end up controlling you. Luckily, there are some simple techniques to get a handle on irascibility. Often, simply noticing your thoughts and tweaking daily habits can go a long way in helping you deal with feelings of rage.  Actionable advice: Drive your car and your life more slowly. Whether you’re literally in the car or in the figurative driver’s seat of life, take your time and try not to rush everywhere. Just relax, get comfortable and enjoy the ride with a relaxed attitude. You’ll find it’s a lot harder to be angry when you’re so preoccupied with enjoying yourself. Got feedback?

Sacrificing your worldly possessions and leading a life of struggle until you “make it” may have been the story of some famous artists of the past, but doing the same won’t serve you. As an artist today who wants to be successful, you need to not only have your creative skills, but also a good mind for business. You need to find your voice and your values, as well as know where to advertise, how to market yourself and sell your work. The following blinks will help you do exactly that. In these blinks, you’ll find out: how to find your voice as an artist, how to sell your work and how to present yourself to galleries. So many of us want to be great artists. But how do we get there? Study artists of the past, emulate them and their lifestyle? As tempting as it might be, doing the exact opposite is a far better idea. We’re all aware of the “starving artist myth,” the idea that in order to create something worthwhile artists need to struggle and suffer like Vincent van Gogh. Although a lot of us cling to this myth, it’s a lie. Being a professional artist doesn’t necessarily entail enduring a tough life and trying to make ends meet. It can actually mean being surrounded by people who care about you and support you, such as your family, friends, mentors and artist circle. What you will need to keep your creativity thriving is passion, talent and hard work. The place you live and the amount of struggle you go through is irrelevant. So forget the starving artist myth and stop mimicking tortured artists of the past. Often people tell artists that they need to learn from other established painters or experienced teachers, but the reality is that the best art is art that displays authenticity and the true inner workings of the artist who created it. It’s the art that reflects your history and the events that made you who you are. Therefore, if you are copying someone else, you won’t be able to innovate. Taking risks, trying different techniques in your work and using different subjects for your inspiration will be far more valuable and worth your while. The good news is that inspiration is all around you. To stay inspired, try keeping a journal and noting down your observations and activities. You never know when a seemingly insignificant event might become your next source of inspiration. So you want to be an artist? Fantastic! But first ask yourself, “Do I want to make a living out of it?” If so, you’ll need to be more than an artist; you’ll also need to be an entrepreneur. To start thinking about yourself in a business sense, the first thing you should do is determine what kind of image you want to project. What type of artist would you like to be? What type of art do you want to make and what are your most important values? If your dream is to work as an illustrator, consider what materials you’ll need. In terms of values, perhaps environmental friendliness is important to you, and maybe there are certain companies you wouldn’t work for based on your principles. Regardless of what kind of artist you want to be, getting there can be a long process. However, identifying the steps you need to reach your goal and then following through with these steps will have you well on your way. Take the illustrator scenario. If your goal is to work freelance for big companies, you’ll need to find a name for your business, photograph your work so you can market it, use a high-quality printing lab for printing and come up with an attention-grabbing bio for your website. As an artist, it can be off-putting to deal with the real world. Yet, this is an essential skill that must not be neglected. You’ll need to get a handle on paperwork, such as filing taxes and applying for business permits. For instance, if you are dealing with physical products such as paintings and sculptures, you’ll need a permit to sell these goods. Taking care of these administrative tasks is vital, as not doing so could land you in a lot of legal trouble. Try to see all these things as taking care of every part of you as an artist; such a mindset will keep you motivated along the way. What is most important in the artistic process? The art itself, right? Actually, as important as creating your art is, whether you’re successful or not depends on how effective you are at promoting it. So how can you improve your promotion skills? Start with the internet, which offers a vast space to promote your work. Make sure you have a good website where people can view your art and read about you as an artist. Make it easy to navigate and have your work readily available for people to view. You’ll also want to make sure you have an easy, memorable domain name. The website of Canadian painter Claire Desjardins, www.clairedesjardins.com is a good example of an attractive website that’s easy to navigate. You may also wish to try blogging, where you can share your thoughts, inspirations and achievements. The main thing to bear in mind when blogging is to be genuine and write about things that interest you. You can also use social network sites as a promotional tool for your work, but don’t get lost in the social network abyss! Many artists fall prey to writing social media posts so often that they start to neglect their actual work. Aside from using social media, you can also attract the attention of the press. To do this, create a list of blogs and magazines you wish to contact and get the names and email addresses of their editors. But before you approach the press, you’ll need a press kit. This includes your contact details, press releases, a bio and your CV. So be sure to have this ready before you send out an inquiry. If you can perfect the art of promotion, there will be no stopping you. Being an artist in the modern world is actually pretty great as you can enjoy many benefits that previous generations never had. One main advantage is access to digital technology. Whether you’re a photographer or a painter, modern technology is a real asset. One such technology is digital reproduction. By replicating your work this way, you can sell your art to a multitude of people. If you want to use this strategy, however, you must know your options. First, decide which images you think your customers will appreciate most and consider your market niche. If you want to sell to renowned galleries, make sure you choose the highest quality paper and ink and limit the number of copies you print to ensure your work remains valuable. You’ll likely want your work to stay in the best condition for as long as possible, so use archival acid-free paper and archival ink. This will protect your work from disintegration. If you want your art to reach a larger number of people, however, you may opt for cheaper print methods and a higher number of copies. However, when selling or publicizing your art, make sure you use the highest quality photographs to show your work. Now, on to actually selling your art. How do you know how much to charge for it? How you create your art will help you establish your asking price and the locations you wish to sell it. Your price should cover your costs, which includes the price of printing, materials you used and labor. If you want to sell to a broad public, you can use online retailers such as Etsy, Big Cartel and Shopify or even your own website. If you are looking to sell to prestigious clients, you have the option of selling your work to them directly or even working for them on commission. Whichever way you choose to reproduce or sell your work, respect your art and you’ll reap the rewards. There are many different artists and all have different requirements when it comes to displaying their work. For many, the goal is becoming a gallery artist, a visual artist who shows her work in exhibitions. So let’s look at how to do this. As you might guess, an essential consideration if you want to be this kind of artist is to find the right exhibition space, as your work must be appropriate for the gallery in which you wish to exhibit it. Every gallery has its own preferences and direction. San Francisco gallery owner Jessica Silverman, for example, likes to explore “artists and their relationship with the overconsumption of images,” so she’s interested in how artists stand out from everyone else in the art world. If you have an idea of the kind of gallery you would like to exhibit in, you can reach out to some potential galleries by using the internet to locate specific galleries, asking your local art community or an art professor. Once you’ve pinpointed some galleries you think will be suitable for your work, contact them, but be prepared to wait a while as a reply can take months. If you’re invited to come to the gallery with your portfolio, think about what to take with you. You should show at least two pieces of work in your portfolio and bring a copy of your CV, including your artist statement with an introduction to your work and why you created it. If you can’t find a gallery, don’t worry. You can always organize a solo or group exhibition in a café, shop, restaurant or even in your own studio. Just remember, if you’re organizing a group exhibition, you will need to find a location and make sure each artist has the space to display their work. You should also think about how you will promote it by using printed cards, writing press releases or promoting it online. So we’ve seen how to get started as a gallery artist. Yet this is just one road an artist can choose to go down. Another rewarding path you can follow is illustration. The illustration world is largely commercial and you’ll need to have a good idea of how exactly you’ll sell your work there. To do this, first think about which area you wish to focus on. There are many options here: you could illustrate for wedding invitations, birth announcements, logos, advertisements and books, to name only a few. When you’ve pinned down your niche, research any local jobs and start applying. You might want to advertise your services through your website or social media. You could also contact the art directors of websites you like and take part in design trade shows such as Printsource or Surtex.    If you land a job, you’ll receive a briefing of what to illustrate, the number and size of illustrations and their associated deadlines. Be sure to read this carefully, be aware of what is required of you and who will have ownership rights of the final work. Betsy Cordes, licensing consultant and creative manager, advises illustrators when going over contracts to remember that they should own the copyright to their work. Remember, you’re leasing your work for a specific purpose and a specific amount of time only. If you want to reach for the biggest companies to illustrate for, it might be worth hiring an agent. The agent’s job is to use his contacts to promote you and your work through social networking, print media and trade shows. Agents can be useful, but they are an added expense, and no matter how good they are, they can’t turn a bad artist into a great one! Lastly, remember when making decisions and dealing with commercial business to stay true to yourself. That way you can’t go wrong. Constant movement keeps artists working and in the flow. But taking breaks every now and then is just as important and experiencing peaks and valleys is normal. If you’re experiencing some downtime in your career, it doesn’t mean that you have to stop working on anything altogether. You can use your downtime to refresh your portfolio, take up a personal project, make new connections with people in the local scene or even take on a residency. These can be highly beneficial to help you evolve artistically. You could also look into teaching others, which can be great for expanding creativity and reactivating long forgotten techniques. Plus, sharing your knowledge and experience with others can be stimulating and rewarding. You can look into teaching through galleries or businesses or you can even teach online. In the ebb and flow of being an artist, sometimes the work can really pile up. When this happens and you have multiple projects on the go, it’s a good idea to dedicate some time to organization. Use a simple to-do list or calendar or try Google Task or Todoist. There are many options out there for self-organization. And remember, you can always hire an assistant, if your finances allow. Regardless of whether you can afford assistance, though, learning to be assertive and saying no to tasks you cannot add to your schedule can make your life easier. You might even find that saying no to one opportunity allows a better opportunity to come in. Always try to keep balance in mind. You can balance out your work life by making sure you take regular intervals for family, friends, meditating, exercising and eating healthily. These things will help keep you grounded and able to cope in times of extreme stress. Remember, success means balancing work and your life outside work. The key message in this book: Forget about the myth of the struggling artist. With an entrepreneurial mindset and some promotional and marketing know-how, there is nothing to stop you from taking your art and making a healthy living from it. Actionable advice: Packaging matters more than you think! Package your art with care and consideration. Why would you spend so long creating something only to cover it in shabby packaging? Present your art in the best way you can and don’t forget to insure it against theft or damage if necessary. Don’t sit around waiting for others. You shouldn’t have to wait for a response from a gallery just so that you can exhibit your work. Instead, ask small cafes and shops if they will show your work or get some artist friends together and find a local space where you can display your work. All it takes is a bit of motivation and incentive to get your work out there.

These blinks, however, will show you that asking for it is all about taking control of your life and going after what you deserve. Furthermore, they will guide you through the process of negotiation and tackle some common issues that women face, leaving you better equipped the next time you’re asking for a raise or arguing with your partner over, for example, getting a pet cat or dog. Effective negotiation skills are useful in many situations, no matter how big or small. More importantly, learning how to negotiate will lead not only to better relationships with those around you but also with yourself. In these blinks, you’ll find out: what the TV show The Closer has to do with negotiating salaries; the difference between male and female perspectives on the world; and what a BATNA is and why it’s useful. When we were children, grown-ups often asked us what we wanted to do when we grow up. Even now, as adults, we still get asked the same question. Unfortunately, for most of us, the answer isn’t easy. In particular, it’s hard for modern-day women to separate their true desires and ambitions from what they’ve been told they should want. This is because women have been socialized to act according to what is expected of them instead of being encouraged to follow their personal wishes. For example, Vanessa, a friend of the author’s, didn’t know which career to pursue after college. Since both her mother and sister had become teachers, she thought that it was only fitting that she follow the same path. However, once she entered the profession, she found it wasn’t the job for her. Knowing that she needed a change, Vanessa closed her eyes and tried to imagine what she truly wanted. What she saw was herself working somewhere outdoors, among nature, and she realized that she wanted to work in a garden. Vanessa then went on to start her very own landscaping company. To work out what you want in life, you need to start by asking yourself what’s missing. One way could be rediscovering old activities that you used to partake in and enjoy. Michele, another friend of the author’s, was a principal. She had a good job and a loving family, but despite it all, there was a part of her that felt unfulfilled. Remembering her childhood, Michele was reminded of how she used to enjoy drawing and sketching. Turns out it was creativity that was absent from her life, and so she signed up for drawing classes and rediscovered a favorite hobby. As a result, Michele’s life became more balanced and full of happiness. After you work out what you want, you’re ready to learn that you can control your own life. In the next blink, let’s have a look at making that happen. Picture yourself in a fancy hotel suite. Everything you need is there in your room – a comfortable king-size bed, a large TV, a handsome desk, a cushy armchair, scented candles, and so on. All except for a bathrobe. More often than not, most women would simply accept this circumstance even though they would really want that bathrobe. Why is that? The answer was revealed in a series of studies carried out in the 1980s and 1990s. According to this research, women are more likely to believe that life is controlling them instead of the other way around. Furthermore, the studies found that women often dealt with whatever situation arose without complaint and that they believed they had no real influence on the outcome. Conversely, men viewed the world as a place full of opportunities from which they could freely benefit. The results of these studies have not only proved consistent across the United States, but also in a handful of countries around the world, such as Britain, the Netherlands, Brazil and India. The difference in mind-set between women and men is a global trend, and it has tangible outcomes – namely that not enough women are asking for raises. Psychologist Lisa Barron conducted a study in 2006 to test how the difference in mind-set played out in the workplace. Both male and female participants were asked whether or not they agreed with the following sentence: “I decide what my value in the workplace is and I am responsible for ensuring that my employer pays me appropriately.” Interestingly, results showed that 85 percent of men agreed with the sentence, while only 17 percent of women found it to be true. Barron concluded that women tend to measure their value by what their employer paid them, never raising any concerns over their salaries. In other words, women don’t ask for a raise as often as their male counterparts. This demonstrates that women need to start rethinking the way they interact with the world. Believing that you have no control over your life leads to an imbalance of power where your employer is the one in charge of determining your worth. Moreover, this belief rests on the false assumption that employers will assign salaries fairly and in a just manner. To ensure that you get paid fairly and appropriately, you need to know how to negotiate your salary. We will take a closer look at this in the next blink. When you hear the word negotiation, what springs to mind? Most people think of business meetings, political debates and structured agendas. However, most negotiations occur in more informal settings. In fact, negotiations happen every day. People use negotiation as a tool to help bring about change when the desired outcome is dependent on the cooperation of others. The implementation of change can be something as ordinary as requesting that your salad comes without croutons or something that involves a bit more discussion, such as asking for a four-day working week instead of five. Whatever you’re negotiating, no matter how little or large, the fundamental rules remain the same: don’t bully or lie. Instead, communicate in an intelligent manner. That is, listen attentively to the other person, exchange information and be aware of all the risks before you land on a solution. To become a successful negotiator, you need to prepare carefully. Professional negotiators advise that it’s best to consider other future scenarios in case you run into some unexpected obstacles during your negotiation. For instance, before you head into a negotiation, plan your BATNA, or Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. You can use your BATNA after you fail to reach your desired outcome in a negotiation. So, in the case of negotiating your starting salary for a new job, it’s good practice to have a back-up employer. If you don’t land your desired salary, you’ll still have your alternative employer. Moreover, telling your interviewer that there’s another company interested in you will be beneficial in the negotiation. The key to a successful negotiation is knowing how much to ask for, which is what we’ll take a look at next. People think that being a good negotiator means you need to know how to bluff. But unless you’re a master of the poker face, there are other, less-risky skills you can use. In fact, the most powerful asset you can have during a negotiation is information. To negotiate successfully, you need to know which requests are reasonable and which aren’t. For instance, let’s say you ask for a 15 percent raise, which your boss denies. Should you stop there? Absolutely not. Try showing your boss data stating that the average salary for your position earns 15 percent more than what you’re getting. This will surely get your boss’ attention. To further increase your chances of success, gather information on salaries from firms in direct competition with the one where you work. This way, if you have evidence that other people in the same position as you are getting paid more, you won’t be discouraged as easily when your boss turns down your proposal. It’s important to be reasonable during your negotiations, but you must also be careful not to undervalue yourself. When asked to think about what you want from your job, you might find yourself undercutting the possibilities open to you. You might aim to move one rung up the corporate ladder and ask for a salary raise of 5 percent. Instead, consider making a bolder move. Once again, information is crucial when asking for more. The author ran some studies and found that a lack of relevant information resulted in women underestimating themselves. When negotiating their end-of-year bonuses, women averaged 19 percent less in comparison to men. When negotiating their entry-level salary, however, women performed slightly better, at only 6 percent less than their male counterparts. This is because information on starting salaries in many industries is more readily available. Since women are more likely to underestimate their value, it’s imperative that they consider asking for more rather than less. When asked to focus on a specific task, it’s easy to overlook the obvious. In a well-known study, participants were asked to focus on particular details of a basketball game, which somehow distracted them from seeing a person dressed in a gorilla suit walking across the court! Similarly, in negotiation, you might miss crucial information if you’re overly focused on your own goals. To illustrate this point, we’re introduced to Twyla, a friend of the author’s. Twyla was an aspiring director looking to make her first ever movie. Inspiration struck her when she stumbled upon a novel about a family dealing with the devastating effects of a hurricane. She approached the author of the novel and after careful consideration of how much she was willing to invest, made him a generous offer for the rights to the story. But it turns out the author wasn’t interested in how much money he could get for his story. What was important to him was the creative manner and the accuracy with which his story would be portrayed on screen. Because Twyla was so focused on the financial aspect, she failed to see this crucial bit of information that would’ve otherwise landed her the rights to the story. So it’s vital that you find out what the other negotiator wants. Again, this requires gathering information. For example, Ericka, an assistant buyer at a homeware store, was looking to get promoted. Her proposal, however, was turned down by her boss. Undeterred, Ericka decided to gather some information from her colleagues and learned that a renowned cooking equipment store was opening soon on the same street. Deducing that her boss would want to remain in competition with the new store, Ericka took it upon herself to study everything she could about luxury European kitchen equipment. After a year she approached her boss once more about a promotion, highlighting how she had become an expert on luxury kitchenware – and walked away with a higher salary. Showing interest in others, coming up with creative solutions, listening attentively and working together are qualities that women tend to possess. These qualities are also key to negotiation, so it stands to reason that women can become great negotiators. During a negotiation, cooperation is more effective than competition. The main advantage in cooperating with the people you’re negotiating with is that you’ll achieve results that benefit both parties. Talk about your classic win–win scenario. To illustrate why cooperation is the better approach, let’s imagine a couple of newlyweds. We’ll call them Sophia and James. The husband and wife want to go on a week-long vacation together, but they can’t seem to settle on a destination. Sophia dreams of holidaying on a beach, while James is adamant about a camping trip in the mountains. How should they go about making a decision? The first scenario is a win/lose situation where they will have to sacrifice one person’s wishes for the other. The second scenario is a compromise where they will divide the week between staying on a beach and camping in the mountains. Not exactly what you’d call a relaxing holiday! The third scenario, however, uses the win–win approach, where Sophia and James cooperate and are attentive to each other’s wants and needs. In the end, they will arrive at a solution that suits both of them, such as a vacation in Costa Rica, where there are lots of beaches as well as hiking opportunities. An effective negotiation not only requires cooperation but also needs you to consider the interests of everyone involved. This is known as interest-based negotiation, which takes all interests into account in search of the best solution. It’s the opposite of position-based negotiation, which involves defending your position. Here’s an example that explains the effectiveness of an interest-based negotiation: When she was a member of staff at Heinz College, the author was offered the position of chairwoman of a committee responsible for the future of the college. At the time, however, she was busy writing a book. To make an intelligent decision, both sides took all interests into account and came up with a win–win solution: the author would reduce the courses she taught so that she would have time to run the committee and finish writing her book. By now you’ve probably gathered that women are capable of negotiating like men. The sad reality, however, is that women still have to closely monitor the way they communicate. For instance, Alexandra, a friend of the author’s and a popular designer with good interpersonal skills, applied for a job with a better-paying salary. The salary range was $42,000 to $60,000, and due to her experience and success, Alexandra felt confident in asking for $58,000. She decided to ask for the salary in a firm and direct way, but the hiring manager immediately doubted her ability as a team player. What was the reason for the manager’s assumption? Because she came across too strongly and aggressively. The annoying thing is that this confident behavior is risky in a male-dominated industry, and because of this, women have to be diplomatic. It’s annoying and unfair, but women will be more successful if they communicate in a pleasant manner. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to give up or back down. But you should use a friendly tone and be mindful of your body language to ensure that you’re communicating in a positive and nice way. To verify this idea, the author conducted a study in 2007 that consisted of recording videos of interns applying for a new job. In these videos, some of the interns were bold and aggressive in their statements about pay expectations. Participants were asked to watch the videos and evaluate the interns, deciding who they would hire and who they would reject. Female interns who acted in a bold and aggressive manner were 50 percent less likely to get hired, regardless of whether the participant was a man or woman. On the other hand, male interns who were also aggressive and bold were excused and their behavior deemed assertive if the participant was also male. Females evaluating male interns weren’t as lenient. In conclusion, women should try to communicate in a pleasant and non-threatening style to increase their chances of success in the workplace. A television show from 2011 called The Closer was so titled because the main character, who ran a police department, was skilled at closing elaborate criminal investigations. Let’s dive into a few finishing moves that will make you the closer in every negotiation. The first tip is to keep your attention on your upper target. More specifically, keep your focus on the optimum possible outcome. Studies carried out in 2002 by psychologist A.D. Galinsky show that focusing on your reservation value (your minimum target) will most likely result in you acquiescing to an agreement that will lose you money. Conversely, the people who directed their attention to their upper target performed better because they negotiated a higher figure from the start and allowed more time to pass before reaching an agreement. Furthermore, the research suggested that this difference in focus will impact salaries by 11-13 percent. Those aiming for their upper target would earn $34,500, as opposed to those concentrating on their reservation value, who would earn $31,000. It’s also important to take your time in getting your desired outcome. Don’t let anyone push you around. To ensure you’re in control and in tune with what’s happening, manage the tempo of negotiation. Give both parties enough time to express their interests and concerns so that you can get a fuller understanding of the situation. Next, state your offer clearly and calmly. You should have already practiced doing so beforehand. Then listen attentively to the other negotiator’s reply. Take a deep breath, organize your thoughts and then make the next move. When you start to feel like you’re losing control of the situation, either getting too worked up or emotional, slow down the momentum. Request a pause or kindly let the other negotiator know that you’re feeling a bit rushed and need some time to go over the points that have already been made. Keep all these tips in mind the next time you enter a negotiation, and you’ll most likely walk away triumphant. The key message in this book: Negotiation is an everyday occurrence, but for many women, it’s not easy to undertake. Women need to learn to ask for what they want and do so in the right way to increase their chances of success. This involves being prepared to collaborate with others, taking the other negotiator’s interests into account and paying particular attention to communicating pleasantly while not undervaluing oneself. Actionable advice: Don’t drop your prices too low, too early. Let’s say you want to sell a used car on Craigslist. You put up $14,500 as your initial sales price, to which a buyer would make an offer of $12,000. Now your rebuttal shouldn’t be too low. If you drop the price too steeply in the starting round, it will signal that your reservation value is low and encourage the buyer to expect you to reduce the price even further. Instead, you should respond with an offer of $14,000, indicating that your reservation value is somewhere around the $13,500 mark. This will, in turn, prompt the buyer to make a better offer if they’re interested in the car. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s the diehard fans in the stands, the dedicated players on the field or the grizzled old-school coach pacing the sidelines, the people who live and breathe sports tend to project a certain message – that success in the game rests on grit, determination and raw talent. But that’s changing. Today’s top clubs are increasingly embracing something we don’t usually associate with sports – math. Take it from the Houston Astros, a baseball outfit whose meteoric rise from mid-table mediocrity to World Series champion was driven by a managerial revolution. At its heart were two forward-thinking innovators, Californian data analyst Sig Mejdal and scout Jeff Luhnow, both of whom realized that baseball, like other games, can be understood statistically. In the face of opposition from skeptics and proponents of good old “gut instinct,” Mejdal and Luhnow started following the data. The results were stunning. Soon enough, the Astros were gaming the market and signing overlooked talents whose unique skill sets laid the foundations for the club’s title-winning season in 2017. In the following blinks, you’ll learn how technology is reshaping American baseball; why the most successful clubs champion inclusivity; and what big data sometimes misses. In the late 1980s, Sig Mejdal, a Californian student and future NASA engineer, was paying his way through college by working night shifts at a casino. It was at the blackjack tables that he noticed something important: gamers usually trust their gut over reason. Blackjack is a game of probability. The player’s aim is to beat the dealer’s hand without his own hand exceeding 21. Despite the superstitions of players, there’s always a statistically preferable option when it comes to choosing to draw another card. Say a player has a hand amounting to 16. In most cases, he’ll be wary about drawing another card. After all, the chance of going bust – getting more than 21 – is pretty high, right? Well, yes, but there’s more to it. In fact, reason tells us the best move is to take another card. There’s a 74-percent chance the dealer has a winning hand of at least 17. Draw another card, however, and the player’s chance of defeat drops to 67.5 percent! That got Mejdal thinking. What, he wondered, would happen if you applied the same logic to other games. He started looking more closely at baseball. His hypothesis? Since it’s a game just like any other, math might be more reliable than gut instinct. It was an insight that paid dividends in one area in particular: player recruitment. Mejdal proved this in 2005 during his stint as an advisor to Jeff Luhnow, the scouting director at the Missouri-based St. Louis Cardinals. Mejdal’s data on player performance metrics told him that the best college player in the United States was Jed Lowrie of the Stanford Cardinals. Scouts had – literally – overlooked Lowrie because of his slight stature. Their gut instincts told them he was simply too small and slender to make it as a major league player. Luhnow, however, decided to follow Mejdal’s advice and take a gamble on Lowrie, recruiting him to the Cardinals team. The result? Lowrie went on to become an all-star player with a relatively dependable batting average of .262 in 2018 in addition to his high skills as a defensive player in the shortstop position! In 2012, scout Jeff Luhnow and his analyst Sig Mejdal were recruited by the Houston Astros. It wasn’t long before the duo started shaking things up. Thanks to technological advancements, compiling previously unimaginably detailed performance metrics was now a breeze, letting the team make smarter recruiting decisions. Take the video camera system PITCHf/x, which started being used in all major league baseball games in 2006. By triangulating between three fixed cameras, the system can calculate everything from the speed the ball is pitched at to the point it’s thrown from, as well as how strong its spin is and where it crosses the batting plate. The Astros put all that data to good use when they recruited pitcher Collin McHugh from the Colorado Rockies in 2013. McHugh’s overall performance metrics were pretty average, but PITCHf/x showed that he had an ace up his sleeve – he occasionally threw extraordinary curveballs with more than 2,000 revolutions per minute, way more than the average of 1,500. The Astros gambled that McHugh would become a more consistent player and put him on the team. The result? He went on to become one of their best pitchers. Sig Mejdal was meanwhile developing complex algorithms to support player-selection decisions. His team of analysts compiled a database of player metrics based on information gathered by the Astros’ scouts on potential recruits’ health history, individual performance, playing style and personality. What Mejdal wanted to find out was whether the scouts’ evaluations were reliable. He realized that comparing their ratings to the players’ actual performances was a great way of weeding out decisions based on prejudice or bias. Do that, Mejdal showed, and you’d be able to craft a more objective recruitment policy geared toward finding players who were most likely to become high performers. As you can imagine, this newfangled approach didn’t go down well with traditional scouts who’d long been used to relying on their instincts to pick players. But despite the doubts of naysayers, it worked. Mejdal’s system was key to the Astros’ 2017 World Series title. His recommendations helped build a team that racked up 101 wins and only 61 losses in 2017. In mid-2012, the Astros’ public relations office prepared biographies of the high school players the team regarded as likely recruits. But when the selections were made, there were quite a few surprises. The reason? Scouting duo Jeff Luhnow and Sig Mejdal’s unique approach. Let’s start with the question of age. Most baseball buffs thought the Astros would pick Byron Buxton, a player who’d already made a name for himself and proved his talents. Luhnow, however, wasn’t having any of it and instead plumped for someone with a much more low-key profile: Carlos Correa. Correa, a defensive fielding specialist like Buxton, had shown promise, but his performance stats were solid rather than outstanding. Plenty of scouts would have been turned off by that, but Sig Mejdal had seen something others hadn’t – his algorithms, which gave Correa top marks thanks to his strong defensive performances. Then there was the question of age. Correa was just shy of 18 when the Astros signed him, a good nine months younger than Buxton. Mejdal’s data showed that every month in age difference matters to players’ – and their teams’ – long-term prospects. Signing top talent young can make all the difference. It was another insight that paid dividends. While Buxton’s performance with the Minnesota Twins peaked between 2013 and 2014 before dipping in 2015, Correa simply got better and better. Picking young talents who have their best years ahead of them is also a financially savvy move. Simply put, they earn a lot less than experienced players. That’s a boon in baseball, a sport that strictly regulates expenditure on new signings and caps it at a certain sum per every ten new players. This system means that a team’s first new signing – in this case, Correa – typically gets the largest slice of the pie, limiting how much can be spent on other players. But since he was young and inexperienced, that didn’t apply to Correa. In fact, the Astros landed their new fielder by promising him a draft bonus of $4.8 million – much less than the expected $7.2 million. The upshot? The Astros filled a key position and had enough spare change to recruit top players for other positions! Baseball, like lots of games, is a sentimental affair. Just ask the Astros’ scouting director, Jeff Luhnow. Every season, he receives letters and emails from young fans begging him to hire or not hire their favorite players. There’s nothing wrong with emotion in sports – after all, we play and watch games because we love them. But sound recruitment policy requires a more hardheaded approach. The reason is simple. Relying on data rather than sentiment or instinct produces better results. That’s something the Astros know all about. In 2006, long before Sig Mejdal’s brought his algorithms to the Astros, the team already struck gold by relying on data. They found José Altuve, a Venezuelan defensive fielder known to his teammates as “the midget” due to his small size. Altuve was by all accounts a talented player and had already tried out for several major teams. But his stature was a problem. After each tryout, he’d inevitably be sent home after being told that a five-foot-five player would never make it in the major league. That changed when he tried out for the Astros. The team’s scouts and algorithm were impressed by Altuve’s speed. He was definitely small, but he could cover a lot of ground – 60 yards in just 6.31 seconds, to be precise. He was also a talented batter, hitting virtually every ball that came his way despite the common prejudice that smaller players have trouble doing just that. The team believed the figures and signed Altuve, who received a small draft bonus of $15,000 and – more importantly – an opportunity to play in one of the Astros’ affiliated minor league teams. He didn’t disappoint. By 2011, he had an impressive batting average of .327 and was asked to join the Astros in the major league. It was another triumph for data-driven scouting. Altuve was aggressive, swinging at 55 percent of all pitches, but better yet, he hit a whopping 88 percent of them – more, in other words, than top sluggers like Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero! Traditional recruitment methods would have missed this extraordinarily talented, pint-sized baseball player. But it wasn’t just the Astros who benefitted. Altuve’s performance was so impressive that he was soon offered $12.5 million to stay on and play for the team over the next four seasons. Top athletes often earn more money in a week than most people do in an entire year, to say nothing of the head-turning bonuses that come their way when they’re successful. But being a professional sportsman isn’t just about laughing all the way to the bank. In fact, the athletic trade is a uniquely vulnerable one due to the threat of injuries. Pre-existing health issues sometimes finish off careers before they’ve even really started. Take it from Brady Aiken, a young player drafted by the Astros. When Aiken arrived in Houston for his medical examination, he was on the verge of fame and fortune. A few tests later, however, and his dream had been shattered. The examiners discovered a weak ulnar collateral ligament in his arm – a ligament placed under high stress in baseball. The risk of it rupturing was too great and Aiken was sent home. It was a tough call, but it had to be made despite the fact that the Astros’ scouts loved the way Aiken played. But the Astros couldn’t simply turn Aiken away. Getting out of their agreement with him without losing a ton of money required plenty of savvy. Why? Well, if this happened, Aiken was entitled to compensation for his loss. That would have amounted to 40 percent of his signing bonus value. And for Aiken, that bonus was worth $7.9 million, meaning Aiken stood to receive a cool $3.1 million. The Astros gambled – correctly, as it turned out – that Aiken would reject this offer of compensation. After all, what he wanted wasn’t just money; he wanted to play baseball. As long as he didn’t take the compensation, there was a chance another team would recruit him. If that happened, the Astros would receive a transfer fee, thus freeing up resources for a different player. It was the right decision for the Astros. In 2015, Aiken’s ulnar collateral ligament ruptured during a game for the Florida-based IMG Baseball Academy, just as the Astros’ medics had predicted. Aiken was later drafted by the Cleveland Indians, but his injury held him back. Meanwhile, the Astros recruited Alex Bregman in Aiken’s stead, a new player who would become a core component of their team. What makes the greatest athletes, well, great? They improve with age, taking their natural talent and complementing it with their growing experience of the game. Baseball is no exception. Every player hopes for constant growth and development. But not all careers pan out that way. Sometimes players start to plateau. Take JD Martinez, a batter from Florida selected by the Astros in the twentieth round of the 2009 draft. Once he had his foot in the door of the minor leagues, he started to shine. Within two years, he’d been selected for the major league team. By 2012, he was one of the best players in a struggling Astros team and their most consistent point-winning batter. A year later, however, things started slowing down. Martinez’s stats began to suffer. His batting average declined to .251 and he hit a paltry 24 home runs over the season. What was going on? As the team’s hitting coach John Mallee noted, Martinez was stagnating. If he really wanted to become a great player, he had to make changes. Carry on the same way for much longer, Mallee warned, and he’d fall off the map of US baseball entirely. Martinez followed Mallee’s advice and decided to work on improving his game. When he sprained his wrist just a few weeks later, he took advantage of his time off the playing field to watch some of the world’s best sluggers from the stands. Few players were better than the Milwaukee Brewers’ Ryan Braun. Watching Braun hitting balls out of the park, Martinez noticed that his swinging style didn’t match Braun’s. Whereas he swung his bat downward, Braun – like other top talents – had a tendency to swing upwards so that the bat’s finishing position was higher. Once his wrist had healed up, Martinez headed to California for a couple of months of intensive training with specialist batting coaches. By the time he reappeared on the field in 2014, his batting average was up to .312. Unluckily for him, however, the Astros remained unconvinced and fired him. That was their mistake. When Martinez moved on to the Detroit Tigers, he upped his average to .444 and became the player of the month in June 2014. Most major league baseball players belong to two broad groups – those whose first language is English and those whose mother tongue is Spanish. The division between them might be invisible in most locker rooms, but it’s there all the same. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, clubs that overcome the linguistic divide often develop a much stronger team spirit. Take Carlos Beltrán, a Puerto Rican player who didn’t speak a word of English when he first joined the American baseball leagues in 1998. It wasn’t just language that posed a problem, however; racial prejudice also prevented bonds between Caucasian and Hispanic players. That left a lasting impression on Beltrán. When, between 2016 and 2017, he played for the Astros as a veteran 40-year-old player, he was determined to help create the kind of inclusive atmosphere at the club that had been missing earlier on in his career. That was easier said than done, but Beltrán found an ally in Alex Bregman, a Caucasian player who’d been with the Astros since 2015. Bregman claimed that he spoke perfect Spanish. That turned out to be a white lie, but there was no doubting that he genuinely wanted to get to know the team’s Hispanic players, including stars like Altuve and Correa. His enthusiasm was so great that soon enough other players joined in, making efforts to improve their English or Spanish skills. As the linguistic boundaries dissolved, a new team spirit began to take shape. That was great for the Astros’ sporting performance. After all, many of the team’s top performers were like Yuli Gurriel, a talented Cuban first baseman who didn’t speak a word of English when he moved to Houston in 2016. Bregman again took the lead, making sure to chat to Gurriel in Spanish and help the new signee fit in socially. Between them, Beltrán and Bregman created a sense of inclusion that boosted the team’s performance on the field. And 2017 ended up being the club’s most successful season ever, with a total of 101 wins. Data and sophisticated algorithms helped the Astros become one of the best baseball teams in the American Major League. But the club’s success wasn’t merely driven by tech. Data might be able to do a lot, but it’s worth remembering that it can’t do everything. One area in which it sometimes comes up short is player valuations. Take an example from 2017. The Astros had the opportunity to sign Justin Verlander, one of the best pitchers in the country. Great news, right? Well, there was a catch – he would cost the club $40 million for two seasons. Sig Mejdal’s algorithm suggested the deal wasn’t worth it. What it failed to pick up on, however, was the changing economic climate in the major league. Prices were rising everywhere, and fast. Star players like David Price and Zack Greinke were making $30 million a year on four-year contracts. Put into perspective, Verlander actually looked like a pretty good deal. For less than the cost of many other players, the Astros would get one of the most celebrated pitchers of all time. Jeff Luhnow, the club’s sporting director, had made plenty of decisions based on Mejdal’s data, but this time he overruled the algorithm and moved to sign Verlander. It wasn’t a bad call. Today, he’s a seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star player! Another aspect the algorithm missed was the possibility that Verlander, who seemed to be at the top of his game, might continue improving. That’s not surprising because future performance is generally something that is tricky to forecast accurately based on past performance. Top players are hard to put a price tag on since they’re so adaptable and their playing styles keep changing. How, for example, is an algorithm supposed to predict the fact that Verlander’s signature sliding pitch would be undermined by new, higher velocity balls, or that he’d respond to that change by once again upping his game and crafting a new technique? Statistics, data and mathematics already play a massive role in major league baseball and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. And teams like the Astros have shown what can be achieved when you put your trust in data rather than gut instinct. But it’s worth remembering that there’s still plenty of space for a more human touch. The key message in these blinks: When it comes to selecting players for a baseball team, gut instinct has been overvalued, leading to drafting decisions that are often prejudiced. Focusing on data as the base for most scouting decisions is a much sounder approach, even if exceptional circumstances might sometimes force scouting directors to ignore the data and follow their own instincts.

Growing up, we’re told that good grades will get us into good colleges, and only then can we be successful adults. But what if much of what we were taught about attaining success was wrong? Success is more about breaking rules than following them. About doing what you’re passionate about rather than what society dictates. Of course, confidence and hard work are also important, but meaningless unless you have long-term goals to which to couple them. By looking at some examples of real-life success, the following blinks will uncover what it really takes to get ahead of the pack and help you accomplish your life goals. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how to turn your weaknesses into your greatest strengths; why college dropouts on the Forbes 400 list are twice as rich; and why nice guys finish first and last. Just about every parent wants his teenager to turn out well-adjusted, conscientious and intelligent, with the grades to prove it. After all, students with these traits often grow up to be reasonably successful. The problem is, an ability to succeed in an environment governed by rules, like a high school, won’t prepare a student to rise to the top of the real world. In fact, the number of valedictorians who transform the world is close to zero. There’s a Boston College study to demonstrate this. Researchers followed 81 high-school valedictorians from graduation onward and discovered that these incredibly high-achieving students were rarely visionary in their life pursuits. Rather than revolutionizing the system, they simply settled into it. How come? Well, good grades are a stellar predictor of a person’s ability to follow rules. However, while school has clear guidelines, life doesn’t; it’s an unpredictable roller-coaster ride with no clear path. In this environment, rule-addicted academics lose their advantage. But if valedictorians aren’t the most successful people in the world, then who are? Those who are obsessed; the unruly creatives who can adapt to every aspect of the outside world. These creatives are driven by passion rather than external rules, and commit themselves to their passion projects with almost religious virtuosity – a clear recipe for excellence. Just consider a sample of the richest people in the world. Are they conscientious rule followers? Absolutely not! Some 58 people on the Forbes 400 list either dropped out of college or never even went. Those 58 academic failures have more than double the average net worth of the other individuals on the 400, all of whom attended Ivy League schools. In the 1980s and 1990s, an American doctor named Michael Swango murdered at least 60 patients. While his colleagues suspected him of these crimes, not one of them tried to intervene. It’s just one example of the way bad people seem to get away with everything. But does the world really tip in favor of those prepared to be bad? Well, one thing is for sure: nice people tend to make less money and receive worse reviews than their meaner peers. Just take a study by the Harvard Business Review, which found that men who are low on the “agreeableness” scale make up to $10,000 more per year than those who are very affable. Not just that, but nice guys who pull more than their weight often end up with worse performance reviews than their lazier colleagues, who make a good impression by flattering their bosses. Research has even found that flattery is so effective it works regardless of whether a boss knows it’s sincere. In other words, nice guys often finish last. Yet, paradoxically, they’re equally likely to finish first. For example, Wharton School professor Adam Grant found that engineers, salespeople and medical students who consistently attempted to help others were overrepresented at both the bottom and top of success metrics. Similarly, “takers,” or people who selfishly try to get more while giving less, often end up in the middle, while “givers” are split between the very top and absolute bottom. Interestingly, these same studies found that the highest achieving engineers, students and salespeople were all givers. It may seem odd, but it also makes intuitive sense; everybody knows a martyr who tries his best to help others only to be used by takers. And we also all know helpful people who rise because others are indebted to them. To put it simply, it’s not always bad to be nice. And by the way, bad people don’t get away with everything. That serial killer, Michael Swango, was caught and sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison in 2000. Today, Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa, also known as Dr. Q, is one of the top brain surgeons in the world. He runs his own lab at America’s best hospital, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. However, his life started out in absolute poverty; as an illegal migrant farmworker, he had to demonstrate true grit, sticking with difficult work throughout his life and never giving up. It sounds like everyone could benefit from some grit like that, but where does it come from? Interestingly, it’s primarily a product of telling yourself optimistic stories. This is key since studies have found that we say around 300 to 1,000 words to ourselves every single minute. These words can either be positive, like “I can handle this,” or negative, like “I can’t do this.” Just take an example from the military. Post 9/11, the US Navy SEALS were looking for more recruits. To ensure that a greater percentage of candidates made it through the grueling initiation ritual known as “Hell Week,” they began teaching candidates to use positive self-talk. As a result of this practice, the Hell Week pass rates rose by almost 10 percent! In other words, optimism keeps people going, but true grit is more than positive thinking. It often also depends on the stories people tell themselves about the meaning of their lives. A good example here is the renowned psychologist Viktor Frankl, who was imprisoned in Auschwitz in 1944. Before long, he found that some people were surviving the camp much longer than others, although they neither appeared physically stronger nor emotionally braver than those who passed away early on. In observing this phenomenon, Frankl found that what was keeping these survivors going was the meaning they saw in their lives, even during times of tremendous suffering; the people who made it were those who told themselves that they had a purpose beyond themselves. Frankl himself had such a purpose, wanting to survive for his wife. He had imaginary conversations with her all the time. In a working world that’s increasingly organized around teams and networking, how far can a lone wolf advance? Do you have to be extroverted to succeed in your career? Well, if research is any guide, the scales certainly tip in favor of outgoing and popular people. Extroverted workers are much more likely to succeed than their peers, both in financial terms and in career progress. Just take one study which revealed that the most popular 20 percent of students in a high school class went on to earn 10 percent more in adulthood than the least popular 20 percent. Beyond that, even the bad habits of extroverts make them more financially successful. For example, extroverts are more likely to go out drinking, but also more likely to bond with others at the bar, potentially forming valuable connections. That could be why, according to other studies, drinkers earn 10 percent more than sober people. Simply put, having lots of friends is a plus, but it can also serve as a major distraction. That’s why introverts are much more likely to become experts in their field. For instance, the author and Olympic medalist David Hemery conducted research which found that 89 percent of top athletes consider themselves introverts, while just 6 percent identify as extroverts. Why? We know that becoming an expert, regardless of the field, requires 10,000 hours of practice. Simply put, holding together a vast social network doesn’t leave extroverts with the time they need to do the hard, lonely work necessary to acquire such expertise. Meanwhile, introverts don’t have to worry about other people bothering them, and have plenty of time to hone their skills. When the chess master Garry Kasparov played the supercomputer “Deep Blue” in 1997, the computer executed a random move caused by a software bug. In response, Kasparov assumed that the machine had a plan he wasn’t smart enough to understand; he lost his confidence and eventually the match. It’s a clear example of how poor confidence can cause serious problems. Success and confidence have a clear positive association. Research has even shown that overly confident people have better chances of receiving a promotion than their less confident colleagues, even if the latter are more accomplished. According to other studies, confidence increases productivity and causes people to take on more challenging tasks, thereby making them stand out as shining stars in the workplace. So, confidence is key, but how can you boost it? Well, one sure-fire way to make yourself feel more self-assured is being attractive. This correlation likely explains why attractive women earn 4 percent more than their peers and attractive men an extra 3 percent. In other words, confidence can predict success and often results in increased power, both on the job and in daily life. However, there’s also a downside; too much confidence and power can destroy a person’s character. Some studies have found that power lowers empathy and that powerful people are prone to treating others as subhuman. This could be explained by the fact that powerful people need to make decisions that could harm individuals but are, in the long run, the right choices to make. For instance, generals are tasked with leading troops into deadly battles to win wars. If every general were wracked with guilt after making such a call, they would never do what was necessary to win. And finally, research has also found that feeling powerful makes people more selfish and better at lying. That’s because power and confidence reduce a person’s concern that he’ll hurt others, and therefore lower his remorse when telling a fib. This could explain why increased feelings of power positively correlate with the odds of cheating on a spouse. If you’ve read this far, you’re ready to succeed and, if you strive for the traits outlined in the earlier blinks, you can. But you won’t strike it rich and get famous just by working when the mood hits you. Having a strong work ethic is essential. The number of hours you spend working will make all the difference between the decent and the incredible. While intelligence will certainly help, once your IQ stretches beyond 120, adding additional points has basically no effect on success. That’s why the smart people who succeed are those that work the hardest. Just take a Harvard study which found that the most successful managers in a number of industries commonly worked over 60 hours per week. The study clearly indicates that a person’s success depends on her productivity, and productivity depends on putting in time. Research has even found that in every complex, professional job, the top 10 percent of employees – those who make the most game-changing contributions – are 80 percent more productive than the average and 700 percent more productive than the employees in the bottom 10 percent. But putting in long hours isn’t all you need to do. Success also depends on how far you push yourself beyond your limits. This is important to remember as people rarely make an effort to improve during their day-to-day activities, work included. For example, research has found that doctors and nurses don’t tend to get better at their jobs over time. Another classic study by Benjamin Bloom considered leading scientists, artists and athletes. It found that one of the greatest benefits of mentorship in these fields was not insider knowledge or emotional support, but the presence of a figure whose expectations would push the mentee beyond their limits. So, no matter what form you want your success to take, be sure that you’re ready to commit yourself to the hard work it will take to achieve. If you do, there’s nothing you can’t accomplish. The key message in this book: People tend to think that those who “make it” in life are the smartest and most talented. But the truth is that success is determined by characteristics that are much more within your control, like hard work, motivation and confidence. Because of this, anyone who wants to can enjoy tremendous success.  Actionable advice: Take time to make others happy.  Did you know that people with happy friends are 15 percent more likely to be happy themselves? You can boost your happiness by doing kind things for those in your life. Try it out by doing a favor for a friend without expecting it to be reciprocated. Doing so will make your friend feel better about you and make you feel better about yourself. It’ll only be a matter of time before the happiness of those in your social network boomerangs back at you. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Idolized by many, he has become an almost mythological figure – a knight crusading for innovation and immaculate design. As CEO of Apple, Jobs created one of the most valuable and admired companies in the world and, along with it, a series of amazing products, including the iPhone. But who, exactly, was the man behind the myth? A good many tales have been told. Some saw Jobs as a genius and visionary leader, while others thought he was a pompous jerk, a single-minded perfectionist or a stubborn half-genius, half-asshole. This is the story of how Steve Jobs became the Steve Jobs we think of today. You will also find out how Apple got its name; what role Pixar played in Jobs’s coming back to Apple; and how Jobs made some of his last great products while fighting death. Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco – and, shortly thereafter, he was put up for adoption by his biological mother, Joanna Schieble. As a result, he grew up the son of Paul and Clara Jobs, a working-class couple. Being adopted by Paul and Clara may have greatly contributed to his later work, since Jobs quickly developed a keen understanding of technology. Because his father was a car mechanic and craftsman who made furniture, there was a workbench in the family’s garage and Jobs’s father taught him how to build things, take them apart and put them back together again. This education served him well; later in life, when showing the iPod to the author, Jobs reminisced about how his father told him to work as diligently on the underside of a cabinet as on its finish. Jobs was also smart as a whip. He skipped sixth grade and was naturally drawn to math and science. Because of his demonstrated skill in these subjects, he was accepted into the Explorers Club, a group of kids who worked on electronics projects on the Hewlett-Packard campus. It was here that Jobs used a computer for the first time. He was clearly precocious, so it’s no surprise that he was just 21 years old when he and Stephen Wozniak founded Apple. Here’s what happened: The pair met in 1969 when a friend introduced Jobs to Wozniak, or “Woz,” an engineering genius and the son of a Lockheed Martin engineer. At the time, computing was anything but personal and computers didn’t even have keyboards or monitors. Woz recognized these shortcomings and Jobs knew they could build a better computer for home use. So they set up in Jobs’s parents’ garage and began working on their first model, the Apple 1. They invited in a few kids from the neighborhood to assemble it and pretty soon they had a miniature assembly line going. They named the new company Apple – a nod to both the Garden of Eden and an Oregon apple orchard and commune that Jobs frequented after high school. In founding his own company and designing the Apple 1, Jobs had discovered his purpose in life. He and Wozniak even convinced a local small-business owner to distribute their machines. Soon enough, they were selling a dozen computers every few weeks. Fewer than two hundred units of this first model were ever sold, but this success was nonetheless energizing. Riding the momentum of their first attempt and Wozniak’s assurance that he could build a much better machine, they went to work on their second computer, the Apple II. To fully realize Wozniak’s plan, however, they needed some serious capital, a problem they soon solved when Jobs won over A.C. “Mike” Markkula, a former Intel executive. This angel investor handed the pair a then whopping $92,000 out of his own pocket and set up a $250,000 line of credit for the young company. Beyond that, Markkula also hired Michael “Scotty” Scott, who would become Apple’s first professional CEO and the company moved out of Jobs’s family garage and into a real office in Cupertino. There, with their new professional assistance and start-up money, they focused on their vision to build a truly personal computer. In 1977, their hard work paid off and the Apple II was released. The new model came with a significantly faster microprocessor, which boosted performance, along with an audio amplifier and speaker as well as inputs for a gaming joystick. But more importantly, as it was designed to be a personal computer, it didn’t make the frightening sounds of an industrial machine and it came packed in a single, manageable box. In combination, all these features made it a huge retail success. Pretty soon, Apple was one of the fastest growing start-ups in history. In fact, soon after the Apple II was released, in April of 1977, the company was selling some 500 computers every month! From there, their sales rose from $7.8 million, in 1978, to an incredible $48 million, in 1979. However, this rosy financial picture obscured a number of issues, which you’ll learn about in the next blink. In the late 1970s, Jobs’s life was a rollercoaster; he was in his early twenties and he had thrown himself full throttle into his career, forgoing a social life and even going without sleep. In many ways it paid off and, when Apple went public in 1980, Jobs’s shares made him worth $256 million. However, by icing out early contributors like Bill Fernandez and Daniel Kottke, Jobs isolated himself within the company. And then he and Wozniak began to grow apart. Jobs was in urgent need of another breakthrough product, but the company simply couldn’t deliver. First, in 1980, they came out with the Apple III, the successor of the much-lauded Apple II. However, unlike its predecessor, this third model was an absolute disaster; it had an insane price tag of $4,340 and was prone to catastrophic overheating. After the Apple III came the Lisa, a computer developed for businesses and introduced in 1983. It was the first computer to utilize a graphical user interface, or GUI, which meant it had desktop symbols that users could click on to open programs and files. Unfortunately, since Jobs was intent on making the computer accessible to individual users, rather than businesses, it was as much a failure as the Apple III. Then, in 1984, the company released the Macintosh. While it was initially celebrated by the media for its beautiful graphics, it was clearly too under-powered to be truly useful and sales of the product missed the mark by a wide margin. Such a stream of failures meant serious trouble for Jobs. In fact, the situation was so dire that, in 1985, he was forced into exile from his own company. The CEO at the time, John Sculley, made Jobs step down as head of the Mac product division and Jobs retaliated by trying to get Sculley fired. In the end, he couldn’t get the support he needed from the company board and was forced to walk away from Apple himself. Nonetheless, Jobs was more determined than ever to create the next big thing. Though forced out of Apple, Jobs was not about to give up. He was ready to plot his tech revolution and, with investors and the media hailing him as a genius, he was certain he could be a great CEO. He was also certain that he was the only person alive who could create such amazing products. So, in 1985, he founded the computer company NeXT. But success didn’t come as readily as he’d assumed it would. The firm started out with the idea of developing a computer geared toward the specific needs of the higher-education market, catering to universities and academic professionals. The academics Jobs spoke with told him that they couldn’t afford a penny above $3,000. Yet when NeXT finally released its first computer, in 1988, the retail cost was a shocking $6,500. And that wasn’t even the total cost for a fully functioning NeXT system; for the full works, users were really looking at something closer to $10,000! Naturally, at this price, the product had no chance. The product’s demise is actually a good example of a general tendency Jobs had; he was so driven by innovation that he seemed practically incapable of noting the trade-offs that his choices necessitated. For instance, he chose an optical disk drive for the storage of information rather than a more conventional hard drive. The disk drive had certain perks, like the ability to store two hundred times more information and the option for removal from the computer. However, pulling information off of an optical drive was impossibly slow, and nobody actually needed a removable drive. Things weren’t going well at NeXT, but Jobs also had another project. He’d become the major owner of Pixar. This firm was a computer subdivision of Lucasfilm, which was responsible for the incredible special effects in movies like Star Trek II and Young Sherlock Holmes. The company caught Jobs’s attention because of the high-tier software they developed for the manipulation of 3D images. When all was said and done, it would be his experience at Pixar that would lead him back to Apple. While Jobs struggled to pull together his vision for NeXT, which was drifting disastrously, another tech star was rising. This was Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. During the 1990s, his company was dominating the industry as NeXT and Apple alike began fading into the past. In fact, by 1991, Microsoft was already the world’s leading software company. This might have had something to do with the fact that, while Apple and NeXT didn’t license their operating systems for other manufacturers, Microsoft’s operating system, Windows, became the industry standard for every personal computer not produced by the other two companies. This wide appeal rocketed Gates into the elite circle of the super rich, but it also made clear the fundamental differences between him and Jobs. For instance, Jobs was always set on creating the best, most aesthetically pleasing and innovative machine possible. Gates, on the other hand, didn’t care much for revolutionizing the computer industry. Rather, he wanted to ensure reliability and gradual improvements, which is exactly what millions of corporate customers also craved. Because of this difference, Gates became arguably the most important businessperson on earth, while Jobs looked on from the sidelines. But that would all change as the success of Pixar gave Jobs new confidence. Here’s what happened: In 1995, Pixar partnered with Disney to produce its first animated film, Toy Story, which went on to be a smash success. This masterstroke also coincided with Pixar’s initial public offering, making Jobs, who owned 80 percent of the company’s shares, a billionaire overnight. Oddly enough, the release of this animated film for children is what catalyzed Jobs’s rise from the dead. It boosted his confidence, and his experience at Pixar had also taught him about good management. During his tenure at the company, he learned from John Lasseter and Ed Catmull, both of whom ditched micromanagement at Pixar, enabling their creative employees to run with the freedom they needed. So the release of Toy Story put Jobs back in the spotlight. Nonetheless, NeXT was still struggling. The company’s products weren’t selling and Jobs’s dream that the company would produce the world’s next great computer was toast. It was by far the low point of his career. Things were so bad that Jobs shut down production entirely, shifting the company’s focus to software development, specifically its operating system, NeXTSTEP, which at least brought in a small profit. But if the situation with NeXT sounds dire, just wait till you hear what was going on with Apple. By the mid-1990s, the company was effectively a sinking ship. It had no promising products in the pipeline and was still failing to modernize its operating system. Beyond that, Apple had way more employees than it could afford. As a result, in the first quarter of 1996 alone, the company lost $750 million. Jobs watched the downfall of the company from a distance, but it was painful for him nonetheless. And then an unforeseen opportunity popped up: Apple, in search of a shortcut to a more advanced operating system and a way out of its crisis, was looking for software companies to acquire. Jobs threw his hat into the ring and, in late 1996, Apple purchased NeXT. Just like that, Jobs was back at Apple! Over the years that followed, he worked hard to reestablish Apple as a profitable computer-industry leader. This process began with the forced resignation of the CEO, Gil Amelio, whom Jobs described as a “bozo.” With Amelio out of the picture, Jobs was offered the position and retook the reins. Though finally back in power, Jobs was initially indecisive, which was a first for him. In fact, during the last few years, he had largely overcome his impulsive tendencies, learning to make careful, measured decisions. Thankfully, this initial indecision didn’t last and, by 2000, Apple was shipping out tons of groundbreaking products, including the iMac and Power Mac. It was this technological innovation that remade the company and brought it out of the red. But how exactly did Jobs accomplish this? You’ll find out in the next blink. So Jobs succeeded in transforming Apple from a deeply troubled company into a soaring business, but how exactly? First, he trimmed the firm down to a size that was appropriate to its resources. In the process, thousands of employees were laid off, but Jobs was able to inspire those who stayed to buckle down and create a whole new line of incredible products. He did this by steering the company in a clear direction, focusing on no more than four basic products. The company produced two desktop PC models and two laptop models, one model from each pair directed at consumers; the other, at professionals. Such focus laid the foundation for the company’s comeback. But the true innovation began in 2001, when Apple launched iTunes, a software that, for the first time ever, let users create digital music archives and put together personal playlists in a simple, easy-to-use way. But what was even more important about iTunes is that it led to the development of the iPod. Introduced in the fall of 2001, this MP3 player was Apple’s first foray into the mass-market of consumer electronics. At the time, pocket-sized MP3 players existed, but were mostly poorly designed; it was difficult to put music on them and hard to find what you wanted to listen to. The iPod changed all that. It was a truly usable device, in large part because of its user interface and its unique “thumb-wheel,” which let users intuitively scroll through their music collections. Customers instantly fell in love with the device and sales soared. Then, in 2003, the company built an iTunes music store into the software and opened up iTunes for Windows users as well, taking a further step into the market. The addition of the music store was huge. It gave users a simple and fairly-priced option for buying albums and singles that they otherwise had to download illegally. It was so successful that, by the end of 2003, Apple had sold over 25 million songs. The company was back on the rise. In his forty-nine years, Jobs had never experienced a serious medical condition. But then, in 2003, he was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Luckily, the tumor turned out to be slow-growing and more treatable than was first thought. However, while the Stanford doctors that Jobs enlisted told him he needed immediate surgery, Jobs himself wasn’t so sure. Ignoring their advice, he opted first for an alternative, less invasive treatment: an augmented diet. This route was insufficient, however, and, in 2004, without any other options, he finally did have the tumor surgically removed. The operation was highly-invasive and Jobs spent practically an entire day on the operating table. Worse still, it took him a full month to get back into the office post-surgery and, though the surgery was successful, it uncovered another serious medical problem; surgeons detected a series of cancerous metastases – secondary tumors growing on his liver. At the same time, during 2003 and 2004, Apple continued to surge. Sales from iTunes and the iPod kept climbing. It was just three years after the launch of iTunes, but revenue related to the store and MP3 player already made up 19 percent of Apple’s total sales. In 2004 alone, the company sold 4.4 million iPods which brought in a net income of $276 million, a dramatic jump from the $69 million of the previous year. Not just that, but Apple’s entire product line, including its laptops and desktops, was upgraded during these two years. It also didn’t hurt that Apple simultaneously launched its own internet browser, called Safari, and released a cool new application called GarageBand that could be used for simple music recording and editing. When Jobs came back to the office, it was with a relentless drive to improve and innovate. Unsurprisingly, the result of that innovation is arguably Apple’s most revolutionary product to date: the iPhone. Next up, you’ll learn how this game-changing product was born. In 2007, there already existed devices that were being described as “smartphones,” like the BlackBerry and the Palm Treo. All of them were fine for checking email, finding a contact in your address book or checking your calendar. But when the iPhone first hit shelves that summer, it clearly offered something different. In many ways, it was the world’s first truly smart phone. What really set the iPhone apart was its full-sized touch-screen, which made making a call as easy as swiping a finger. The larger screen also enabled users to view full-featured websites, photos and videos in a way previous phones hadn’t. Another difference was that while the existing smartphones all had a massive, fixed keyboard, the iPhone didn’t have a built-in keyboard at all. Instead, the keys only displayed on the screen when needed. How did this incredible innovation come into existence? Apple had actually been tinkering with the touch-screen technology since 2002, but for different reasons. Their hope at the time had been to find a more intuitive way for users to interact with computers beyond the confines of a keyboard and a mouse. As they began experimenting with multi-touch – as the technology is called – they found that it was both fun and effective. In another sense, the iPhone was also just a natural progression from the iPod, combining a phone, an iPod and a computer in a single, beautifully designed product. That all being said, the phone did have an initial problem. Because of Apple’s refusal to allow outside developers to build applications, there weren’t a ton of apps to choose from. It was only in November of 2007 that Apple revealed its intention to release a software-developer kit, which may have been the greatest breakthrough the product offered. All of sudden, anyone who wanted to could create apps, making the iPhone truly versatile. As a result, the iPhone remains the most successful consumer electronics product in history. Over half a billion iPhones have been sold since 2007 and, of course, Apple has profited tremendously. So Apple was doing better than ever, but the same couldn’t be said of Jobs. His cancer never went away, and his health was declining. But, despite this fact, his illness also never overshadowed the daily business of Apple. While the board of directors began to discuss succession plans, for most people at Apple, Jobs’s declining health was a total mystery. After all, even as his health deteriorated and he knew time was running out, Jobs refused to give up. Because of his dedication, the company released the MacBook Air in 2008 and, two years later, the iPad. At the time, the former product was Apple’s new “it” device. It was thinner than any previous laptop – effectively the computer equivalent of a supermodel. From there, the iPad further revolutionized the industry in 2010. If the iPhone was a miniaturized computer, the iPad was a blown up iPhone. When it was released, Jobs unveiled its functions while comfortably sitting on a couch, demonstrating how easy it was to use. And, in fact, the iPad did offer a much more intimate experience than a laptop, easily bringing computing into the living room. This casual presentation was perfect, but it was also necessitated by Jobs’s poor health; he had lost an alarming amount of weight and the prospect of death was becoming undeniable. In early 2009, he received a liver transplant, but it was to no avail and, on Tuesday, October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs passed away. As you might imagine, the funeral services were magnificent. When he was buried, on October 8, there was a small ceremony – family, close friends and companions from Apple. But another service followed on October 17, at Memorial Church, on the Stanford University campus. And then another, on October 20, at the Apple headquarters, in Cupertino, with almost ten thousand people in attendance. Following Jobs’s burial, his long-time colleague and friend Tim Cook took over as CEO of Apple, and he’s continued to advance Jobs’s legacy – a legacy of growth, success, creativity and innovation. The key message in this book: The life of Steve Jobs is a story of success, innovation and growth. Even from an early age, Jobs had a talent for technology and, when he cofounded Apple in his twenties, he already had a vision of what computers could become. Though a sometimes impulsive and difficult man, he was also a dreamer and a trailblazer – and in an inspiration to millions worldwide. Got feedback?

K. Bray","summary":"Are you tired of your job? Are you bored, exhausted or dissatisfied with your tasks? Or perhaps you like your tasks, but it’s your office and your colleagues that make you dread going to work. Today, as we rush to find a job and make a living, we make bad decisions and choose a job that doesn’t meet our expectations or doesn’t fit our strengths. As a result, our discontent grows. We’re hesitant to make a change because we fear we won’t be able to find anything else, let alone something better –  and sometimes we don’t even know what we would do instead. These blinks show you what it takes to make a career change. They’re full of effective strategies to help you overcome your fears, discover your strengths and successfully plan a career transition. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why winning the lottery is not a career path; what scoring a goal, landing on the moon and changing careers have in common; and how to try out job opportunities like food samples in the supermarket. You’ve probably heard this cliche before: Just find a job you like and you’ll never work a day in your life. Well, the reality isn’t that simple. After all, work is called work for a reason. What makes it worse, though, is that lots of people have unrealistic expectations about their jobs. For instance, when asked to describe their dream career, people tend to say things like, “a job that lets me travel a lot,” or “one where I make twice as much money as I do now.” But such notions are totally off base. Just like winning the lottery, which some people list as their ideal career, the notion of luxurious jobs is a fantasy, with an absurdly low probability of realization. While some people want the most pampered career they can imagine, others would take virtually anything but their current job. In fact, lots of people are unhappy with their jobs, even though many of them like the field in which they work. Indeed, a 2013 global Gallup survey found that 87 percent of employees weren’t satisfied with their careers. But while lots of people are left unsatisfied by their work, it’s not the type of work they do that leaves them feeling unfulfilled. The real issues are characteristics of their workplaces; things like bosses, coworkers, salaries or even office politics. If this is true for you, it might make sense to look for a different position within the same company or the same role at a different one. For example, if you have a family, but your job requires loads of travel, you might prefer a different role within your organization that keeps you closer to home. As you begin thinking about changing careers, you’re likely to have thoughts like “you can’t do it” and “you’ll definitely fail.” So how can you get past these thoughts and into the career you desire? The thing all these thoughts have in common is fear. So to make your career change, you’ll need to overcome it. Remember, it’s no surprise that your plans are scary – it’s a common human reaction to unknown situations, and a career change is a highly uncertain undertaking. To get your worries under control, start by listing the unknowns. For instance, you might not know whether you’ll be able to quickly find another job, or what it’ll be like to work at a new company; you might be worried that you won’t be able to meet a new set of expectations. Once you’ve listed all the unknowns, write down what makes them scary. Then, come up with an action sentence for each fear that begins with the word “despite.” As an example, you might write, “I’m afraid of switching careers because it might mean a few months without income. Despite this financial risk, I can change careers because I have some savings.” Writing out your worries and how you’ll handle them will help you separate legitimate fears from illegitimate ones, and show you what you can do about them. After you’ve gotten this roadblock out of the way, it’s time to decide what your change should look like. This is key, as lots of people mistakenly make drastic changes to their entire career when all that’s needed is a slight adjustment. To avoid making that mistake, determine what change or changes to make by considering your current job satisfaction. Ask yourself questions like, “How much do you like the place you work and the people you work with?” and “Are you being paid the same as others with your position?” By answering these questions, you’ll get a better idea of whether you should switch departments, change companies or choose a different career altogether. Lots of people try to make significant changes in their lives, from quitting smoking to losing weight to stopping nail-biting. But too often, people fail to stick to these plans. That doesn’t mean change is impossible, it just shows that it requires a particular combination of short- and long-term thinking. So once you know exactly what change you want to make, it’s time to make plans for the near and distant future. Draw three columns on a piece of paper and label them “One Year,” “Three Years” and “Five Years,” respectively. Then, in each column, write your ideal employment situation for that time frame. Continue filling in each of the three columns with your preferred job type, desired salary, the skills or education required and whether your position will be in management or not. Once you’ve got this information down, form a timeline that starts where you are and ends where you want to be. This process will get your goals down on paper, but it will also help reduce any fears you might have about finding your ideal job. It will give you some very specific details about the path you want to follow over the next five years, knowledge that’s central to quelling your fears. For instance, after completing this process, you’ll be able to start getting the training you know you’ll need and searching for positions that meet your requirements. This will allow you to set several small, achievable goals that cut down the fear of a big change and give you a higher chance of meeting your target. Just as companies have to leverage their resources to make profits, you need to leverage yours. But what’s the most important resource at your disposal? It’s the people around you. Take stock of the contacts in your network and consider how each of them can help you achieve your career goals. Essentially, this is just networking. While lots of people don’t enjoy this activity, considering it shallow or selfish, it’s actually all about building relationships. If you approach relationship-building with genuine goodwill, the other benefits of networking will follow naturally. That being said, there is still some strategy involved: After making a contact, say, at a social gathering or conference, be sure to get in touch with them at least three times per year. This could be as simple as shooting them an e-mail saying that something reminded you of them. By maintaining contact, you’ll establish a rapport that lets you ask for a favor down the line. For instance, an accountant you met at a business fair might know the CEO of a company you’re dying to work for. But meeting new people can be scary and, if you’re really apprehensive about it, you should consider preparing yourself beforehand. Begin by generating a few questions you can ask almost anybody, like what their profession is, or whether they’ve heard of your company. Then, once you’ve asked a question and the other person is responding, regain your composure while listening to them and share something relevant about yourself. The goal of this type of interaction isn’t to make a deal, it’s just to leave an impression through a brief conversation. Remember, you can always follow up later with a phone call or e-mail that gives more details about who you are and sets up your next meeting. You know how some supermarkets offer free samples that let you try out different foods before buying them? Well, the job market also has free samples on offer. In fact, there are many ways to find out what a prospective job really involves, and this information can help you make an informed decision about your employment and career prospects. For instance, if you’re considering changing jobs within your company, you might ask to work one day per week in a different role, strictly on a trial basis. When it comes to positions outside your organization, lots of companies will offer potential hires the opportunity to try a job out for a few weeks to determine if they’re a good fit. And you can always take a second job, undergo training in a new field that interests you and talk to as many people as possible about your new career options. But before embarking on your career change journey, it’s important to arm yourself with the right tools. First, make sure you have a financial contingency plan in case things get rocky. Figure out how much money you’ll need to get you through the transition, and then be sure to have a little more than that, just in case. It’s also essential to prepare yourself mentally, since your career change might not be all that easy at first. Changes are especially difficult in their initial stages. But don’t worry, they get easier with time. Just take the author, who meticulously prepared his doctoral thesis, thought it was all set to go and was devastated when he was told it needed a lot more work. Instead of freaking out, he kept himself focused on the goal he had set for himself; he believed in it and never quit until his thesis was complete. The lesson is clear: as you embark on this major life transition, make a careful plan and stick to it. The key message in this book: Whether your goal is to secure a different job, join a new company or enter a different industry altogether, you have to take stock of what you want from your career change and make a careful plan to achieve your goal. Knowing yourself well and being realistic about what’s possible are essential steps in this potentially life-changing process. Actionable advice: Define your strengths. If you know you want a different job but aren’t sure what it should be, take some time to consider your strengths and how they could be applied to different fields. Make a list of things you're particularly good at and consider different industries or jobs that require these skills. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

If there aren’t any numbers, if something can’t be measured, then how can one know what action to take? Well, some things are beyond measure. Take relationships, for example. Could you quantify the relationship you have with your family or loved ones, with your friends? Probably not, and, as you probably know, businesses are full of relationships that can produce magnificent outcomes if they work well. So, let’s take a look at how these interpersonal relationships work and what companies can do to achieve greatness through small changes. In these blinks, you’ll find out what social capital is and how it helps businesses succeed; why working more hours leads to less productivity; and about the amazing results of bringing in an outsider. You’ve probably been there before. You’re sitting in a business meeting, and someone proposes a business decision you disagree with. And because you don’t want to seem hostile, you hold your tongue. But avoiding debate is never helpful, and there are ways your company can change this unproductive habit. The key is creative conflict, a skill that, like all others, can be learned through practice. With creative conflict comes a willingness to disagree and challenge the general consensus so that new and creative ideas can be developed. But what many people don’t know is that there’s a talent to productive disagreement. Brooke Deterline is a constructive conflict specialist, and she is always astounded by how her clients assume they’ll be able to productively manage group discussions on their first attempt. It’s particularly surprising since people recognize that other skills, such as learning a language, a musical instrument or public speaking, take time and practice. And when it comes to creative conflict and the ability to effectively express your opinion and meet conflict head-on, it is still practice that makes perfect. The first key point people need to realize is that they must prepare and gain supportive allies before they take on authority figures at the workplace. Deterline coached one of her clients, Luke, through this process when he had to stand up to his aggressive boss while negotiating a contract. The first step was simulating how the situation might play out; they considered how his boss would react to different statements and devised appropriate counter-reactions for Luke. Then, Luke reached out to his colleagues within the company for advice and support. This allowed him to strengthen his position further so that he could engage with his boss in a productive conversation. So, by the time Luke had the actual negotiation with his boss, he was confident. He knew what he needed to say and how to react appropriately to whatever his temperamental boss threw his way. Have you ever been part of a group project where everyone involved was unfamiliar with one another? If you have, then you probably noticed that discussions were mostly unproductive, because everyone was hesitant and nervous around each other. To combat this kind of situation, and enable constructive conflict, it’s important to establish social capital within your company. The concept of social capital isn’t new. Anthropologists who studied early communities coined the term to explain why certain tribes thrived and succeeded – it’s what people in a community feel when they can rely and depend upon one another for help, and it remains a great survival tool for companies today. And you will find that when you combine creative conflict with social capital, your company will enter into a cycle of prosperity. This happens when people engage in creative conflict. The experience allows coworkers to bond with one another and improves their relationships. Naturally, this creates even more social capital within the company, which in turn builds more trust so that people feel more confident to engage in future creative conflict. But creative conflict isn’t the only way to build social capital. One company used a different kind of creativity to help improve collaborative efforts between departments. The CEO launched a company-wide project in which each department was charged with making a short film that highlighted the work of a different department. They weren’t expected to make an Oscar-winning movie, nor did they have to: people only need to take small actions in order to build social capital. And the project worked perfectly. The whole company gathered in a movie theater to watch the results, and the movies not only turned out to be creative and original but also got the previously uncooperative company members talking and bonding with one another. Working longer hours should mean that more work gets done, right? Actually, that might not be the case. Over 100 years ago, scientist Ernst Abbe discovered that reducing the workday from 9 to 8 hours increased overall productivity. Even now, studies continue to show that overworked employees are less productive, but companies remain reluctant to change their ways. Since Abbe’s discovery, many studies have shown that people working over 40 hours a week are less productive and more prone to making mistakes, all of which results in a less efficient company. Yet these companies remain largely blind to these facts. Apart from industries like aviation or truck driving, where long hours can lead to deadly accidents, many continue to believe that workaholics make the best employees. This holds true even in the face of compelling evidence. For example, while 50 percent of all mergers or acquisition deals fail, few people question whether or not this could be due to exhausted CEOs making poor decisions that could be avoided by working more reasonable hours. Working too much can lead to what’s known as tunnel vision. When people are tired, their ability to think and reason diminishes, and they often become stubborn in their decision-making, refusing to adapt to changing circumstances or even recognize existing errors. Naturally, under these conditions, employees become increasingly inefficient in their work, which unfortunately results in having to work even longer hours! What’s worse is that being overworked can lead to health problems as well. In 2012, the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health showed that working 11 hours a day doubles a person’s risk of depression. Furthermore, employees who work more than 55 hours a week start to show signs of losing their language and problem-solving skills by middle age. All this in addition to the slower reaction times that overworked people tend to have. You might think that the analytical mind of a scientist and the abstract mind of an artist would make for an unproductive pairing. But such a team can actually make some astounding breakthroughs. This is exactly what happened at Roche Pharmaceuticals. Team leader Matthias Essenpreis was at a loss when his group was trying to improve the company’s diabetes products. He knew his team needed an exciting new perspective, so Essenpreis came up with an unorthodox idea: to invite an artist to work with the team. It was an effective strategy. While his team of scientists approached problem-solving in a logical way, the artist, Kelly Heaton, took a more holistic approach. Rather than focusing on the technical aspects, the artist took on the perspective of the diabetes patient. She was also a great communicator and her fresh perspective allowed her to ask the right questions when the team was stuck. As a result, in 2003, Roche developed diabetes packs containing an innovative new device that allowed patients to simultaneously administer insulin and measure their blood sugar. Thinking outside the box can also lead organizations to breaking boundaries and connecting with other businesses. Traditionally, companies tend to look inward; they create protective policies and focus on safe products to maintain a comfortable status quo. These days, however, they are discovering that true innovation comes when companies consider themselves as interactive parts of a bigger corporate picture. We can see this change of perspective in ARM, a company that specializes in semiconductor and software design. When ARM started, it was a tiny company of only 12 employees. In order to grow and increase production, ARM learned to collaborate with much larger firms that had thousands of employees. Rather than struggling on their own, they grew by becoming a part of other companies’ teams. Even today, many of ARM’s employees spend most of their time working within other organizations. Companies that don’t collaborate are often less creative than companies that do. Indeed, collaboration is, in some ways, the name of the game. And that’s why companies hoping to innovate should adopt a flat hierarchy. A flat hierarchy is a company structure that eliminates the levels of middle management that separate employees from executives. Paul Harris, CEO of South Africa’s FirstRand Bank is a proponent of flat hierarchies. For Harris, part of this structure’s appeal is a matter of efficiency. Vertical hierarchies, with their long chain of managers, are needlessly complicated: the flow of information from top to bottom can often get stuck in middle management, leaving people lower on the ladder clueless as to what their bosses want them to do. But more importantly, flat hierarchies give every member of a company the opportunity to contribute creative ideas, which makes for a much more innovative environment. When FirstRand Bank introduced a flat hierarchy system, the idea of introducing an electronic payment method and giving clients the ability to use their cell phones to transfer money, easily made its way from idea to implementation and is now a service for every FirstRand Bank customer. The thing is that, when one person has too much power, it’s often a recipe for disaster. Research in this area shows that when people become powerful they also become worse at listening to others, failing to take into account the opinions of their employees. They get so preoccupied with pursuing their own agenda that the ideas, emotions and perspectives of other people simply fall by the wayside. Many of the traits can be traced back to the fact that these powerful leaders tend to feel that all the responsibility rests on their shoulders. Therefore, they are reluctant to seek help or assistance, fearing it will be perceived as weakness. Implementing a flat hierarchy is one way to avoid ending up with a bad leader. The key message in this book: Having a successful company isn’t just about generating billions of dollars in profit; it’s about fostering creativity, innovation and open communication. And you can achieve this with some small but important changes – like cutting down on work hours, flattening hierarchies and encouraging people to voice their opinions. Simple changes like these can make all the difference.  Actionable advice: Lead from where you are. It doesn’t matter whether you are the CEO of a company or a regular employee. Look out for opportunities to lead your team to success. For example, practice voicing your opinion as often as possible. This may result in some annoyance at first, and you may make mistakes, but your team will thank you in the long run for getting the ball rolling and showing that you care about the company.

These blinks show how failure can be used to your advantage – how it’s in fact key to progress and success. In these blinks, you’ll discover why prosecuting innocent people isn’t a rare event; how the invention of the ATM sprang from failure; and how good you are at learning from your mistakes. Children have a hard time admitting their mistakes. It’s practically automatic for them to deny doing things like drawing all over the walls, even when the evidence – the marker in their hand and the ink on their fingers – is indisputable. But are we that much different when we’re all grown up? Not really. In general, people are highly averse to admitting that they’ve made a mistake. In fact, we hate admitting that we’ve made an error more than we hate making mistakes themselves! A look at the criminal justice system makes this very clear.  In 1984, the advent of DNA testing enabled prosecutors to prove guilt beyond doubt. You’d think that this fool-proof technology would work the other way around, too – helping wrongfully convicted people prove their innocence. Unfortunately, it usually didn’t work that way. In most cases law enforcement simply wouldn’t admit that they’d made a mistake.  Take the case of Juan Rivera, a 19-year-old with a history of mental illness. In 1992, he was accused of raping and murdering an eleven-year-old girl, and sentenced to life in prison. Thirteen years later, a DNA test proved Juan’s innocence. But prosecutors wouldn’t budge, and it took another six years for his release.  So why is it so hard to admit mistakes? Well, admitting error compromises our self-esteem, especially when it’s about something important. Those prosecutors from the Rivera case weren’t necessarily bad people. They may have simply wanted to cover up their mistakes. Perhaps the hardest part of admitting mistakes is the first part – admitting to yourself that you’ve made one. This is especially true when the mistake is a big one, like sending an innocent person to spend 13 years in prison. Admitting such a horrible mistake instantly compromises your self-esteem, making it difficult to even live with yourself?  So, in all likelihood, the prosecutors truly believed that Rivera was guilty, and that there was some explanation for the negative DNA test that didn’t rule out guilt. As you saw in the previous blink (and no doubt learned from some experience in your own life), it’s extremely difficult to admit mistakes. But failing face and understand failure has consequences: it hinders our ability to succeed. Failure is more than personal shame; rather, it’s an indication that something is wrong. And when you know that something is wrong – be it your personal attitude or the way a company is organized – then you have an opportunity to fix it.  Think about it like this: when playing basketball, every missed basket is, technically, a failure. You obviously made a miscalculation, a mistake. Maybe you’re holding the ball incorrectly, using too much force or jumping awkwardly. Each time you miss the basket, you know that you’ve somehow failed to shoot a perfect shot.  It’s by adjusting your behavior according to the feedback you get from failure that you improve, and ultimately succeed. All of those missed shots provide you with crucial information about how to get things right next time – how to hold the ball, how to jump – so that you can eventually score.  Nature works in the same way. Species evolve over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, with each generation passing on the mutations that made survival easier. It’s as if each species makes a record of the things that almost got it killed in order to ensure that future generations are better prepared for danger.  A team of Unilever biologists employed a similar method when attempting to design a nozzle that wouldn’t get clogged. In total, they produced 449 designs, taking the best design from each series until they eventually developed the most effective nozzle. Imagine a world in which no one admitted to or learned from their failures. In such a world, mistakes would be repeated again and again, with drastic consequences. It’s often obvious whether someone succeeded or failed: a patient either lives or dies, a plane either lands or crashes. The subtlety lies in the explanation: was this failure due to a mistake, or not? But it’s not always obvious that a change in action would lead to a change in outcome. Would the patient have lived if treated differently? Would the plane have crashed if landed elsewhere? It’s precisely this vagueness that makes it so easy to shirk responsibility for mistakes. But if you can’t admit mistakes, how will you learn to do better next time? In the medical profession, mistakes are so unacceptable that doctors and nurses rarely admit to making them. As a result, mistakes are repeated, ultimately at the expense of the patient’s health. Studies estimate that at least 40,000 people die per year in the United States due to medical mistakes. In some fields, however, failure is simply impossible. As a result, these fields make virtually no progress. For example, pseudo-sciences like astrology haven’t progressed at all in centuries. The assumptions underpinning astrological predictions are simply too vague to be falsified. Another great example is bloodletting, which was a common medical practice before clinical trials became standard in the nineteenth century. Doctors would drain blood from patients, in an attempt to cure or prevent diseases. Although this only weakened the patients when they most needed their strength, doctors nonetheless employed this practice for over 1700 years. They had no idea they were literally killing patients, as they’d never bothered to test the practice. So far, we’ve focused on the negative impact of not owning up to mistakes. In the following blinks, we’ll explore how to put your failures to good use. We tend to see the world as simple, and easily understandable. As a result, we rarely feel the need to test our theories. But this deprives us of the opportunity to see if these theories are true or false! The world is big and scary, so it makes sense that we’d look for simple explanations wherever we can find them. Think back to the practice of bloodletting: medieval doctors thought that patients who died were simply doomed from the beginning. Such patients were so far gone that even bloodletting couldn’t save them. Though it may be hard to admit, the world isn’t simple. Difficult situations often stem from numerous causes. Simplifying things only prevents you from actually making sense of the world by testing your theories. The medieval doctors never tested the validity of bloodletting because they had no reason to. They already “knew” why the patients died – at least, they thought they did. But giving ideas an opportunity to fail makes room for new ideas and progress. No matter how reasonable an idea may seem, you can never be certain of its validity if you don’t put it to the test. One way to test a theory is to perform a randomized control test (RCT), in which you test something against a control group that helps make the cause of failure clearer. For example, if you wanted to test the efficacy of bloodletting, you could gather ten patients, each suffering from the same illness, and split them into two groups: the bloodletting group and the control group. The bloodletting group gets a bloodletting procedure; the other group gets no treatment. If everyone in each group dies, then you don’t have enough information to make an informed judgment about bloodletting. However, if everyone in the bloodletting group dies, but half of the control group survives, then you have to admit that bloodletting is not only ineffective, but downright harmful. Failure can be annoying. But it can also inspire you to see problems in a different light. And with this new perspective comes new solutions.  Often, great ideas arise when there’s a specific problem – that is, when something has failed. The failure itself is what drives you to find a solution, and in this way, failure can function as a driver of progress.  Think about the ATM, for example, conceived one day when John Shephard-Barron forgot to go to the bank to pick up some cash. In other words, he failed at having cash when he needed it. But through his failure, a new solution arose: a money-dispensing machine that is open when banks are closed.  In addition to catalyzing novel solutions, failure is also a way to fine-tune complicated processes, as it helps us discern a problem’s component parts. The more complicated the process, the harder it is to fine-tune. Complexity makes it harder to see exactly where things went wrong. Say you want to help improve education throughout the African continent. How do you know if your aid is making a difference? Looking at grades alone doesn’t tell you much, because the problem is simply too large to know what causes a certain change.  However, by allowing yourself to fail on a small scale, it becomes easier to discern which strategies are working, and then apply them on a larger scale.  For example, in Kenya, a group of economists wanted to improve the quality of local schools. They started by recording the grades at different schools, and trying out various things, to see if they improved scores. Their first idea was to deliver free textbooks. However, they soon discovered that schools without this aid performed just as well. So, they tried several other approaches. Finally, they stumbled upon a solution that actually helped improve grades: de-worming medicine. Once a small-scale solution like this is developed, it can be tested on a wider scale. If you want to take full advantage of failure, it’s not enough to understand intellectually that failure is helpful. You also need to build a positive relationship with it.  If you can’t handle failure – if you run from it instead – then you’ll end up failing more than is necessary. In fact, a fear of failure can cause people to create unnecessary barriers to success. For instance, the author recalls some of his classmates, the “cool kids,” who used to go out partying the night before exams. These students were so afraid of not living up to expectations that they decided to do things to take the edge off of potential failure. If they did fine on the exam, then all was well. But if they ended up failing, they could blame it on the night of drinking. Obviously, this is a terrible way to improve. You have to be willing to fail, and take responsibility for that failure, in order to develop – because failure is a valuable teacher. But no teacher in the world can help you if you’re not willing to listen. Learning from failure means spending time and effort thinking about your mistakes. Unfortunately, people would rather bury their heads in the sand than face their failures. This is a major problem, because our attitude toward failure often determines our success. We see evidence for this in an experiment performed by a team of psychologists at Michigan State University. The experiment divided children in two groups: those who believed they were born intelligent, and those who thought they could get smarter with practice. Each group was assigned tasks with increasing difficulty, designed so that children would eventually fail. The experiment revealed that children who believed they could improve were able to use these failures to progress in subsequent tests. The other children, the ones who believed their intelligence was fixed, simply gave up. The key message in this book: It’s hard to admit to mistakes. But if you want to meet your full potential, then you not only have to recognize that you make mistakes but embrace them as part of your path to success. Indeed, without failure, there is no progress. Suggested further reading: Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson Through studies and anecdotes, these blinks explain why, when we make mistakes, we often come up with self-justifications instead of admitting the mistakes to ourselves. It also shows how detrimental these self-justifications can be to personal relationships, medicinal care, the justice system and even international relations. Got feedback?

Benioff and Carlye Adler","summary":"Every year millions of companies are started around the world. The majority fail within a few years. Multi-billion-dollar powerhouse Salesforce.com is truly one of the exceptions. So what makes them different? All success stories begin with an idea you truly believe in and the courage to go your own way when venture capitalists give you the cold shoulder and markets are in uproar. But how do you give that fledgling idea wings? By clearly differentiating yourself from others, putting the customer at the heart of your business, and by not being afraid to pick on the big dogs, you can not only pave the way to success, you can also change an entire industry. In these blinks you’ll learn how Salesforce.com put an end to the software era; why standing out from the crowd is so important; and how you become big in Japan. Even the biggest companies in the world start off as mere ideas. But if everyone could snap their fingers and manifest those ideas, the world would be teeming with entrepreneurs. So what is it that made Marc Benioff and Salesforce.com so massively successful? Let’s start with this tip from Benioff: when you notice an idea’s potential, don’t be intimidated by it, even if it means going at it alone. The idea for Salesforce.com wasn’t the culmination of an arduous journey to seek out a grand new business concept. Benioff was on sabbatical after over ten years as vice president of Oracle when he got his inspiration while swimming with dolphins in Hawaii. Around this time, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) company Siebel Systems went public with a software solution that enabled salespeople to track leads, account information and manage contacts. However, it was expensive, flawed and high-maintenance, like many other similar solutions at the time. Benioff noted the concept and thought he could improve the software using a “Software-as-a-Service” approach, specifically through a cloud computing model, so he contacted founder Tom Siebel about his idea. However, although supportive, Siebel didn’t think it would win over a significant part of the market. But Benioff stuck to his vision and decided to go at it alone. He knew he had to think big. To draw in the best engineers for his new company, he marketed his vision as “the end of software business and technology models.” He knew that this benchmark would intrigue any skilled developer. By March 1999, he had employed three highly experienced application developers who worked with him in a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco and by that summer, Benioff had ten employees and was out-growing the apartment. To accommodate his promising company, he decided to rent an 8,000 square-foot office space at the Rincon Center. Marketing: it’s the number one way to garner attention when you’re still a growing company. If you want to see the same kind of success as Salesforce.com, you must assert yourself either against the market leader or as the new market leader from the very start. The first thing you must figure out is how you can show the public that you are unique. Just six months after Benioff founded Salesforce.com, Don Clark from the Wall Street Journal wrote a front page story on the “spawning of a new industry.” This did wonders for the company and spread awareness about the “end of software” era. Benioff knew he had to offer a clear message and inform journalists about how Salesforce.com was different from other companies. Next, Salesforce.com needed branding. And for this, Benioff hired Bruce Campbell, a legendary marketer who created the “no software” logo, which consisted of the word “software” in a red circle with a line through it. Some team members were skeptical, but Benioff felt that their concerns were overruled by the number one marketing rule – stand out from the pack. He was right: after plastering the logo all over magazines and newspapers, the campaign was recognized as the Hi-Tech Campaign of the Year by PRWeek. But it’s not enough to simply stand out from the crowd, you must also pick a fight with the biggest players. Bolstered by the positive media feedback, Salesforce.com began badgering their competitors. In one instance, they paid actors to pretend to be protesters waving “no software” signs in front of a conference for their main competitor, Siebel User Group. Every visitor was given an invitation for the Salesforce.com launch party and many of them showed up! The press revelled in this David and Goliath story, adding even more buzz to the event. As Salesforce.com expanded, they found it less necessary to concentrate on attacking their competitors. Now was the right time to really market the value of their service. One of the best ways to do exactly this is to use events wisely to maximize the viral effect. There are two important marketing strategies that result in the best sales conversions: the first are editorials, which are unbiased write-ups in the press. The second are testimonies, meaning word-of-mouth created by customers enthusing about their success stories. Rather than presenting their product to potential investors, Salesforce.com started organizing a road show in a string of cities called City Tours, with events featuring keynote speakers, customer presentations and demos. This brought potential customers, journalists and analysts together to share their experiences. This way of catering to the end user made a marked difference in the company’s marketing success. Traditional software companies chased executives who, although they controlled budgets, were less likely to use the product themselves. So Salesforce.com saw more value in celebrating their real customers. They covered events with posters of them, even incorporating them into their presentations. These events became affectionately known as “love fests,” and enabled the company to close deals with a huge 80 percent of new prospects. Lastly, the company began throwing cocktail parties instead of hosting boring product demos. As the City Tours became more popular, Benioff wasn’t convinced they could keep holding such expensive events in every city. But an East Coast salesman had an idea: he didn’t really care about the presentations, but loved the after parties, where he could mingle with customers. So how about just hosting the cocktail parties? Salesforce.com decided to test this in a small venue in New York with only 11 customers and prospects. At a tenth of the cost of a typical City Tour event, the net result was almost exactly the same. Dealing in enterprise software during the 1990s meant tailored presentations, multiple negotiations and months of expensive work. But as the internet era dawned, Salesforce.com found a far better way to deliver and improve their product: they recognized that the customers themselves should be able to evaluate it. Benioff understood that potential customers wanted to be hands-on with the software before they signed anything. So he started giving away free trials over the internet, which meant customers could try it without talking to a salesperson. This isn’t unusual today, but in 1999 it certainly wasn’t standard industry practice. The software initially cost $50 per month, so the purchase was also less risky for the customer. Salesforce.com also created “bugforce,” a scaled-down database where customers could report bugs and offer new ideas for the software. With this constant feedback from customers, they were able to rework and refine the software immediately, and respond to customers’ needs effectively. This customer-centric approach helped them more than they could have predicted when the dot-com bubble burst. The dot-com craze initially boosted a lot of sites. But in March 2001, they, as well as Salesforce.com, were hit hard. Many companies decided to leave Salesforce.com and by October 2001, the company was losing up to one and a half million dollars per month, creating critical cash flow problems. Their solution was to change from a monthly to a yearly billing plan. Although this was a more conservative approach and restricted the customers’ payment plans, over 50 percent of them agreed to it immediately. Within a year, Salesforce.com went from being in the red to making a profit, all while retaining many of their customers. This was only possible because they had earned the trust and loyalty of their customers long beforehand, and the same customers now felt secure about paying upfront. Software companies such as Oracle traditionally tailored their products for each company that used their product. But Salesforce.com focused on a single service to suit everyone. They did this partly by allowing their users to share their service over the internet. The developers at Salesforce.com used a technology model they called “multitenancy.” This acted like an apartment building where tenants split costs associated with the whole building, but every tenant still had their own lock and could decorate their apartment however they liked. At Salesforce.com, this meant the user could access the software running on the Salesforce.com servers while still working with their own data. Venture capitalists saw this as a loss of control and feared they would shed customers as a result. But this was never a problem – maintenance became easier because every user received updates or new features automatically. Besides, if they went back on the idea, how could they promote “the end of software” if they began offering exactly what they wanted to destroy? In addition to multitenancy, Salesforce.com knew they had to make things fast and simple. Before their small-scale development team started writing the code, they created core principles for the system and laid them out on a whiteboard. They concluded that the system should be fast, because salespeople needed information quickly, and if they ran into roadblocks, they would quit the service. Next, they decided their code should be as simple as possible, which would make identifying and fixing bugs easier. Their principles paid off: in the first quarter of 2009, the service had a 99.9 percent uptime and over 200 million transactions per day. One pivotal decision was to make the code public for external developers, giving them free rein to create their own applications. This was put to use by the $300-million healthcare services provider, the Schumacher Group, who used it for over 90 percent of their operational programs. Salesforce.com had now laid a solid foundation in the United States, but as the need for CRM was international, Marc Benioff was keen to expand overseas. So what should you do if you want to be internationally competitive? Choose your headquarters wisely. Salesforce.com opted for Europe first, and in order to give themselves a promising start, in 2000, they set up their headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. At this time Dublin was attractive to big companies like Oracle or Microsoft, due to the English-speaking population and the favorable tax rate of 12.5 percent. They also resolved to only hire native speakers from different countries. That way, when a customer from Germany called they would think they were speaking with someone in Germany. Although they had an office for essential office work, they conducted meetings largely from luxury hotels in London, which was possible as their software was internet-based. Using hotels for meetings projected an image of success to their clients, and it was cheaper than renting high-end offices. The company also began to tailor their marketing strategy for different markets. Salesforce’s aggressive marketing strategy was hugely effective in the United States and Europe, so now they set their sights on Asian markets, beginning with Japan. After conducting a bit of research, they recognized that they would need to approach Japan rather differently, with a significant re-think on how they positioned themselves. Japanese companies are traditionally cautious about foreign products, and look for something relatable. Salesforce.com learned this lesson from their direct sales manager, Eiji Uda. Everytime he introduced Salesforce.com to potential Japanese customers, he would throw in a few references to other growing companies like Google or Amazon, with which the Japanese were familiar. Then, when two of the biggest Japanese companies – Canon and Japan Post – started implementing Salesforce.com into their workflow, many more were happy to follow suit. Getting sufficient funds together is one of the most stressful and draining parts of setting up a business. Unfortunately, even if you’re a passionate entrepreneur, the passion alone is not enough to support your new business financially. Thankfully, though, start-up capital is often closer at hand than you might think. According to one study, 79 percent of small businesses start out with a serious lack of funds. In an attempt to avoid being one of these companies, Benioff sought out interested venture capitalists. This seemed logical for a fast-growing internet company looking to land a multi-million-dollar investment. However, no one was particularly enthused by the “no software“ model. But rather than quitting, Benioff reminded himself of all the other companies, like Starbucks and Cisco, that got turned down by venture capitalists. So Benioff went to those who believed in him: his family and friends. To his surprise, he found many people in his immediate circle who totally backed his idea. Remarkably, over five fundraising rounds he managed to raise $65 million between 1999 and 2002, much to the chagrin of the venture capitalists who had rejected his idea. If they’d made an initial investment of $1 million it would be worth one hundred times that today. Benioff also decided to focus his efforts on raising revenue and expanding Salesforce.com’s customer base, rather than streamlining the firm and chasing profitability. In 2002, Salesforce.com had the goal of becoming a one billion-dollar company, and they decided to go public. However, as the market had only just found its feet after the dot-com bubble burst, companies now had to demonstrate significant revenue. Going against convention, Salesforce.com started to audit before they went public. By December 2003, after over a year of internal preparation, Salesforce.com increased their annual revenue from $25 million to $100 million. That’s more than twice as much as other companies had achieved. Not long after, on 23 June 2004, Benioff got to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange – a personal career highlight. The key message in this book: Salesforce.com is a solid example of a company who became hugely successful by following a few key guidelines: stand by your vision; know how to position yourself in different markets; keep your customers at the center of your business; pick one product or service and do it in the best possible way; and don’t be scared of the big players. Actionable advice: Don’t let expense stop you. If you have an idea you believe in, don’t let anyone dissuade you with stories of how hard it will be to raise the money to realize it. Instead of chasing down venture capitalists, look to other means to support your idea, like people you know or institutions and organizations that can back you financially.

As the author and seasoned Olympic coach Michael Bar-Eli explains, basketball teams and workplace teams alike can use the proven techniques of sports psychology to take their performance to the next level. These blinks will provide you with some of the most reliable and beneficial methods to improve your performance, as well as some examples from history that highlight these methods and the amazing results they’ve produced. But even if you’re out of shape or just want to know how to improve performance and morale in the office, you’ll find some useful techniques ahead. In these blinks, you’ll discover what a backwards high jump can teach us about innovation; which soccer team proves that friendship isn’t a requirement for success; and how an active imagination can bring you better results. In the winter of 1971, the author, Michael Bar-Eli, was in the Israeli military, undergoing a tremendously challenging basic training that included finishing a 3,000-meter run in under 12 minutes. Time and time again, Bar-Eli found himself running at the end of the pack during the practice runs. And then, the commanding officer threatened to punish him with four extra hours of night-watch duty if he didn’t shape up. This proved to be just the motivation the author needed. Immediately, he set himself the goal of keeping pace with the front-runners who were always beating the 12-minute mark. And sure enough, when it came time for the official race, Bar-Eli managed to come in under 12 minutes. This experience taught the author an important lesson about how goals can greatly influence outcome, as long as those goals are specific. Being specific is crucial because it leads to a detailed action plan that you can focus on and measure yourself against – all of which will help you achieve your goal. In the case of the author’s 3-kilometer run, the goal was specific – keep up with the front-runners – and this allowed him to plan, focus and measure his progress by comparing his pace against theirs. In tracking himself against their speed, the author knew precisely when and where he needed to adjust in order to stay on track. If the author had settled on just “doing his best,” he wouldn’t have been so focused and motivated, since there wouldn’t have been anything to measure his progress against. The author’s “best” has no specific pace. As for more long-term goals, you should use specific short-term goals as building blocks. One of the greatest Olympic swimmers in US history was John Naber, and he used this incremental goal-setting strategy with historic success. His specific long-term goal was to cut four seconds off his personal best in the four years before the next Olympics. If he did this, chances were he’d win gold. Now, to reach this primary goal, he set small, yet still specific, short-term goals of shaving off a fraction of a second in each practice swim. He knew that, by doing this constantly, he could reach four seconds by the end of his four years of training. Naber’s strategy worked like a charm. The fractions of a second added up as planned, and his new time didn’t only win him the gold – it made him the holder of a world record. In the ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion, a sculptor falls deeply in love with one of his statues, so much so that he prays to the goddess Venus that his statue may be given life. Venus sympathizes, grants the wish and the new couple have a child and live happily ever after. This ancient story highlights what modern psychology refers to as a “self-fulfilling prophecy” – when you have such strong faith in a particular outcome that it indeed does come to pass. Well, the same thing can happen with athletic performance. The expectations players have can greatly influence the outcome of their performance. And one of the best ways to change their expectations is to boost their self-confidence. So how can you improve self-confidence? There are two primary methods: The first is through vicarious experience: when you see someone else successfully make the high jump, it gives you greater confidence that you can do it, too. The other self-confidence boost, which is even more powerful, comes from first hand experience. Let’s say a soccer player has a fear of penalty kicks, chokes every time and kicks the ball over the net. Well, this player might benefit from improving his self-confidence in another way – say, by being given some corner kicks. And then, when he feels more comfortable with high-pressure situations, he’ll have more confidence next time he makes a penalty kick. The legendary Israeli basketball coach Ralph Klein understood the importance of player self-confidence perfectly. In 1992, his team had little in the way of talented players and they were struggling to win. So, in an attempt to boost their self-confidence and expectations, he told them a friendly lie. He told his players that they had the best defense in the entire league. And, soon enough, the team began to play with a new sense of confidence. In fact, they were so eager to meet Klein’s expectations that they began to play far above their talent level and even made it to the championship game that season. 1968 witnessed one of the greatest innovations in sports history. At the Summer Olympics in Mexico, Richard Douglas Fosbury, an Olympic high jumper, forever changed the event by doing something very silly looking. He forewent the traditional technique, known as the frontward straddle roll, and threw himself backward over the bar. This unorthodox approach was met with a fair amount of skepticism, but the results spoke for themselves: Fosbury won gold and his new technique went down in history as the “Fosbury Flop.” Fosbury’s achievement highlights a trend in the world’s great innovations: they tend to come from unexpected places because they’re often somewhat counterintuitive. Luckily, there is a pattern to innovation – one that can be broken down into four steps and put to use by anyone. The first step happens when you encounter a problem. In Fosbury’s case, the problem was that he had trouble using the frontward straddle roll technique, yet he still wanted to be a competitive athlete in his high school’s high jump competitions. The second step happens when you discover an unexpected solution to the problem. Fosbury sought alternatives to the traditional jump, which led first to experimenting with the outdated and inefficient scissor jump technique, which in turn led to Fosbury entertaining the unusual idea of jumping backward over the bar. And though it may have sounded unusual at the time, Fosbury’s experiments with the technique showed great promise. The third step is to refine the idea through repetition. Throughout his high-school years, Fosbury practiced his backward jump over and over again, refining it until he’d perfected the gold medal-winning “Fosbury Flop.” The fourth step is to share the innovative idea for the world to adopt. Fosbury had the best possible place to unveil his invention: the world stage of the Olympics. As a result, it was immediately adopted by the rest of the world. What was once most unusual is now a conventional technique that continues to be used by high jumpers of all nations. When trying to be innovative, one shouldn’t put too much emphasis on rationality, for it’s often the unconventional ideas, thoughts and actions that lead to world-changing creativity. In 2004, Heiner Brand was the coach of the German national men’s handball team. That year, he had an extremely close-knit group of players and won Germany's first gold medal at the European Championship. When asked about the team’s success, Brand was unequivocal: it was a result of the team’s cohesion. So what does cohesion mean, exactly? Well, there are two types of cohesion you should be aware of, and both will increase a team’s success. The first is social cohesion, which is about having healthy relationships and social bonds between your teammates. Brand’s handball team had suffered a good deal of setbacks along the way, including injuries to some of the best players and a bad start to the tournament, but thanks to their strong relationships and social bonds they were able to overcome each stumbling block. Their cohesion meant that they were able to stay emotionally connected and continue to work together through difficult times, as opposed to turning against one another. It’s important to note that there is such a thing as too much social cohesion. A 2014 study at Ryerson University shows that when teams are too closely bonded they can waste time socializing or ostracizing their coach. The second type is known as task cohesion, which is bonding through a shared commitment to reaching a common goal. When a team has a high level of task cohesion, each member is willing to sacrifice their self-interests in favor of the shared goal. This includes making sacrifices and doing whatever it takes to achieve the goal of the team. Task cohesion doesn’t necessarily require social cohesion; even without it, task cohesion can be a hugely beneficial quality. A perfect example is the Bayern Munich soccer team, which won three consecutive European Championships between 1974 and 1976, making them one of the best soccer teams in history. Yet, according to the team’s midfielder, Rainer Zobel, they weren’t that socially cohesive. It would be a stretch to say they were friends. But, when on the field, they were all perfectly united in what they wanted to accomplish. So a good leader will boost his team’s chances to win by uniting them with common goals and facilitating strong personal bonds. Franz Beckenbauer was one of Germany’s greatest soccer players as well as the captain of the German national team during the 1970s. Beckenbauer played the defensive position known as the “attacking sweeper,” but he was also known to go on offensive attacks downfield, leaving his defensive position open for another player to fill. The teammate who would most often fill that vacant position was Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, a very talented player in his own right, and one who didn’t feel insulted when he was referred to as Franz’s “shadow man” in the press. He simply agreed that it was his job to cover for Beckenbauer. This kind of team dynamic shows how success can stem from teammates who know their role and follow a strong hierarchy. For this to work, a team needs its leaders to be clearly defined and distinguished from the followers. If these roles are not clear, and people don’t know where they fit within the team hierarchy, confusion and distraction are sure to follow. This will also likely lead to different leaders emerging and butting heads, causing internal conflict. It’s important to have a clear structure so that everyone knows who the captain is. Fortunately, there are two different hierarchical structures to choose from, depending on which one best suits your team. The first is the traditional vertical structure, which can be thought of as a pyramid, with the leader at the top and layers of followers underneath that descend in rank until you reach the bottom. The structure works best for teams with many players, including big corporations, since the top-down approach is an efficient way of avoiding confusion. This way, each member knows who they should report to. For smaller teams, there’s the more modern approach known as the flat structure. This one has far fewer layers, usually consisting of the leaders at the top, a small group of middle managers and then the rest of the staff. This can work well in creating a sense of camaraderie, where people work side by side, with less of a feeling of there being an us-versus-them relationship between the workers and the management. But this generally only works when there’s a smaller, less complex workforce. With bigger teams, it can result in confusion. Every team, no matter how big or small, needs a strong leader – someone who can guide them through tough times and inspire them to do their best. A great leader is more than just a manager. So what are the precise qualities that make the best leaders? First of all, an effective leader is flexible and able to adapt to the different scenarios that are sure to emerge. This means the leader is always aware of the changing environment and what the team needs at any given moment. A good basketball coach, for example, needs to respond differently to a pre-game huddle than she would to the final timeout at the end of a playoff game. In the last moments of a close game, a good coach will adapt appropriately and give clear and direct instructions for a team to follow. In a high-stress, time-sensitive moment, there’s no room for lengthy explanations, and a good leader will know this. But when you’re leading a team through a regular practice, this is the perfect situation to focus on development and take the time to provide more thorough explanations. Leaders can also be more effective by practicing humility, which is a way of earning respect and trust. For this, you can look to Derek Jeter as a role model. In his career with the New York Yankees, Jeter was one of the best, with an amazing .310 lifetime batting average, 3,400 hits and 358 stolen bases. But even though he played a large role in winning the Yankees three back-to-back World Series titles, he always showed humility and never bragged about his accomplishments. Nor did he speak ill of any other player or put himself above a fellow team member. Jeter’s humble nature not only made him one of the most respected players in the league; it made him a successful team captain for eleven straight years, inspiring loyalty from every teammate. Leadership is also about teaching teammates ways of raising their performance level, which can be effectively done through constant feedback. Positive reinforcement works best, and leaders should always be on the lookout for ways to reward strong effort and performance. Likewise, leaders should avoid punishments and degradation when a team member underperforms. Along the same lines, leaders can look for ways to use failure as a learning opportunity. Michael Jordan is remembered as one of the all-time greatest, but he would point out his own failures, like missing 26 game-winning shots. Acknowledging these misses kept him motivated to keep improving and prevented him from resting on his laurels. Did you ever drift off into a daydream while sitting in a classroom? Most teachers aren’t too happy if students start paying more attention to their imagination than the lesson being given. But consider this: recent studies have shown that a vivid imagination can come in very handy to visualize tasks, make plans and envision future ambitions. Imagination is a key part of visualization, which is recognized as a powerful tool to improve performance and reach your goals. However, for visualization to be effective, you need to make your imagined scenario as detailed as possible. So ask yourself what you want to achieve? Do you want to hit more three-point shots on the basketball court? Or do you want to be more comfortable giving a presentation in front of an audience? Once you have your scenario in mind, you’ll want to envision as many sensory details as possible, so think about the feel of what you’ll be holding and the sounds and smells of what’ll be around you. Now, visualize your scenario and let it play out in real time, as if the task or event were really happening. You’ll find that doing this will actually make it easier to perform the real task when the time comes. Whenever you use visualization, it should have a positive outcome, but your focus should be on the details of the process and the actions that will lead to that successful outcome, not the outcome itself. “Pistol” Pete Maravich, was an NBA basketball player in the 1980s, and he was always focused on the process rather than the outcome. In fact, when Maravich practiced shooting three-pointers, he would look away before the ball reached the hoop. Coaches were perplexed by “Pistol” Pete’s habit of looking away, but he explained that his focus was on the process of making his shot. As long as he had the right technique down, then he did his job and the ball should find the hoop. So when you’re visualizing, remember to focus on your technique, which is something you can control. Once the ball leaves your hand, you’ve done all you can do. The key message in these blinks: The psychological tools and strategies that have been proven effective by generations of elite athletes can also be used by anyone who’s looking to achieve better results in their work. These methods are based on knowing how to set more effective goals while creating the kind of expectations that go hand in hand with healthy self-confidence. These methods also do wonders for managing teams of co-workers, helping them create the kind of cohesion that leads to better results. All of these tools can be learned and developed with practice, just like any other skill. Actionable advice: Create a mental toolbox of relaxation tools. These tools can be used to maintain the ideal levels of stimulation by preventing your stress response from becoming too high. However, since Individuals and the scenarios they encounter are all unique, you need to find the relaxation tools that work best for you. So try different techniques and, through trial and error, discover what suits your needs. You can start by finding a word, thought, image or color that is relaxing and returning to this in times of stress. The practice of deep breathing also tends to work for most people. Got feedback?

A couple of the ingredients are pretty obvious. You’ll need a job you love, for one. A little old-fashioned elbow grease won’t hurt, either. Add a dash of social smarts and topnotch communication skills to the mix and you’re all set. But we’re still missing one key factor – the stimuli that kickstart and support your growth. Think of them as catalysts: the magic people and actions that precipitate success. Whether it’s a boss who encourages you to answer your own questions, or learning why it’s so important to postpone gratification, these are the active ingredients that can accelerate your career without leaving you feeling burned out. The tips and tricks in these blinks are designed for long-term and sustainable success. Start putting them into action today and there’s no telling how far you can go. Along the way, you’ll learn Why fretting about that next promotion is a waste of time; What the fabled race between the tortoise and the hare tells us about timing; and Some telltale signs that your next boss is a good match for you. Today’s business world is a rat race. Getting ahead means moving up the ladder – the higher, the better. That’s the general idea, at least. In reality, careers rarely progress as swiftly or smoothly as we’d like. It’s easy to feel frustrated. So let’s take a fresh look at your relationship with your job. A good way to start is by letting go of the illusion of control. Remember, your career progression isn’t solely up to you. Like a ship sailing its way across the ocean, a typical 40-year career has to make the best of unpredictable headwinds and tailwinds. Sometimes an industry booms and people in that sector with specialized skills are suddenly in high demand. If you’re one of those people, this tailwind will help carry you toward your destination: promotion and a bigger paycheck. At other times, though, headwinds check your progress. Just think of someone who’s been a committed, loyal employee of the same company for years, waiting for an opportunity to get promoted. Then, when her boss finally announces his retirement, management announces a new strategy and the position she worked so hard to reach is eliminated completely! Careers might be unpredictable, but that doesn’t mean you need to let the worry over promotions and raises stress you out. Instead, your best bet is to focus on your own personal growth. That means gaining professional experience, and improving and expanding your skillset. Imagine you’re a baseball batter. If you concentrate on hitting each ball tossed your way as perfectly as possible, there’s a pretty good chance you’ll win the game. Step up to the plate with nothing on your mind but winning the game, though, and you’ll probably be so nervous that you’ll end up missing every time you swing. Careers are just like that. If you take your professional life one swing at a time rather than obsessing over the big picture, you’ll end up excelling. Interviews are often pretty formulaic, so you can usually guess a lot of the questions that’ll come up long before you’ve walked through the door. Top of the list? Experience. Usually, you’ll say you’ve been a manager, a lawyer, an accountant for fifteen years – and the interview moves on. But what do all those years actually tell us about the quality of someone’s experience? Not a lot. Simply doing something doesn’t mean you’re good at it. Think of it this way: if someone asked you how much experience you have sleeping or walking, you’d probably laugh at the question. You do them on autopilot – it doesn’t make sense to talk about them in terms of “experience.” But telling your potential future boss that you have five years’ experience as an HR manager doesn’t so much as raise an eyebrow. The implicit assumption is that you’ve spent that half-decade actively learning and improving your performance. The problem is simple: Take a look around pretty much any office in the world and you’ll instantly disprove that idea. Plenty of people complete their daily tasks without giving them any thought whatsoever. That isn’t real experience!   Experience is the fruit of an active learning process. That process has three stages: practice, reviewing your performance and taking steps to improve in the future. To see how it works, imagine a sales manager called Mr. B. Mr. B’s performance is usually only reviewed in terms of his sales figures. When it comes to gaining experience, though, what really matters is what he’s learning from each unit of time he spends working. So if he’s recently helped hire new staff members, Mr. B should take a moment to look back over the interviews and assess what went well, what went wrong and what could be improved. Then, when he interviews the next candidate, he should work on putting those insights into practice and perfecting his interviewing skills. That also goes for every sales interaction he has with customers. Why? Because actively and critically assessing your performance makes you more mindful of your shortcomings and what you can do to fix them.   What do the most successful people have in common? Here’s one thing: they’ve all contributed to a major company project from its inception to its completion. This is called a learning cycle. Say a company wants to launch a new product. The team has to identify what the new product needs to work, draft a business plan, develop and test prototypes and finally, implement the necessary infrastructure for production, sales and service. Then, at last, they can launch the product. That’s a full learning cycle. But here’s the caveat: simply attending meetings or watching from the sidelines doesn’t teach you anything. If you want to grow, you have to be proactively engaged in all stages of the project. Taking full responsibility for the success or failure of a project gives you a wealth of insights into problem-solving in different settings. That means that it’s a great idea to start looking for opportunities to get involved in these kinds of learning cycles. After all, simply going through the motions during a regular nine-to-five shift isn’t likely to contribute much to your personal growth. As we saw in the last blink, development is all about active learning. So how do you get yourself involved in big projects? Well, first you’ll want to keep your ears to the ground. Listen to what your bosses and colleagues are talking about. If you hear about an exciting new project, speak up and put your name forward. If you don’t catch word of anything, your best bet is to create your own opportunities. You can do that by taking the initiative and spearheading improvements to your workflow. If you’re a factory manager, for example, you might want to look into expanding a certain area of activity. Or, if you’re an IT specialist, you could start developing tools to automate irksome decision-making processes within your company. We all know about the tortoise and the hare. Here’s a new way to think about it: while you obviously want to hit the ground running when you start your career, it’s vital that you don’t peak too soon. Typically, people focus on the first half of their working lives and forget about what comes later. But long-term success is all in the timing – like a marathon runner, you want to hit your stride as you enter the second half of the race.   To see why, let’s take a look at two marketing employees. They’re both hardworking and capable people, and both have done well for themselves. After a decade of experience in their field, both head up marketing departments in decent-sized companies. This is the midpoint of their careers – what happens next is key. The biggest promotion opportunities usually come up at around this point. And that’s where the difference between a tortoise and a hare shows. The former will have conserved his energy, and he’ll be ready to take things to the next level. Chances are, she’s going to make the leap from head of a department to chief marketing officer. The latter, by contrast, will be tiring by this point – she’s pretty much guaranteed to remain in her current position. So how do you make sure you’re setting yourself up for that all-important sprint towards the finish line? You need to learn to avoid instant gratification and keep your eyes on the prize. Imagine a young artist just getting started. She decides to do a five-year apprenticeship with a well-established artist. That kind of experience can be pretty frustrating. Even if you do great work, the person above you gets her name on the final product. It’d be tempting to call it quits and go it alone, right? Sure, but if our budding artist strikes out alone, she’s guaranteed to miss out on foundational skills. And without those, her career will suffer setbacks further down the line. Imagine the following scenario: You’re a young office worker with about five years of experience under your belt. One day, a competing firm reaches out to you. Their old boss has unexpectedly quit and they’re convinced you’re the right person for the job. You’ve just been offered your first senior position – great news, right? Not quite. As we saw in the last blink, there’s a good reason to take things slow when you’re just starting out on your professional journey. Snap up that company’s offer and you might just end up missing out on something vital: the chance to really focus on going deep in your work and improving your skills. Typically, that’s something you’ll only ever really get to do once, in the first half of your career. Let’s look at two frontline company workers, Amit and Vijay, to see how this works. They have entirely different approaches to building their careers: Amit spends years at the same firm while Vijay switches employer and city every year. Now fast forward three years. Who’s in a better position? Well, Vijay’s roaming has given him one advantage: plenty of insights into market conditions in different areas of the country. But Amit has something much more valuable – a bigger skills toolkit. Having spent the previous 36 months with just one company, he’s had the chance to see the results of his work and improve his performance. More importantly, everything Vijay learned is easily replaceable. After all, it’s pretty simple to get the lowdown on market conditions online or through contacts. Amit’s knowledge, by contrast, is much harder to replace. That’s partly because deepening your experience gives you a valuable opportunity to hone one of the most important skills of all – problem solving. When you’re a newbie in a company, it’s easy to spot things people who’ve been there longer than you have missed. These are low-hanging fruits, and picking them gives you lots of easy wins. Hang around a little longer, though, and you’ll be forced to raise your game. Do that long enough and you’ll become a master at solving more tricky issues, and that’s bound to stand you in good stead throughout your career. Our age has become increasingly individualistic. Everyone, the argument goes, is responsible for their own success. That’s not necessarily wrong, but it does leave out something important: virtually everything you pick up along your journey is learned from someone else. More often than not, that person is your superior. That’s why it’s so vital to work with the right bosses. But before we get to how you can seek out the best in the business, let’s take a closer look at the two different kinds of boss you’ll likely encounter during the first half of your career. The first is the results-driven boss, who is all about making sure you’re hitting your targets. Expect to receive plenty of nudges reminding you about deadlines and frequent checks on your progress. Then there’s the second variety of boss. Like the first, they’re committed to getting results. That isn’t their only concern, though – they’re just as interested in your personal growth, too. That makes this type of boss a kind of mentor. Expect them to encourage you to answer your own questions, even when they know the answer, and they’ll likely take an interest in what you’ve learned during projects as well. When you take that into account, it’s pretty easy to see that the second type of boss is much more likely to aide your professional development. Which brings us to the million-dollar question: where do you find them? Well, there are two surefire ways to tell that a company has great leaders. The first is to look at whether it’s hiring the most talented people out there. If a ton of high achievers are flocking to a given firm and, just as importantly, staying there, you can be pretty sure that there are some great bosses pulling the strings behind the scenes. The second approach is more direct: seek out a company insider and ask them to give you the lowdown on the organization’s internal culture and the way it evaluates its employees. If the boss is interested in results and not much else, give the company a pass. If there’s a greater emphasis on self-development and mentoring, congratulations – you might just have found your next employer! Remember how the most successful people all have experience in seeing projects through from start to finish? Well, there’s another thing the author noticed while observing senior executives in major companies: they’re all passionate about challenging hobbies. These aren’t just any old pastimes, however. In fact, they’re usually what the author calls striving sports. These are competitive, individualistic and difficult to truly master – think of running, cycling, swimming or golf. More importantly, they encourage you to focus on yourself. Whether you’re competing in a race or teeing up shots, your aim is always the same: to beat your previous record. That’s a pretty handy skill in the boardroom. After all, putting your company on the path to success in a competitive market is all about surpassing limits and taking things to the next level. Striving sports keep executives in that mindset even when they’re not at their desks. But wait, isn’t a bit of time out a good thing? And don’t executives already have more than enough challenging work? Sure, but here’s the thing to remember: once you reach a senior position, your focus shifts from personal achievements to encouraging an entire team to excel. Take an engineer who’s worked his way up the corporate ladder. At the start of his career, he was tasked with solving practical problems on the ground. But now, he has to concentrate on hiring other engineers and making sure everyone is pulling together to achieve shared goals. That has upsides and downsides. On the one hand, your work has greater purpose once you’re responsible for the whole company’s welfare. On the other hand, it’s easy to end up feeling like your fiercely competitive inner nature doesn’t have an outlet anymore. And that’s where striving sports come in. Think of them as a pressure valve. An executive can let off a bit of steam by, say, running a marathon. Then, when he turns up to work, he’ll have a clear head and be ready to focus on more team-oriented projects. The world is full of leaders. Every nation, region, community, religious group, council and company has one or more leaders. But not all of them are cut from the same cloth. Some are merely obeyed while others inspire intense loyalty. So let’s look at the difference between humdrum leaders and exceptional ones. There are a couple of factors. Let’s start with a leader’s position and message. One way to measure the effectiveness of a leader is by looking at how many followers she has and how much influence she has over them. Generally speaking, the more senior a leader’s position, the more trust she’ll inspire in her followers. That’s why a CEO usually commands more respect than a vice president. That said, winning over followers isn’t simply a matter of sitting behind the right desk – it’s also about the message you’re communicating. Let’s say the CEO of a marketing firm believes that the company should avoid wasting its time on small brands. That stance will partly determine what kind of followers she’ll gain, and how many. After all, it’s a divisive view: some people will agree, and others will regard it as wrongheaded or shortsighted. The most important criterion, however, is morality. Leaders who promote a strong ethical vision and stand up for their values often win the largest followings. Take Mahatma Gandhi, the spiritual leader of India’s struggle for independence from its British colonial masters. Gandhi led by example: his modest life, rejection of materialism, frugality and honesty made him one of the most inspirational political leaders in the country. Gandhi’s strong moral code suggested that he really meant what he said. While other public figures appeared self-interested and untrustworthy, millions of Indians were convinced that Gandhi was the best champion of the cause they believed in – self-rule and a nation of their own. That just goes to show how important it is to develop your own value system before aspiring to become a leader. The key message in these blinks: If you want to build a successful career, your best bet is to learn to think strategically. That starts with reminding yourself that you’re in this for the long haul and taking it slow, especially at the start of your professional journey. That’s when you’ll have the time and opportunity to do things you won’t get many other chances at: honing your skills, becoming a world-beating problem solver and focusing on your personal growth. Once those foundations are in place, you’ll be perfectly set up to hit the afterburners and power through the second half of your career.  Actionable advice: Set and follow your own high ethical standards rather than the group’s. We’ve seen how important it is for people in charge to lead by example. But you don’t have to wait until you’re promoted to a senior position to start setting and living up to your own high moral standards rather than blindly following the crowd. So, say tardiness has become an accepted part of your company’s culture. If you don’t think it’s okay, you have to do something about it. And that’s something you can start doing today. Got feedback?

More than ever, however, networking has become a prerequisite to professional success, whether we are unemployed or not. When done well, networking provides us with a community and keeps us open to developments in the job market. This book will show you how to succeed in and appreciate the networking process, how to build community and how you can connect with others professionally in an enjoyable way. In the following blinks, you will find out: how to connect with someone in 30-seconds, how networking completely changed the author’s life, and how someone transformed a simple networking experience into $25 million. No matter what industry we work in, networking is an essential skill to possess. In fact, in our fast-paced, rapidly changing work environment, we don’t have the luxury of avoiding it! Far from merely an opportunity to collect business cards, networking is about establishing relationships and helping people. For example, author and columnist Arianna Huffington once attended an event at a woman’s home in New York City to talk and discuss the challenges women face in the workplace. After her talk, she gave her private email address to everyone in the room. Doing so enabled her to continue the conversation she had started with all the attendees far beyond the meeting. To be effective networkers, we must be interested in the people we are talking to, not just in seeing what the other person can do for us. In the long term, helping others offers benefits to both our professional and personal lives. Networking is not about the quantity of contacts, but the quality of our relations. It is a skill we need to succeed in life. It acts as a safety net in our evolving work environments and helps us move forward in our jobs. We may not all be natural-born professional networkers, but there are tips and tricks that anyone can learn in order to hone these beneficial skills. These tips include: making sure you have a 30-second elevator speech where you can quickly and easily introduce who you are and what you do; knowing what resources you can use to network (sites such as linkedin.com and job-hunt.org); how to tell your story to really connect with others and how to build your portfolio. Getting a good grasp of these techniques can make your career satisfying and challenging. Networking means crafting relationships, connecting with people, and being part of a greater community. Our jobs may change, but the relationships we cultivate through networking endure over time. Networking is about creating community. For example, after the author left her job of 10 years at Sprint Nextel Corp., rather than wallowing in loneliness, she booked herself meetings every day for nine months in order to connect with new people and companies. By doing so, she created a safety net of contacts. Muller’s networking taught her how to adapt, following the changes in the business world and reacting to them in an appropriate way. Her networking schedule also prevented her from isolation. Introducing herself to 200 people and going to 160 meetings in nine months meant that she had to constantly connect with others. In turn, she was able to build a community where many people could communicate and work with each other. To get the most out of networking, you should treat it like a job: get up early and start planning your meetings. Ideal times to meet up with others are morning coffee, midday lunch, and afternoon coffee. Though some of us have a natural inclination to network, not all of us find it easy. However, by exercising your networking muscles – even if you think you don’t need to – you’ll always be prepared for the day when you could use some help from your contacts. Beyond fostering community and serving as a safety net, networking can even be life-changing. For example, after the author left her job, she succeeded in landing her current job as president of Kauffman’s FastTrac – as a result of her nine months’ of meetings. Where do you see yourself in the next few months? What about in a couple of years? Addressing these questions can make networking more effective because they help you identify your goals. And identifying your goals helps you to step up your networking. When you consider what you want, you should prioritize your long term goals so that the short term goals can get you there. Short term goals can include meeting those who are involved in your field, discussing and receiving ideas from them and asking how you might be able to help them. Long term goals might include cultivating professional and personal relationships with colleagues, getting your dream job or making a positive difference to others within your current job. Taking some time to make the following lists will help you achieve your networking goals: People in your community that you already know People you want to get to know in your community Companies you want to get to know Your “non-negotiables” Your “non-negotiables” list outlines the things that you are not willing to compromise for your new job. This could be, for example, geographical restrictions or how you divide your work and home life. As well as listing your goals, you should also prepare yourself for networking; specifically your mind, your body and your spirit. Your mind’s job is to focus on your end goal, which means doing homework on the person you’re meeting with. Your body’s task is to take charge of your emotions in each meeting. Remember that positivity and cheerfulness are contagious and increase the chances of having a successful meeting! Lastly, your spirit’s responsibility is to focus on long-term goals. Focus on where you see yourself in the future, how you can help the person you are meeting, and the main points you want communicate. So, how do you get the networking ball rolling? The answer is through storytelling, which means sharing anecdotes from your professional experience. Your story should start with an introductory email requesting a meeting. How you introduce yourself here is very important. If you didn’t receive their contact information yourself, mention who gave you their details and how you contacted them. In your email, briefly outline your work experience and close off by stating what you are interested in working on and asking whether the person is available to meet up. In this initial email, avoid sending a résumé. Instead, send it in a follow-up email, when confirming the meeting. When you’re actually in the meeting, your story should be well-crafted, bring your work experience to life and contain the following features: First, you should mention what conflicts you faced in your job. For example, maybe you managed to retain a client who was considering leaving your services. You should also have a hero – you, of course – but mentioning particularly helpful colleagues along the way is also a good idea. To keep your partner interested, there should also be anticipation. After the conflict, you can provide reasons why it was so important. Next, your story should have a peak, that is, tell them how you solved the conflict! After the peak, describe a transformation by telling them how you changed as a result of the conflict. Finally, provide an explanation, where you emphasize how you grew from the experience. Make sure your story is relevant to your listeners and encourage them to reciprocate with their own anecdotes. It’s a good idea to prepare your stories beforehand, write them down, and even practice them in front of the mirror. It’s the fateful day and you're eager to meet the person. So, what are some useful things to keep in mind? The first thing to remember is that your mind and body should be present and calm when communicating with your partner. First impressions are key, so approach your meetings with confidence by offering a firm handshake. Keep in mind the meeting should be an enjoyable event and something you’ve been looking forward to. Make sure you have a process – agree on a time and place that suits you both and come prepared with key points and a main message you want to communicate. Also make sure you research the person before walking into your meeting. Have some questions to ask them, such as: where is your company headed? What responsibilities do you have? How did you join the company? How did your previous work experience support you in this position? Listening is critical! Pay attention to your partner’s responses and how they connect to your professional interests. Listening will help your body and mind stay present and keep the conversation moving smoothly. So how can we control our stress levels? The following tips should help. Use eye contact. Remember to look the person you are speaking with in the eye and avoid looking away when either of you are talking. If you feel your nerves taking over and you find yourself sweating and short of breath, consciously slow down and deepen your breathing. This has a calming and cooling effect. It is important to keep hand movements to a minimum. So if you have nervous hands, focus on eye contact and your hands should follow naturally. You can also keep them folded to minimize their twitchiness! Having control over these reactions will make you appear more comfortable and help you connect with the other person. Your portfolio is the complete picture of how you present yourself to others. Paying attention to every aspect of your portfolio enables you stand out from the crowd. Simply put, a strong portfolio is a must-have networking tool. Your portfolio should include an introduction, business cards, a résumé and your bio. Your introduction should be a 30-second elevator pitch. It is a chance for you to advertise yourself. Use this 30-second time frame in an elevator or while walking between rooms with someone. During this time tell them a short snippet about who you are, your professional history and your goals. Next, you should always have your business cards at the ready. You might even consider having a personal card that states your field of specialization in addition to your standard business card. Your portfolio should also include a résumé. Make sure you keep this relevant and up to date. According to networking guru Eric Morgenstern, a résumé is like a negligee: it should be just revealing enough so as to entice the other party, but not give away everything! Make sure you also have an up-to-date, professional headshot of yourself to attach to your résumé. You’ll also want to be equipped with a professional bio to give to those you meet. Muller recommends having a brief version of about 200 words and a more detailed version of around 500 words. Bear in mind your portfolio should continue to expand, even after the meeting. Be sure to write a follow-up email thanking the other party for their time and, if appropriate, send a thank-you email to the person who referred you. Recap what you learned from the meeting, as recalling details from the first meeting is central to building solid professional relationships. Assembling a portfolio in this way will help you stand out and connect with others both professionally and personally. Aside from scheduling individual meetings, there are also other situations where we can network in a more spontaneous way. It might seem daunting, but it’s a vital part of your networking training. It allows you to step out of your comfort zone and explore your community. Risk-taking involves pushing yourself. By doing so, you will begin to see networking opportunities where you didn’t see them before. The reality is networking doesn’t automatically happen when you schedule your meeting. You should be prepared to turn naturally-occurring situations into a chance to network. Laurel Touby, founder of the networking and job search website Mediabistro, is great at doing that. After college, Laurel moved to New York City to start her career as a writer and after some experience working for magazines, she decided to move on to freelance work. Finding freelancing rather isolating, Laurel started arranging weekly events with one of her freelancing friends, where they could each invite friends to connect with each other and discuss their work. What started as a simple way to meet and connect with new people soon developed into a networking event. Witnessing the success of this, Laurel decided to transform the concept into a job hunting and networking website, where employers could post job vacancies. If the employers were able to find someone, she would earn a commission. Laurel’s idea was so successful that she was able to sell her company for $25 million. The moral of the story? Although not all of us will be able to turn a networking event into a multi-million dollar business, it’s impossible to know the opportunities that may come about from informal meetups, unless we engage in them! Laurel proved to be a highly successful networker precisely because she did not set out to run these meetings with a view to making money, but rather as an opportunity to get to know people. As in all professions, becoming an expert requires effort. To become an excellent networker takes dedication, perseverance, and completing day-to-day practicalities such as meeting with others, being an attentive listener, following up and being ready to give back to others. It’s important to acknowledge that mastering networking is a lifelong task that requires patience and the willingness to put in the time needed. Much like learning a language, you must put in the necessary hours if you want to become fluent. In other words, you must be open to learning at all times and gathering knowledge from your contacts. Reaching out and asking questions is vital as this often results in learning something new. Questions can be either trivial, such as asking what holiday destinations to go to or how to work an aperture on a camera, or more important, such as how you can help someone at a company that you would like to work at. Mastering the networking language isn’t just about talking business with only your own interests in mind. It’s about listening to others and forming a personal connection with them. You must also bear in mind that success and significant pay-offs don’t always happen from networking. Don’t forget that in those nine months before her current job as president at Kauffman FastTrac, Muller attended a total of 160 meetings and met 200 new people. So perseverance is key! Networking is about fostering relationships; like cultivating a garden, it would be absurd to expect instant results. The relationships need time and attention to grow. As a lifelong student and networking practitioner, you should always seek out ways to connect with people and be prepared to never stop learning! The key message in this book: Networking is an essential skill in our ever-changing business world. Knowing how to connect with others and build lasting professional relationships will help you in your professional and personal endeavours. Whether you are looking for a job or simply want to explore more opportunities for growth in your current work, networking will help you achieve your goals.  Actionable advice: Set up networking meetings! Networking isn’t just for people who are looking to change jobs; it helps us to meet new people and expand our professional circle even if we are satisfied in our current job. Make it a point to network and meet with a certain amount of people per week or month. Aim to stay in touch with those people while meeting new people. Steal networking ideas from your social interactions. The next time you’re socializing, take mental note of what makes you and the person you are socializing with feel comfortable, and how you can apply those same methods to your networking interactions. Think of ways you connect with others in non-networking situations that you can apply to your professional networking meetings to make them more effective, memorable, and enjoyable. Got feedback?

Have you spent years finely honing your professional skills? Are you still struggling to turn these awesome assets into a substantial success despite all your hard work?  Creatives might be at the top of their game but they still struggle to make the most of those talents in business. They just don’t have the knowledge to master the tricky and competitive commercial world.  But this is where these blinks come in. They explain, in just a few simple steps, how creatives of any stripe can turn their skillsets into viable and profitable businesses. In these blinks, you’ll discover why every creative should bone up on tax law; why it can help to give someone a portion of your profits; and that nothing is more important than a strong portfolio. So you’ve proved that you’re highly adept at your creative skill. Whether you’re an illustrator, graphic designer, writer or photographer, you’ve now decided to go it alone and work as a freelancer. Of course, there’s a lot to think about. So where should you start? Firstly, creating a strong brand identity will set you apart and help you reach your target audience. Selecting the right company name is hugely important. After all, it’s the first impression potential customers get of your business, and something that will endure as your market grows. Using your own name is common for solo freelancers. This might cause you problems later down the line if you plan to collaborate, or you share a name with an established brand: Pat Starbucks, Freelance Web Designer, for instance, might face some legal issues if they went eponymous! So you must check that the name is not already in use. Ideally, your business name will feel right to you and garner positive reactions from others. For example, when Matt, Jenny and Julia of freelance business Also arrived at their name, it caused them to scream with excitement. They loved it, as it didn’t tie them to a particular niche. The next step is to work on your branding: how will you present your business to the world? Your brand should give a strong impression of your business’s identity. Is it about rustic design or a sleek, polished finish?  Whatever you decide on, always ensure your logo, typeface and business card all carry the same feel. You might even consider hiring a specialist to help create your logo, as the better it is, the more professional you’ll look.  Communication, both visual and verbal, also make a huge difference. The way you advertise, conduct business and interact with clients all contribute to your brand identity. Photographer Thayer Allyson Gowdy recommends having a clear, personal style to inspire the potential clients you want to reach within your target market. A unique brand that reflects your personality will convey a strong message about your business. Once you’ve established your brand, it’s time to show the world what you and your business can do. An impressive portfolio is the most powerful tool available to showcase your talents.  One simple way to ensure your portfolio does its job is by keeping it up-to-date. An artist’s style can change over time, so it’s worth maintaining a portfolio that reflects your current output. This makes client interactions smooth, as prospects will know exactly what it is you specialize in, and they’ll be less likely to ask you to produce work you no longer enjoy. If you left college many years ago, avoid including work you did then, as this suggests you’ve done little of worth since. Professional work you have completed will in any case be more impressive, as it demonstrates that your skills have been utilized by real clients. Your portfolio work should also be relevant. Consider your client’s needs when presenting them with your portfolio. Use it to target what they are likely to want from your service.  You may even opt to create different portfolios for different tastes or directions. A photography company, for example, often has a portfolio for professional portraits and another one for family photos. Then, when you receive an inquiry, you can supply the portfolio that’s perfectly suited to it.  Finally, it goes without saying that your portfolio should be professional. Not only should it include examples of professional work you have done, but the whole appearance of the portfolio should be high spec.  For instance, the portfolio should be the right size: perfect for sitting on the table when you meet your client. Also, it should be clean and protect your work from stains and fingerprints. An up-to-date, relevant and professional portfolio will give you the best chance of gaining business.  Designing a brand and developing a portfolio may, for an artist, be the enjoyable parts of starting a business. However, you need your business head screwed on to guarantee profits. A business plan is not to be overlooked – it’s crucial to success. Though they may seem rather dull, business plans are great for setting your goals and determining your needs. These include financial projections and overheads such as office space. Your plan should also feature a clear mission statement. This is an outline of the values you hold and the goals you wish to achieve. Following it will help you stay on the right course. Be prepared to make financial sacrifices at first. Moonlighting is an option, especially for young freelancers, that can guarantee you income while your business is finding its feet. However, this can be exhausting. Your freelancing should always take priority. Illustrator Andrew Bannecker juggled a job as an art director with freelancing for two years before being confident enough that his illustration work could take over full-time. He had to be strategic and put in long hours to pull this off, however. Like Andrew, you’ll need to be prepared to make personal sacrifices. Often this means being thrifty with your money. You could consider moving to a cheaper area, taking on a roommate, or asking your partner to help contribute more. You’ll also save money if you only buy equipment when you need it, and try bartering when making purchases. What you shouldn’t scrounge on, however, are the legalities that a freelance business requires. You will be liable to pay taxes, insurance, and to abide by a host of rules and regulations.  You may need to apply for a business license, register your company name and service mark, and set up a business bank account. Navigating the bureaucracy calmly a step at a time can save you a lot of time and money in the long run. Now it’s time to make sure you spread the word. There are many effective advertising strategies, but some of the most common are the simplest: business cards, websites and blogs. Business cards should always be carried with you, just in case. Small in size, they are perfect for transferring from your wallet to your potential client’s hand. Remember to keep it short and sweet: your name, contact details and an idea of what you do should suffice to grab a customer’s interest. A website is great for showcasing your talents 24/7 to clients all around the world. To create one, begin by securing a domain name that should also be short and simple. Next, you’ll need to develop a clear and easily navigable layout. Clients want to quickly view what you have to offer without having fancy animations crashing their computer. Agent Lilla Rogers uses artists’ websites when selecting whom to represent. She only has time to stay for two to three clicks, so their sites must impress straight away.  A blog can be an even more personalized way of marketing yourself – and more powerful at tapping into different networks, too.  There is more space on a blog to include what you couldn’t elsewhere, like sketches in progress or photographs that didn’t make the final album. Photographer Matt Armendariz describes his blog Mattbites as a way to share tidbits there was no room for elsewhere: anecdotes and outtakes from photoshoots, for instance. This method of networking can help your company reach out further than was previously imaginable. Animator Ward Jenkins started a blog in 2004 that gathered a large following. One of those followers invited Ward to contribute to the Drawn! blog, which has eight contributing bloggers from across the world. Because of a little blog, Ward’s ideas are now reaching a massive global audience. So it’s going well and you’re getting some interest. With a reputation to build, however, think carefully before taking on jobs. As much as you might like to, you cannot say yes to everyone.  When starting out, approach suitable clients. Your input is likely to make a bigger difference to a smaller company, so don’t approach the big guns straight away. Additionally, when approaching the project, research your client. This will allow you to understand their needs better and see where they might want to head so that you can work with them more effectively. Industrial designer Josh Owen recommends finding personal connections with clients when starting out, by using the network of people you know (or have found through your blog). No matter how you make connections, you should always ensure you and your client are a good match before agreeing to the job. Make sure you understand what they want from you, both in terms of content and timescale. Don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions. If it’s not going to work, turn it down. The alternative is far worse: letting a customer down after committing to the job will reflect badly on you and could affect future business opportunities. Andrew Almeter of Almeter Design only works with those whom he feels are the right fit for his business. He looks for opportunities that will help further his career and says no if he knows he won’t enjoy the job. Almeter points out that politely explaining to the would-be client why he wouldn’t be a good fit could mean that client refers you to someone else, so you won’t necessarily lose out in the long run. Being able to pick and choose is at the core of freelancing, so make the most of it! Whether your client has an office down the road from you, or is based on the other side of the planet, maintaining good communication throughout the job is crucial. So how you do this? Ensure that expectations on both sides are clear from the beginning. When you have established the brief, the estimate and the timescale, ensure that both parties sign a contract. This ensures a professional approach and protects you in the case of potential disputes. If the client initiates the contract, make sure you read the small print! Next, send your client a timeline with deadlines for various stages of completion. If this is tight, ensure they are aware of this and that extra fees will apply as a result. Then start discussing communication with your client. The founders of Also and Thayer Allyson Gowdy both prefer face-to-face communication, at least once during a project. The latter will frequently fly to meet her clients. However, this may be impractical, or your customers may prefer video calling, emails or phone calls.  Either way, do remain open with your client, and stay in touch between deadlines or major meetings with quick messages to reassure them they haven’t left your thoughts. Feedback is a vital aspect of communication. It should be constructive, something that’ll help you sculpt the final piece. Make your feedback process more effective by presenting clients with a few options at each step along the way. By keeping them involved, you’ll be more likely to produce something that they love.  If clients don’t take to a particular option, unearth which elements they prefer, and try to combine them. For example, perhaps they like the typeface of one design and the layout of another. Above all, keep dialogue open. You should feel comfortable explaining your creative process and asking questions to ensure you are meeting clients’ needs. While working hard on your design might be fun and rewarding, you can’t make a success of it if you don’t get out what you put in. So take the time to sit down and work out your finances. Consider how much your talent is worth. To secure the ideal job, you may wish to undercut the competition. This option is probably more appropriate for young freelancers or those starting out: it will help build your portfolio and reputation.  However, if you have more experience, your work should come with a higher price tag, and you shouldn’t be afraid to aim for this. If your skill is particularly specialized or if you know you are far more efficient than others in the market, your work is naturally worth more. Over time, as your experience grows, give yourself a pay rise. Experience is valuable, but demand for your work is likely to increase, as well as your overheads: for instance, you may need more office space if your business grows, or to take on an agent. To ensure you turn this income into a profit, keep a clear list of your expenses. List your outgoings along with the amount they cost. This should include business expenses such as travel, utilities and marketing as well as your personal expenses such as rent, clothing and recreation. Bear in mind the amount of savings you wish to make and the amount you wish to reinvest in the business. Tax can claim 25 to 48 percent of net business income, so make sure you’ve planned for this too. Using the above figures, you can calculate how much income you’ll need to make, and thus your baseline hourly fee.  Working out how much to charge can be a balancing act between how much you need to make, how to ensure you get job offers, and how much you think your talent is worth. Time spent considering this, however, will certainly prove valuable. As your business expands, a talent agent may help you spend less time negotiating contracts or sorting out administration and more time simply being creative.  An agent can help secure work and deal with communications. Agencies can be extremely well-connected and know their regular buyers well. This may lead to you gaining opportunities you may have struggled to find on your own.  Agents will do extensive marketing on your behalf. For instance, the Lilla Rogers Agency present their client with marketing options and attend trade shows such as Surtex to exhibit their work. Not only could an agent approach a client for you, but they can also negotiate contracts and manage ongoing relationships. This can save you having to barter over prices and deal with dreary administration tasks. However, using an agent won’t be to everybody’s taste. Without an agent, you get to keep 100 percent of your profits and don’t give a chunk away to pay their fees. Agents’ commision may range from anywhere between 15 to 50 percent of your payment for each job. Think carefully about whether you feel this sacrifice is worth it.  By approaching potential clients yourself, and by negotiating your own fees, you maintain more control over the project and the way you handle your business. This could potentially foster better relationships with customers, and give you the opportunity to make interactions that align with your brand identity.  Illustrator Nina Chakrabarti has never worked with an agent, despite being approached by some. While she used to hate negotiating her own contracts, once she got used to it she was fully able to enjoy the freedom of working without an agent. With a flourishing career to manage, it might be tempting to continue throwing everything you’ve got at continuing your success. However, this can be all-consuming, so it is important to take a step back and ensure a healthy work/life balance. Be aware of signs you are becoming a workaholic and recognize when to step back. If you are seeing less of your family and friends, or having difficulties switching off at night, you might be letting your business take over too much of your life. To minimize this, keep track of your goals. When buried in your work, you risk focusing too much on the everyday and forgetting the wider picture. Take a step back and re-evaluate your goals: both business and personal.  Why not create a long-term timeline? For example: “after one year I will be submitting my portfolio to a top magazine;” followed by “after 3 years I will employ an assistant so I can take more time off.” This will help you see the bigger picture and remind yourself of your priorities. Creating boundaries between your home and work life will also sustain your creative energy. In most cases, this is as simple as maintaining a physical boundary, separating your office space from living space. If you don’t have a separate workspace to operate from, no problem! Designate a particular room in your house to do your work in.  Time boundaries are also important. Just as if you were working in a conventional job, set yourself working office hours where possible. Take breaks where you indulge in a completely non-work-related activity such as yoga, lunch with friends, or just plain old “me time” – whatever that might mean for you. After the first few years of freelancing, you will have gained plenty of experience and have an idea about whether or not you made the right decision. It’s time to ask yourself some key questions. One of them might even be: Is it time to give up? If things aren’t going well, you may want to consider returning to a full-time job as someone else’s employee. If you aren’t getting what you hoped for from freelancing, be it a healthy salary or more time with your family, it is perfectly reasonable to return to full-time work. Remember: giving up doesn’t make you a failure. When applying for jobs you will have a wealth of experience and skills to draw on, having run your own business. If, however, things are going well, you could be faced with the opposite problem. If you’re constantly busy and demand is high, you may wish to consider expanding. Perhaps it’s time to invest in more office space where you can manage larger operations. You could then consider the mass-market, for instance, producing designs for a national brand. In this case, you will likely also need to take on staff – perhaps an assistant or intern at the very least. If you are prepared to share your brand with someone else, partnering is also an option. Although you will have to sacrifice part of your creation, a partner can bring further connections and customers, as well as allowing you more vacation time. However you define success, it is important to regularly consider whether you are achieving it. Maintaining a sense of perspective and keeping your future options open will ensure you remember what matters most, whether that is within freelancing or beyond it. The key message in this book: By taking a considered approach to branding and business when you balance clients’ needs with your own, you’ll create the perfect conditions for a business that showcases your creative talent. Freelancing is a challenge, but with the right tools and mind-set, you’ll be able to carve out a niche of your own that you love! Actionable advice:  Get your facts straight! Before taking the plunge, quitting your day job and starting to freelance, do your research. Ensure you know the industry you plan to work in, unearth some companies that you might be interested in working with and start to foster a network that you can tap into, perhaps through attending events. Preparation is everything! Such research can be done while you’re still at work full-time, and will give you a head start once you dive into freelancing.

Each and every human being is born with a strong desire to know about the world around her, both out of necessity and curiosity. It should therefore come as no surprise that children between the ages of three and five ask around 300 questions per day! Yet, as we grow older, we reach a point at which we are no longer interested in discovering new things. We run on autopilot, rely on our old assumptions and stop asking questions. And while this might be natural, it’s certainly not desirable. If you want to be successful in your professional and personal life, you have to be curious. Curiosity is absolutely necessary in your studies, career and personal life if you want to be successful in any! In these blinks, you’ll discover why the internet is good for your brain if you’re smart, but will just make you dumber if you’re already dumb; why Andy Warhol liked boring things; and why most of us act as if we already know everything there is to know. A blinking ad on a website, a bizarre circumstance of a murder mystery or an apple falling from the tree: all these pique our curiosity. But why? What do these drastically different things have in common that captures our attention? According to psychologist George Loewenstein, curiosity is a result of information gaps. Put simply, information gaps are missing pieces to a puzzle. When we realize that there is something we don’t know, we then suddenly really want to find out what it is. For instance, if you’re watching a thriller, there might be a murder, i.e., a piece of information. However, you’re missing some crucial information to complete the picture: who committed the murder? This is the information gap, and we continue watching with the hope that this gap will soon be closed. Storytellers of all sorts use the principle of information gaps all the time; in fact, a good story depends on it! They create information gaps, and then close them, only to open yet another, and then another; it’s how they keep us engaged in their stories, feverishly turning page after page. But it’s not the mere absence of information that sparks curiosity. Curiosity can’t exist in a vacuum; we  must first have some knowledge about the subject. The gap exists only between something we already know and something we don’t yet know, but would like to find out. For example, if someone tells you all about the riveting performance he saw at a classical concert, you can’t respond to this information if you know nothing about classical music. Thus, your curiosity remains uncaptured. However, if he then tells you that this music also appeared in your favorite film and that the composer was born in the same city as you, then you might have enough relevant information to become curious. Curiosity is what brought humankind to the moon. Yet it’s also the force that leaves us wasting half our lives scrolling through our newsfeeds on social media. This is because not all curiosities are created equal: Curiosity is divided into two types. The first, diversive curiosity, is little more than a craving for new input, i.e., the desire for more novelty and excitement. On the one hand, it’s what motivates our engagement in a topic in the first place. On the other hand, it can also be impulsive, superficial and difficult to resist. Moreover, at it’s very worst, diversive curiosity becomes aimless, little more than distraction. We’ve all succumbed to this kind of curiosity late at night on the web. Clicking on one really interesting-looking link quickly leads to clicking another, and then another. Eventually, we realize that we’ve spent the past three hours watching cat videos on YouTube, far past our bedtime. This contrasts with epistemic curiosity, which is all about the desire to know something new. This kind of curiosity goes far deeper and takes more work to sustain. It is a conscious choice, requiring self-discipline, effort and focus. All good scientists and artists utilize their epistemic curiosity. Take Charles Darwin, for example, who found a strange barnacle during his journey to South America. This barnacle made him so curious that he dedicated the next eight years of his life to conducting research on this single species, dissecting samples under a microscope. This isn’t to say that you have to choose one kind of curiosity over the other. In fact, to achieve sustainable learning, you have to combine both types: diversive curiosity is a good way to familiarize yourself with basic information about a topic. But you’ll have to supplement it with epistemic curiosity in order to help you dig deeper, gather specialized knowledge and avoid the temptation of distraction. It’s common knowledge that babies and small children are relentlessly curious about nearly everything. They point at things, babble and ask questions and they always want to know “why.” Indeed, we’re all born with an innate desire to know. The instinctual knowledge that there are things we don’t know, but that other people do know, is incredibly powerful. This is the force that makes the inquiring minds of young children relentless: children between the ages of three and five ask around 300 questions per day! So, if every child begins life with the same drive to learn, why do some people maintain inquiring minds while others don’t? It all boils down to their surroundings, particularly during the formative first years of life. Take, for example, the way that babies point at things they’re interested in. When they point at something novel to them, they expect a reaction from those around them. If this curiosity is met with stony silence, then they’re more likely to learn to abandon exploratory inquiry. In fact, studies demonstrate that children whose parents react to their pointing continue the pointing behavior for longer and are better at acquiring language and knowledge later on. Unfortunately, the older we become, the more our curiosity declines until we eventually reach a point at which we no longer feel we need to learn anything: a saturation point. As adults, we have a considerable amount of knowledge that we simply don’t question, yet still heavily informs our actions. This accumulated knowledge is helpful in situations like driving, where we don’t want to expend the energy interpreting the stimuli on the road, such as traffic signs and lights, and where it is simply easier to act automatically. However, our faith in our accumulated knowledge makes us intellectually lazy, causing us to suffer from the overconfidence effect: most of us think that we already know everything. Now that you know a bit more about the nature of curiosity, our next blinks will examine how the internet affects our desire to know. As far as learning is concerned, the internet has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. Depending on how you approach it, the internet enables you to easily learn everything about complex topics, like the theory of relativity, plate tectonics or French history, or you can spend all day looking at cat videos and pointlessly arguing with strangers about them. In truth, the educational potential of the internet has yet to be fully realized. According to a study by The Kaiser Foundation on the media habits of Americans, children now spend an average of ten hours per day on devices, which represents more than a 50-percent increase since 1999. However, the majority of this time is spent on entertainment, not on education. Moreover, internet usage actually widens the gap between those who want to learn and those who don’t. There is a growing cognitive polarization, a division in our society between the curious and the incurious. The internet makes curious minds more curious, while the incurious spend their time on the internet with entertainment, thus further diminishing their interest in learning. There are two circles: a vicious and a virtuous one. Those who already thirst for knowledge realize that there’s so much they still don’t know, which makes them even more curious and eager to know more. The opposite applies to the incurious. This disparity in curiosity will further widen social divisions via the educational system. In schools and universities, students with a higher intellectual curiosity will be more successful, as they have the willingness and capacity to learn more. Willing to explore and finding pleasure in accumulating knowledge, these students will get better grades, better jobs and better pay. It’s easy to blame the internet for how it encourages or hampers the development of our epistemic curiosity. However, the only person that can make you stupid is yourself: epistemic curiosity is a conscious decision, and thus so is ignorance. It’s an undeniable fact that the internet has revolutionized our access to information. Everyone who has an internet connection can learn about even the most obscure things. But it’s also worth asking how this affects our learning, curiosity and creativity. With regards to learning, the mere fact that information is easily and immediately accessible doesn’t mean we are better at accumulating knowledge. This is because the internet spoils us: knowing that the knowledge is always just a click away, we tend to not make the effort to store it in our memory. When we casually Google the information we need and accept the first answer that pops up, that  knowledge isn’t internalized and will soon vanish. In contrast, when we really make an effort to discover something new – for instance, by going all the way to the library to find information – then the knowledge we gain is added to our long-term memory. What’s more, Google answers our questions so precisely that it closes all information gaps. As you’ve already learned, curiosity results from information gaps and unanswered questions. But the internet has all the answers! It has all the information – there is no such thing as an information gap and thus no place for curiosity to take root. Google’s precision also makes it less likely that the user will stumble into unknown fields of knowledge and thus discover new interests. This has considerable effects on our creativity, which is formed by the combination of separate ideas that merge into something new. Creativity relies on the random and unexpected collision of knowledge in order to make novel connections between different areas of knowledge. Creative people and innovators always have a wide knowledge base. Take Steve Jobs, for example, whose interest in many diverse areas such as Eastern philosophy, the Bauhaus art school, business and poetry all culminated into Apple’s innovative projects and success. You’ve learned how technology can make us intellectually lazy. Our final blinks will show you how you can stay curious. How many questions do you ask per day? You could probably stand to ask a few more, as questions are what makes your mind hungry and inquiring. Indeed, every answer is preceded by a question. Asking questions is essential to uncovering the information you need. Unfortunately, it’s not the kind of skill that can be easily passed on: you have to experience the power of good questions firsthand in order to improve. However, we can help people ask more questions by leveraging the fact that question-asking seems to be contagious: several studies have shown that children who were asked more questions by their parents began to ask more questions in return. Class, too, plays an important role in our development. Middle-class children, for instance, ask more curiosity-driven questions that start with “why” or “how,” and ask more questions in general, than working-class children. The difference is observable as early as age two, and these children have a much higher chance of success in their education. As adults, however, the habit of asking questions can fall by the wayside. Sometimes, we fear that asking questions will make us appear stupid, as asking questions is an admission of ignorance. Other times, we’re too busy to be inquisitive, or simply never developed the skills to ask relevant questions. History has shown us, however, that going the convenient route and deliberately choosing ignorance over curiosity can lead to disasters. In fact, this is exactly what happened in the 2008 financial crisis: While bankers traded highly intricate and volatile financial products, they could have easily paused at any time to question the inherent risk in their actions, but they chose not to. They were so busy reaping huge profits from their trades that they failed to learn anything more about them and thus failed to foresee the looming financial meltdown. So, think of question-asking as a valuable skill that can be sharpened with practice, and try not to let it get dull. Knowledge and creativity are often perceived as two opposing poles, where the mere gathering of facts is seen as detrimental to children’s blooming creativity and curiosity. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth! In fact, it’s absolutely necessary to first accumulate a database of knowledge before any creative work can happen. As you’ve already learned, creativity is the product of novel connections between seemingly unrelated thoughts and ideas. Consequently, the more you know, the more connections you can make. Take William Shakespeare, for example. Historians know that he attended a classical school, where he learned all about Greek and Latin as well as the writers and thinkers of these classical cultures, such as Seneca and Cicero. He used this broad and deep knowledge to create plays with a wide variety of themes, set in various locations and at various points in history. Romeo and Juliet, for example, took place in Verona, Italy, far away from Shakespeare’s London home. Curiosity, just like creativity, is fuelled by knowledge and facts: the more you know about a subject, the more you discover how much is still left to uncover, which then leaves you with information gaps that in turn further ignite your curiosity. This is why going to school is often so difficult and frustrating for children when they are young. Many fields, such as history, require context and foundational knowledge in order to be understood. But children have neither the context nor the knowledge, so it’s hard for them to sustain their curiosity. However, it’s not enough to haphazardly learn about everything that you come across. As you’ll learn in the next blink, the ways in which you gather and store your knowledge are also important. There are two different ways in which you accumulate knowledge: you either learn a great deal about a few areas, thus making you a specialist, or you learn a few things in many areas, which makes you a generalist. This distinction roots back to the ancient Greek story of the hedgehog and the fox. The fox has various clever strategies to evade his predators, while the hedgehog has only one tried-and-true trick – he hunkers down and uses his spikes for protection. As the Greek poet Archilochus puts it: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” This distinction is especially relevant to knowledge-based careers, such as software engineering or research science. To achieve success in these fields, in which the line between different areas of knowledge becomes blurred, you have to be both a hedgehog and a fox. On the one hand, you have to learn a massive amount about one or two big things in order to give yourself a knowledge-based advantage over your competitors. On the other hand, as your work becomes more complex, it’s bound to cross over into other disciplines. If you work in the music industry, for instance, then you also need to know about social media. Linguists, too, need a good grasp of data analysis, and football coaches need to know about psychology. In fact, most of humankind’s great thinkers represent both the fox and the hedgehog. Take Charles Darwin, for example: He was a specialist in biology and knew everything there was to know about the life cycles of earthworms. However, he was also interested in other disciplines, and combined seemingly unrelated knowledge, such as the theories of the economist Thomas Malthus regarding the logic of population growth, in a way that eventually enabled him to think outside of the box and lay out his groundbreaking theory of evolution. Since 2010, something strange happens in London each year: young people come together and listen to presentations on topics often considered tremendously uninteresting, such as bus routes, electric hand dryers and the history of supermarket self-checkout machines. It’s called the Boring Conference – and yet, the attendees all seem quite entertained! The Boring Conference is all about the mundane and overlooked phenomena in everyday life. But these things are not intrinsically boring; the Boring Conference shows that our interest in a subject has everything to do with how we approach it. In this way, anything can be interesting. Andy Warhol surely inspired the Boring Conference’s founders. He once famously quipped that he “like[s] boring things,” and proved that boring things can actually be quite remarkable, turning one of the most ubiquitous and unremarkable objects of everyday life, a can of Campbell’s soup, into a world-renowned work of art. If you pay close enough attention, then anything can turn out to be amazingly interesting. When we become bored with something, we tend to fault the thing that bores us. However, the thing is not the problem. We’re the problem. We simply need to find the right perspective. This is what the author Henry James did. On the outside, his life appears quite boring. However, he spent his whole life focused on discovering new interesting things in those ordinary experiences. Many of his novels grew out of boring anecdotes recounted to him by his friends. He would mull over these stories for days, pondering the reasons why people behave the way they do, what they think and what their backgrounds might be. He then transformed these boring anecdotes into vivid fiction now considered to be among the best ever written. In essence, curiosity is a choice. You choose your perspective, and thus you can choose never to be bored again. The key message in this book: Curiosity can be thought of as a cognitive muscle that has to be constantly nurtured and fed with new knowledge in order for it to grow and flourish. If you can master this art, then you’ll have a greater chance at being more fulfilled in your job, at school as well as in your personal life.

Should you prove yourself by demonstrating your power over subordinates? Would you command more respect if you changed your job title? In fact, if you want to become a better leader you’ll need to forget all about status, titles and power plays. Instead, get ready to engage your heart and mind as you go on a journey to discover how the most courageous leaders think, feel and behave. You’ll look at what concepts such as trust, honesty and failure can tell you about daring leadership, and challenge conventional wisdom about how the most successful among us operate. You’ll also discover the impact of your values, emotions and interpersonal relationships on your effectiveness as a leader. Finally, you’ll learn why, in a competitive and hostile working culture, you nonetheless need to let yourselves be vulnerable if you want to get ahead. In these blinks, you’ll discover what skydiving can teach you about leadership skills; why vulnerability leads to innovation; and why bravery and perfectionism don’t mix. What makes you feel vulnerable? The author has posed this question to thousands of individuals over the years, garnering responses that will probably sound familiar. Vulnerability is the first date after your difficult divorce, starting to run your first business or how you feel when you get laid off from work. In fact, vulnerability is a universal human emotion that we feel when we expose ourselves to others and during times of risk or uncertainty. Nonetheless, despite being such a common feeling, there are some damaging myths surrounding vulnerability, particularly that it equals weakness. Experiences that make you feel vulnerable, like losing a job or putting yourself out there emotionally, can bring feelings of anxiety, uncertainty and a desire for self-protection. However, there is not a single piece of empirical data to suggest that vulnerability is associated with weakness. In fact, the opposite is true: acts of courage are impossible without first putting yourself in a vulnerable position. Not convinced? Just consider the question that the author put to a room of special forces military personnel in 2014. After explaining that vulnerability is the emotion that accompanies risk and uncertainty, the author then asked these brave, tough soldiers whether any of them had ever undertaken or witnessed a courageous act that did not require them to feel vulnerable. Unsurprisingly, none of the soldiers could come up with a single example of courageousness in which vulnerability hadn’t come along for the ride. In other words, as soon as the audience focused on their actual experiences of being courageous, the myth of vulnerability and weakness crumbled. And vulnerability isn’t just essential to courage. In fact, it is the cornerstone of human innovation and creativity. Why? Because there is so much uncertainty inherent to the creative process that successful innovation usually requires a healthy dose of failure along the way. On a cultural level, this means that a society that equates vulnerability with weakness is likely to struggle to produce new ideas or fresh perspectives - although some individuals will inevitably go against the grain. As Golden Globe-winning actress and writer Amy Poehler points out, it’s very difficult to let yourself be vulnerable, and those who can are often society’s dreamers, thinkers and creators. Sometimes, the truth hurts. In the early days of starting her own company, the author’s employees asked if they could sit down with her and discuss some concerns they had. Stunned, the author listened as her employees relayed how bad they thought she was at time management and pointed out her habit of setting unrealistic deadlines that they often struggled to meet. Although their criticisms were hard to hear, the author was grateful for her team’s honest feedback. Why? Because she believes that being clear is being kind, and that it’s unkind to be unclear. Indeed, entering into all communication with a spirit of clarity and honesty, both at home and in the workplace, is a simple yet transformative step that all leaders should take. Unfortunately, research has shown that the majority of us sidestep clarity in our daily interactions because we feel it's kinder to do so. But is it really? We may tell ourselves that we feed people half-truths to make them feel good, but often we’re really avoiding honest and confrontational conversations because they make us uncomfortable. Clear communication would be far kinder and more productive in the long run. After all, if you fail to be clear about your expectations for a subordinate simply because doing so is difficult, you’ll likely just end up blaming them for failing to deliver further down the line. One of the most important things the author has learned from years of studying leadership is that leaders need to spend a significant amount of time communicating about their subordinates’ feelings and fears. If they fail to do this, they can expect to spend even more time attempting to manage their workforce’s unproductive and ineffective behavior. Importantly, leaders can solicit clearer feedback from subordinates by really listening to them. Once you ask someone about their true feelings, leave a lot of empty space and drawn-out pauses in the conversation. In other words, try to stop talking. This may feel uncomfortable, but have faith that, when they’re ready, the other person will fill the silences with their true thoughts. When they do begin talking, try not to start mentally formulating a response right away. Instead, concentrate on listening to their concerns. Just remember that they are being kind enough to be clear with you – return the favor by really listening to them. The modern workplace can often feel like a gladiatorial arena – a battle for supremacy that, while not a matter of life and death, still requires bravery and plenty of blood, sweat and tears. During moments of struggle, whether at work or in our personal lives, it’s tempting to throw up our hands and exit the arena. How can we find the strength to keep going? Importantly, when we find ourselves face down in the dirt, it’s our values that motivate us to get back up again and keep daring to give it our all. Our values inform our judgments about what is most important in our lives. The most courageous leaders that the author came across during her research were those who had the most clarity about what their values were. During times of uncertainty and vulnerability, their values were an important support to them, a ‘North Star’ that helped guide them through periods of darkness. They were more willing to take risks, secure in the knowledge that their values would guide them through without compromising their integrity. Knowing what was most important to them was vital to their ability to be daring leaders. So take the time to ask yourself: What are your key values? Making a list of things that are highly important to us might be a straightforward exercise. When we whittle our list down to just two things, though, it really becomes useful. The author, for example, narrowed hers down to the key values of courage and faith. Why two? The author’s research, derived from hundreds of interviews with global executive leaders, has found that most leaders identify ten or more core values. The leaders most willing to experience vulnerability and demonstrate courage, on the other hand, anchored themselves to no more than two. It makes a lot of sense - two values are actionable. But if every single value on the less daring leaders’ long lists is highly important to them, then none are truly driving their behavior. Consequently, their values become a meaningless list of words that make them feel good. To avoid falling into the same trap, we can name our two most important values, let them guide our behavior and hold them close when times get tough. How trustworthy are we, and how many people do we truly trust? Astonishingly, most people report that they themselves are entirely trustworthy, but that they trust only a small number of other colleagues. It seems that most of us have some trust issues to work on. First, though, we need to ask ourselves: What does the concept of trust actually mean? The author’s team of researchers has pinpointed seven separate behaviors that encourage trust, expressed together with the acronym BRAVING. BRAVING can be a useful way to inventory strengths and areas for improvement in working relationships with subordinates. So, what are these behaviors? The B stands for boundaries. This element of trust involves respecting others’ boundaries. If either party is unsure of the other’s boundaries, they ask whether or not something is okay, and the other person feels comfortable enough to say no if it isn’t. The R stands for reliability, or doing what we say we will. In a work context, this translates into being aware of our abilities and limitations so that we don’t end up overpromising and under-delivering on commitments. The A stands for accountability. We take ownership of our mistakes, apologize for them and try our best to make amends. The V stands for vault. We can think of ourselves as a vault of information that other people have shared with us over time. An important aspect of trust is not passing on information that is not ours to pass on. Other people need to trust that we will keep their confidences and also need to see that we are not sharing other’s confidential information with them. The I stands for integrity - choosing courage instead of comfort, and doing what is right rather than what is easy, fun or expedient. It also means practicing the same values that we preach. The N stands for non-judgment, which means people know that they can tell us how they really feel or ask for help without expecting us to judge them for doing so. The G stands for generosity, being consistently generous in our interpretation of the words, actions and intentions of others. People are more likely to trust us if they know we always see the best in others, rather than the worst. Implement these behaviors to become a successful, trustworthy leader. Believe it or not, business leaders could learn a lot from skydivers. Before aspiring skydivers are allowed to hit the skies, they spend numerous training sessions learning how to hit the ground safely by simply jumping off ladders. The lesson for leaders? If you’re going to be brave, then it’s best to prepare yourself for bumpy landings. In other words, you need to learn how to be resilient. Unsurprisingly, things are done differently in business than in skydiving. Leaders and leadership coaches are usually aware of the need for resilience training, but these skills are usually taught only after a failure or crisis has already happened. It’s comparable to teaching newbie skydivers the right way to hit the ground after they’ve already landed, or worse, when they’re already in free-fall. But there is a better way. Research has shown that when it comes to teaching leaders resilience skills, timing is everything. Specifically, teaching them early on as part of a wider training program is more likely to result in them demonstrating courageous behaviors. Why? Quite simply, they are confident in their ability to get back up again if their daring behavior doesn’t pay off. So companies that fail to instill these resilience skills in their workforce are effectively deterring their leaders, both present and future, from bravery. Some organizations may worry that teaching leaders how to fail from the get-go promotes a culture of low expectations. In fact, the opposite is true. For instance, in the author’s own company she makes it a priority to teach failing and resilience skills as part of the onboarding process for new recruits. It’s the company’s way of telling new joiners that bravery is expected, thus failure is also expected once in a while. Interestingly, this emphasis on resilience is nothing new. You may well have seen company slogans urging you to “fall forward” and “fail fast!” But without a resilience skills program to back them up, implemented at an early stage in a leader’s development, these slogans can do more harm than good. Why? Because leaders who fail without the resilience skills to cope quickly find themselves dealing with a double dose of shame – the shame of the initial failure quickly followed by the shame of struggling to pick themselves up again despite all the shouty motivational slogans urging them to learn and move on. Right from childhood, we seek to shield ourselves from vulnerable feelings like disappointment, hurt and diminishment. By building a wall out of our behaviors, emotions and thoughts, we protect ourselves from the big bad world. But to live and lead with courage, as we already know, we must let ourselves be vulnerable. This means letting down our walls and recognizing protective thoughts and behaviors for the defense mechanisms they really are. One of the most pervasive types of self-protection is perfectionism. To become daring leaders, we must rid ourselves of perfectionism. To do so, let’s start by busting some of the myths around this damaging phenomenon. Perhaps the most damaging myth of all is that perfectionism is about self-improvement and striving for excellence. But in fact, perfectionism is really about attempting to win approval. Most perfectionists are raised in environments that praise their exceptional performance, for example in athletics or school. As a result, perfectionists develop a damaging belief system that follows them into their adult lives, anchoring their whole sense of self in accomplishments and brilliant execution. This locks perfectionists into an exhausting behavioral pattern of pleasing people, perfecting efforts, performing for others and proving themselves. People with a healthy drive for success, on the other hand, are much more self-focused and inspired by asking themselves how they can improve. It’s a stark contrast with perfectionists, who ask ‘what might others think of me?’ Significantly, leaders who armor themselves with perfectionism often assume that this way of thinking will bring them success. They couldn’t be more wrong because there is a much darker side to perfectionism, going way beyond the need to please. Disturbingly, research shows that perfectionism is associated with addiction, depression and anxiety. Furthermore, perfectionists are more likely to miss opportunities and experience mental paralysis that keeps them from fully engaging in life. Why? Because their fears of being criticized or not meeting the expectations of others keeps them from entering the messy arena of life, where healthy competition and striving for true greatness occur. To become a daring leader, take off the armor of perfectionism and jump into the fray of life. You might make mistakes in the process, but you’ll gain something valuable in exchange: the courage to succeed and lead. The key message in these blinks: When we open ourselves up to vulnerability, we open ourselves up to courage and creativity. When we let go of our perfectionist tendencies and our fear of failure, we find the bravery to improve ourselves and to have difficult, important conversations with our colleagues. In other words, we need all of our emotions on board if we’re going to become daring leaders.  Actionable advice: Explore your feelings instead of numbing them. Our knee-jerk response when experiencing vulnerability is often to try to make it go away. We usually numb ourselves, with whatever we have at hand - whether it’s alcohol, comfort eating or shopping. But before you dive into that big glass of wine or tub of ice cream, ask yourself: What is it I’m actually feeling, and where has this feeling come from? Once you’ve identified the real problem, you can work out what will bring you real comfort and relief from it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Here’s how it works: you find yourself a well-paid job, get married, have kids and settle down. Soon enough, you realize your time is being swallowed whole by your career and family commitments. Every day has its set pattern and familiar chores – tasks you know so well that you’re basically cruising through them on autopilot. If you’re a high achiever or have an ambitious personality, this can be a killer. After all, you’re at your best when you’re working on exciting new challenges or experimenting with novel ideas. But all your commitments have you on a treadmill – you’re always running but not getting anywhere. By the end of the day, you’re exhausted and ready to collapse on the sofa in front of yet another Netflix series. In the morning, you’ve recharged your batteries just enough to start all over again. So why do so many people end up in this trap? Well, that’s where limiting beliefs come in. If you want to know what those are, just think of all the “should” sentences you’ve told yourself over the years: “I should get a reliable, safe job,” say, or “I should have another child” and “I should put other people’s needs above my own.” These aren’t necessarily bad ideas, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever be happy if you’re pursuing them because you think society expects you to! Then there’s the notion that you can turn a bad situation around, that is, do more of the thing that’s making you miserable. It sounds crazy, but plenty of folks end up doubling down on a job they loathe, believing that the next pay rise or promotion will finally give them the life they’ve always dreamed of. But that rarely works out; if you’re not doing something you’re passionate about, chances are it’s never going to be fulfilling. So how do you get yourself out of this trap? In a word, change. And that’s what we’ll be looking at in the next blink. The worst thing about being stuck in a soul-crushing cycle of predictability is how hard it is to break out of it. In fact, people often only take decisive action when fate forces their hand, for example, when they’re laid off or get sick. So what stops us from making those all-important changes? It’s usually fear that keeps us locked into the status quo. Nothing scares us more than the unknown – as the saying goes, “better the devil you know.” Sure, things might suck right now, but what if they got worse? Then there’s the fact that change can be difficult, even if it’s ultimately for the best. Just think of something as simple as changing your cable provider: even if the present one drives you up the wall, buying, installing and acclimatizing to a new setup is a pain. The other great obstacle that stops us from transforming our lives is the nagging worry that we’ll buckle under the emotional strain that comes with big changes. The problem here, though, is that we fail to understand just how great an emotional burden the status quo is. Change can be painful, but it hurts a whole lot less than staying in a miserable relationship or working at a job you loathe. This leaves us with the million-dollar question: How do you start shaking things up and improving your life? The good news is, it’s simpler than you might think. All it takes are three steps – the author calls them awakening, disrupting and designing. Awakening is all about mindfulness. Taking a step back to observe yourself, and your behavior, allows you to start recognizing the patterns and habits that keep you on that treadmill. And becoming aware of the things that make you unhappy is the first step to changing them. That brings us to disruption. Here you’ll want to experiment with breaking out of negative cycles. Say you overeat – dropping that habit for a bit is a great chance to get in touch with what’s motivating your behavior. Perhaps you overindulge when you’re stressed, or maybe there are other feelings at play. Finally, there’s designing: creating a new, positive routine that helps you live the life you’ve always dreamed of. We’ll be exploring this in greater detail in the following blinks. We’ve seen that fear often holds us back from making changes, but why? After all, we all know that getting fired or losing a partner are possibilities even if we stick with the status quo – some things just aren’t within our control. That suggests that the real obstacle isn’t a rational calculation of possible outcomes, but our inability to imagine and connect with our future selves. Take the work of economist Hal Hershfield at the UCLA School of Management. His research uses MRI scans to look at people’s brain activity when they think about the future. When Hershfield asked subjects to picture themselves three to five years from now, their brains reacted as if they were thinking about a complete stranger. That goes a long way toward explaining why it can be hard getting out of a dead-end job you hate – it’s virtually impossible to picture what another half decade in your current position will do to you! That’s why it’s so important to learn to connect with your future self if you want to make positive changes in the here and now. So, how does that work? A good starting point is visualization. Take it from Chris, one of the author’s clients. Chris was working as a salesman for a company selling medical appliances. He regularly clocked up 12-hour shifts, six days a week. He was miserable, but couldn’t figure out how to improve his situation. The author asked Chris to imagine how he’d feel three years down the line. How motivated would he be? How would his relationships fare? More concretely, what did Chris think he’d look like? As a picture of his future self came into focus, Chris got scared – it wasn’t a pretty sight. And that was the point of the exercise: by visualizing his future self, Chris realized that making changes now would ultimately be a lot less painful than sticking to his current path in life. The result? He quit his job and went out in search of a new vocation! Meditation might just be the most powerful tool there is for improving your life. Why? Well, it’s a key part of the awakening process we’ve already mentioned. In this blink, we’ll take a closer look at how it works. One of the reasons we end up feeling stuck in the present status quo is habit: we’re basically running on autopilot when we going through our daily chores. That’s where meditation comes it. The practice is all about creating a gap between stimulus and response, and learning to observe thoughts dispassionately without immediately reacting to them. Over time, this puts the brakes on automatic behavior. Rather than jumping out of bed when the alarm rings and sleepwalking your way into the office, you’ll find yourself pausing and asking “Is this what I really want to be doing?” And this is the first step toward making those all-important changes. Getting to that point, however, takes time and perseverance. Take it from the author. He first realized that he’d much rather be an inspirational life coach and speaker than a corporate employee while meditating. When that thought initially arose, a habitual response kicked in and he repressed the idea by telling himself he’d never make enough money doing his dream job. After a further six months of regular meditation, the same thought came up again. By this stage, the author had deepened his meditative practices to such an extent that those old money-based fears didn’t have nearly as much power over him as they used to. Rather than dwelling on his anxieties, he focused on the excitement he felt when he contemplated his new career path. The rest is history: the author quit his dreary day job and decided to become a life coach. All it took was some time out to reflect on his life and true desires! Sometimes all you want to do when you’ve had a long day at the office is relax on the sofa with a glass of wine and zone out in front of the TV. While that can be relaxing and fun, it’s often little more than a waste of time. So how do you position yourself to do something more rewarding with those precious after-work evenings and weekends? Well, the key is to disrupt ingrained habits. It’s not about giving up everything you enjoy doing, but rather developing a healthier relationship with things like entertainment or alcohol. So why not challenge yourself to go a hundred days without drinking, or abstaining from TV and Netflix for the next three months? If you’re hopelessly addicted to your smartphone, you could try declaring your home a cell phone-free zone for two weeks. The point of these kinds of commitments is to break away from compulsive behavior, and learn to only do things when you actually want to do them. So, rather than automatically logging into your social media account or heading to the fridge for a beer when you get home, make a mindful choice about what the most rewarding use of your time would be. Taking a break from your habits will make that much easier: by the end of your voluntary abstinence, you’ll be much better placed to compare what you missed about your old habits with what you gained by doing something else. Another great way to positively disrupt your life is to be choosy when it comes to your social circle. We live in an age of unprecedented connectivity. That means we’re always connected, and could theoretically create dozens of new relationships every week. In reality, that’d be a nightmare: just imagine all the effort it’d take to keep them going! It might sound harsh, but your best bet is to select a small number of key relationships that inspire you or are deeply meaningful to you, and then weed out the rest. If you’re just seeing friends out of politeness, but don’t really have anything to say to them, it’s time to move on! High achievers have hundreds of goals, but very little time and extra energy to pursue them all. So what do you do if you want to learn Japanese, tone your abs and get that promotion you’ve been angling for? Well, you’re much more likely to succeed if you focus on one target at a time. Sounds pretty commonsensical, right? But here’s the rub: it’s so obvious a notion that lots of strivers and go-getters end up overlooking it. That’s something the author has seen in his clients time and time again. Ambitious people often pursue multiple projects at the same time, spread themselves too thin and end up feeling frustrated by their lack of progress. That’s hardly surprising – after all, sustaining a commitment is much harder than taking it on in the first place. Just think of relationships. In the early days of a budding romance, spontaneity and going with the flow is all it takes to keep things on track. Maintaining a long-term relationship, by contrast, requires a huge amount of time, dedication and work. So it stands to reason that focusing on one goal at a time is the best strategy if you want to see your projects through to completion. And that’s all about your mentality. Starting with a goal that’s relatively easy to achieve – getting home early one day a week to spend more time with your family, say – will increase your chances of success. That’s important, because you’ll want to reinforce your experience of setting and meeting targets. It’s also important to be clear about why you’re pursuing your goals. If your aim is to lose thirty pounds over the next three months, you’ll need to have an outcome in mind that’ll really keep you motivated. Simply being able to squeeze into a pair of jeans that have become too tight just won’t cut it. Losing weight to give your sex life a boost, by contrast, should keep your motivation levels sky high! The sense that you’re simply drifting through life without really accomplishing anything is a huge source of anxiety. That said, focusing your efforts and actually completing things that matter to you isn’t easy, especially if you’ve got a million other commitments. Luckily, there a couple of tools you can start using today to help you. Let’s start with scorecards. A scorecard is essentially a list of things you want to achieve within a certain timeframe. Simply ticking them off as you work through your targets is a great visualization of your progress, which is bound to inspire you to keep going. Take it from the author. He set himself three targets for a 90-day period: avoid TV, skip dessert and get a full eight hours of sleep each night. As the crosses on his scorecard gradually accumulated, he began to feel more and more confident about his ability to stick to his guns and reach his goals. The best thing about this system is that it helps you put occasional lapses into perspective. Caved in and spent the evening binge-watching a new series on Netflix? Just compare it to all those nights that you didn’t! That’s a great reminder of how well you’re doing, and should strengthen your resolve rather than letting a bad day throw you off course. And here’s another top tip: make your mornings and evenings meaningful by creating rituals that set you up for the day ahead, or prepare you for a full night’s rest. How? Well, start by paying close attention to how you spend these precious hours. If you find that you’re writing e-mails and scrolling through your Facebook feed before you’re even out of bed, why not aim to do something more fulfilling, such as working out? Evenings are just as important – after all, if you’re not getting enough rest, it’s likely to have a massive impact on your physical and mental health. So cut out distractions, and try spending a few minutes meditating and clearing your mind before bedtime. Chances are, you’ll sleep a whole lot better! In 2010, Facebook employees spray-painted one of the company’s core beliefs on the walls of its headquarters: “Done is better than perfect.” That’s an idea all high achievers should take to heart – after all, the desire to do things perfectly all too often gets in the way of getting anything done at all! That’s a bitter pill to swallow if you’re the go-getter type. Chances are, you’re all about 120 percent motivation, inspiration and success at all times. But here’s the thing: that’s just not realistic. There’ll be days when you’ll feel tired, overwhelmed or out of your depth, and simply incapable of knocking it out of the park. That shouldn’t distract you from an important truth, however – even if you’re “only” hitting 75, 50 or even 25 percent of your daily targets, you’re still that much closer to your goal. Say you’ve decided to meditate for 30 minutes twice a day. That’s pretty ambitious, and it’s likely you won’t always manage to find the time to fulfill that ambition. The key is to persevere, and remember not to give up even on those occasional off days. Scaling things back and aiming to get in 20 minutes of meditation each day will allow you to keep your momentum going and achieve your goal, even if it takes a little longer than you initially thought it might. The key is to remember that, in the end, even the smallest steps add up. In fact, if you keep chalking up little victories every day, you’re pretty much guaranteed to reach a tipping point and find yourself achieving your biggest dreams. Think of writing a book. When you first sit down in front of an empty page, it seems like the most daunting thing in the world. But now imagine writing just 500 words a day. That sounds pretty manageable, right? Do that for 90 days and you’ll have produced 45,000 words – that’s a pretty decent size for a first book! Anything is possible when you embrace the right mindset. As we’ve seen in these blinks, that’s often about nothing more than making small tweaks to your outlook. But the most important step on your journey is the first one: the decision to smash the status quo, disrupt your life and start pushing for the things that really matter to you! The key message in these blinks: It’s easy to get stuck in a safe, predictable routine built around a reliable job and a plodding family life. That, however, is a nightmare if you’re a high achiever – what you need are challenges, change and excitement. So what’s stopping you from shaking things up? Well, it’s usually fears about money, status and what society says you should be doing. Learn to face down those anxieties, and the world is your oyster. Luckily, there are plenty of tools you can use to help you do just that. Whether it’s crafting new daily routines, keeping a scorecard to track your achievements or meditating, the hacks in these blinks will help you unlock your hidden potential.  Actionable advice: Finish what you start.  There’s nothing more exciting than throwing yourself into a new project that you love. But the truth is, that feeling will gradually wane: at some point on your journey, you’ll begin to tire and think of giving up. It’s in those moments that you need to remember how you felt at the outset. Reconnecting with that early enthusiasm will remind you that you’re doing something that is deeply meaningful and important to you. So keep going until you achieve that big result – best of all, it’ll give you much more motivation and happiness to sustain you through your next project! Got feedback?

Or maybe you’ve stopped and marveled at the design of your smartphone? If so, then you’ve experienced the bliss of quality design. Now, let’s imagine that you could tinker with and fine-tune your life so that it, too, was perfectly designed. Just as designers solve everyday problems by creating new things, so can you too address the problems in your life by focusing on its design. Designers have tools and training at their disposal to help them in their work, and these blinks aim to give you the tools and training that will allow you to build a life that brings continuous joy. You’ll also find out what the four most important parts of life are and how you balance them; how coherency between your beliefs and what you do will give you a compass for life; and why you want to design several different types of life. If you feel completely content with your personal and professional life, then consider yourself lucky. Most people are unhappy with at least some aspects of their life. For instance, many people worry that they’ve chosen the wrong profession. In a poll of US workers, two-thirds of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction with their job, some of them saying they feel trapped because their diploma is in a field they’d rather not be in. They have a degree in civil engineering, for instance, and feel doomed to pursue a career in this field that they never really enjoyed in the first place. Indeed, around 31 million Americans between the ages of 44 and 70 would choose a different encore career if they could, one that gives them a sense of personal meaning and societal impact, as well as a steady paycheck, but they see no way of getting there. With all these unsatisfied workers, what we need is a new way of designing our lives to meet our needs and desires. A degree shouldn’t limit your options. After all, three-fourths of US college graduates end up in a field that has nothing to do with the subject they majored in. You may have chosen to get a certain degree, but it needn’t determine your future. Whatever your age, background or profession, thinking like a designer and creating a well-designed life can bring you more satisfaction and joy. A well-designed life is one that allows you to be creative, happy and fulfilled. It helps you to avoid feeling stuck and unproductive while providing you with a sense of freedom – freedom to change and grow, in both your personal and professional life – no matter how old you are. Everything around you is designed: your house or apartment, the chair you sit on and the computers and devices you use. So why not design your life, too? If you’re trying to get directions from Google Maps, you need to know more than just the destination; you also need to know your current location. The same is true when you start designing your life. The first step to figuring out your current situation is to assess four critical areas in your life: health, work, play and love. Health includes your emotional, mental and physical health. Work includes both paid and volunteer jobs. Play is any activity done simply for the fun of it. And love applies to partners, children, friends and pets. The goal is to find a healthy balance among all four of these areas, and the precise balance is totally up to you. Someone young will likely give more importance to play, while an elderly person might focus more on health. After you’ve taken stock of these areas, it should become apparent to you if one is being neglected. For example, maybe you’re too focused on work, and it has caused both your health and your love life to suffer? Or maybe you’ve been too immersed in play and have neglected your career aspirations? Once you’ve made this assessment, it’s time to assume a beginner’s mind and start asking the questions a complete novice would. A beginner’s mind is a great perspective to have whenever you’re facing a life-changing decision, such as which career to choose. Let’s say you’re interested in studying marine biology because you love seals. Before you make the decision to start applying to colleges, approach the situation like a beginner and ask yourself basic questions like “What is the life of a marine biologist really like?” and “How much of it really involves seals?” This will help you find the right direction. Maybe you should do some volunteer work on a research vessel to get a better idea of what the day to day is really like? If you approach situations with a beginner’s mind and ask the right questions, you’ll reduce the risk of regretting your choices later down the line. A great many discoveries were made by explorers who had little more than a compass to guide them. When entering the great unknown of your future, you can use a compass as well. In this case, the two guiding poles of your life are your workview and your lifeview. Your workview is your own philosophy on work and what it means to you. Everyone has their own ideas about what “good work” entails and how important money and the societal impact are to their job satisfaction. Your idea of “good work” might be whatever earns enough to pay the bills, so long as you don’t have to work on weekends. Likewise, your lifeview is your philosophy on life, meaning your personal values and perspectives on how it should be lived. This view covers things like how important religion is in your life, how you think society should function and what you consider to be moral and just. Your lifeview might, for instance, place a lot of importance on the environment and lead you to live a self-sustainable life on a farm somewhere. When you start designing your life, reflect on these two areas and write down at least 250 words to accurately describe both. Try not to spend more than half an hour on each description. Now, the goal is to find a coherent balance between the beliefs in your lifeview and the kind of job your workview suggests; if you can manage this balance, your compass will be correctly aligned. Without the right balance, you’re bound to feel discontent and unhappy sooner or later, because you’ve compromised your beliefs, and therefore your integrity. If your lifeview says the planet must be treated with care, then you don’t want to take a job with a corporation that dumps chemicals into the ocean every day, right? And if your workview says that money and prestige are important to you, you need to choose a career that can realistically deliver those. By taking both views into consideration when designing your life, you should be able to stay on course and know when to adjust your route. Now that our compass is set let’s put it to use. With your compass in proper working order, let’s take a closer look at engagement. To live a joyful life, it’s important to know what engages and disengages you. And for this, a Good Time Journal can be an invaluable tool. This is a place to write down your experiences, in both good times and bad, and doing so will help you understand what brings joy to your life. Throughout each day, wherever you are, write down how engaged and focused you feel, also noting if you’re unhappy or bored. Also, jot down what you were doing at the time. One thing to make special note of is when you experience flow, where you become completely immersed in an activity and time seems to fly by. Maybe it happens when you’re researching a legal document or when you’re chopping carrots. Maybe you feel it when you play sports. It depends on you. If you ever emerge from being in the zone and are surprised by how much time has passed, be sure to make note of what you were doing. These moments are a great indicator of your engagement, and you should keep them in mind when designing both your career and your life. Another clue to help you find your way in life are your energy levels. Every day involves both physical and mental work, but some activities take a bigger toll than others. And some activities can even raise your energy levels. Use your Good Time Journal to keep track of which activities drain your energy and which ones help to sustain it. If you feel completely drained after sitting in meetings or doing data entry, but feel energized after pitching products to a potential customer, make a note of it. Understanding how to stay energized and make the most of your day will be useful information for designing your life. In the next blink, we’ll look at what to do when your life has you feeling neither engaged nor energized, just stuck. At one time or another, most of us have felt stuck. Just consider the story of Grant, who was working at a car-rental company. Even though he had recently been offered a promotion, he still loathed having to deal with angry customers and boring contracts. He felt like a mere cog in the corporate machine with nothing to keep him engaged or energized. Like a lot of people who don’t like their jobs, Grant looked to the weekend for engagement. He enjoyed hiking and playing basketball, but these energizing activities couldn’t pay the bills. In college, he’d studied literature, but he’d felt the need to jump at the first decent paying job he found, which is how he got stuck in the car-rental business. Eventually, Grant got unstuck, after he did some mind mapping. Because he knew he enjoyed doing things outdoors, Grant picked “outdoor activities” as his starting point and wrote this in the center of a sheet of paper. He began to free associate and jot down what popped into his head, like “hiking,” “surfing” and “travel.” For each of these, he made secondary associations. For hiking, it was “mountains” and “exploring”; for “travel” he wrote down “Hawaii” and “tropical beach.” Now Grant could start to put these ideas together into a plan. He thought about accepting the promotion the company had offered, but only if he could relocate to another office where he could surf and enjoy the beaches, such as California or Hawaii. This is how mind mapping works. It allows you to open your mind to new ideas that you otherwise might not have thought of. With just a pen and paper you can begin to find your new path.  Most of us have regrets from time to time. If only I’d played that one situation slightly differently, we think, everything would be better today! But the truth is, there’s no single, specific choice that will lead to a perfect life. In fact, there isn’t a single best or perfect way to live a life, period. Throughout your life, you’ll have many options to choose from, even if they aren’t always apparent. This is why it’s important to think ahead and plan, or design, many possible lives for yourself – not just one. Consider the story of Chung: when he graduated from UC Berkeley, he was offered four different internships, three of which were ones he’d hoped to receive. But he hadn’t expected to be in the position to choose among three great opportunities. At first, he felt immense pressure to choose the right path. After all, this would likely influence his choice of graduate degree, his career and the rest of his life. But then it hit him: there’s nothing stopping him from doing all three one after the other – which is exactly what he chose to do. But then came another twist: while doing his first internship, Chung spent a lot of time talking to his friends via Skype. He was so pleased with his decision to do all three internships that he felt motivated to help them with their career choices, too. In the end, he realized he enjoyed this so much that he skipped the other internships and began studying career counseling in grad school. You can do a similar thing by charting three different paths, which the author calls odyssey plans. Life is an odyssey, with a variety of possible routes and circumstances, so it’s wise to give yourself at least three options. But don’t rank them from worst to best. Instead, have an open mind and look at them as three equal, and equally possible, plans. An example of three equal plans could be, for instance, becoming an ecological farmer, journalist or kibbutz volunteer. At the Stanford Graduate School of Education, professor Dan Schwartz and his colleagues have observed that people who have multiple ideas from the get-go as to how to solve a problem are more likely to come up with innovative solutions than people who start out with just one idea. So don’t settle for a single path. Keep an open mind! This way, if your first choice doesn’t work out, you won’t panic about not having a perfectly viable plan B to turn to. The key message in this book: You can be the designer of your own life. First, focus on your current situation, and the balance of work, health, play and love in your life. Then understand your workview and lifeview. Next, do some mind mapping to figure out three solid options of where you want to go. Actionable advice: Stuff keywords into your CV. If you discover that you’re in the wrong line of work and decide to look for a new job, you should be aware that many companies often just automatically scan incoming CVs for certain keywords like a “Phd,” “creative” or “motivated”. Therefore, to ensure that your CV gets to the top of the pile that actual humans look at, you should stuff as many of those keywords into your CV as possible. Look at the job description for guidance as to which ones to include. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But before you make that jump, it’s important to do your research and ensure you know what kind of risks you’re taking. This same philosophy applies to jumping into the world of business as well. If you’re preparing to take a risky business move, it’s important to distinguish between competitive risk and market risk. So what makes something a competitive risk? Well, let’s say you have an idea for a great product and it has tested well in a variety of studies and appears to have the potential for huge success. But, at the same time, you’re pretty sure that similar products are being developed by other companies that are aware of the demand. By going ahead in this scenario you’re taking what’s known as a competitive risk, since you’ll be competing against others. A market risk, on the other hand, is when you have a unique idea for a new product or service but are uncertain about its chances of success. In this scenario you have no idea whether your company will generate revenue, but you are certain that your unusual idea will give you a head start on the competition. While a competitive risk is seen as the safer route, since there’s a known demand for the product, the market risk is usually the best option if you’re looking to disrupt yourself. In fact, studies show that start-up companies fare better when they take a market risk. In 1995, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen conducted a landmark study on the computer industry. He determined that two kinds of disc drive companies had emerged between 1976 and 1993, and they’d either taken a market risk or a competitive risk. Of these companies, it turned out that only six percent of competitive risk companies had reached $100 million in revenue, while 37 percent of the market risk companies had soared past the $100 million mark. Everyone has a special strength that can make them stand out. Even the gentle and seemingly lazy koala has the unique ability to digest poisonous eucalyptus leaves, which no other animal can stomach. To be successful in a highly competitive marketplace, you need to identify and develop your own distinctive strength. To see how you can use your own unique abilities as a business advantage, let’s look at an example from the 2014 film The Hundred Foot Journey. In the movie, an Indian family is forced to flee during political uprisings in Mumbai, India. They seek refuge in Europe and arrive in a small French village where the family acquires a rundown restaurant. The family’s talented son, Hassan, is an expert in Indian cuisine, but the local villagers are suspicious of the new restaurant and not keen to try out the exotic fare. But eventually a French neighbor takes Hassan under his wing and teaches him the art of French cuisine. Now Hassan has the unique power to fuse traditional French flavors with Indian spices, and once he puts this distinctive strength to work, the restaurant ends up becoming a great success.   Hassan’s food also opened an untapped market; likewise, you need to aim your strengths toward some unmet need in society. For example, when Jayne Juvan started at the law firm Roetzel & Andreas in Cleveland, Ohio, she was a young female lawyer in a conservative male world. In order to prove herself, she needed to discover an unmet need in this society. She looked around and saw that very few people were using social media, so Juvan began advertising the firm’s services on Twitter and Facebook and, before long, she was landing major clients. Due to her ability to see the world around her and what was missing from it, her bosses quickly took notice of her strengths and Juvan was made partner of the law firm at the young age of 32. If you’ve ever stared at the thousands of options on Netflix and been unable to pick something to watch, you’re not alone. When it comes to decisions – in life and in business – sometimes limitations can be a good thing. In fact, having a limited amount of money can force companies to get creative.   Real estate manager Nick Jekogian is well aware of this. Early on, when the budget was tight, his business flourished. During this time, employees knew that the company couldn’t afford mistakes, so they put in quality effort and worked hard. Later on, in 2007, the company was a success and the budget was no longer a concern. And this is when the focus was lost and the company ended up in a downturn. Nor is Jekogian’s experience an anomaly. In a 2007 study by Entrepreneur magazine, 72 percent of the most successful new businesses don’t have access to money from private investors or bank loans. And though you may not think it, limited experience in your given field can also lead to success.   Athelia Woolley LeSueur was experienced in the field of international relations, but she had to give up this career due to health issues. That’s when she decided to venture into the unknown world of fashion. LeSueur launched an online clothes shop called Shabby Apple, and her lack of experience actually worked out in her favor. Unfamiliar with the customary practices of hiring representatives and pricey wholesalers, she skipped all these steps and saved herself a lot of money and trouble. These business partners are often unhelpful and not worth the difficult negotiations you have to go through to secure their services. LeSueur forged ahead on her own and today her company is worth $47.5 million. If you’ve spent any time in the business world, you may have met a boss that is surrounded by yes-men and people who don’t dare challenge the head honcho’s ideas. This kind of behavior can be deadly if you’re looking to disrupt yourself. To disrupt, you need to discover new ideas and new people, and this won’t happen if you fall victim to cultural entitlement.   It’s natural for human beings to group together with like-minded people; if those around you share your cultural values and ideas, your own ideas will be understood and appreciated. But this can also lead to a feeling of superiority over other cultures and a sense of entitlement. Research indicates that staying within your own social circle can make you less innovative. The Kellogg School of Management looked at all the scientific papers that were published between the years 1990 and 2000. The papers were deemed either successful or unsuccessful, the criterion for success being how frequently the paper was quoted in other academic papers. They found that the most successful papers were those that used a majority of well-established academic sources as well as a small amount – 10 to 15 percent – of unusual or alternative sources. This means that the most successful authors had searched beyond their recognized circle of academic friends and sought out some unique voices for inspiration. Another pitfall is intellectual entitlement, which can prevent a good leader from paying attention to voices of dissent. This happens when leaders get so convinced of their own intellectual superiority that they don’t feel the need to listen to others. Brooksley Born, who served as chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to the 2008 economic crash, knows what it feels like to be ignored. She repeatedly pointed out the need for regulations in the derivatives market. But the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, and the Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, were too experienced and entitled to listen to her concerns. If you’ve watched Olympic divers, you know how much skill it takes to keep from hitting the water with a tragic belly flop. Well, it takes just as much poise and control to successfully execute one of the dicier moves in business: stepping down. It’s crucial to know when to take a step down in order to achieve success.   Carine Clark figured this out as a senior manager for online products at the software company Novell. After launching a wide-reaching $80-million marketing campaign, she felt she had accomplished everything she’d set out to do, so she decided to step down and start anew. Clark joined Altiris, a small start-up that offered a platform for IT management assets, and her timing couldn’t have been better: A few years later, in 2007, Altiris was acquired by the $6-billion software company Symantec, and Clark was made CEO of the new company. Even if you’re forced to step down against your will, it can still turn out to be a great thing.   In 2009, Clark had to step down after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. This caused her to spend several years out of the business loop, and when she recovered she decided it was time for another fresh start. In 2012, Clark built her own small software company from scratch, which was acquired by MaritzCX in 2015. Again, she was selected to be head of the new company. Carine Clark’s success story shows how important it can be to keep challenging yourself and recognizing when it’s time to start over and try something new. When you look at your situation clearly, you can make the right business decisions, take the right risks and, like Clark, become a respected business leader. It can be frustrating to see other kids breeze through school while you have to struggle just to get a passing grade. But all that hard work can actually give you an advantage.   After all, everyone is going to eventually hit a setback, and it will take hard work to recover. We can see this in the studies done by child specialists Carol Dweck and Claudia Mueller, who explored how different praise can affect our level of resilience. First, they gave a group of fifth graders some easy problems to solve. After they successfully finished, one group was told how smart they were, while the other was praised for its hard work.   Then came the second round. They were all given very difficult problems that no one got right. Finally, in the third round, the children were once again given problems that were easy to solve. In the end, the “smart” children did 25 percent worse in the third round than in the first round, while children who were praised for working hard showed a 25-percent improvement in the third round. This shows us that the wrong kind of encouragement can actually set people up for failure when they hit a roadblock. Children should be taught that, as long as they work hard, it’s okay to fail. In fact, a lot can be learned from failure, which can then be put toward future success. Entrepreneur Nate Quigley wanted to create a Facebook spin-off called FolkStory, which would act as a blog for the whole family. But it never took off. So his team came up with the idea for JustFamily, which would let families collect and share their photos on a cloud service. This also failed. Still, they kept at it, reaching out to target users to find out what would work and finally coming up with Chatbooks, a service that compiles the social media photos and stories of various family members so that it can all be neatly printed out into a book. Unlike the previous ventures, Chatbooks was a huge success. Every so often you come across someone who knew at a very early age what they wanted to be when they grew up. Such stories offer a certain narrative satisfaction – but don’t be frustrated if you’re still searching for your vocation. Most successful people are actually driven by a restless spirit of curiosity. Linda Descano is one such person. She started out as a geology student at Texas University, which got her work as an environmental consultant. This led to legal counseling work and her becoming an expert witness. She then joined Citibank’s legal sector, where she looked at potential environmental risks and provided estimates. Then she became an asset manager before transitioning into the position of being Citigroup’s lifestyle blogger. It should be noted that Descano didn’t plan any of these career moves. Rather, she remained curious and willing to discover new fields of work, and this can-do attitude eventually convinced her employers that she was fully capable of learning any new task. Descano’s story also shows the importance of being flexible and adaptable. In fact, research shows that 70 percent of all successful new companies end up with a different product or strategy than they started out with. Take Millenium Pharmaceuticals, for example. They started out as a biochemical company treating genetic diseases before recognizing that treatments for other diseases, such as cancer, were more important to their target population. Gradually, they branched out into researching and evaluating new drugs and, in May of 2003, Millennium produced a new drug called Velcade, a successful treatment for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood. This was a milestone achievement, and the company was convinced that they should focus on anti-cancer drugs as their main product from now on. So remember, life is full of surprises. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t end up where you thought you would. You might end up doing things you never dreamed of! The key message in this book: You’ve got to be disruptive, both in your professional and in your personal life. Don’t be afraid to challenge received ideas about best practices and savvy strategies. And don’t be afraid to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch! If you’re unsure of what you want to do, figure out what your unique talents are and how they could be used to contribute to society. And remember: don’t forget to learn from your failures and continue to challenge yourself.  Actionable advice: Listen to your inner voice. You probably have an inner hunch as to what would interest you or what your talent might be. But perhaps you think there’s no way you can earn money with it. Don’t think that. Stay with your hunch and think of Susan Cain, a woman who wanted to focus on the value of introverts in society. Is that a good business model? You might not think so, but Susan Cain ended up writing a best-selling book and becoming the CEO of the social media network The Quiet Revolution. Got feedback?

If the answer is yes, then you are in the minority; a 2013 Gallup poll showed that 63 percent of Americans don’t feel “engaged” in their job, and a further 24 percent outright hate them. And yet despite all this disengagement with our work, we don’t seem to do anything about it. How many of us resolve to quit our lame job and launch a more fulfilling career? So few of us do this because, even though we hate our jobs, we fear change even more. But it doesn’t have to be this way. These blinks show you how to transform your life and become someone who, unafraid of change, is always on the lookout for a better, more fulfilling career. In these blinks you’ll discover why your most important skills may be invisible; how changing your career depends on your Career Savings Account; and that starting at the bottom can get you to the top. Do you love Monday mornings? Do you spring from your bed excited to begin yet another amazing week of great work at your fantastic office with your awesome colleagues? It’s not unlikely that your and most other people’s answer to that is a resounding NO.  In fact, up to 70 percent of Americans said they hated their jobs or felt disengaged, according to a Gallup poll in 2013. If you’re one of those people who lives for the weekend, then perhaps it’s time for a Do Over, that is, a complete reorientation of your career. Though change can be frightening, it can also greatly improve our lives. For example, after he began working freelance, the author suddenly had the freedom to live according to his own schedule and to engage in more creative work. It took courage to make that first change – but, clearly, it was worth it. Perhaps you too can imagine the positive changes a Do Over would bring about, and yet, you don’t quite feel brave enough to take the plunge. One way to make things easier on yourself is to build up a Career Savings Account?   So how do you get your Career Savings Account, or CSA, started? Well, your CSA is your abilities – how well you build strong relationships, learn new skills, improve your character and up the hustle you put into your work. It’s a toolkit that will help you during those tough periods of transition in your career. Of course, these transition periods don’t all look the same for everyone. There are, however, four main types of transition, times during which a Do Over is possible. In order to give you a better understanding what skills and tools to put in your CSA, these blinks will explore all four species of transition, starting with that seeming dead end, the career bump.  Sometimes our career comes to what seems like a dead standstill. Perhaps you get laid off. Or perhaps, after graduating college, you spend months fruitlessly searching for work. Such career bumps are difficult to overcome, especially if you’re unsure whom to turn to. So it’s crucial to develop supportive and reliable relationships. That way, you’ll be prepared to cope with a career bump before it happens. Begin by taking stock of those people with whom you already have a relationship. Don’t only count your current coworkers; include people from previous workplaces, too, as well as your friends and acquaintances. What kinds of relationships are these? It’s important to classify these relationships so that you can tell your friends from your foes. Most of us have foes in our life – those people who keep us from achieving our goals. And often they do this in ways we don’t at first recognize. For example, your buddy that keeps you up late in a bar will hamper your productivity. So if some of friends are, in fact, foes, how do you tell the difference? Try asking yourself, “Who do I know that has experience and wisdom to offer about the world of work?” Whoever fits the bill is someone you’ll want to build a strong relationship with. These are your friends – and also, perhaps, your advocates. Our advocates provide insight and help untangle tough decisions by proffering considered advice. Friends, on the other hand, support your decisions, as well as motivate and inspire you with their own career choices. Friends and advocates can help you deal with tough situations now, or they may be of help at some point farther down the track. But remember: friendship is a two-way street! Give back to these people when they need a hand or face a tough period of transition. Keep in touch. And if you do part ways, stay on good terms. By being there for them, you can ensure that they’ll be there for you when you face a career bump of your own. Say you’ve got a stable job. Everything’s going fine, and you’ve got nothing to complain about. Well, except that you’re dissatisfied, and you feel that there’s no way out. When we lose the ability to imagine a better job for ourselves, we’ve hit a career ceiling. There are, however, ways to break through this barrier. How? It’s all about your skills. Ask yourself, “What am I good at?” If you draw a blank after listing just a handful of your abilities, it’s time to think a little harder. You may have a lot of invisible skills – abilities that you may not recognize as strengths, but which are nevertheless incredibly useful. Say you’re good at organizing dinner parties. This quality might not seem like anything special at first, but think about it: it also reflects your general organizational talent. That’s a strength you shouldn’t neglect. Re-evaluating your own skills will give you the attitude boost you need in order to truly envision yourself creating change in your career. But now that you can visualize change, perhaps you’ve spotted a few things missing from the picture. Are there new skills that would benefit you? If so, then don’t wait to go out there and learn them. Not only will they bolster your resume; they might also lead you on new adventures. Consider Brazilian immigrant, Alex Atala, who came to Europe with very little to his name or on his CV. He began working in a restaurant, one of the few places he could get work. But by starting at the bottom, he found himself developing new strengths that ultimately helped him make the decision to open his own restaurant. Atala’s restaurant was voted the 7th best in the S. Pellegrino list of the world’s 50 best restaurants. Atala shows us that it really does pay off to invest in new skills! Perhaps after improving your skills, you decide that you don’t want simply to move up in your industry. Instead, you’d like to create an even bigger change by starting your very own enterprise. You’re looking at a career jump, and in order to make the leap, you’ll need to work on your character. A strong character will give you the ability to build stronger relationships, and to always leave a lasting impression on those you meet. But beware: negative impressions are far worse than no impression at all. Coworkers won’t ever forget them. Just think about that former colleague of yours – remember, the one who always expected the worst outcome? Did you completely forget that she made great cake, too? Negative traits will nullify positive ones every time if you let them. But by working vigilantly to keep our narcissism, dishonesty and pessimism at bay, our positive traits will begin to shine through. So what characteristics should we be building up? The top three are generosity, empathy and presence. Generosity is vital in creating loyalty and trust. Say you’re a boss that’s just received free tickets to a football game. You’d love to go, but you also know your employee would, too. Why not simply pass them on to him, and you can catch the game on TV? It’s a small gesture, but you’ll have guaranteed his loyalty, as well as his support in future ventures.   Empathy, your ability to understand the needs of others and behave accordingly, and presence, your ability to pay attention, will prove especially useful as you begin to handle the new relationships, opportunities and challenges of a career jump. So where should you start? It’s simple. Just put away your phone, look your coworker in the eye and for the first time, truly listen to them when they talk about their family. It might be a bit of a stretch, but imagine this for a moment: Your boss unexpectedly announces that he’s moving to Hawaii. This means that you’ll get his position – your dream job. Right now, you’re in the middle of a fantastic career opportunity. So how can you make sure you grab it? You’ve got to have grit and hustle.   Whatever images the word “grit” brings to mind, within this context it means making the conscious decision to overcome your fear of the unknown, and to work hard to achieve your goals. This means taking questions like, “What if I don’t have what it takes?” or “What if I miss another opportunity?” and throw them out the window. Grit will allow you to ignore self-doubt and become a full-time swing dance instructor (if that’s your heart’s desire), even if you worry that swing dancing is only a fad. With grit in your arsenal, let’s turn to your hustle. In your career, hustle is the desire to reach your goal. It does require some flexibility, though. Remember: you don’t need to be perfect at your job from the outset. But you do need to actively try your best and engage with learning. So simply rigidly holding onto your initial expectations won’t work. Doing that prevents growth. If you want to embrace new opportunities, expect the unexpected, and welcome it when it arrives. Consider this: A decade ago the only way to publish was through publishing houses. Then along came the internet, which opened up completely new avenues for authors to achieve success. Additionally, the level of hustle you’ll need changes in different seasons. Some periods don’t require too much hustle; others will require your hustling harder, such as when you’re preparing for that job interview or cramming for your exams. So keep those seasons in mind, and your hustle won’t let you down! The key message in this book: To deal with any career bumps, jumps, ceilings and opportunities you encounter, just remember the acronym SHINS: find a Supportive network, Hustle for new opportunities, Invest in your character and acquire New Skills.

Tieger, Barbara Barron & Kelly Tieger","summary":"If you’ve ever struggled with a job only to realize that your coworker is doing the same thing with complete ease and a smile on her face, then you’ll realize how your personality can affect your work. The truth is, no two people – not even identical twins – will share a personality. Likewise, what one person finds enjoyable and to be rewarding work the next person might find tedious. It’s also safe to say that it’s much easier to know what you don’t like to do than what you do like to do. Fortunately, knowledge of your personality type can help steer you to work you’ll likely enjoy and away from work you’ll hate. Thanks to research into the likes, dislikes and behavioral traits of people around the world, we have a nuanced idea of different personality types. And while no two people are alike, we share certain commonalities based on preferences for how we interact with the world, take in new information, make decisions and structure our lives. To find out which personality type you have and what kind of work would suit you best, read on. In these blinks, you’ll also learn how the wrong job is like writing with the wrong hand; what separates a Traditionalist from an Idealist; and how you can benefit from having an “encore career.” Do you dread having to drag yourself to work every morning? Does getting through a typical day feel like a monumental struggle that requires every ounce of your effort and leaves you feeling like an empty husk of a human being by 5 p.m.? Then there’s a good chance that your personality just isn’t suited to the job you’re doing. The notion of different personality types isn’t some newfangled gimmick. It’s a tried and true concept that goes back to ancient Greece and was perhaps most influentially refined, in 1921, by the esteemed psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Not long afterward, an industrious American woman, Katherine Briggs, along with her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, developed this concept even further. Following years of research and testing, in the 1940s they developed the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI®), which relies on four preference scales and includes 16 different personality types, which we will go into more detail in later blinks. But how does this history lesson relate to your career? To begin with, personality types highlight the fact that everyone has their own set of preferences for interacting with the world around her. Therefore, your most satisfying career is going to be a job that suits your preferences and specific personality. Working at a job that doesn’t suit your personality type is like trying to write a sentence with the hand you don’t naturally use for writing. Sure, you’ll eventually finish the task, but each letter will likely be an uncomfortable and poorly executed struggle. The truth is, work doesn’t have to be an unpleasant chore. When your job suits your personality, you’ll look forward to doing it and even feel energized by it! Let’s look at two people, Arthur and Julie, who were working as placement counselors at a job recruitment firm, a competitive job that required making dozens of calls a day and getting rejected by most of their targets. Arthur was a talkative, high-energy, thick-skinned person, while Julie was slow-paced, disliked conflict and preferred to focus on the minute details. Since Arthur liked jumping from one conversation to the next and didn’t take rejection personally, he thrived at this job, while it wasn’t long before Julie quit. This just goes to show how critical your personality type is for professional success and fulfilment. So, how do you find out which of the 16 personality types is closest to you? As mentioned in the previous blink, the MBTI® involves four preference scales, essentially asking you to put yourself on a spectrum between two choices. The first scale involves your preference for how you interact with the world and asks you to place yourself on the spectrum between Extraversion (E) and Introversion (I). Extraversion can be described as looking at the world and asking yourself, “How do I affect this?” While Introversion asks the question, “How does this affect me?” A common trait for those who lean toward Extraversion is thinking by talking. For example, extravert students will often raise their hand in class before their answer is fully formed in their mind. If called upon by the teacher, they’ll think aloud and talk their way to a conclusive answer. Introverts, on the other hand, tend to mull their answer over in their head until they reach a firm conclusion. Introverts also tend to be energized by getting to spend some time alone, while extraverts are energized by being with other people. In all of these scales, it should be understood that no one lacks both characteristics entirely, though everyone will lean more in one direction than the other, however significantly or minutely. If you’re unsure which side of the scale you fall on, ask yourself: if I had to spend the rest of my life one way or the other, which would I prefer? The next preference scale is between Sensing (S) and Intuition (N), and this is about how you take in new information. A sensor would be anyone who relies on the five senses of touch, taste, smell, feeling, sight and hearing, and concerns themselves with what can be measured and what is happening in the here and now. While sensors trust personal experience and are good at noticing and remembering, intuitives trust hunches and are good at gaining insight and recognizing the future implications of a present situation. So, while sensors see a situation and are concerned with “what is,” an intuitive will focus on “what could be.” Intuitives place a premium on imagination, and instead of concentrating on the face value of something, they’ll think about how to interpret that information to uncover its underlying meaning. One quick difference between sensors and intuitives is how they put something together. Sensors will look at the pile of parts for their new grill and be drawn toward the instructions, while an intuitive will often start putting it together, well, intuitively. At this point, you have a good idea of whether you’re an extravert or introvert, and more of a sensor or an intuitive. Now, let’s put together the last two aspects of your personality type. The next preference scale is between two styles of decision making: Thinking (T) and Feeling (F). Thinkers are drawn to logic, objectivity and analytical conclusions that don’t factor in personal emotions. Feelers will factor in their personal values and do what they believe is right. So, while a thinker may be criticized for being too impersonal in their choices, an empathetic and compassionate feeler could be deemed over-emotional. When considering on which side you fall, keep in mind that society tends to have a gender bias in conditioning men and women into being thinkers and feelers respectively. So, when deciding which one you truly are, don’t think about what people may expect you to be. A good example is the story of a freshman college student who was caught smoking marijuana in his dorm room. The school rules said that anyone caught smoking would receive a one-semester suspension. However, the freshman did have an outstanding academic record with no prior incidents, and he’d been given a dorm room with two older students who did have a history of troublemaking. Also, the freshman seemed genuinely apologetic and deeply worried about how his parents would react to a suspension. The school’s dean was a thinker and believed that rules were rules, so a suspension was in order. But the assistant in charge of deciding the punishment was a feeler and believed probation was sufficient. In fact, he believed the school had made a mistake by placing the freshman with two troublemakers and felt the suspension could adversely harm an academic career that was just getting started. So, if you feel like the dean was right in suggesting the by-the-book punishment, you’re probably a thinker. But if you agree with taking all external factors into consideration too, you’re more likely a feeler. Now, the final preference scale is between Judging (J) and Perceiving (P), and this reflects how you’d like your life to be structured: strictly or in a loose and spontaneous way. If you like consistent order and hate when things are left unresolved, then you’re probably a judger. But if you like flexibility and prefer to leave your options open for as long as possible, then you’ll fall into the perceiving camp. Think of it this way: Would you rather your business released a newsletter every month, regardless of the circumstances, or would you rather have the flexibility to delay the newsletter whenever you’re unsatisfied with the content? A judger would prefer the unambiguous schedule, and a perceiver would rather stay flexible. Now it’s time to bring all your choices together to find out your personality type. Next to each choice was a letter, so your type should look something like this: INFP for introvert-intuition-feeling-perceiving or ESTJ for extravert-sensor-thinking-judging. Altogether, there are 16 possible types that can help you become more aware of your potential strengths and pitfalls when it comes to finding a satisfying career. For example, ENFJ, or an extraverted-intuitive-feeling-judging person, is usually what you’d call a people-person, as one of their biggest concerns is the well-being of others and forming strong relationships. This makes them well-suited to being leaders, as they also tend to be charismatic and good at negotiating. However, they can also become too involved in drama and get immersed in problems that aren’t worth their time and effort. An ISFP, or an introverted-sensing-feeling-perceiving person, tends to be a patient, caring, gentle and flexible person with little need for power or control. This makes them effective and loyal team players, but it also means they’re susceptible to taking conflict and disputes badly as their indirect way of expressing themselves can often be misunderstood. An INTJ, or an introverted-intuitive-thinking-judging person, can be an ingenious perfectionist with a desire for autonomy and full confidence in his plans and ideas, which can be visionary and insightful. As such, the INTJ tend to be unbothered by criticism and capable of superb focus, energy and determination. However, they can also set expectations too high and be so confident that they miss flaws in their ideas and neglect to get a second opinion. As you can see, each personality type comes with strengths as well as weaknesses. But unfortunately, some cultures tend to promote the outgoing characteristics of the extravert as being somehow better than the inward focus of the introvert. So people assume that extraverts have a greater chance of success, but this is nonsense. The truth is, no one type is going to have an advantage over someone else in life. For example, an ESTP, or extraverted-sensing-thinking-perceiving person, is usually action-oriented and great at negotiating and problem-solving, but they can also be too focused on the here and now and fail to properly plan ahead. An ENTP, on the other hand, tends to excel at planning ahead and thinking strategically, but they can also be too flexible and resistant to commitments. On top of that, they can be so fast-acting that they’ll fail to take in the advice of those around them or fully consider the feelings of others. So don’t succumb to the mistaken belief that one type will give you an advantage over another. Of course, no two people are exactly alike, but in a general sense, those with the same personality type, or even just two or three of the same preferences, can have a lot in common – especially when it comes to work. So, while there are 16 personality types, those who share specific preferences will fall into one of four Temperaments. The first Temperament encompasses traditionalists, who are people with S and J in their personality type. In other words, they are sensing judgers. Some will be extraverts and some introverts, so there will be significant differences among them, but you can think of Temperaments like instrument sections in an orchestra – you’ll find a lot of differences among the instruments in the string section, but there is a fundamental commonality to them as well. A good motto for the traditionalists is, “Early to bed, early to rise,” because they feed off order, stability and conformity. Traditionalists are reliably consistent and will follow through on whatever task they’re given. But they have an inability to change or adapt to a new way of doing things, as well as a tendency to avoid long-term thinking. Given their fondness for order, it’s no surprise that around 50 percent of police officers are traditionalists. In general, this Temperament is well suited to working in strong organizational structures with clear operating procedures, expectations and chains of command. The less confusion, the better. Next up are the experiencers or sensing perceivers, as they’re made up of types that share S and P. The motto for this Temperament could be, “Eat, drink and be merry,” as they’re an adventurous, outgoing and impulsive lot. Experiencers are out to make a difference in the world, and their strengths include courage, resourcefulness, improvisation and a willingness to change, adapt and take chances. They also tend to be good with tools and instruments. As for pitfalls, experiencers can be so impulsive that they cross over into irresponsible or childish behavior. They can also be less than brilliant at recognizing patterns and making connections. It’s no coincidence that experiencers also show up a lot in law enforcement, but for them, it’s the thrilling unpredictability that makes them want to become police officers, firefighters or other emergency responders. They excel at these jobs and others that offer variety, autonomy and unpredictability. Next on the list of Temperaments are the idealists, otherwise known as the intuitive feelers since they share N and F in their personality types. The motto for this group is, “To thine own self be true,” since idealists are all about personal growth, gaining knowledge and finding satisfaction in authenticity and integrity. Idealists are drawn to meaningful work that explores new possibilities and often deals with the philosophical or spiritual aspects of life. The strengths of idealists include being receptive to and accepting of all kinds of people, an ability to bring out the best in others and a knack for coming up with creative solutions. On the downside, they can be moody, over-emotional, poor at handling criticism and being disciplinarians, and of course, too idealistic and insufficiently practical. If you’re an idealist looking for a job, it’s best to stay away from competitive environments and instead find ones that are democratic and harmonious. Idealists tend to find fulfillment in artistic jobs and endeavors that help people, such as teaching, consulting, counseling, human resources and community outreach. Last but not least is the Temperament of conceptualizers or intuitive thinkers who share the N and T preferences. The motto here is “Be excellent in all things,” as conceptualizers are into seeing great possibilities everywhere and being the agents of change to bring about those improvements. The strengths of conceptualizers include planning and designing innovative solutions, being confident and clever and recognizing complex patterns and trends. Among the pitfalls to look out for are arrogance, disregard for authority, being too complex for others to understand and a lack of interest in small details as well as the feelings of others. The ideal job for a conceptualizer will be challenging and intellectually engaging with a good amount of autonomy. They tend to thrive in positions of upper management and in fields like science, technology, medicine, law, or at a university where they’re surrounded by capable colleagues. It’s helpful to recognize that despite the differences between the four Temperaments, they often come together to strike a harmonious balance. Think of what it takes to keep a big organization like a hospital running. The finance department needs a highly organized person like a traditionalist. The marketing and planning department needs a future-minded person like a conceptualizer. Human resources needs an idealist to promote personal development. And the director of operations will likely be an experiencer, someone who’s focused on the here and now and is always ready to put out the next fire. Knowing your personality type is great, but it’s just the start! With every personality type, you’ll find a Dominant Function, or the strongest aspect of your personality, and an Auxiliary Function, as well as a third and fourth function that are less influential in your day-to-day life. It pays to be aware of your Dominant Function because when you’re using this function at work, you’ll find it easy and pleasurable. In other words, it’s like being aware of your natural talent. If your personality type is ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTP or ESFP, you’re a dominant sensor, which means you probably prefer cold, hard facts – the more specific, the better. You’re also likely to have a memory that is the envy of your friends. Dominant sensors often shine when they’re in a position to collect, analyze and put those facts to work. Maybe a research post would be your dream job? If your type is INFJ, INTJ, ENFP or ENTP, you’re a dominant intuitive, so rather than facts, you focus on implications – all the meaning and subtext that is going on behind the facade that other people can’t see past. You’re also likely to have a strong creative streak and will be in your element if you can exercise your imagination or originality. Have you thought about a job in advertising? If you’re an ISFP, INFP, ESFJ or ENFJ, this means you’re a dominant feeler, which suggests you’d do well in a job that reflects your personal values. The common characteristics here are compassion, loyalty and empathy, so satisfaction tends to come from work that is personal and focuses on the human experience – it could be artistic, or it could be as an advocate for customers or people in need. And finally, ISTP, INTP, ESTJ and ENTJ are all dominant thinkers, which means you’re probably great at cutting through the touchy-feely stuff to make strictly logical decisions. You’ll be rewarded in any situation that requires someone to make tough choices, which is why dominant thinkers make great lawyers. Unfortunately, there’s more than one way to end up with an unsatisfying career. Due to expectations placed on you from an early age, you may have been pushed in a direction in which you had no interest. But many people end up going down the wrong path because most traditional educations put us in the position of choosing a career when we’re barely out of our teens. Our skills and abilities are always developing and changing, and to form a well-rounded personality and stay satisfied, we should plan on a career that changes along with us. Let’s look at how that development happens, starting from the beginning. For the first six years of your life, your personality type starts to develop, and between ages six and 12 your Dominant Function comes into focus. If you’re a dominant feeler, you’ll start to show a strong sense of empathy, or if you’re a dominant thinker, an early sign might be to logically talk yourself out of a punishment. From age 12 to 25, your Auxiliary Function, or secondary skill, will become clearer. If you’re an ISTJ or ESTP, this means you’d be a dominant sensor and an auxiliary thinker, so you’d start to notice that you’re not only great at gathering and analyzing info, but you’re also pretty good at making decisions. During this time, your third and fourth functions will emerge as well, though they may not be as readily apparent yet. Between ages 25 to 50, your third function, or third strongest skill or interest, will truly develop. This often takes place after your fortieth birthday and can coincide with the standard midlife crisis – when you feel a strong desire to change careers. After all, if you’ve spent 20 years focusing on the same skill or interest, it’s natural to feel the desire to shift priorities. You want to devote some time to that other interest, whether it’s your auxiliary, third or even fourth function, which often develops after age fifty. For example, Marty was an ISFP, which made him a dominant feeler and an auxiliary sensor, with a third function of intuition and a fourth function of thinking. Sensors tend to take things at face value, but after his thirty-eighth birthday, Marty’s third function started to become more appealing, and he began to question the underlying meaning of things more often. At whatever age this shift in interests happens, it doesn’t always lead to a career change – it can often lead to forming a new hobby – but it’s wise to be aware of these changes and understand why they’re happening. The perfect career path is one that brings together two things: what you’re good at and what you’re interested in. And the only way to combine your strengths with your values and interests is to have the kind of self-awareness that comes with knowing your personality type and everything that goes with it. Of course, there’s little chance someone’s just going to suddenly email you to offer a dream job. Instead, you’ll need to do what can feel like a job in itself: a job hunt. Here, an effective search brings together everything you can gain from knowing your personality type. The first step is, of course, to know your specific four-letter personality type, which comes with your potential strengths and weaknesses, as well as your four main functions and a list of jobs with the potential to be a perfect fit. The next step is to take this information and consider what’s most important to you. If you’re an ENFP, that’s extroverted, intuitive, feeling and perceiving, you’ll likely want challenging, varied work that allows you to meet new people, learn new skills and get rewarded for your imagination. Now, when you can bring that together with your interests, you might look to the recommended creative jobs and see that journalist, art director and costume designer are just a few of the suggestions. Or maybe your interests guide you more toward marketing jobs like public relations specialist or market research analyst. If education or counseling is more your thing, you’ll find suggestions like rehabilitation counselor, special education teacher, social worker or anthropologist. It’s your job to rank the ones that sound best to you and keep a strong focus on your top five. You might ask yourself: If money wasn’t an issue, which jobs would I be happy to do for free? When you have your list, the next step is to write down all the ways in which your skills and strengths would be put to use in these jobs. This way, you’ll be prepared to explain why you’re a good candidate. You can also list past examples of effectively utilizing those strengths and skills, along with instances where pitfalls came into play, to show your potential employer that you’re also knowledgeable of your weaker points. Next, do some research on your potential job. Find someone who currently does it and see if he can tell you what the job is really like. Sometimes you’ll find that what you thought was your dream job may not be so appealing after all. As health care costs and life expectancy rates rise, older people are increasingly hanging on to their careers for longer periods of time. In fact, 40 percent of Americans are planning to “work until they drop.” Whether you want to keep working past retirement age or are just looking for a fresh start, it’s never too late to find new work that better suits your personality. When you start a new career late in life, you can call it an encore career, and many Baby Boomers born between 1946 and 1964 are expected to have one. If this sounds like you, gaining an awareness of your personality type and Dominant Function are sure to help make your encore career your best one yet! No matter your age, a change in career can bring a breath of fresh air to your life when you start doing what you’re meant to be doing. For example, Jay was a Traditionalist who studied government in college and then spent time as a journalist and PR consultant early on in his career. He got his MBA while working as a financial analyst but then ended up joining the family business, which involved the manufacturing of industrial sewing machine parts. Jay became the company president but wasn’t too happy about it. While working for the family business, Jay started coaching sports on the side, and he enjoyed it so much that, at 46, he decided to start a teaching career. Jay now teaches social studies and history to high-school students, and though the change came with some challenges, he wishes he’d done it sooner. Being an ISTJ means Jay is a dominant sensor, so it’s no wonder he likes teaching history since it’s filled with facts and details that he can share with his students. Traditionalists like Jay also want to believe in the mission of what they’re doing and see clear results of their effort. So after years adrift in the business world, Jay is now in his element, where he can see the benefit of his efforts in his students every day. So whether you’re headed to college or facing retirement age, you can gain from knowing more about your personality. The key message in these blinks: Knowing the secrets of your personality type can greatly improve your working life. When you understand your personality type, you’ll become better acquainted with your strengths and weaknesses. This will allow you to make sure you’re using your primary or Dominant Function at work. When you’re doing this, your job will become easier and more enjoyable. Actionable advice: Get to know your educational and training options. The internet brings access to job training and continued education right to your fingertips. Discovering the secrets of your personality type can also reveal that you need some training to better qualify for one of your ideal jobs. So check out the websites of the schools and training programs around you to see what they offer. Furthermore, many online schools now offer accredited programs in a wide variety of subjects.

Most of us find ourselves in that position far more often than we would like. When it comes to bringing our creativity to life, it can be almost impossible to get out of these ruts. So, what exactly is this inner resistance that stops us from achieving our goals, and where does it come from? These blinks offer the help you need to identify the causes of resistance and how it stops you from taking action. Explore various techniques to overcome resistance and get back on track, so you can finally make your dreams, ambitions and goals a reality. In these blinks, you’ll learn how aviator Charles Lindbergh was helped by his ignorance and arrogance; why your enemy in the struggle to get things done might be you; and why author Michael Crichton slept in hotels to save his marriage. Certain things help you move toward your goals, while others get in the way. Good music might motivate you to work out, for example, while your favorite television show might make you want to stay home. These are the allies and enemies in your life.  Ambition and self-awareness are the real keys to achieving any goal, but they’re always under threat by a common enemy: resistance.  Resistance manifests itself in a number of ways. When you’re working on something meaningful that you have real passion for, but find yourself bogged down by self-criticism and doubt, that’s resistance setting in.  Any activity that requires a lot of energy and time can draw resistance. Actually, the more important an activity is to you, the more you’ll have to fight the resistance that acts against it.  Acting was so important to Henry Fonda, for instance, that he would throw up every time before he went on stage – even when he was 75 and already one of the most famous actors in the world! Passion and dedication are strong allies, but they aren’t the only ones. Traits that we tend to perceive as negative – like ignorance and stubbornness – can be allies too, especially for artists and entrepreneurs. Such “negative” characteristics helped famous American aviator Charles Lindbergh accomplish extraordinary feats. He had no idea how difficult it would be to fly for 33 hours straight, but his ignorance and stubbornness, along with his arrogance, made him believe he could do it.  And he succeeded: Lindbergh was the first person in history to be in New York on one day and Paris the next.  Stubbornness also helps you stay dedicated to your work, especially in difficult times. Steve Jobs was notorious for being stubborn, and this was instrumental while guiding his company, Apple, from its modest beginnings to becoming one of the most successful technology companies in the world. Have you ever had a great idea, but failed to put it into practice because you spent so much time preparing for it? If so, you aren’t alone.  Let’s look at some strategies for avoiding this counterproductive habit.  Excessive preparation and overthinking prevent you from getting things done, so learn to resist them. Working is like meditation – you have to get into a mental state where you can assess your own thoughts and feelings objectively. If you start to feel self-doubt, learn to ignore it – that doubt is a form of resistance.  It’s better to act first and reflect on it later, especially when you’re starting a new project. Start focusing on doing work, not thinking about it.  So if you’re a writer, for example, action means putting words on the page, while reflection means evaluating what you’ve written the next day. Don’t try to do these two things at the same time; instead, create productive schedules and structures for yourself. One useful structure to apply is the three-act structure. In the three-act structure, you divide your idea into its beginning, middle and end. This basic structure can even be applied to the creation of the social media site Facebook. In the beginning, Facebook was a digital meeting space where anyone could create their own page. Its middle act was that each person could decide who is allowed to access the page, creating an interconnected web of contacts. Now, in its end phase, people can communicate and share anything they want through a worldwide community of friends.  So, when you’re ready to take on a big project, stop and ask yourself some basic questions. What is this project about? What is its theme? What’s missing? It’s normal to hit a block now and then when you’re working on something creative. Most of us lose confidence when this happens, but there are ways to overcome creative blocks.  When you hit a wall, stay calm and remember that it’s always possible to get past it. Recognize that there’s an enemy force that’s actively working against you and your dreams.  This enemy isn’t hidden within your boss, your children or your spouse – it’s inside you. It’s in your head and only you can defeat it, so don’t place blame on the outside world.  But remember that just because this enemy is inside you, it doesn’t mean that it is you. You haven’t done anything wrong yourself; it’s just resistance trying to block your true creative self.  You are a knight and your resistance is the dragon. To overcome this fierce and persistent creature, find your love for your work, and for what you have already created. When resistance appears, it forces you to ask two questions of yourself; only one answer to each of these will allow you to go on with your personal pursuit.  The first question is, how badly do you want this? If your answer is that you’re just in it for the money, fame or power, you simply won’t succeed. You must be completely committed to pushing yourself toward your goal, which is why the only answer to this question that will allow you to push on is “totally committed.”  The second question is, why do you want this? It’s alright if you want something just for the fun or beauty of it, but your answer should include something along the lines of, “because I have no choice.” Only this kind of profound dedication and determination will push you to do what you really want. At some point in your career, you’re almost certainly going to face the Big Crash, a major obstacle you have to overcome. Perhaps your computer suddenly crashes and takes your unfinished novel with it, or maybe a major problem in your personal life pushes you off track.  You can’t predict when a Big Crash will hit, but when it does, remember: it’s just another problem, and you can get through it.  Crashes can be extremely difficult and demanding, but they can be of benefit to you in the long run. A crash forces you to figure out what is and isn’t working in your project.  The author experienced this after he finished his book, The Profession, which had taken him two years to write. He gave it to his friends to read and, to his surprise, they hated it.  After several long conversations with colleagues, he was able to improve the book – but only after another year of hard work.  You may also experience a crash when you advance to a higher level in your work or creative pursuits, and realize that you’re about to cross a threshold. Much like a child taking his first steps away from his mother, each new attempt to do so will bring the courage to go further.  Like new advances, the fear of success is also a sort of crash. In fact, it lies at the very core of resistance itself – the fear of success is an enemy you will have to face.  But resistance is often strongest when you’re about to finish a project and have to push through it. Take bestselling author Michael Crichton as an example: whenever he was about to finish a novel, he would wake up earlier and earlier each morning to keep his creative momentum going, working around the clock until he was finished.  Sometimes he would even stay in a hotel because his increasingly erratic routine would drive his wife mad! The good news about overcoming struggles like this is that the more problems you overcome, the easier they’ll be to overcome in the future. Crashes ultimately help us become wiser and stronger. The key message in this book: Often we stop dead in our tracks just when we’re about to start achieving real success. Instead of just going for it, we can overthink our actions. Take the time you need to identify your enemies and allies along the path to your goal, and stay focused. Remember that challenges are just an opportunity to grow stronger; you can defeat resistance if you remain completely dedicated.  Actionable advice: Don’t let fear overcome you. Fear kills passion. When you feel the urge to abandon your work, take a step back and try to quiet the chattering in your mind. Focus on the joy and satisfaction your work brings you, rather than on the fear of failure. Conquering this fear is a major step toward always working with passion.  Suggested further reading: The War of Art by Steven Pressfield In The War of Art, author Steven Pressfield helps you identify your inner creative battles against fear and self-doubt and offers advice on how to win those battles. An inspirational book for anyone who’s had trouble realizing their passion, it offers an examination of those negative forces that keep you from realizing your dreams, and shows how you can defeat your fears to achieve your creative goals.

Every day they sit in cubicles or stand behind counters feeling increasingly frustrated, but don’t know what to do about it. This sad state of affairs arises from the simple fact that they’re not following their own dream, but instead working for someone else’s. If you find yourself in this situation, these blinks will show you how to overcome your fears, so you can break free of your job and pursue your own dreams. You’ll find out how to take this massive-sounding endeavor and break it into small, manageable steps that will lead you to where you really want to be. Little by little, you can make this year the one where you finally begin to achieve your dreams. You’ll also discover why it’s actually a good thing that you’re frustrated at your current job; how anyone can get to personally meet dozens of world leaders; and what being shot at and starting your own business have in common. Do you dislike your job? If so, you’re not alone: studies have shown that a whopping 66 percent of working Americans can’t stand what they do for a living. But why is this? Most of the frustration you, as an employee, experience stems from the fact that you’re working to make someone else’s dream come true, not your own. Your job is not meant to be fulfilling or satisfying; your employer has probably designed it so it’s just bearable enough that you won’t quit. Luckily, this sense of frustration can have a positive outcome. For one, it can help you understand and articulate the problems you face so you can better address them: when you complain to a friend about your job, you may find that you’re actually listing all the issues very clearly. What’s more, frustration can also push you to improve your situation. It’s an energy source that can fuel your efforts to make a change. Finally, the frustration you feel now will also help you stick to the changes you make later, as it will help quell any doubts you have. Let’s say you decide to quit your IT job and go back to school to study medicine. Undoubtedly, at some stage you’ll begin to have second thoughts: “Was this the right move?” “Should I quit?” This is inevitable, and when it happens, you can think back to the frustration you felt at your old job. This will strengthen your resolve and help you stay the course. So now the question is, what kind of change is the right one for you? Quite simply, you need to stop following other people’s dreams and start pursuing your own. Take your own dream and your own ideas, and start a business around them. If so many Americans hate their jobs, you might be wondering why more of them don’t quit and start their own business. For many, there is only one thing stopping them: fear of failure. If you’re afraid of failure, then the idea of following your dream and starting your own business will no doubt terrify you. In this light, a regular job where you simply work for someone else’s dream might seem relatively attractive. But what are you actually afraid of here? What’s the worst that can happen? If your business fails, your standard of living will take a hit: you may have to skimp on things like cable TV and eating out for a while. But you can definitely bounce back from this temporary setback, so this fear is unfounded. Instead, what you should really fear and avoid at all costs is insignificance. If you play it safe by ignoring your own dream, you’ll end up leading a life devoid of significance – a truly horrifying thought. You must embrace this fear of insignificance, and let it be the force that drives you to start your own enterprise. Another simple antidote for the fear of failure is experience. When you first take the leap to pursue your dream, you’ll no doubt fret constantly about the risk you’re taking. But very soon you’ll start acclimatizing to it. One Los Angeles-based security company manager trains his bodyguards by shooting at them. The normal human reaction to such a stressful event is to freak out completely, but the bodyguards need to remain calm even when under fire. At first, the trainees panic just like everyone else, but after about ten shots, they have acclimatized to the high-risk scenario and remain collected. Similarly, you too will acclimatize to the high risk of following your dreams. Let’s say you’re ready to quit your job and start following your dream. But what if you don’t know what your dream is? Many people struggle with this dilemma, but you can unravel it by turning back the clock. One starting place could be your childhood, because in many ways you were freer then than you are now. As adults, our desires and choices are largely dictated by the expectations of society. For instance, these days it has become a near-universal goal to become rich, famous and successful. But what if these goals have nothing to do with your dream? In contrast, as a child you probably didn’t care about what society expected of you. You simply did whatever you wanted. If you wanted to become an astronaut, you probably didn’t worry about the cost of the endeavor or whether your insurance policy would cover it. Instead, you simply did everything you could to get into NASA: learning about the universe, building model rockets and attending space camp. By looking back on your childhood dreams in this way, you can find inspiration for your dream as an adult. Once you’ve found a dream you’re passionate about, tweak it so that it matches your gifts. Maybe your space career came to a halt because you didn’t shine at science in high school, but that didn’t mean you had to abandon it altogether. Naturally, you should be passionate about your dream – so much so that you’d gladly pursue it for free, without any compensation. Let’s say you’re passionate about music. This means you probably gladly spend hours listening to albums, going to concerts and reading interviews with your favorite artists. What’s more, you’ll pay for the pleasure of doing this! But just because you’re passionate about music doesn’t mean you should necessarily become a musician yourself, because your gifts may not be suited for this. If you have no singing talent, you probably shouldn’t try to become a singer, but perhaps a producer, concert organizer or music teacher. These are the dreams where your passion and gifts match each other. Once you’ve identified your dream, you need to find a way to turn it into a business. The first step is to come up with a business idea that allows you to pursue your dream while simultaneously solving a problem that people face. This is the only way anyone will care about your dream. A case in point is Chuck Templeton’s passion project: the restaurant reservation service OpenTable. When he originally offered this service to restaurants, he found they weren’t interested because they were already full every night. Instead of giving up on his dream, Templeton tweaked OpenTable by adding a function that let restaurants access detailed customer information. Now he was solving a real problem for the restaurants: they didn’t know their customers. Demand for this new version of the service skyrocketed, and OpenTable is now used by over 30,000 restaurants. Another key criterion for your business is that it has to be unconventional: it must break the rules of your industry. This is because a conventional idea will put you in direct competition with established firms in the industry, who have advantages like more experience and an established customer base. So work out what everybody else is doing, and then subvert it. Netflix showed the power of this approach in the 1990s when they disrupted the video rental industry. Instead of setting up retail stores like everyone else, they rented videos through their website, delivering and retrieving the DVDs via mail. They also charged a monthly subscription instead of a fee for each rented video. This approach was highly successful, but once video streaming technology had advanced sufficiently, Netflix broke the rules again by releasing movies directly over the internet. Today, the company is a major player in the on-demand internet streaming industry. Once you’ve come up with a business idea that will let you pursue your dream, you’ll probably be raring to get started. But at this stage, it’s actually vital that you keep a cool head and take a sober look at your finances. For starters, your idea has to be financially viable – this is what differentiates it from a hobby. It’s not enough that you and your customers love your idea, it must also generate enough profit for you to live on. For instance, you’ve probably seen restaurants that are unbelievably popular because they serve great food at really affordable prices. Sadly, these businesses usually go bust sooner or later, as they’re simply not profitable – a steady flow of customers is not enough. So profits are important, and one way to maximize them is to create multiple revenue streams: offer services or products that are related to your main idea. If you own a hair salon, don’t limit yourself to just offering haircuts, but also sell hair care products and provide spa treatments. This will not only increase your profits, but also make them more robust. If one revenue stream dips, the others are still on tap. Another crucial part of running your business is keeping your outlays low. An easy way to increase your profits is to cut all expenses which don’t lower the quality of the service you’re delivering. So don’t go overboard by, for example, investing in a big office or fancy antique furniture just because you’re excited about your new venture. Go further: if you’ve started a web design agency, you definitely shouldn’t bother with an office. You can start out working from your own home. Cost-saving tactics will give your idea the best possible chance of turning a profit. In any undertaking, the hardest part is getting started. And pursuing your dream is no different. It’s very tempting to just keep dreaming and planning your business rather than actually taking action to make it happen. It’s easier and more appealing than actual work. Another common excuse for not pursuing your dream is saying that it’s not the right time to take action. But this is false reasoning: circumstances will never be perfect. Consider the creators of the popular game, Angry Birds. When they started their company in 2003, they didn’t have any great ideas for games. But they launched anyway, and developed 51 unsuccessful games, almost going bankrupt in the process. But the 52nd game turned out to be Angry Birds, the most popular mobile game in history. Similarly, you too need to understand that taking action is more important than waiting for all the stars to align. But first take a step back and create a realistic schedule for yourself to follow. This will keep you on track and mindful of the big picture. In this schedule, you should define what you want to achieve each day. These tasks should be as small as possible so they don’t feel overwhelming. For example, don’t put down “do this year’s taxes” but instead split bigger items up into tasks like “print out the tax declaration form” and “collect receipts for March.” This will help keep up your spirits. This kind of schedule will allow you to adopt a very hands-on mind-set in your own business, much as you would at a regular job. After all, at a regular job you can’t just procrastinate and daydream all day, you have tasks to do and milestones to hit. The same should apply when you’re pursuing your dream. Just remember not to make your schedule too ambitious, or you’ll inevitably fall behind and lose heart. If you were to write to the president of the United States requesting a meeting, do you think he would find some room in his calendar for you? Probably not, right? But in fact, you’ll never know unless you try. Take the author Bob Goff: After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he wanted to help his children come to terms with what had happened, and so he asked them to imagine what they would say if they met the leaders of the world. One of his daughters insisted on actually writing to them to ask for a meeting, and so Goff found some addresses for her. Astonishingly, she received 29 affirmative replies to her request, even from as far away as Israel and Switzerland. This just goes to show that you never know what you can get unless you ask for it. This lesson is especially important for entrepreneurs, as they need to be bold in making asks – their livelihood depends on what they can get from others. They might need to ask a supplier for a discount, a realtor for a prime retail location or a customer for an advance payment. For most people, asking for things feels uncomfortable. Thankfully, you can make it less so. A simple rule is not to formulate your requests as “can you do this for me,” or “I need you to do this for me,” because these will be rejected, and you’ll feel embarrassed. Instead, you need to make it clear that you’re not really asking people for something, but rather giving them the opportunity to participate in your dream in a win–win scenario. This is what filmmaker Kristin Harle did when she wanted the movie rights for her favorite childhood book. She was able to start a dialog with the author, but only because she emphasized that her film would help sell more books, benefiting the author, too. There are countless smartphone and tablet companies out there, but none evokes quite the same passion as Apple. Their products may be pricey and lack the features of other leading-edge competitors, but people still swoon over them. Why is this? Because Apple has succeeded in creating a brand experience that sets their products apart from the rest. Then there’s Whole Foods, the American supermarket chain. People tend to see shopping for groceries as a necessary chore, so Whole Foods decided to make the shopping experience more personal. The company encouraged employees to chat with customers in a friendly way and started posting signs at their deli counter announcing who had sliced the meat each day. The result? Customers loved this personal approach. If you want to succeed, you too need to think about what kind of brand experience your company can offer, and how it will help you stand out. A compelling brand experience leads you to another key element for success: building a platform – a loyal fanbase who you can count on to buy your products and promote them to their friends. Without a platform, you’ll have very little chance of success, even if your idea is brilliant. According to Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Wired, you need at least 1,000 “true fans” to start earning a living from your company. So how can you reach out to people to build a platform? One popular method is to start a blog or use other forms of social media, but you can also consider more innovative approaches. Consider author Tim Schraeder’s approach when writing Outspoken, a book on communications: He invited 60 experts to contribute to the book, knowing that each expert would engage their own fanbase, thereby ensuring a large platform for the book. It worked too: the book sold 1,200 copies in just five days. The key message in this book: You can escape career frustration by becoming an entrepreneur who is pursuing his or her own dreams. Be upfront about what you want from people, and keep both your revenue streams and your customer base broad. It will be a rocky road, but with level-headed, realistic planning, you’ll get there.  Actionable advice: Break down your dreams into actionable steps. Once you’ve identified your dream, take the time to plot out each step you need to take. Then break those steps down into smaller and smaller tasks until you reach a level where each task can be accomplished within a single day. This will stop you from being overwhelmed. For example, don’t put a check box by “generate first million dollars of revenue.” Instead, work through “identify potential customers,” “draft pitch email to potential customers” and “send off pitches.” Suggested further reading: The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss The 4-Hour Workweek advocates the idea of the New Rich.

Are they lucky or uniquely gifted in ways you aren’t? Well, probably not. What they most likely do have is a proven recipe for success. The trick is simply choosing the right cookbook.  Luckily, you’ve already done that. In these blinks, we’ll break your performance down into four key areas or “capacities” – spiritual, intellectual, physical and emotional. Think of them as tools that, when used together, will see you through any project.  This is valuable because life is full of demanding long-term projects. Whether it’s your personal life and its many relationships or your career with its numerous challenges and hurdles, success is the fruit of patience, diligence and flexibility. In these blinks, you’ll also learn  how to gain clarity on your mission in life;  why mornings are the best time to start building new routines; and  why your brain suffers when you don’t take care of your physical health.  Do you want to improve yourself and achieve more? Great – you’re in the right place! Let’s kick things off with the two most important words in these blinks: building capacity. This is about continually learning and honing new skills that allow you to elevate yourself and grow. What it doesn’t mean is simply doing more things – you also have to do the right things.  There are four principal areas when it comes to building capacity. The first is spiritual capacity. This is about focusing on getting to know yourself and clarifying your values and desires. Next up is intellectual capacity. This includes how you think, plan and execute with maximum efficiency and discipline. Then there’s physical capacity – your physical health and well-being. Finally, there’s emotional capacity. That’s your ability to deal with challenging situations and get the most out of your relationships.  One way to visualize these areas is as a ball divided into four chambers, each of which can be filled with gas. The 2D version of this ball would look like a pie cut into four quarters. The more air you pump into each of these chambers, the more momentum the ball will have as it moves. But here’s the catch: if you’re not filling each chamber with the same amount of gas, the ball will start to wobble and go off track. It’s the same with your capacities. All four need to be balanced. This means developing them simultaneously with equal care and attention.  Now, building capacity isn’t something that happens overnight. It’s like working out. Sure, you have to be motivated to book your first gym session, but that’s just the start. If you want to build muscle and get that washboard stomach, you need to be hitting the gym week after week and improving bit by bit.  Building capacity is just like that – after all, achieving big goals takes time and dedication. Most importantly, it means taking those small steps that will carry you over the finish line every day. Sometimes, the process takes months; other times, it’s a matter of years. Stick at it, though, and you’re sure to realize your dreams.   So, now that you know how to build capacity in theory, let’s take a look at what you need to do in practice.  Building capacity isn’t something you can do willy-nilly. Before you start expending your time and energy, you need to be clear about what it is you’re trying to achieve and why. That’s exactly what “spiritual” means in this context – it’s about figuring out who you are and what you want. Think of it as a compass that will keep you on course and ensure you’re using your resources to get to where you want to go.  So here’s the million-dollar question: how do you do that?  Well, if you want to define your core values, you need to ask the right questions. This means taking time to reflect on what’s most important to you. Ask yourself what makes you feel happy and energizes you, and also what gets you down and saps your energy. In other words, when do you succeed and when do you struggle?  The next step is to reach out to friends, family members and colleagues and ask them how they see things. Here you’ll want to compare your answers with theirs to make sure you’re seeing things clearly. Then, you’ll want to take all those answers and look for common words. Maybe “compassion” crops up repeatedly, or maybe “independence” is a running theme. Whittle down that list to just four or five key concepts. These are your core values – the principles by which you want to live.  That brings us to your core purpose. This is your mission in life. It combines your values and gives you a clear sense of where you’re going. The author, for example, defines his purpose as “finding a better way and sharing it,” and it’s this that motivated him to write his book.  Take a moment to examine your values and then see if you can form a sentence that represents your long-term direction in life. If you’re struggling to do that, try writing your own obituary. It might sound a little macabre, but this is a great way of getting out of your head and asking yourself how you’d like others to see you. That will likely contain vital clues about your core purpose.  The last step is to begin aligning your actions with your values and purpose. This is all about putting your energy in the right place. True success is the fruit of this alignment. Fail to do that and your success won’t be defined by you but by others.  If you’ve updated your computer software recently, you’ll know how much more efficiently and smoothly applications run when you give them a bit of TLC. The same thing happens when you work on your intellectual capacity. The more time you put into it, the more tasks you’ll accomplish while expending the same amount of energy.  The key to building that capacity is a growth mindset. People who adopt this attitude reject the fixed mindset – the idea that our intellectual capacity is fixed at a predetermined point. This is all about embracing the fact that it’s never too late to learn new skills and that mistakes and failures are simply part of the process.  The growth mindset is vital to your efforts to expand your intellectual capacity, but it’s not something you can cultivate on your own. That brings us to the second step: finding mentors who will help you keep learning and growing. The world’s high-flyers and top performers all have one thing in common: they surround themselves with coaches and mentors who challenge them to keep improving. These people are so important because they don’t tell you what you want to hear – they tell you what you need to hear. They pull you up on avoidable mistakes and point out how you can achieve more.  That’s vital because we’re all short-sighted when it comes to understanding ourselves. Sometimes, you need an objective outsider to tell it like it is.  Finally, you’ll need to use routines to set yourself up for success. Routines are important because they help you make a habit of being productive. That’s crucial when it comes to achieving long-term goals like learning a language or writing a book.  The best time for this is the morning. It’s as simple as waking up 15 minutes earlier than usual and using this extra time for quiet, focused work. Once this habit has been consolidated, you can start adding extra minutes to your routine. What, for example, would happen if you got up a full hour before your family and used the time to meditate, work out and jot down ideas for your book?  These are small tweaks to your daily schedule but, cumulatively, they can add up to life-altering changes.  Physical capacity is about more than just being able to run a marathon. When your body is in poor shape, your brain also suffers: you’re more easily distracted, less resilient and more likely to be knocked back by stress and setbacks. That means it’s time to start looking after your health.  Let’s start with what you eat. The key point here is to make sure you’re getting a balanced and nutritious diet. Highly processed junk food is everywhere today and, in many countries, people are more likely to die as a result of obesity than they are from starvation. But with so many different kinds of diets out there, it’s often hard to choose what’s right for you. Is paleo better than keto, for example? Or is low-carb preferable to slow-carb?  Well, let’s make things easier with a tip from author and journalist Michael Pollan. His rule of thumb is simple: don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t have recognized as food.   Next up: managing stress. Stress isn’t necessarily a bad thing – in fact, it was stress that ensured our ancient ancestors were alert and attentive enough to spot dangers. Unfortunately, our brains respond to our frenetic, digitalized world in much the same way as they would to snakes and tigers. This means that many of us are regularly experiencing more stress than we can cope with.  According to Dr. Heidi Hanna, the most effective way to reduce stress is to take regular short breaks throughout the day. These allow you to take a deep breath, relax or even meditate. Getting enough sleep is also essential to your performance levels and well-being, so make sure you’re spending a good 6-8 hours in the Land of Nod each night.  And here’s one last tip: embrace competition. This has become something of a dirty word, but it’s important to remember that competition shouldn’t be about crushing your opponents and winning at all costs. What it really means is going the extra mile and challenging yourself to become better. Whether it’s intellectual or physical competition, it will push you to build your capacity.  Finally, we come to emotional capacity – the tool you’ll use to navigate your relationships both with yourself and others. This has two sides: dealing with people around you and dealing with unintended consequences. Think of driving a car: to do this well, you have to keep an eye on other road users while also anticipating their sudden swerves and stops.  Building emotional capacity begins by leaving your comfort zone. It’s all too easy to get stuck in a particular mindset, hemmed in by limiting beliefs or the low expectations of others. Overcoming these boundaries is only possible when you set yourself new challenges or allow someone else to push you. If you’ve ever had a colleague or friend tell you something you didn’t want to hear, you’ll know all about this. Sure, it’s uncomfortable at first, but it ultimately motivates you to make improvements.  Stepping out of your comfort zone also builds your resilience. This is a vital skill. Every day, we face new challenges and situations which can throw us off course. The more resilient you are, the more likely you are to clear those hurdles.  So how do you do it? Well, it’s as simple as trying new things. You can cook an unfamiliar dish or travel somewhere new, for example. You can also try doing something you usually shy away from, like cold-calling a potential client or giving a colleague some honest negative feedback.  This isn’t something you can do on your own: to maximize your emotional capacity, you need to surround yourself with the right people. As the author and entrepreneur Jim Rohn once put it, you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with. That’s why it’s so important to seek out people who share your values, energize you and inspire you to be your best self.  The flipside of that is avoiding people who undermine you. These are energy vampires – so-called “friends” or family members who sap your strength and undermine your effort to improve yourself. Disengage from these individuals and you won’t just feel better – you’ll also have more time for relationships that truly elevate you.  The key message in these blinks: The key to boosting your performance and achieving more is working on four core areas of your life. These are your spiritual, intellectual, physical and emotional “capacities.” How do you do that? Well, the best place to start is clarifying what you actually want in life. Once you’re clear about your goal, you can start honing the skills and abilities you’ll need to reach it  Actionable advice: Protect your mornings by keeping them tech-free.  The time between waking up and beginning your routine is crucial – it’s literally what sets you up for the day ahead. Unfortunately, our digital devices and gadgets mean we often fail to make the most of this time. Rather than working on our own projects, we waste these precious minutes answering emails or browsing Facebook. But there’s a simple fix: commit to keeping the first hour of each day tech-free. Whether you put your phone in a drawer or use an app to restrict usage is up to you. Either way, you’ll be amazed at how much you can get done when you’re not distracted!

Although modern technology and international connectivity have made it easier than ever before to reach out to millions of people across the globe, it remains difficult – and is in fact even harder today – to convince them to try something new. The market has grown, but so has the competition. And consumers aren’t affected by advertising the same way they once were. In order to reach consumers, we need to quit thinking about how to just get them to buy now. We need to figure out how to enchant them: to get them enthralled with our cause, and turn them into arbiters for our mission, free-roaming salespeople who are true to our cause. These blinks will teach you all about the art of enchantment, and how you can use it in order to create a fanatic fanbase who just can’t wait for your next product or service. It will also provide you with some tips for how to avoid becoming enchanted yourself by those who just want to make a quick buck. In addition, these blinks will show you: how inviting Filipino militants inside for coffee totally changed one woman’s life, why one company has so much faith that their customers won’t try to rip them off, and why it’s better to not just enchant your customers, but anyone and everyone. Have you ever been in a situation where someone was just so nice or captivating that you really just wanted to help them? Likely, you felt enchanted by this person. The greater your goals and the fewer resources are available to you, the more useful enchantment will be in winning people’s hearts and minds and motivating their actions. But what is it exactly? Enchantment is the ability to change the nature of relationships, and therefore influence other people’s actions. Consider, for example, the story of Karin Muller, a filmmaker and author who worked in the Peace Corps, building wells and schools in a Filipino village during the late 1980s. One day, seventeen members of the New People’s Army (NPA), an armed wing of the Philippines’ Communist Party, came to interrogate her. When she saw them, she exclaimed: “Thank God you’re here. I’ve been waiting all day. Please have some coffee. Leave your guns at the door.” Muller was able to totally transform the dynamic of her situation, turning it from an obvious show of force to “conversation and delight,” by appealing to the leader’s emotions. But enchantment isn’t just useful for getting out of a pickle. In fact, it can happen anywhere, anytime. And it’s not just about making money, or even personal gain. It’s about filling others with the same delight and passion you experience about something. For example, when Steve Jobs was developing his iPhone, he wasn’t contemplating the best strategy to get consumers to put money in his personal bank account, or entice them to sign on to a two-year contract with AT&T. He, like all enchanters, was selling his dream for a better future – one in which people can have cooler social interactions and use technology to improve their lives. This means that, if you want to enchant people, you have to have a dream that you’re striving to achieve. But, there is more to the equation. Have you ever felt enchanted by someone you didn’t like or couldn’t trust? Probably not. If you want to be able to enchant people, then you first have to get them to like and trust you. But how? The fundamental key to enchantment is accepting and liking people as they are. Arrogance and self-centered behavior, therefore, are your greatest obstacles. In order for people to like you, they first have to accept you. But in order for them to accept you, you have to take the first step by accepting them. Not everyone is immediately likeable, so keep in mind that we all have strengths and weaknesses, before writing anyone off. What’s more, we often find that passionate people are more easily likeable and interesting. Thus, you should be very open with other people about your passions, as your excitement is infectious. The easiest way to enchant someone is to connect with them on your shared passions. These connections aren’t always easy to find, but don’t give up! Assume you have something in common, and do your homework on the specific person whom you want to enchant. However, if you want to be enchanting, then it’s not enough that people merely like you. As the American motivational speaker Zig Ziglar once said: “Every sale has five basic obstacles: no need, no money, no hurry, no desire, no trust.” In order for people to trust you, you must demonstrate that you are knowledgeable and competent, and understand that trust works in both directions. American shoe retailer Zappos offers a great example of this two-way trust. Customers trust Zappos because of its money-back guarantee and free shipping for both deliveries and returns. Zappos, in turn, trusts their customers to not abuse this trust by sending back shoes that have been worn. As with most things, actions speak louder than words. So Kawasaki recommends to “be a mensch.” One who is authentic and transparent is showing proof of his or her good intentions. So now that you know what enchantment actually is, the following blinks will focus on how to make your brand or product enchanting. Do you often buy things just because you like and trust the salesperson? That may be true sometimes, but even the best salesperson will fail to enchant their clients with a mediocre product, service or idea that doesn’t deliver. If you want your product or service to be enchanting, then it must have these five qualities – it must be DICEE : Deep: A deep product demonstrates value and features at multiple levels, being able to fulfil the immediate and future needs of your customers and developing over time. Google, which started off merely as a search engine, has recognized user needs and has since developed an email service as well as a broad selection of online tools and services. Intelligent: An intelligent product solves problems with efficiency and elegance. Ford’s MyKey allows the car owner to set driving speed limits, thus offering worried parents peace of mind when their teenager grabs the keys to the car. Complete: A complete product is one that provides a great experience for the customer during the entire life-cycle of the product. For example, the after-sale service of Lexus is as much a part of the Lexus experience as the car itself. Empowering: An empowering product makes us feel smarter, stronger, or more skilled than before we had it. It is this very feeling that makes many of us consider our computers or favorite search engines to be part of us. Elegant: Elegant products are ones that work with or for their users. The designers thought long and hard about how to design for optimized user experience. A great example of elegance in design is the simplicity and user-friendliness of Apple products, such as the single-button iPod. By following DICEE, you have in your hands the blueprint for a product design that will not only deliver, but also enchant. Having a high-quality, enchanting product is crucial to your success. But your product won’t sell itself. You first have to present it to the public, and do it right. Unfortunately, most launches simply convey vague information. But as Annette Simmons, author of Whoever Tells the Best Story Wins, said: “People don’t want information. They are up to their eyeballs in information. They want faith – faith in you, your goals, your success, in the story you tell.” Luckily, there are two great ways to achieve this: First, you have to inject yourself into your product launch, thereby giving it a personal touch and story. Be transparent, open with your emotions and your story, all while being likeable and authentic. Secondly, in order to truly infatuate people with yourself and your cause, give them a hands-on trial with the following characteristics: Easy: Make sure people can use your product or service without much training, expertise, time or guidance. Immediate: When people are eager to dive in, don’t make them wait! Immediacy means forgoing things like making them fill out long forms or waiting for passwords or approval to get started. Inexpensive: When people are trying out your new product or service, they shouldn’t have to pay anything more than their time. With the exception of serious fanatics, virtually no one is willing to pay for the “privilege” of being a customer during product trials. Concrete: When people use your product, they should notice concrete improvements in their lives. In order to become believers, they’ll need to see the evidence for themselves. Reversible: People should be able to reverse their decision to try out your cause without trouble, similar to Zappos’ no-cost, no-questions-asked return policy. Finally, when you’re in the launch phase, don’t focus your attention on the so-called “influencers” at the expense of the “nobodies.” Your goal should be to reach as many people as possible, delight them with your passion, and turn them into advocates. Enchantment always means changing someone’s beliefs and perspectives. But like every change, these don’t happen easily. You have to overcome certain obstacles, most of which are buried deep in audience members’ minds. For starters, people usually resist change. They want to maintain the status quo and don’t like making decisions. This hesitancy is due in part to a strong fear of making mistakes, but also to a lack of risk-taking role models to follow. So how do we remove these obstructions in order to entice people to get behind our cause? One way is to offer them some sort of social proof, i.e., show them that other people they trust are doing it, so it’s safe for them as well. If you can show them that others have embraced your cause, then they will follow suit and embrace it too. For example, Colleen Szot, a copywriter in the infomercial business, was able to increase sales simply by changing the script from “operators are waiting, please call now” to “if operators are busy, please call again.” When people heard the new pitch, they assumed that the product was doing so well that the operators couldn’t keep up with incoming calls, thus offering them immediate social proof and enticing them to call in. Another way is to make your product seem scarce, so that people believe it to be more valuable. A perfect example of this is Google’s email service, Gmail, where accounts were once authorized by invitation only. The desire for these invites became so hyped that people even bought them on eBay! So which strategy should you use? Social proof or scarcity? This depends on the degree of uncertainty and doubt people have about your product. In the face of high uncertainty, use social proof in order to alter their perception. When their uncertainty is minimal, emphasize scarcity to give your product hype, moving interested customers to more immediate action. If you are selling a product or service, would you rather have people simply buy your products, or act as unpaid advocates for your cause? Obviously the latter, but how do you get people to internalize your cause and carry your banner for you? First, you need to create the feeling that your customers belong to a group of people who share the same interest and identify with what you have to offer. Second, you have to motivate people to make an actual commitment to your cause, and honor that commitment. The best way to do this is to create an ecosystem – a community, via your website, blog or Facebook page – that fosters loyalty. Follow these guidelines so that people join your ecosystem: First and foremost, create something that’s actually worth joining. This means making sure that your ecosystem provides actual value to its community members and doesn’t just serve you. Next, find an evangelist and champion for your cause, who will build and support your ecosystem and carry the flag for the community. Make sure there is room for people to do something meaningful in your ecosystem. In other words, don’t set too many constraints. Welcome criticism and discussion about your cause or product. Don’t try to cover up any failures, but be open and transparent, as this will help to cultivate trust. Create a reward system for your ambassadors that reinforces your brand and doesn’t include money. Maker’s Mark, for example, rewards their whisky ambassadors by putting their names on a barrel and providing them the opportunity to buy a bottle from the batch. As you can see, enchantment is not a singular event, but rather a process that must be carefully tended. The next blink explains how you can use technology to help you enchant more people and keep them enchanted. Once you’ve created a product or service that encompasses your vision, you’re going to want customers, and that often means using push technology, technology where you reach out to the customer. Unfortunately, there is some major competition for your customers’ attention. In order to maximize effectiveness of this direct communication, keep these principles in mind: Engage fast. We’ve grown so accustomed to the immediacy of technology that we also expect this in our correspondence. When your customers contact you, they too expect a fast response. Try to deliver your response in under 24 hours. Engage many. Don’t just try to capture the attention of a few influential people. Remember that “nobodies are the new somebodies in a world of wide-open communications,” so try to reach as many as possible. Engage often. Remember that “engagement is a process, not an event.” Engage your customers often, and vary the way you package your messages – e.g., with different media, such as pictures, videos, live chats, and audio – so that you don’t bore them with redundancy. Provide value. If you want to enchant people, then you can’t start by immediately trying to sell or promote your cause. Instead, provide potential customers with immediate value in the form of helpful advice, or inspiring or entertaining content. You can also share your own personal insights or advice as a way to be more genuine. Be short and concrete. Presentations and email tend to overflow with information, and this can be distracting and confusing. Try to limit your emails to no more than six sentences. When making presentations, follow the 10:20:30 Rule: 10 minutes, 20 slides, no font smaller than 30 point. So which technology should you use to push your message? According to the author, Twitter is among “the cheapest and most effective ways to engage and enchant people.” It’s cheap, easy, and allows direct communication with potential customers. So try it out! While push technology allows you to directly engage people and draw their attention, it can only transport a limited amount of information. This is where pull technologies, like websites, blogs and Facebook, come into play. In order to maximize the enchanting power of your pull technologies, be sure to follow these simple guidelines: Provide good content. Just because you have nearly unlimited space, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t impose limits on your content. Tailor the content around your cause and the interests of your target market by only providing content with intrinsic value that is inspirational, entertaining, enlightening and/or educational. Make sure you update frequently and use many forms of media, such as graphics, pictures and videos. Provide pages for FAQ and About. People love FAQs because they cut right through all the fluff and answer their most pressing questions. In addition, no visitor should have to wonder what your cause is about. Be sure to present all the essential information about you and your cause in an About page. Be aesthetic. Express things as simply and naturally as possible, calmly yet energetically, without overloading viewers with information. Don’t feel like you need to use every empty pixel on your page, and make sure your user interface is simple by approaching your design from the user’s perspective. Often, Facebook is a great place to put these principles into action. A Facebook fan page is fast, easy and inexpensive. As an example, the Facebook fan page for Enchantment cost only around $1,750. Not only that, but “if Facebook were a country, it would rank third in the world in population – behind China and India.” It has a huge user base, and consequently an enormous amount of people who could be interested in your cause, so it only makes sense to make a presence there. By now you should have a good idea of what tools you can use to attract customers to your cause. In these final blinks, you’ll learn about other ways to use enchantment. What is more likely to motivate you to work hard: a project that pays well but is ultimately useless, or a project that pays less but is deeply rewarding and intrinsically valuable? If you aren’t hard pressed for cash, you’d probably be more interested in a personally rewarding experience, and you wouldn’t be alone. If you want to motivate and enchant your employees, you need to provide MAP: mastery, autonomy and purpose. Mastery: If have to do something for eight hours every single day, then you’ll want to be good at it, otherwise your work day will be miserable. Providing employees with new skills not only increases productivity but also helps them to take an interest and pride in their work. Autonomy: Management needs to trust that their employees are competent enough to do what needs to be done. Giving employees some freedom is essential to their happiness. Purpose: By far the most important element to motivation at work is the feeling that what you and your company are doing is intrinsically valuable. Above all else, an employee’s work should provide her with a mission that she actually wants to complete. Another important aspect of an enchanting work environment is celebrating success. Celebration is incredibly powerful, and can easily offset the damage caused by failure. According to Brenda Bence, author of How YOU Are Like Shampoo, celebrating success can motivate employees to work harder, and unifies them around common goals. In addition, it helps focus employees’ attention on the work tasks, as well as communicates organization’s values. Creating an enchanting work environment is not just icing on the cake. It’s crucial: the more that employees are totally turned on to your ideas, the more likely they are to secure enchanted customers. Have you ever felt totally enchanted by someone, just to have them dupe you and take advantage? Unfortunately, not every enchanter has good intentions and genuine interests. So how can you defend yourself against the enchanting persuasion of others? The most immediate way is to be aware of and avoid situations where you can be easily tempted. For example, the low prices of an outlet mall or the high-pressure of an auction can lead you to make regrettable decisions. Moreover, if you’re stressed, sick, tired or in a hurry, then you’re especially vulnerable to rash purchasing decisions. Avoid or delay your decision-making if you’ve had to skip breakfast! It’s also a good idea to use a checklist whenever you encounter a tempting situation, to make sure your decision isn’t totally unfounded. There’s no shame in second guessing yourself: even the most successful and seemingly intelligent people make decisions out of temptation they later regret. Next time you’re making a big purchasing decision, take a step back and ask yourself the following questions: Am I missing any information that would help me make a rational decision? Am I making a decision based on facts? Or is it because people around me are doing it? What will be the impact of this decision a year from now? Would I still make the decision if I waited a week, a month, a year? Have I made a similar decision before that I ended up regretting? Am I fully aware of this decision’s total cost (including hidden costs like the cost of installation, support, maintenance, upgrades, etc.)? Would I still make this decision if everyone knew about it? We all have a capacity to withstand enchantment if we just take the time to pause and reflect, but that doesn’t mean every decision has to be an ordeal. Don’t waste your time fretting over small and harmless things. Save the deep thinking for the important decisions. The key message in this book: In today’s world, the best way to get people to sign on to your cause is not through persuasion or mere marketing, but through enchantment. It’s about telling the entrepreneur’s dream and getting people to follow. Today’s technology makes it easy to convert others to your values and make your cause their own. Actionable advice: Cast a wide net. When you are trying to reach potential customers, don’t spend all your time focusing on the “influential people.” Instead, try to capture the attention of as many people as possible so that you can convert the most idle consumers into brand fanatics. Remember: in a world of unfettered access to communication, “nobodies” are the new “somebodies.”","headers":["What’s in it for me?

And then there’s the fear – the fear of being criticized, of coming up short and not being the success you dreamed of. But author and entrepreneur Paul Jarvis is here to tell you that you can push through these fears, and that there’s no time like the present to put those plans into action. With over 20 years experience as his own boss, and with numerous start-ups to his credit, Jarvis has learned a lot about entrepreneurship and the excuses people make to continue working for someone else. But if you want your hard work to benefit your dreams, rather than the dreams of someone else, then it’s time to push the excuses aside and get down to some real, meaningful work that reflects who you are as an individual. Jarvis doesn’t believe in advice, so these aren’t “rules.” Rather, they’re lessons that he’s learned over the course of his career. But if you’re thinking of starting your own business, there’s a good chance they’ll help your career as well. In these blinks, you’ll find out why it doesn’t hurt to be an imperfect yoga instructor; why a bold manifesto is good for business; and why theft is better than mimicry. If you were a schoolkid in the 1980s or 1990s, you may remember the Choose Your Own Adventure books, a series of adventure stories that allowed you to decide what the main character did or didn’t do. For instance, if you chose to go through the scary forest, you’d turn to a certain page; if you chose to go around the forest, however, you’d turn to another. When the author, Paul Jarvis, was a young boy, he loved these books, and as an adult he continued to choose his own adventure by deciding to be his own boss rather than working for someone else. After quitting college, Jarvis did work for someone else, as an employee at a web design company in Toronto, and he didn’t like it one bit. However, this experience taught him the ins and outs of running a web-based business – things he knew he wouldn’t learn in school. Sure, when you work for someone else, you’re not risking much and you may feel a sense of security, but it’s not very rewarding in the long run. In order to get the big reward you have to take the big risk and embark on your own adventure, which means doing something no one else is doing – something that speaks to who you are as an individual. As a web designer, Jarvis has met clients who point to someone else’s website and say, “I want the same site they have.” But what they don’t understand is that following someone else’s lead is just going to make them boring and forgettable. Following someone else’s path may seem like an appealingly safe way to go, but imagine following someone else’s treasure map. It may lead you to where the gold was, but that gold will be gone by the time you get there. So why settle for the leftover scraps that come with copying someone else when you can do your own thing and uncover your very own treasure? The universe rewards those who do their own thing in an authentic way while managing to help others. It’s true that corporations and schools often tell people to fall in line and be like everyone else, rather than promoting individualism and uniqueness. But the fact is that we’re all unique and, as we’ll see in the next blink, it pays to embrace our weirdness. There’s plenty of so-called “expert advice” out there that says it’s smart to try and fit yourself into some cookie-cutter business model. But Jarvis is here to tell you that such advice is bullshit. In fact, he hates advice altogether. That said, he does believe that the best way to be inspiring and attract people to your business is to be true to your unique self, and to be different than what’s already out there. In other words: be weird. Plenty of people have advised Jarvis to refrain from swearing around clients – telling him that it’s unprofessional. Yet he swears from time to time, and he’d rather be honest about who he is than be phony in order to please a client who would likely be a bad fit anyway. The truth is, clients will respond positively when they see that you’re authentic and honest in your desire to help them. If given the choice, people will always choose an authentic and weird human over a flawless and boring bot. Take yoga instructors, for example. There are a lot of yoga instructors out there who are indistinguishable from one another – each one seemingly enlightened and perfect. And then there’s Caren, a yoga teacher who talks openly about her experience with depression. An expert would probably say it’s bad business to tell potential clients that you’re not perfect, but Caren’s openness doesn’t turn people off. In fact, it attracts clients, who are drawn to her story and inspired by her authenticity. What really matters is that you identify your values and stay aligned with them. When you do this, you can rest assured that you’re doing meaningful, worthwhile work, no matter what anyone else says. For Jarvis, his values are doing good work that helps people while always pushing his creative limits. Some people align their values with making money and getting famous, but Jarvis is against this practice since fame and riches are external factors that are ultimately out of your control. While you can’t determine how many people are going to buy your next product, you can determine the amount of work and care you put into it. So even if you don’t immediately reach through-the-roof sales, you can rest easy that you succeeded on your terms if your product is well made and truly does a good job of helping people as intended. When you establish good internal values, meaning ones you can control, your sense of self-worth will also be in your control, as it should be. There are all kinds of learning preferences, and some people are perfectly suited to the structure that schools and universities provide. But sometimes there can be a limit to how much you can learn from reading or listening to a lecturer – you need to go out and learn by doing. Whatever your craft may be, learning by doing is the best way to develop and improve that craft. Jarvis doesn’t regret dropping out of college to work at a web design company because he knows that he learned a lot of valuable lessons on the job that he wouldn’t have learned at school. Only after spending a few years as the company’s creative director did he feel confident enough to venture forth and start his own business. Still, when he started out, Jarvis made a lot of mistakes. But these became valuable lessons that allowed him to improve –  and he wouldn’t learned them unless he was doing. Also, since putting out quality work is one of Jarvis’s core values, these mistakes became opportunities to improve the overall quality of his work. However, this doesn’t mean that you should keep pushing things forward if your business has flatlined or isn’t getting off the ground. If you find yourself stuck in a bad situation, don’t be stubborn and try to press on with business as usual. Instead, recognize it as a good time to stop what you’re doing, take a step back and reevaluate things. Jarvis found himself in this exact situation with his freelance web design business so he hit the pause button and asked himself how he could do a better job helping his clients. Sure enough, stepping back gave him enough distance from the problem to clearly see the path forward, which involved completely restructuring his practices and procedures. There are also steps you can take to reduce your chances of getting to such a point of stagnation that you need to hit that pause button. One of the better things to do is to keep experimenting, trying new things and staying up-to-date with what’s going on in your field. Once you’ve made the first step of having a great idea that speaks to who you are and what you value, it’s time to move on to the second step: overcoming the obstacles that are keeping you from realizing that idea. You may think that the obstacles are big and plentiful, but the good news is that many of them can be overcome by thinking differently and adjusting your outlook on the challenges ahead. For example, you or someone you know may be a perfectionist – someone who doesn’t like to take on a project unless they know it’s going to come out flawlessly. No one wants to put out bad work, but if everyone only put out work they believed was absolutely perfect, the marketplace would be pretty empty. In fact, it’s safe to say that absolute perfection doesn’t exist at all in the real world. It’s just a concept that keeps us from moving forward with a perfectly good idea. If perfection is a requirement for you, then you’ll most likely end up never having done anything, which is a far greater tragedy than producing something with a few flaws. There’s another concern, often associated with being a perfectionist. Something that can also act as an obstacle to getting your work done, and it has to do with being judged. These days, it’s hard to avoid criticism from anyone with a computer or smartphone. Every day, Jarvis gets a message, be it a tweet, an email or a one-star review, from someone who thinks his work stinks. He thinks of it as a virtual slap to the face, but it’s not something he’ll dwell on for too long. It’s just an unavoidable fact of life and you simply have to move on. It also stings to lose a follower or a subscriber, but there are also the days when you’ll gain new fans and five-star reviews from people who really appreciate your work. You need to focus on the good rather than get stuck obsessing about the bad. And here again is where it helps to have work that is aligned with your values. Since Jarvis’s work is all about sharing what he’s learned and trying to help others, he can rest easy knowing that his finished product met these values – despite what the haters might say. Success doesn’t eliminate a person’s fears. It just creates new worries, such as the fear of not living up to the previous success! So it’s safe to say that everyone has fears about putting their own work out into the world, no matter who they are. This is why it’s important to really care about what you do and to have those strong values in place. It may not make the fears go away, but it should reduce them, since you’ll be less invested in how others respond. Jarvis has plenty of fears. In fact, in one long blog post, he listed each of them. In response to this extensive list, one reader pointed out that fears are often a sign that you have things you cherish and don’t want to lose. So, in a way, fears are something to be grateful for! To push past your fears, you need courage. Now, some people confuse courage with fearlessness, but real courage is about acknowledging fear and pushing past it in order to do what needs to be done. To make this a bit easier for yourself, you can give yourself a series of small steps, since it’s always easier to make small steps than it is to make one big, scary leap. Among Jarvis’s many fears is a fear of crowds, especially performing in front of people and receiving criticism. So it may surprise you to learn that he’s also a touring musician in a band. Jarvis didn’t suddenly lose these fears in order to be a touring musician; he pushed through the fear in a series of small steps. First, he played music outside, performing in parks to passersby. Then he moved to open mic nights at local music venues. After that, he started booking gigs in clubs. After each step he had a realization that there really isn’t so much to worry about. Even after performances that Jarvis thought went terribly, he’s had fans come up and say it was his best show yet. What’s more, failure isn’t worth fearing anyway, since it’s part of the creative process for any entrepreneur and artist.    Think about it: no one has emerged with a great product or work of art without leaving behind a series of failures, accidents and mishaps. The important thing is to embrace these failures as important opportunities to learn, grow and get better. Fear of failure is just one poor excuse for not doing something you really want to do. The other big reasons are not having enough time and not having enough money, but these barriers are far from insurmountable. As far as time goes, you always have choices to make and you can always choose to prioritize one thing over another. So instead of spending time on social media, you can start writing your own book and, if you don’t have much money, you can self-publish it as an e-book, which is what Paul Jarvis did. Along with establishing your values, it’s also important to define your intentions, or why you want to do something in the first place. When you have a strong desire and pure intentions, it becomes easier to push through the fear and make the necessary sacrifices with your time and money. Ask yourself: Why do I want to do this in the first place? What do I want to accomplish? How does my product or service add value to the world? When you have good intentions, people will recognize it. And conversely, when you lie about your intentions, people will be able to tell. Just contrast the intentions of Blue Bottle Coffee with those of Starbucks. Blue Bottle’s mission statement clearly sounds like human beings who want to help, while Starbucks’s sounds like it was written by a faceless corporate committee. So fill your intentions with humor, passion and love – all the stuff that humans are made of and respond to. When you really believe and care about the unique work you’re sharing with the world, your personal story will likely show up in the end product. That is, your product will reflect who you are. And people are far more likely to be attracted to this kind of work than some generic copy of something else. But it also helps to use a rallying flag to get your audience’s attention. A rallying flag can be a number of things, but what it should never be is confusing or boring. It can be a bold mission statement, a manifesto, a video – anything that takes a stand, draws a firm line in the sand and says this is what you and your work represent, so come be part of the adventure! You’ve probably heard someone say it as a form of career advice: “Follow your passion.” It sounds nice, but, in reality, following your passion isn’t enough. You also need to put time and effort into developing your craft, generating as many ideas as you can and questioning whether your passion is aligned with your values. The better advice is to find your intersection, and this happens by knowing your passion and where it intersects with your skills and how those skills help others. For example, if you’re passionate about protecting the environment, and skilled at web design, your intersection with helping people, and thereby getting paid for your work, might be in designing websites for eco-friendly businesses. But knowing this is still only half the battle since you then need to come up with your rallying flag and get your audience as excited and passionate as you are. And then there’s the matter of following through, finishing your work and making it as good as it can be. This means staying focused on the real work and avoiding the many distractions that people commonly mistake as being part of the real work. A lot of people seem to think of self-promotion and maintaining an active social media presence as being a substantial part of their work, but this is a mistake. Promotion is secondary to the craft of doing the work. Ironically, if self-promoting individuals spent as much time developing their craft and doing the actual work as they do composing the perfect tweet, then they probably wouldn’t need to promote themselves so much! Doing fantastic work for a client is promotion in itself, since this client will most likely recommend you to everyone in their circle. Since Jarvis ranks the quality of his work very high in his values, he’s never had to spend one penny on advertising. Twitter and Facebook could vanish and his business would be unaffected. Finally, there’s one more piece of common advice that Jarvis questions: the use of goals. Jarvis is against goals, since they tend to lock you into a certain track that can keep you from experimenting and seeking out alternatives. Instead, Jarvis uses his values to guide him. Since his primary values are to “do great work” and “help people,” he’s free to explore every possible way of making this happen. Now that we’ve gotten the excuses out of the way, it’s time to stop procrastinating and start your own adventure. So let’s get moving on your great idea for a product or service that can truly help people and make the world a little bit better. If you need some inspiration to get started, it’s not a bad idea to look carefully at the work of people you admire. But keep in mind that there’s a big difference between copying, theft and mimicry. Copying can be very helpful in developing your craft. When Jarvis was starting out, he would recreate websites he liked as a way of learning techniques and how certain things were done. Then, he would see how he could make the re-created sites better, faster-running and more stylish. Copying was also a good way for him to learn how to mix multiple web design styles together. Theft can also be used as inspiration for your own work. Jarvis has stolen lots of designs and details found in art, nature, architecture and other places. These details are then incorporated and blended into his own work and made part of his own individual style. Chances are, if he told you about the idea he stole, you wouldn’t even recognize it in his own work, but it was an important part of the process nonetheless. Mimicry, on the other hand, is taking someone else’s idea and passing it off as your own, which is simply bad form. Everyone takes bits and pieces from other creators past and present – and sometimes we’re not even conscious of outside influence. But these inspirational ideas should be jumping-off points for making something unique and wholly your own. While it’s okay to look to the work of others for inspiration and ways to improve your own craft, it can also generate some bad feelings if you were to start comparing your work or your popularity against theirs. Ultimately, this kind of measuring-up isn’t going to do you much good. What really matters is how you feel about your work as it stands and not against someone else’s effort. So try to stay focused on the process since this is where the real, lasting reward is. If you pin all of your hopes on the final result, you’ll find that satisfaction is fleeting. You might feel good for a day, but then it’ll be time to move on to the next thing. When you’re focused on the process of making and doing good work, rewards will be there each and every day. No matter what kind of adventure you’re planning to start, it all begins by taking a moment to ask yourself some important questions: What are my intentions and motivations? What are my core values? With the answers to these questions you can create your rallying flag and a mission statement that will help guide your decisions. Getting a big project started can be overwhelming. So much so that it’s often filled with moments where you’ll be tempted to give up. So, to keep your momentum going, it’s good to figure out how you can break down the launch of the project into small, doable steps. Once you’re up and running, it’s important to avoid burnout by knowing when to say no. Time and energy are precious resources and they aren’t to be wasted on clients who don’t see eye-to-eye with your values. When you stretch yourself too thin, every project can suffer. Of course, we don’t always have the luxury of being able to turn clients away, but if you find yourself struggling to get clients, you can take advantage of anonymity with some bold experimentation. Keep in mind that both fame and obscurity come with pros and cons. With fame and success, there comes a lot of pressure to keep delivering and maintaining your reputation, while anonymity provides an exciting opportunity to experiment, fail, learn and develop your expertise in relative peace. When you gain some followers, it’s important to keep learning and stay flexible. Being an expert only means that others respect and value your opinion. To retain that status you need to stay on top of the developments in your field and accept the fact that it’s an ongoing process. Opinions can change as a person continues to develop and gain new insights. Finally, don’t give up. Even if you feel like you’ve failed so many times that you feel cursed, all it takes is one success to turn things around. On the bright side, you should know that it often feels darkest right before the dawn. So keep learning from your failures, making those adjustments and trying again. What do you have to lose? The key message in these blinks: There’s nothing like doing your own unique work that reflects your values. Exciting, innovative work comes from people who break free from bland corporate thinking and do their own thing. Everyone, even successful people, has fears about exposing themselves to criticism and failure, but these fears can be overcome. Failure and criticism are not the end – in fact, they can be helpful in providing ways to learn, pivot and continue creating even better work.  Actionable advice: Rather than wanting more money, want enough money. Once Jarvis makes enough money to cover his expenses for the year and put some money into savings, he stops taking on clients for the remainder of the year. This way, he might work for six months and then spend the next six months traveling, writing, making music, working on side projects and exploring his hobbies – some of which do end up earning him some extra cash. This is just one of the benefits of being your own boss. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: Change by Design, by Tim Brown You’ve just learned that to do truly meaningful work you need to break free from dogmatic thinking and follow your own passions and values, even if it’s daunting. But no matter how creative and courageous you are, you’ll inevitably sometimes face seemingly insurmountable problems that make you want to throw up your hands and exclaim, “I give up!” What should you do in these situations? In Change by Design, Tim Brown, chief executive of the legendary IDEO design company, pushes for an approach to solving problems based on design methods, whether you’re an employee or have your own business. So if you want to learn more about how to attack any problem with a design mind-set, head over to the blinks to Change by Design.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Pozen","summary":"People tend to think that increased productivity is going to be exhausting. They believe that they’ll have to work all the time, at full capacity, to fulfill their ambitions. But in fact the opposite is true. The more productive you are, the faster you can finish your work. That means more time to do the things that matter to you. And, as a consequence, you will be more happy and refreshed, which will make you even more productive. So how can we enter this positive cycle? It’s really all about simplicity. Productivity is about developing a certain Zen sense of busyness, expending minimal effort for maximum results. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to plan your work efficiently; how to stop losing time and find focus; and why you really can work less than eight hours a day. Planning ahead, whether it’s for next year, next month or even next week, can be a daunting task when you’re drowning in work. But looking down the line will pay off big time in the long run. To get yourself thinking more long-term, begin organizing your work. Split up tasks into aims, objectives and targets so that you can begin to prioritize. A good strategy is to divide tasks according to how long they take to accomplish. For instance, career aims take five years or more. These are things like expanding your business network or landing an executive-level promotion. Objectives take between three and 24 months. For example, if you work for a shoe company, an objective might be to re-brand a sneaker line. And finally, targets are anything that will take three months or less, such as writing progress reports or finishing part of a major project. Objectives and targets are both essential. After all, if you don’t focus on these baseline endeavors, you’ll never reach your larger career aims. But it’s also important to prioritize aims, objectives and targets that both you and your employer are on board with. You should first focus on the things that both you and your boss want to achieve; once that’s done, you can address the tasks that concern only you. For example, say you want to meet more people in your industry and also want to re-brand your firm’s sneaker line to boost profits. Since your employer also wants the second thing to happen, you would do best to focus on the re-branding first. Then, once you’ve parsed out your tasks, it’s time to set some top priorities, that is, the projects on which you’ll spend the majority of your time. To ensure you’re doing this effectively, you should track your work days, monitoring how you allocate your time. You might discover that you spend lots of time on activities that don’t have much to do with your objectives or targets. Maybe you’re going to too many internal meetings and failing to prioritize the important ones. How you allocate your time is crucial to your productivity, which leads us to another issue: procrastination. Have you ever found yourself with tons of work to do and no idea where to start? Situations like this can be paralyzing, so it’s essential to know how to deal with them. One approach is to break your projects down into smaller targets, for which you can set mini-deadlines. After all, if you’re like most people, you’ll only start working when the pressure begins to build. But instead of waiting until the last minute to churn out a sloppy piece of caffeine-fuelled work, a better approach is to set smaller deadlines that split tasks up into more manageable chunks. That way you can finish your work step-by-step, well ahead of its due date. When using this approach, you should set your deadlines at similar intervals and avoid having them all pile up at the end. For instance, say you have to write a 6,000-word report in four weeks. Your deadlines could be to write 2,000 words every week for the first three weeks and to spend the final week proofreading and adjusting. From there, you can hold yourself to your deadlines by sharing them with your boss, which adds some extra pressure and makes you more accountable. For instance, you could tell your boss that you’re working on an analysis of your company’s competitors and that you’ve split the task into four chapters. From there, you could say that you’re going to begin on Monday and that you’ll have the report in her mailbox by Friday. You could even make a calendar event that you invite your boss to so that she gets a reminder about the due date. Such an approach guarantees that you’ll deliver on your promises, since you won’t want to disappoint your boss. But remember, it’s also key to reward yourself after successfully meeting a deadline. So treat yourself to a nice meal or an interesting book to let yourself know you’ve done well. At one time or another, you’ve probably spent so much time on small, simple tasks that you never got around to completing the tasks that truly matter. That’s why, when doing work, it’s important to get the smaller pieces out of the way right off the bat. After all, spending too much time on a small, low-priority task will waste both your time and your patience. So instead of allocating a lot of time to work that’s not super important, do the simple things quickly to free up more time for the meatier tasks. For instance, each day you’ll be faced with different requests from your colleagues, your boss and your family. As these tasks come in, it’s important to decide as quickly as possible whether or not you’re going to handle them. If you are, it’s then up to you to do so hastily. A good approach here is to apply the OHIO principle, also known as “Only Handle it Once.” For example, say you receive an email inviting you to a conference. You quickly browse the email then set it aside. Three days later, you remember the message, but don’t remember the name of the sender. As a result, you spend countless minutes scrolling back through your inbox. From there, you’ve got to read it again, wasting yet more time! On the other hand, if you were using the OHIO principle, you’d check if the date was free and the topic interesting and make a decision straight away. Another way to move forward with your work, is to fight the temptation to be perfect when it comes to your low-priority tasks. Remember that not everything needs to be done flawlessly. You should reserve this privilege for your top-level work, since this is what your boss will see and judge. Nobody is going to be pleased if you spend loads of time answering meaningless emails, so handle such tasks accordingly: get through them quickly and move on to the important stuff. Anytime you read anything, whether it’s a novel or a blog post, you get a glimpse inside the mind of the author. Pretty quickly, you can ascertain whether that mind is neatly ordered or dramatically chaotic. And, if you yourself are a writer, your readers will learn much about the inner workings of your brain from the flow of your prose. So to improve the efficiency and quality of your writing, you need to add structure to the process. You can do this by brainstorming, categorizing and then outlining. In the brainstorm phase, write down whatever thoughts come to mind about the subject. Don’t worry about order and structure; paint in the broadest strokes possible. For instance, imagine you’ve been tasked with writing a pitch to your company’s executives about how to make the firm more environmentally friendly. You could begin by brainstorming things like company image, product package redesign, energy costs, carbon emissions and LED bulbs. From there comes the categorizing phase, during which you add some order to your ideas. Group your ideas into categories and then into subcategories. In the case of the environmental pitch, your categories might be intangible gains, such as company image and values; waste and energy, into which packaging and LEDs would fall; and profits and losses, which covers energy costs, carbon emissions and strategic positioning. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to outline your piece by arranging your categories in a logical sequence. In the above example the categories are already in the correct order and all you’ve got to do is write them out, adding an introduction and conclusion. But efficient writing isn’t just about structure. It also requires time and quiet. After all, how are you supposed to focus with your phone ringing, emails constantly flying into your inbox and colleagues pestering you? Try going to the office early, when nobody is around, or staying a bit later, after your coworkers have left. Or if your job involves traveling by train or plane, take this excellent opportunity to do some focused writing! Do you judge the quality of a book on how long it took the author to write it? Of course not. And the same is true of work. Results are what count. The number of hours spent on any given project is irrelevant. After all, can you think of a single customer or colleague that would want you to spend more time on something if that extra time led to worse results? For instance, say you write two reports. The first one, on which you spent eight hours, turns out bad because you started it late and were anxious while writing it. The second, which took you only three hours to write, is excellent because you prepared for it and knew just what to write. Which one do you think your boss will prefer? The point is, it’s totally irrational to value the number of hours you spend on something over the quality of the result. That being said, while working faster doesn’t mean you always leave the office early, it does mean should feel free to take some time off. It makes no sense to embrace a culture that favors long hours over productivity. Unfortunately, lots of managers still put more emphasis on hours worked than on results produced. They tend, often subconsciously, to value workers who put in overtime and weekend hours. As a result, many managers claim to favor results but in practice prefer employees who work long hours. Given what you now know about productivity, this is obviously a problem. However, it’s one that you can change by preventing such a culture from taking root. To do so, simply avoid making remarks that reinforce the importance of working long hours. For instance, if a colleague leaves early, don’t say things like, “Hey, banking hours?” And, if a coworker comes in late, avoid comments like, “Look who finally decided to show up!” By avoiding such snide remarks you’ll be improving your workplace culture. Of course, there are other benefits to cutting back on long hours. For one, it gives you more time for your private life, whether that means an outing with your family or getting some exercise. Most people just work and work and work, thinking that’s the most productive approach. But productivity is about much more than work. It’s also closely connected to your personal life and general lifestyle. After all, the point of being efficient at work is to make time for your life outside of work. It’s important to prioritize non-work related activities and to stick to the standards you set. This is essential for protecting your personal and family time. For instance, you could make a rule that you’ll always be home by a certain hour. If something urgent comes up that absolutely can’t be postponed, make a plan with your boss to finish it from home or come in early to finish it up. Remember, making sure you have time to spend with your family is essential, whether that means cooking together, sharing a conversation over dinner or, if you have kids, reading them a bedtime story. However you do it, it’s key to make sure that you’re there for the ones you love. But to make such a goal a reality, you need to show your boss that you’re reliable. Build trust with her and she’ll allow you to go home earlier or make up time another next day. If possible, learn to say no to late meetings. Simply postpone them, making a strong point that you need to go have dinner with your family. And in the best-case scenario, just take a job at a company with flexible working hours. A 2008 survey found that flexible hours are the single most important determining factor for employees when considering a job offer, which, as these blinks hopefully made clear, makes perfect sense. For instance, imagine your partner suddenly falls ill, or that your kid is in a play that starts at 5 p.m. You wouldn’t want to be stuck at work during such important times and, the truth is, you don’t have to be. The key message in this book: Productivity relies on efficiency. That means nothing will stop you from becoming a faster, smarter worker if you set clear goals and priorities. This results-driven approach will do away with procrastination, break up big projects and clearly define your working hours. Actionable advice Increase your productivity by reading faster. The key to reading faster isn’t to read more words per minute. It’s to read fewer words in total. To try this out just pick up a book on a topic that interests you. Read the introduction, then the conclusion and end by skimming the body for the information you want. You will almost certainly have gleaned the most important information you were looking for.

Maxwell","summary":"The world these days is a competitive place where success is the only currency that counts. Failure, which is usually considered the opposite of success, or even an obstacle on the road to it, is seen as a something to be avoided at all costs. But are our failures always such disasters? Not necessarily – and it may well be time to review our opinions about failure as a concept. Contrary to popular belief, failure actually isn’t the opposite of success, but rather a necessary part of it. Failure doesn’t need to be avoided. Instead, it should be embraced, because we can learn from it and become stronger in the future as a result. In these blinks, you will learn why failure can be a good thing. You will see why failure is an opportunity, what it can teach you and how you can overcome it. Learning to fail today will help you be successful tomorrow. You’ll also learn how a marketing debacle paved the way for Coca-Cola’s greatest success; how the experience of failure led Thomas Edison to develop the world’s first recording device; and why Peanuts cartoon character Charlie Brown shouldn’t be a role model. While most of us do our best to avoid failure, most entrepreneurs know better. The majority of successful businesspeople attribute their success to their ability to persevere after failures. In fact, it takes entrepreneurs an average of 3.8 failed ventures before they manage to start a successful business. These entrepreneurs recognize that even if their business eventually fails, they’ll be in a better position than they were when they started. But if their fear of failure had stopped them at the beginning, they wouldn’t have gotten anywhere. In the real world, a single failure doesn’t always mean the end of the road. Take Sergio Zyman, a marketing executive for Coca-Cola in the 1980s. When Zyman launched the new Diet Coke range, it was hugely popular. This success bolstered Zyman’s standing in the company and gave him more confidence in his daring ideas. So later, when Coca-Cola wanted to introduce a new formula for Coke, Zyman proposed to introduce it under the name “New Coke.” Zyman believed the new idea would sell so well that he convinced Coca-Cola to stop producing the old version. To Zyman’s surprise, New Coke was a complete flop. The rebranded bottles failed to sell, costing Coca-Cola approximately $100 million, and Zyman his job. To recover from this blow, Coca-Cola reintroduced their flagship drink under a new name: Coca-Cola Classic. As it turned out, Coca-Cola Classic was a huge hit. The drink became more popular than ever, and Zyman’s failure to transform the brand in the first instance ended up leading to a great success for the company in the long run. In 1993, Coca-Cola chairman Roberto Goizueta rehired Zyman, acknowledging that daring thinkers can’t be right every time. While we largely assume failure can only lead to negative outcomes, the opposite is often true. Many chance discoveries and new opportunities have emerged from failures. This was certainly the case for legendary inventor Thomas Edison. Edison worked for years to improve the telegraph machine, with little success. But along the way, he discovered something else entirely. By making certain adjustments to his failed telegraph machines, he was able to record sound that could be played back again and again. Edison used his lack of success in one pursuit as an opportunity to develop something entirely new. Twentieth-century author William Marston referred to experiences like Edison’s as “drawing dividends from failure.” Marston, who was an inventor as well as a psychologist, believed that this ability was crucial to success. Beyond opening our eyes to new possibilities, failure can be a powerful incentive to work hard and change our lives. Consider the story of the billionaire founder of Home Depot, Bernie Marcus. In 1978, he was fired from his role as CEO of hardware chain Handy Dan as a result of internal conflicts. At the time, Marcus’s parents required his financial support to make ends meet. Marcus was determined never to fall victim to a corporate power struggle again. He enlisted Arthur Blank, a coworker that had also been fired from Handy Dan, and together they opened their own hardware store the following year. Today, their store – Home Depot – is known as one of the most successful retail endeavors in history. Most of the time, failures occur as a result of factors that we can’t control. When that happens, we don’t need to blame ourselves, we just need to take responsibility for finding new solutions. The author recounts the story of his friend, Greg Horn, whose supermarket was destroyed in the 1997 Kentucky floods. Ironically, Horn was insured for almost every type of damage and theft – except flood damage. Obviously, the floods were beyond Horn’s control. But he wasn’t deterred by his unfortunate circumstances. Rather than giving up, Horn took responsibility for his situation and resolved to get his store up and running again as quickly as possible. While continuing to support all 80 of his employees, Horn got to work on fixing the store. The repairs cost him $1 million, but he was able to reopen the store only 21 days after the flood. Horn’s story shows that we can only shape our future by taking responsibility for our circumstances. For another example, think of American tennis player Roger Crawford. Crawford was born without many of his fingers and toes, a condition known as ectrodactylism. In spite of his condition, Crawford took the attitude that he was still responsible for his future. He chased his dream of becoming a professional tennis player, eventually receiving certification from the American Professional Tennis Association as the first American tennis professional with a disability. Crawford attributes his success to the responsibility he takes for his own life, which ran a very different course to another man he knew with ectrodactylism. Unlike Crawford, the man thought of himself as a victim of unfair circumstances, and he felt bitter about the world – an attitude that prevented him from succeeding. Could you imagine starting a new project and aiming to fail? Probably not; most of us prefer to avoid making mistakes. And yet, failure always has the potential to create instructive, even inspiring, learning experiences. The power of embracing failure is illustrated poignantly in an anecdote from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s 1993 book Art and Fear: a ceramics teacher divides her class in two and tells one half that they’ll be graded on the quantity of art they make, and so should make as many pieces as they can. The other half are told to focus on creating one piece, the quality of which will determine their grade. Though the latter group spent longer crafting a single work of art, they were outshone by the first group, which produced pieces of notably higher quality. Because they were able to learn from their mistakes with each subsequent piece they made, the students in the first group were able to develop both their skills and their creative ideas along the way. It’s important to note that we only learn from failure when we’re determined to understand it. One strip from the comic Peanuts reflects on this phenomenon. Charlie Brown is building a sand castle at the beach, which gets flattened by a wave. He looks down at the sand castle and knows there’s something to be learned from the situation – but he doesn’t attempt to figure out what the lesson is. Like Charlie Brown, in the wake of failure many people tell themselves that they don’t have the time or energy to investigate what went wrong. But this simply puts us at risk of making the same mistake again. Identifying the causes of failure allows us to learn, grow and, in Charlie Brown’s case, build sand castles farther away from the waves. When you drive across town, how often do you catch only green lights? Probably never, but that’s alright – it’s just a part of driving. How might life be if we saw our failures as red lights? They might stop us temporarily, but they aren’t a reason to give up on our destination. Failure can feel very discouraging, but this doesn’t have to be the case. Fear of failure is debilitating and can damage our chances of achieving success, so it’s crucial that we fight it at every opportunity. Just consider pioneering American aviator Amelia Earhart’s story. When attempting to fly around the equator, she crashed her plane on takeoff. Despite this, she wasn’t discouraged and pushed on with her flying career. She eventually achieved no less than six world records, including that of the first solo female pilot to fly across the Atlantic. We can also take heart in the fact that we overcome our fear of failure in countless daily activities. Driving a car, for instance, is a dangerous activity, but we do it anyway. In fact, choosing to cycle or stay at home out of fear of having a car crash might even put you at greater risk: a total of 15 and 17 percent of accidents resulting in injuries are linked to cycling and home-based activities, respectively. Our professional lives also provide opportunities to overcome our fear of failure and act. Suggesting a daring strategy or proposing to take on more responsibility are great ways to confront your fear of failure and earn the respect of your team, too. Refusing to take risks, on the other hand, is more likely to leave your team members feeling like you’re, at best, unambitious, and at worst, lazy. Taking risks inevitably leads to failure some of the time, but by embracing this, you’ll be more likely to win big in the long run. Learning to embrace and overcome failure opens up new opportunities for success. But to be able to use these opportunities, you’ll need to practice three things: goal-setting, people skills and a positive mindset. American writer Don Marquis noted that while most people don’t truly know what they want, they’re still willing to sweat blood to get it. The trick to success is channeling this desire for change into well-defined objectives. So, rather than simply complaining that you’re tired of working, set goals that’ll allow you to create a better lifestyle. For example, you could invest in property to create a passive income that’ll allow you to retire sooner. Along with goal-setting, outstanding people skills can carry you to success. Today, most jobs, projects and goals can only be achieved by mobilizing stakeholders, investors, teams and employees. By spending time working on your communication, negotiation and conversational skills, you’ll be better able to win the support of your peers and open up new opportunities for achieving your ambitions. Finally, maintaining a positive mindset gives you an immediate advantage. Learning to see the value in even the most trying of experiences can be the difference between giving up and persevering. American author W. Clement Stone once told the story of a girl who, after moving across America to join her husband, became dissatisfied with her new life. In a letter written by her mother, the girl learned of an old anecdote about two men in prison. When one looked up from the prison bars, he saw mud. When the other looked up, he saw stars. The girl realized that while she was unable to change her situation in life, she was able to change her attitude toward it. By adopting a positive outlook, she learned to discover new opportunities that her dissatisfaction had blinded her to. The key message in this book: Failure is inevitable, but it can also be beneficial. From revealing new ideas and pushing us to become our best, to helping us learn about our weaknesses, experiences of failure provide us with valuable opportunities. Along with clear goal-setting and a positive mindset, embracing failure is key to unlocking success.  Actionable Advice Seek out stories of failure that inspire you.  Is there an entrepreneur, leader or dreamer that inspires you, from the past or present? Though their successes might be what makes them a role model to you, try spending some time researching their lives to find out more about their failed ideas as well. Not only will this give you a deeper understanding of their successes, their missteps might also offer an inspiring lesson or two. Got feedback?

In other words, do you have some sense of direction and purpose in your personal and professional life? If you can’t answer a clear and loud “yes” to these questions, don’t fret; many people don’t know why they do what they do and, as a result, don’t return home from work at the end of each day feeling fulfilled. These blinks are about finding your WHY, such that you can wake up in the morning feeling inspired to go to work. You’ll discover how to realize your WHY and how to start living by it, whether it means gathering stories from your past to discover your WHY, or sharing it with a group of strangers. You’ll also learn how getting your seat neighbor to talk about his WHY can turn tedious small talk into intriguing conversation; why specificity is the key to the WHY process; and how “hows” are the actions that bring a WHY to life. If you’ve ever felt lost or unfulfilled in life, it might be a result of not identifying purpose in your life – or, as the author Simon Sinek likes to call it, not knowing your WHY. Finding your WHY can be challenging, but once you have it in your life, you can wake up each morning with purpose and determination. Sinek discovered his WHY after he’d lost all passion for his work. At the time, he was feeling depressed and getting lots of advice from people, but none of it felt applicable to his situation. After some soul-searching, he realized his WHY was to inspire others, and once he took this to heart, he began to see his life more clearly and with more optimism. Knowing his WHY gave Sinek’s life direction, and he soon found that this confidence was appealing to others. This not only applies to people, but also to companies. A case in point is Apple, which has strong competitors offering cheaper products with more features. But Apple’s customers are loyal and inspired by their motto “Think Different,” which perfectly describes their WHY. Customers would rather give money to a business with a progressive identity than save a few bucks buying from a more generic company. To see how compelling a strong purpose can be in the marketplace, let’s look at two advertising pitches for a paper company: The first one highlights the paper’s superior quality and affordable price; the second one highlights the company’s mission of creating a fine product that allows people to document their ideas and share them with the world. This second pitch is far more compelling and attractive, simply because it explains the company’s WHY. Sometimes we need to advertise ourselves as well, especially when we’re in a job interview. When a client of one of the authors named Emily found herself shortlisted for a job and sitting in front of a panel of executives, she was asked what made her unique. This was Emily’s chance to share her WHY, so she spoke about her eagerness to work with others and help people become the best version of themselves. With her clear understanding of her WHY, it’s no surprise that Emily got the job. If you dread going to work and find your job exhausting, then you’re clearly doing something that does not speak to your WHY. Once you find a job you’re passionate about, even the most repetitive and banal tasks become easy to tackle. A great way to find that passion is to work your way through the golden circle. The golden circle was introduced in Simon Sinek’s previous book, Start With WHY, and illustrates how we tend to operate on three levels. The first level, the outer circle, is all about “WHAT” we do, while the middle circle is “HOW” we do it. Finally, at the center is the golden circle, which determines “WHY” we do it. When all of these circles are aligned, you’ll find passion for your work. While on a flight, the author met a man named Steve who’d been at his job for 23 years and was still excited by his work. How is this possible? Well, WHAT Steve did was produce steel; HOW he did it was by manufacturing a pure product that is easier to recycle and creates less pollution; and WHY he does it is to keep the environment clean for future generations. Steve’s WHY has kept him energized and passionate for over two decades – but if you’re still wondering how to find your WHY, try looking into your past. In helping one young woman identify her WHY, the authors performed a discovery exercise that involved the woman sharing personal stories from her past. This revealed painful, but nevertheless useful, information, as many of her stories highlighted her desire to protect her younger sister from their abusive father. So a strong WHY for this young woman would be a career in protecting vulnerable people who can’t protect themselves. In the next blink, we’ll move on to look at other ways you can get help finding your WHY. If you’ve gone over a dozen stories from your past and still can’t find your WHY, don’t panic. Sometimes it’s difficult to identify a common theme in the things that are important to us, and if this is the case, it might be time to bring in a fresh perspective. Another person who knows you well can be a valuable resource in identifying your WHY. This person doesn’t need to be someone you’re intimate with, just someone who’s curious and observant. It can help if the person you’re talking to isn’t overly familiar with your background and is someone who will ask thoughtful questions – and even take detailed notes. Asking specific questions is very important to finding your WHY, and these questions often lead to vital details and intense feelings. With the right probing questions, something like “As a child, I loved visiting my cousins during summer vacation,” can become, “I loved visiting my cousins because we could explore the woods along their property and find fascinating things in nature.” With these details, common themes can emerge and point the way to your WHY. A good listener who is engaged and asks questions will draw parallels between different stories, even when they might seem like completely unrelated stories to you. This was the case with Todd, who shared three very different stories. The first one was about losing his basketball scholarship due to his addictive behaviors; the second was about feeling frustrated and useless while working as a bartender; and the third was about coming home from work and giving all his tips to a local girl who had set up a lemonade stand, which made him feel useful. Listening to his stories, the authors identified a running theme that pointed to Todd’s WHY, which is his desire to do work that really matters and to help others do more with their life. Even if you’ve found a profession you love, you can still end up feeling frustrated and disheartened if you’re working for a company that doesn’t have a clear vision, or WHY. Even worse, that company might be your own! To prevent this from happening, there’s a simple WHY Discovery Workshop you can run to share different stories and form a strong WHY for your company. One particularly memorable workshop was held by the espresso machine company, La Marzocco. Employees were urged to share stories that reflected how it felt to work for the company. One employee recalled a photography event at the store that brought the staff together and made them feel connected. This story triggered many others just like it, and La Marzocco’s WHY statement soon came into focus: to bring people together over coffee for lively conversation. Another situation a company can find itself in is to have a WHY, or mission statement, that was once clear but has since changed with the times or fallen by the wayside. A WHY Discovery Workshop can help here, too. Cuestamoras is a self-service supermarket that Enrique Uribe brought to Costa Rica in the 1950s. Recently, however, he felt his business was no longer in touch with its initial vision. So Uribe and his brothers decided to take part in a workshop that helped them re-identify and clarify what their business stood for now. By sharing their stories of what the store meant to them today, the WHY became a spark for innovation and helped create opportunities for everyone in the community. Uribe isn’t so young anymore, but he can now rest easy, knowing that his brothers and children can always look back at his original concepts for WHY Cuestamoras began. His vision will continue to inspire future generations and help them stay on the right path. A WHY Discovery Workshop can help a business define their corporate culture, as well as their mission statement and vision for the future – all of which will make it easier for employees to make the right decisions on the ground. So far, we’ve paid a lot of attention to the WHY, but it’s also important not to lose sight of the other parts of the golden circle. So, once you have an understanding of your purpose in life, it’s time to look to the HOWs. After all, HOWs are the actions that bring the WHY to life, which make them a crucial part of the broader process. To uncover your HOWs, think about your day-to-day activities and how your behavior is helping you achieve your WHY. Co-author Peter Docker’s WHY is to help make it possible for others to do extraordinary things, and he has a few HOWs to make this happen. These include reaching new frontiers, creating strong relationships, simplifying things and never losing sight of the larger context. Knowing your coworkers’ HOWs can be a major advantage as well. Peter often works with David Mead at “Start with WHY” events. At these events, everyone’s “WHY” is the same, since the goal is to help people unlock their potential. But Peter and David really make these events a success by knowing how the other works and how to combine their skills to have the greatest effect. For example, there was once a client who wanted to bring 150 people to a workshop that is normally designed for a maximum of 40 people. What’s more, the workshop generally lasts a full day, but the client only had four hours to spare. Peter and David put their heads together and each one relied on the other’s HOWs to bring 150 WHYs to life. David knows how to be innovative, and he used this HOW to adapt the content to fit 150 people in four hours and still have it be a transformative event. Peter knows how to make things simple, which was extremely useful in this situation, particularly with getting everyone on board with the instructions and requirements of the workshop. To know someone’s HOWs is to understand the way they work, and with this knowledge, you can play to their strengths, divide tasks and collaborate effectively so that every challenge can be turned into a success. Every now and again, we’re presented with a tough decision, whether it’s a project proposal, partnership or job offer. Having a keen understanding of your own HOWs is key to avoiding disasters and making the right choices that will allow you to flourish. To really understand your HOWs, you need to break them down to their core essence. The author, Simon Sinek, knows how to focus on the long term, but this HOW can be broken down – more precisely, Sinek focuses on creating products, services and ideas that will continue to be used long after he’s gone. It also means he’s less focused on deadlines and ways to make a quick profit, and more interested in building lasting momentum for his company. Getting to the bottom of your HOWs isn’t just about self-awareness – it can also reveal where opportunities lie. By being aware of his HOWs, Sinek can better determine which opportunities are aligned with his WHY, or his overall goals. A few years ago, Sinek was approached by an executive of a major corporation to start a new company that would “put people first.” Since his WHY is to inspire others to achieve their dreams, this was a tempting offer. But Sinek dug deeper into his potential partner’s motivations and began to realize he was more interested in making a quick profit, which is not how Sinek does things. Another one of Sinek’s HOWs is to look at things from a different or unconventional perspective, which was yet another approach his potential partner wasn’t interested in. So, knowing that this project wasn’t aligned with his HOWs or his WHY, it was obvious that this opportunity wouldn’t be a good fit for him. In the end, he was able to make the right choice and politely declined. Sure, the partnership would have looked great on his resume and expanded his list of clients, but he also knows it would have been a bad experience. If you find yourself in a situation that doesn’t feel right, you can use your HOWs to identify an imbalance and hopefully make the necessary adjustments to straighten things out. Part of the journey to reaching a fulfilling life is uncovering your WHY and understanding your HOWs. But the hard work doesn’t end there; next comes the task of sharing it with the world. Start by offering your WHY statement to those who ask, “What do you do?” This is a common question in any social situation, and it’s an opportunity to start getting comfortable with expressing your mission in life. Try it with the person sitting next to you on a plane, a fellow guest at a party or a stranger in a waiting room. You might be a little uncomfortable at first, but that’s the good thing about strangers – chances are you’ll never see them again. It also gives you the chance to fine-tune your WHY into a message you feel comfortable and confident saying. More importantly, sharing your WHY with the world will push you to commit to it and back up your words with actions. The more you give voice to your intentions, the more likely you’ll be to follow through with them. Also, if your WHY statement is something like “helping people become the best version of themselves,” you could imagine that some might roll their eyes when they hear it. This is why you’ll want to have some actions that back up this bold assertion. As for your business, there are a number of reasons to constantly refer back to its mission statement. For starters, it will make it readily apparent when a product or service becomes outdated, or no longer relevant. But it’s also useful in matters of human resources, such as knowing what to look for during the hiring process, or recognizing when an employee’s WHY isn’t in line with the company’s. Finally, you’ll be sure to find the most productive arrangements possible when you can match the WHYs of your staff with the roles that best suit them. So the more others are familiar with your WHY and the more familiar you are with the WHYs of others, the better off we’ll all be, both personally and professionally. The key message in this book: Not knowing your purpose in life, or your WHY, can be a frustrating and confusing experience for individuals, businesses and teams. But there are ways to look within, understand your WHY and begin to live a motivated, passionate and productive life. When you fully realize your WHY, you can start thriving in both your personal and professional life. Actionable advice: To find your WHY, look to your most formative stories. Our stories are an important part of the WHY discovery. When sharing your stories with someone who can help you discover important personal themes, it is important to share both good experiences and bad ones. They could be from your childhood or adulthood, as long as they played an important role in shaping the person you have become. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But what good is an excellent idea if you can’t convince other people of its merits? After all, you’ll probably need the support of others if you’re going to make it happen. Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking for investors to fund your new startup, or you’re a talented software engineer trying to get the attention of Google’s recruiters, your chances of success often hinge on your powers of persuasion. That’s where great communication – both written and verbal – comes into play. Great communication is what enables you to bring others to your side of the argument. But what is great communication? In these blinks, we’ll learn the communication secrets of the twentieth century’s greatest orators, such as John F. Kennedy and Winston Churchill, and brush up on the principles of engaging, effective presentations. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you should tell stories at job interviews; what communication skills you can learn from NASA; and why a fifth grader should be able to understand your arguments. The day Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in 1969 marked the end of an incredible journey of collective brainpower, hard work and scientific discovery. Most importantly though, the project was underpinned by effective communication. Throughout the 1960s, US president John F. Kennedy used his exemplary communication skills to spark the imagination of thousands of NASA employees – employees who would, in the same decade, turn the dream of space travel into a reality. And it wasn’t just NASA workers; Kennedy inspired the entire country to get behind the mission to put a man on the moon. To understand how Kennedy’s speeches on space travel inspired so many Americans into action, we need to look at the various rhetorical techniques the president employed during his oration. Firstly, whenever Kennedy made speeches about NASA's space program, he always focused on one goal. Why? Because he understood that it’s simpler to get a team behind just one shared goal, instead of splitting their attention by laying out multiple goals. When NASA was first formed in 1958, the organization actually had several objectives. They wanted to create world-leading space technology, further scientific progress and also become the preeminent power in space. However, Kennedy simply focused on the single objective of putting a man on the moon and getting him back to Earth safely. Therefore, if you want people to rally around your objectives, don’t make them too diffuse. Focus people’s minds on a single goal if you want to see powerful results. Secondly, Kennedy used the power of communication to translate NASA’s overarching aspiration into a concrete, measurable objective. In other words, he took something abstract, namely NASA’s ultimate aspiration to further scientific progress by investigating the solar system, and turned it into something much more tangible that his listeners could understand and hold onto. For instance, Kennedy made a 1961 speech to the US Congress in which he stated that the United States should dedicate itself to the specific goal of achieving a moon landing before the end of the decade. In order to achieve your overall aspirations, don’t be afraid to translate them into tangible goals, and don’t forget to create concrete timelines for their completion. Meet Haseeb Qureshi, a software engineer from Texas who is in high demand in Silicon Valley. When he began looking for a job, he only had one year of experience in coding, was significantly older than other applicants and did not have a degree in computer science. On paper he had little chance of securing a great job; so how did he end up with offers from prestigious tech companies like Google, Airbnb, Yelp and Uber? It was all thanks to the power of communication – and specifically his incredible interview skills. If you’d also like to secure the job of your dreams, take a tip from Qureshi and tell interviewers a compelling story about yourself. Qureshi understood that success in interviews doesn’t just come down to proving that you have the technical ability to do the job. If you really want to stand out, you need to communicate those technical skills through the medium of storytelling. To construct a compelling story that will wow interviewers, start by thinking of yourself as a character in your own life story. Structure your narrative so that it contains a start, midpoint and ending. When thinking about what to include, things like understandable motivations for your actions and points of inflection are essential. For instance, when interviewers asked Qureshi to tell them about a time when he fixed a bug in a computer system, he didn’t give a dull, technical response. Instead, he told a story about a hero on a journey of discovery, in which the main protagonist – that is, Qureshi – faced a challenge and used the difficult experience to improve himself. If you want to tell these stories convincingly, you’ll need to practice them again and again. Think of what questions might come up and consider how you can use storytelling to answer them. You could then make audio recordings of yourself telling your friends these different story-based answers. And don’t forget to ask your practice audience for feedback too, in order to check how your communication skills are coming along. This is exactly what Qureshi did, and it worked so well for him that he eventually signed up to work for Airbnb – on a $250,000 starting salary. It just goes to show that great communication can bring substantial rewards. The leaders of NASA are on a mission: to investigate outer space and use the insights gleaned to improve life here on earth. But in order to achieve this, NASA needs to also ensure that the American people support its space programme. Otherwise, the funding for their projects will dry up and they’ll have to shut down. To make sure this never happens, NASA has developed an additional mission: to get the public excited about space, and inspire all Americans to want to explore the universe. NASA has accomplished their latter mission by employing excellent presentation skills, which we should all try to emulate. One of NASA’s rules for presenting, and one you’ll want to adopt as well, is to keep things brief. For instance, in response to the amazing 2017 discovery of several new planets that were the same size as earth and located not too far away from us, NASA delivered a press conference. Crucially, they ensured this press conference was brief – only 18 minutes long. Why? Because research has shown that when people receive a deluge of information all at once, the result is often what scientists call a “cognitive backlog,” meaning that the part of our memory that deals with new information becomes full and we can’t process everything. In light of this, NASA always adheres to a tried and tested 18 minutes for press briefings, finding this the optimal length before a discussion becomes boring. Therefore, if you want to make your communications more engaging, try shortening your presentations to a short and snappy 15 to 20 minutes. You should also consider adding some pictures to that short and sweet presentation if you want to kick your communication skills up to NASA’s caliber. NASA’s website also offers numerous photos and videos about space exploration that members of the public can download for free; NASA knows that visual imagery is key to great communication. Research has found that when information is delivered verbally, the receiver will later remember only around 10 percent of it. However, if you add just one picture to this verbal content, then the listener will remember a staggering 65 percent of the information. So if you want people to remember your great ideas, think about how you can incorporate photos or illustrations into the delivery. Many people in the tech sector would kill to work at Google; thousands apply to the search giant every year, and only the best make the cut. But if the Google workforce is already the elite, what do the elite teams at Google look like? In 2012, Google themselves set out to answer this question. They asked a team of researchers to find out the habits of the company’s most effective teams, and planned to use this information to assemble even better teams in the future. However, what the researchers discovered upended all their assumptions. As it turned out, who the members of a team were mattered little. In fact, what made the difference between a good team and a great team at Google was how its members communicated with each other. The researchers came to the conclusion that the most successful and effective teams share three specific traits. Firstly, effective teams demonstrate a high level of what the researchers called “psychological safety.” This means that everyone in the team feels secure in their freedom to take risks, is confident in speaking out and also feels comfortable enough to express vulnerability in full view of their teammates. Secondly, the best teams are those that exhibit a high level of clarity. Every member of the team has clearly defined roles and clear goals that they were each working toward. The last hallmark of successful teams is impact. Members are certain that their job makes a difference, that their work matters and clearly understand how their work contributes to the wider goals of the organization. Therefore, if you want to use the power of communication to create your own crack team, ensure you build an emotional aspect into any team-building exercises you undertake. If you’re a leader, try to share personal stories with your team, even if doing so makes you feel vulnerable. This will encourage others to do so too, helping to increase the psychological safety of your working environment. In addition, ensure you communicate the team’s goals and a clear roadmap for how you can all achieve them together. Lastly, take the time to communicate to each individual how their role has a positive impact on the company at large. The story of how Nike got started is undoubtedly one of the most well-known business origin stories around. It began when their cofounder Bill Bowerman, an athletics coach at the University of Oregon, found that his runners’ training shoes couldn’t properly grip the university’s new polyurethane running track. Frustrated, Bill set about trying to design a new running shoe with improved grip, famously using a waffle iron as a mold for his prototype soles. Bill’s early attempts may have destroyed a lot of waffle irons, but this origin story is one of the most powerful tools that Nike has at its disposal today, serving as a metaphor for the brand’s innovative spirit. Why is this story so powerful? It all comes down to pathos. Pathos refers to the act of convincing an audience by making an emotional appeal to them. The Nike origins story, for instance, has a lot of pathos. The company’s most senior executives regularly communicate the heartwarming narrative of its cofounders selling the first Nike running shoes out of the back of their car and those first brave experiments with the waffle iron. This narrative also often includes the tragic story of one of Bowerman’s most famous athletes, Steve Prefontaine, a legendary Oregon runner who died in a car crash. By emphasizing the heroic pathos in its backstory, the company is inspiring its modern-day employees. New workers are always taken on an initiation trip to see the original running track that frustrated and inspired Bill, and are also taken to the spot of Prefontaine’s fatal crash. Pathos is such an effective ingredient in communication because people have a hard-wired desire to hear stories about struggle, whether it relates to you or your brand. Humble beginnings, like those explored in the Nike origin story, are particularly attractive to us because they contain a rags-to-riches element. And we don’t just like these stories – we need them too. According to psychologists, struggle is an indispensable aspect of the human experience, as our brains have a propensity to make meaning out of hardship. Therefore, stories of victory over hardship, or success despite tragedy, speak to us because we intrinsically view struggle as a natural part of life. Neurological research even shows that we remember stories more accurately when they contain an element of struggle. So if you want people to start rooting for you or your brand, be sure to incorporate any adversity you’ve faced into the story of how you got where you are today. Ernest Hemingway is one of the twentieth century’s most famous writers. He won the Nobel prize, among many other awards, and several of his works are considered literary classics. But what was the secret of his world-famous writing? He kept things simple. Despite being an acknowledged literary genius and intending his books to be for adult audiences, Hemingway used simple language that even a fifth-grader could easily understand. The lesson? If you want to be a great communicator, remember that just because a word is longer, it’s not better; it’s probably just more confusing. Whether you’re a leader, entrepreneur or instructor, you should always consider the grade level of the sentences and words you use to communicate ideas. Research has consistently shown that the typical American understands content best if it has been written at a tenth-grade level, or even a little lower. Although you might think that lowering the grade level of your communications will result in them being of poorer quality, the opposite may actually be true. Evidence suggests that as the grade level of writing increases, the content’s clarity may suffer, and people are less likely to understand what is being conveyed. In other words, a higher grade level does not necessarily indicate a higher quality of writing. And if you’re still not convinced that shorter is better, just consider the communication skills of one of the twentieth century’s most famous orators: Winston Churchill. He was well known for substituting shorter words for longer ones in his speeches, saying that he preferred shorter words because “the shorter words of a language are usually the most ancient.” So if you want to give your idea the best chance of catching people’s imagination, you’ll need to assess the grade level at which you’re communicating it. In order to do this, you can use the Readability Index. This is a highly dependable algorithm used by publishers of textbooks in the United States and is primarily used to assess whether a textbook’s content can be easily understood by its target grade audience. Individuals can use this index for themselves by putting their content into online programmes such as Hemingway – an app named after that famous advocate of simple language. The key message in these blinks: Great communication all starts with telling stories about yourself or your ideas. You can make these stories more compelling by adding an element of hardship into them. Additionally, when making presentations, keep things brief, include photos for maximum impact and don’t be afraid to make your content simple and easily understandable.  Actionable advice: Improve your presentations by transforming your thoughts and feelings. It’s normal to feel nerves before that important presentation at work, but what should you do if you get so nervous that it impacts your performance? Engaging in what psychologists call cognitive reframing may help. This is when you actively decide to change how you think about the upcoming situation. If you find yourself focusing on everything that could go wrong when you’re up on stage, try to reassess your thoughts, and instead focus on everything that could go right. Research shows that if we can change how we think about something, we can also change how we feel about it. So, if you can think positively about that presentation, you’ll likely feel less nervous.

However, being a large, ever-growing company won’t increase the odds of success – in fact, it often reduces them. In Focus, Al Ries explains how a company’s emphasis on growth can be its Achilles’ heel. The book will show you how “going global” with your company can be the death of it, and how keeping in step with technological changes is often essential to a company’s survival. Drawing from a wealth of examples, Ries presents the many common ways in which a company can develop its focus – for instance, by specializing – and in doing so increase its chances of succeeding in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Whether it’s a family-run bakery wanting to open a second location or a massive fast-food company aiming for total market domination, it seems that the one thing common to all businesses is their desire to grow. But have you ever questioned why companies are so fixated on growth? One reason is that growing will give them cost advantages. Certain company costs are fixed – they don’t change if the company increases its production – so the costs per unit decrease as the amount of units produced increases. For example, a bakery has variable costs for flour, yeast and other ingredients, and they vary according to the amount of bread it produces. It also has fixed costs, like the money it spent on its oven. Let’s say the oven cost $500 and the ingredients for one loaf of bread cost $1. If the bakery produces 100 loaves of bread, the fixed costs per loaf of bread are $500/100 = $5. So with the variable costs of $1, one loaf of bread would cost the bakery $6 if the total amount of loaves produced was 100. If the amount of loaves produced was 500, the costs for one loaf would sink to $2. Obviously, such cost advantages give companies a competitive edge. With lower costs, their products can be sold at more attractive prices, thus more customers are likely to buy them. Another reason that companies seek growth is that managers want to exploit the benefits that size brings (e.g., cost advantages). Naturally, managers want their company to make big profits, so it’s only logical they’d aim to increase revenues and decrease costs. This is why managers make growth the primary objective of companies. Take, for example, Wayne Calloway, who said during his time as CEO of PepsiCo that they’re fully committed to high (15 percent) long-term growth. To this end, PepsiCo focused on growth, and Calloway and his predecessors worked towards this goal by buying a number of companies.  It’s a popular belief that the larger the company, the more value it has. But is that really true? Sometimes, in fact, big companies with higher revenue have a lower value on the stock market than their smaller counterparts. For example, when you compare PepsiCo to Coca-Cola, PepsiCo is clearly the larger company. It recently made $28.5 billion in sales in one year, whereas in the same year Coca-Cola made only $16.2 billion. Yet Coca-Cola’s worth on the stock market was $93 billion and PepsiCo’s worth was only $44 billion. How is that possible? In a word, focus. Those large companies are handicapped by not having a clear focus. For instance, Coca-Cola focuses solely on beverages. PepsiCo, on the other hand, produces several beverage brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew and 7UP, owns a number of fast-food chains including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC and also the snack food company Frito-Lay. Furthermore, an unfocused company isn’t easily managed, which inevitably leads to performance issues and, ultimately, to less success. The notion that a professional manager can manage anything isn’t true. In addition to people skills and conceptual skills – applicable in any industry – management requires a deep knowledge of and experience in the specific field of the company. If a company operates in several fields, its management will run into problems, as the managers have insufficient expertise. PepsiCo, for example, has a hand in three different fields: beverages, snacks and fast-food restaurants. And, predictably, it also has an inherent management problem. The company tried to solve this problem by shuffling promising managers through every division. The manager that comes out of this process is supposed to have “well-rounded” experience in all fields, but actually has, usually, only one third of the experience of his counterpart at Coca-Cola. As we’ve seen, managers want to expand their companies so they can exploit the benefits of size. Luckily for them, there are several strategies to achieve exactly that. One of these strategies is line extension. This means that a company expands to sell a variety of other products while using an already established brand name. Virgin Atlantic, for example, is an airline company owned by Richard Branson’s Virgin Group. Since it was founded, the Virgin Group has put its brand name on several very different products, including Virgin Cola, Virgin Vodka and Virgin Financial Services. Another growth strategy is diversification: it aims at increasing the company’s sales volume by expanding into new markets or products that are not related to the company’s existing markets or products. For example, in the early 1980s, Xerox – a company known mainly for their photocopiers and printers – diversified into financial services. While such practices are very common, the problem with these strategies is that they cause companies to lose focus. For instance, when a company branches out into new markets, they will have to deal with an increased variety of products to manage, and they’ll also have an increased number of competitors to be aware of. For example, as a result of the Virgin Group using the line extension strategy, not only do they have British Airways and American Airlines as competition, but also Coca-Cola and Smirnoff. As this demonstrates, expanding a company can cause it to lose focus and this decreased focus can actually greatly damage a company. Nowadays it’s rare to find companies which operate only in one national market. Increasingly, most companies, big and small, follow the trend of globalization. This is not surprising, as it’s now easier than ever for companies to trade globally. One reason for this is that globalization dismantles trade barriers. Treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) effectively eliminate high tariffs and other trade barriers that can make importing and exporting expensive for companies. For example, NAFTA is an agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico that lifts tariffs on trade and enables companies to trade freely. However, there is a downside: trading on a global scale magnifies the forces that can unfocus a business. Companies that go global become unfocused by the possibilities that the world market offers. Even if the company is a focused business in their home market, as soon as they enter the global market they try to diversify and, in doing so, take on too many competitors at once. Very often those competitors are hard to outdo because they’re already established on the world market. Olivetti, for example, used to be a typewriter and (later) mainframe company in its home market. When they started to go global, they tried to match up with all the companies in the personal computer business and expanded into services, telecommunications and multimedia. The result? They haven’t had a profitable year since 1990. Just because a company is successful in its home market doesn’t guarantee that it will be successful in a global one. Some might even argue that those companies should have stayed at home. So by now you’ve learned about how companies become unfocused and how that’s bad for them. But is there a remedy? In other words, how do you refocus a company? When diversification and line extension unfocus a company, doing the exact opposite will focus it – and the opposite of extending your product range is reducing its size. Or, to put it another way, to refocus, a company should specialize in one product field. This is because a specialized company tends to attract more customers than a diversified one. Indeed, over the last decade department stores like Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s have been in and out of bankruptcy and perhaps the main reason for this is that they’ve lost many customers to speciality stores like Toys”R”Us. Department stores have a very wide product range running the gamut from food to clothing. On the other hand, speciality stores like Toys”R”Us usually have only one specialist product field, and this attracts more customers. It follows that companies that are trying to focus their company in order to be more successful should narrow that focus by specializing in one field only. Consider Toys”R”Us, for example. The famous toy store started out as Children’s Supermart, a children’s furniture store. Later, its founder, Charles Lazarus, added toys to the concept. The store, however, didn’t become hugely successful until Lazarus threw out the furniture and gave the store a clear and narrow focus: they would specialize in selling discount toys only. If you had a medical problem, like heart disease, would you go to a general practitioner or a cardiologist? Most people would chose the cardiologist of course, because medical specialists usually know more about their specialty than a general practitioner would. And the same thing happens in business: customers prefer to use specialized companies because they trust their products to have the best quality. This is because most people don’t have the knowledge required to make an informed decision on which product has the best quality, so they depend on other factors in their decision-making process – such as experts. And in the business world, the experts of a particular field are those companies which specialize. For example, if you wanted to buy a computer mainframe in the 1970s, you’d go to the leading specialist, IBM, whose products were regarded by experts as being of the highest quality. When it comes to selling quality products, it doesn’t matter too much that the product is of a higher quality, from a technological point of view. It matters only that the customers perceive that quality, because it’s they who’ll make the decision to purchase a product. But keep in mind that high-quality products do sell better, and this leads to better company performance. Consider, for example, the world’s best-selling soft drink: Coca-Cola. When people are asked why they prefer it to Pepsi or other soft drinks, most of them answer that Coke simply tastes better. So, specialized companies perform better compared to unspecialized ones, because they have the advantage of being regarded as experts in their field. Have you ever noticed something in your life that remained completely the same, forever? No? Well, the economy is no exception, and the changes that an economy undergoes are in large part due to changes in technology. And technology changes constantly, so with each new wave of technology that’s introduced a new economic demand is created; gradually, the new technology begins to replace the old. For example, two decades ago photography depended mostly on analog technology. So if you wanted to take a photograph, you needed to buy photographic film and get that film developed at a lab. Then came a major technological advance: the now ubiquitous digital camera was introduced. If companies don’t change with the economy they are going to be left behind. Consider George Fisher, the CEO of Kodak in the 1990s, who was convinced that analog photography wouldn’t be replaced by digital – at least not for a substantial number of years. Soon after, of course, digital photography took over most of the market. In 1992, Kodak was a $20 billion corporation and the market leader in analog photography. But as technology changed, the company began to struggle. By 1995, Kodak was reduced to a $13 billion company. Why? Because sales of photographic film dropped; consumers wanted to buy the new technology – digital cameras that didn’t require film. Since Fisher was so invested in analog photography, Kodak was unfortunately one of the last companies to market and sell digital cameras, therefore allowing other companies to become the market leaders in digital photography. Fisher’s reluctance to embrace a new technology cost his company dearly. Adapting a company to changes in the economy means shifting the company’s focus onto something that is needed in the “new” economy. To avoid the struggle Kodak found itself in, George Fisher should have paid more attention earlier to technological developments and adapted the company’s focus from analog to digital photography in time.  So far we’ve only discussed companies which have a single focus and perform excellently. But there are also large conglomerates, with several brands, that don’t have a single focus and are still well positioned. What’s their secret? In contrast to companies with a single focus, operating in a single market, conglomerates actually operate in several markets at once. Consider General Electric, for example. With sales of $64.7 billion and profits of $4.7 billion, GE are one of the most successful conglomerates, ranking fifth on the Fortune 500 in 1993 (the annual list of the world’s 500 most successful enterprises). Or look at Dover Corp., 361st on the list, with sales of $3 billion. It has 54 operating companies engaged in more than 70 diverse businesses. But why doesn’t this diversityresult in a critical loss of focus? The reason is that successful conglomerates separate their many different markets and build a focus for each one – a multi-step focus. This allows them to specifically target different customer segments and avoid any internal competition. Consider, for example, that in the early years of General Motors, the conglomerate was an unfocused mess. It had seven different brands, including Chevrolet and Cadillac, that were established in different markets. Their main problem was that some of the brands’ markets overlapped, because the price ranges of those brands weren’t clearly separated. This led to competition between the brands, who snatched at each others’ customers – which, for the conglomerate, meant a decrease in profits. When Alfred Sloan took over General Motors in 1921, he built a multi-step focus for the company. He selected five of GM’s automotive brands – Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac – and distinguished them from each other clearly. Each brand had its own specific price range and would thus appeal to a different customer segment. The result? The brands wouldn’t compete against each other, and therefore the conglomerate’s profits wouldn’t decrease. The key message in this book: Although growth is usually the main goal of a company, it can often cause a company to lose its most important asset: its focus. Globalizing a company can diminish its focus, but specialization can often save a company. Also, specializing will help a company to succeed, because consumers are more likely to perceive that company’s service or product as being of higher quality.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Breathe out. It takes four seconds to take one deep breath – four seconds that are crucial to the quality of the decisions you make. Stress leads us to self-sabotage by, for instance, forgetting to prepare for important events or getting into arguments with those around us. In Four Seconds, Peter Bregman explains how in just those four seconds, by taking a deep breath and allowing ourselves to think twice, we can start to turn around counter-productive habits and create the kind of results we want. How can we create useful habits that connect us to others? How can we optimize our work habits? You’ll find answers to these questions and also discover why goals can lead to cheating; why listening is the best communication tool there is; and why you should always share your successes. When you’re in a stressful situation, do you sometimes react in a way that ends up making you feel even worse? Many people respond to stress in self-defeating, counter-productive ways, such as yelling or starting an argument with someone. So how do we transform this unhelpful behavior into habits that save our time, energy and sanity? The first step is pausing and breathing for four seconds. Four seconds is the amount of time you need to take one deep breath in and out. When you pause and breathe, this puts you in a state that allows you to make better decisions and consider the outcomes of your actions before you take them. Say your kids are refusing to brush their teeth before school. It’s the third time this week and you can feel the anger bubbling up inside of you. You’re about to lose your cool and start yelling. But instead, you resist, pause and breathe. After doing so, you feel a little calmer and clearer. Maybe you even come up with a tooth-brushing game instead of succumbing to the counter-productive reaction of shouting. In addition to the four-second breath, in a stressful situation it’s a good idea to identify an area of focus, rather than a goal. Goal setting is often accompanied by temptations to cheat or to take unnecessary risks, whereas an area of focus motivates you without offering up such negative temptations. For example, you own a store that sells a certain product. In recent years, your goal has been to increase your revenue. This, however, has led to some of your staff using questionable methods to hit targets, such as lying about particular features of the product, because all they care about are the sales. But this year, you’ve set an area of focus, which is to talk more with the customers. The results? At the year’s end, you realize that the revenue has increased, thanks to focusing more on the customers than on increasing revenue. Living in a busy world, we need to be prepared for everything life throws at us. In fact, failing to prepare for the day ahead often results in costly blunders that waste time. Imagine you arrive at work unprepared for the morning meeting, then it suddenly dawns on you that you have to chair it – you forgot this was decided last week! Of course, you neglected to read the agenda, and then to make matters worse, two new faces walk into the room. Totally caught out, you decide that you’ll have to reschedule the meeting, resulting in wasted time for everyone involved. But how can you go about preparing for the unexpected? The secret is preparing for a process, rather than a solution. It’s impossible to be armed with a solution for an unpredictable event, but we can be prepared to maneuver through ambiguity. To do so, use the following three-step process. It will help you when you find yourself in a situation you weren’t prepared for, and are suddenly required to make a decision. First: Pause, breathe in and out deeply for four seconds, and think. For instance, if you’re out sailing in your boat and run into a storm, breathe, and think. Next, assess your options. Ask yourself: given the resources and information I have available to me, how can I get to my desired outcome? In this case, you have two options: continue sailing or swiftly make your way back to land. Finally, make a decision and stick to it. Say to yourself: even if this isn’t ideal, it’s the best option given the circumstances. So, based on the judgement that the storm will soon pass and that the wind would be more violent if you turned back, you decide to continue sailing. Taking just four seconds to pause and breathe once in a while will better position you to alleviate your stress and figure out how to proceed. How often do you get distracted by how someone communicated a certain point – their tone of voice, or their aggressive body language – rather than focusing on the content of the message? Most of us are pretty poor communicators, and you’ll have to acknowledge this in order to improve your communication habits. Really try to make a habit out of focusing on the content, instead of the packaging it comes in, to gain a better understanding of the message. For instance, say you had a job interview and now expect a phone call from your potential employer to let you know if you were successful. Instead, several weeks later you receive an email stating that you didn’t get the job. You feel pretty let down that the potential employer didn’t even bother to call you personally. This reaction is hardly helpful, though. Why not take a deep breath and reinterpret what the email actually said, rather than only giving your attention to the packaging? Find the value in the message. For example, do they mention other opportunities for you within the organization? After you’ve calmed down, respond with a different medium to the one that upset you. That is, call them rather than email them. Another valuable tip for improved communication is to stop arguing. Arguing is about nothing other than getting the upper hand. Even if you start to see some flaws in your viewpoint, it’s unlikely that you’re going to suddenly admit it if you’re in the middle of a fight! The result is hopeless; you’ll both stick to your point of view, making clear and helpful communication impossible. Instead, you should use the best tool you have available: listening. Listening is a brilliant tactic as it doesn’t threaten the other person. On the contrary, they will feel heard, piquing their interest to listen to you. So if you want to bring your point home and even sway the other person, drop the arguing and start listening. In our hyper-connected world we communicate with a huge variety of people, some similar and some very different from ourselves. In either case, it’s not uncommon to be taken aback by what people say and do. But have you ever thought that the problem might not be the other person, but instead our own habit of expecting too much of them? If you can learn to alter your expectations, you’ll find that you’ll strengthen your relationships with those around you. Expecting people to say and do what you would have said or done doesn’t usually end well, since no one is a carbon copy of you! It’s a far healthier habit to treat people how they wish to be treated. If you do this, others won’t fail to meet your standards and, in turn, you won’t get frustrated. To further reinforce your relationships, let people know what it is about them that you appreciate. In the business world and in our private lives, we often wrongly believe that gifts or bonuses, in and of themselves, make people feel appreciated by those who give them. This is not the case, however. Picture coming to work one day and finding an envelope on your desk with a bonus inside it, but with no letter to go with it. You’d probably view the bonus as compensation for what you’ve accomplished professionally, but will it really make you feel appreciated for who you are as a person? Probably not, since appreciation is expressed through people and not things like bonuses or lavish gifts. Therefore, aim to replace this gift-giving with a habit of telling people that you appreciate them just as they are – not for the favors they have done for you or the work they have done for your organization. This will encourage them to feel respected and loved, which will strengthen your relationship. We’re continually learning new things in our working lives: a new language, a new technological skill or management technique. However, we often tap into bad habits that can hinder our own or others’ learning. So how do we stop this? First, we have to understand that, in order to learn anything, we must have the opportunity to fail. Learning is not about being perfect. Quite the opposite. It’s about recognizing when you’ve failed, and being able to adjust accordingly. Let’s say you’re teaching your son to ride a bike, and every time he wobbles, you jump in and catch him. Several weeks pass and he’s still not able to keep steady on the bike. Why? If he doesn’t get the chance to lose balance and possibly fall, he won’t be able to recover, maintain balance, and learn to ride the bike himself. The same applies for any manager of an organization. As a manager, you have to protect the organization, but blocking the chance for failure and self-recovery is a weak strategy if you want your employees to acquire new skills and improve their work. So if an employee struggles in an important meeting, you should assess how the employee performed in relation to your expectations of them, and what they can learn from this. Besides making room for failure, you should also be prepared to share your successes if you want to optimize your work habits. This is because the achievements of an organization or any kind of venture doesn’t just boil down to the work of one person. Also, knowing that you’ve contributed to a success is highly motivating. And when you’re motivated, you work more effectively. So ditch the bad habit of praising only one or two people for a success. Instead, ensure that everybody is aware that they, too, contributed to it. Acting negatively is something we all do from time to time. Whether it’s at home, at work, or just getting riled up during a football match, we all have our less than desirable sides! But we don’t do our best when we hold on to negative feelings. Let’s see how we can combat this. You can start with never responding against anyone’s negativity. If you do so, people take it that you’re contradicting their emotions, which will encourage them to hold on to that negativity. Take the case of some employees who gravitate towards negativity. The manager reacted by gushing positively about the chance of bonuses or by making negative comments about how their mood was deadening his energy. Nothing changed. A better way to respond would be to do so with the person in question, in three steps. First, show your understanding of the person’s negative emotions. Then, if you’ve felt similarly before, tell them about it. Lastly, don’t tell the person that they’re wrong. Rather, try to uncover what the person is positive about and focus on that. These steps will have a neutralizing effect on their negativity. You can use yet another tool to complement the steps above and promote positivity in the workplace – accepting criticism. To do this, regard criticism as a gift, rather than something that makes you put up your defenses. When receiving criticism, do the following: Accept that you feel hurt or angry. Then place these feelings to one side. Next, realize that the person offering the criticism might not be the best communicator, so put your attention on the actual message, not the package. Then, try to take a neutral stance, by neither agreeing nor disagreeing. Then listen, and try to simply gather the information being offered. Finally, take a little break before you consider what the person said and decide after a little while if, what and how you can change. The key message in this book: All you need for bad habits to weaken their grip on you is four seconds: the time it takes for one deep breath in and out. By taking this micro pause, you’ll be better equipped to collect yourself, gather your thoughts and act in ways that benefit you, rather than work against you. Pause when you get criticism or have to deal with gloomy colleagues, and then turn that negativity around. Actionable advice: Choose content over delivery. The next time you feel your blood boiling over because of something someone said, try to listen to the content rather than how they packaged it. By really paying attention to what they’re saying, it’s more likely that you’ll uncover the message they were actually trying to get across! A word of appreciation goes a long way. If you are the manager of a business or the leader of a project, remember that everyone contributes to your successes, and you should share it with them. The best way to do this is by actually speaking to them, rather than offering faceless material rewards. This will encourage everyone involved to keep doing their best.

But that’s not true. As the old saying goes, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” Success is all about working your networks – and this extends to cases far beyond classic networking to make new contacts. Caring for your network will expand business potential, increase innovation and diversity and set you on the path to achieving your ambitions. Author David Burkus will show you that your network is much larger than you think it is, and can quickly grow if you learn to reach out to the right people. Crucially, you’ll pick up a few techniques to increase your circle and ensure it is of high quality. Theory and practice together will get you where you need to go. In these blinks, you’ll learn why a hit song’s tune doesn’t actually matter; how The Four-Hour Workweek became a bestseller; and what card game led to a friendship between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates The value of a close friendship is not to be underrated. We all want to have people around who we trust and with whom we can share our feelings. But when it comes to work, if you’re going to be successful, you have to dump those emotional tendencies and work according to a different professional paradigm. Sociologically speaking, your close friends are those with whom you have strong social ties. But, if you cultivate ties with people you’re not so close to – that is, weak social ties – you’re going to be a better networker. Typically, when we're faced with challenges such as looking for a new job, we reach out to strong social ties or seek out job listings online. What’s all too readily forgotten are weak social ties, and that’s a big mistake. The problem with strong social ties is that they are often connected to each other as well as to you, like an interconnected cluster. In contrast, weak social ties tend to be connected to other social clusters, which means they'll spread news of your job search to entirely different groups of people. In fact, a Harvard University student named Mark Granovetter showed this to be scientifically true back in 1970. He surveyed people making job transitions and found that 83 percent of those who were successful in their search had managed it with the help of weak social ties. Interestingly enough, connecting with people you’re less close to also promotes innovation. In 2002, Martin Ruef, a sociology professor at Duke University, set about asking 700 start-ups how they had devised their business models. It turned out that practically all start-ups that had developed their business ideas from talking with weak social ties had more innovative business models than those who had relied on strong ties. This was indicated by the fact that these start-ups had, for example, filed for more patents to protect their original ideas. Additionally, Ruef and his researchers judged their ideas to be highly innovative when compared to business models and research typical of their fields. Remember those cliques in high school that all had their special spots in the cafeteria? It’s a universal experience: people have a natural tendency to gather in exclusive groups of familiar people. If you’ve ever tried to get to know new people at a house party, you’ll have seen the same thing in action. But, in truth, we’d all be better off trying to mingle with people we don’t know at all. That’s because connecting with utterly unfamiliar groups nourishes innovation.   This is illustrated by the story of an early nineteenth-century Cherokee silversmith named Sequoyah. He made contact not just with his native community, but also with American settlers. At the time, the Cherokee had no written language. But, so he could act as a link between the two communities, Sequoyah learned English. He started by learning to write his own name. Soon after, he was engraving it on his silverware. Sequoyah saw how the settlers sent letters to communicate with each other and decided to import the innovation. Through hard work, he developed a system of symbols that represented the different syllables of the Cherokee language. The syllabary was a raving success. The Cherokee soon adopted the script, and it remains in use to this day on street signs and in schools, especially in cities in Cherokee territory like Tahlequah, Oklahoma. There’s another benefit to connecting with unfamiliar groups. We saw earlier that it can help you in your job search, but there’s a good chance that it’ll be more generally beneficial to your career, too. Studies have shown that, in addition to being more innovative, you’ll also be awarded higher salaries and receive more promotions. In 2004, sociologist Ronald Burt conducted a study where he tasked 673 managers working at a major electronics company with improving the company’s supply-chain management. He found that managers who discussed the problem with people from different social clusters to their own were able to come up with the best ideas. As it happened, they were the same managers who already had the best paid and highest positions within the company. Clearly then, networking will take you far! The classic image of innovation and invention is that of a wiry, white-haired and bespeckled scientist at a lab bench, his cry of eureka echoing into the lonely void. But things aren’t like that anymore: innovation increasingly comes down to teamwork. Sociologist Brian Uzzi's 2007 article in the journal Science showed that innovation through teamwork in the scientific community had significantly increased over the previous 50 years. Uzzi's researchers analyzed over 20 million scientific studies published between 1955 and 2000, as well as the teams and individuals behind them. Interestingly, while the average size of a scientific team in 1955 was 1.9, by 2000 it had risen to 3.5. Furthermore, in 1955, only 17.5 percent of the total content of scientific papers was attributable to collaboration. Even then, it was mostly still scientists working alone and then compiling their findings after the fact. But by 2000, 51.5 percent of scientific work was being developed and executed by teams. On top of all that, the impact of team-produced papers also increased. In 1955, coauthored scientific papers were being referenced by peers 1.7 times as often as individually researched papers. But by 2000, that figure stood at 2.1. Uzzi returned to the question of innovation in 2005. He wanted to understand what made teams work well. Using a sample of scientific studies published between 1955 and 2004, he found that teams made up of researchers who had not collaborated before wound up publishing in the most high-profile periodicals. Surprisingly, successful teams who stuck together found it hard to keep the magic flowing. Their work received less recognition, generally only appearing in lower-profile publications. No one has yet successfully explained this phenomenon. But it’s likely that new team members bring new ideas and energy, something severely lacking in stale, established collaborations. In the Gospel according to Matthew, Jesus declares that those who already possess much will be sure to acquire more. In sociology, this is called the Matthew effect, and it applies to networking, too. Simply put, the more connected you are, the more connected you’ll get. It’s pretty logical, really: when people are out to make new contacts, they naturally look for people who already have lots of ties. It’s easy to visualize what happens next. When an already well-connected person starts piling up more links, they’re more likely to attract new people wanting to join their network. There’s a lesson in this. If networking seems hard at first, don’t worry; as your contacts accumulate, it will get easier. Another reason why networking becomes easier over time is that popularity is infectious and spreads quickly through social groups. This was the finding of sociologists Matthew Salganik and Peter Dodds in 2006. The pair set up a website where people could log in and listen to unfamiliar songs for free. But they actually created several different versions. In one, the visitors only saw the album’s title and artist’s name. In the other, it was also possible to see how many times a given song had been downloaded previously. It turned out that the participants were highly influenced by others’ choices. On the website version where it was possible to see others’ selections, certain songs rapidly became hits. In fact, one song soon outranked them all. In contrast, on the other site that displayed no such information, the same song only came in at spot 40 of 48. This very same principle applies to networking. If you’re connected and people know it, then others are going to come knocking at your door. Imagine that one of your friends was 100-feet tall. If you were then to calculate your friendship group’s average height, you’d find that this one measurement had skewed the average dramatically upward. In fact, you’d have to admit that you were shorter than average. The same idea holds true when comparing network sizes. Though many people like to imagine they have more friends and contacts than the average, they don’t. That’s because Super Connectors – people who have amassed mountains of contacts – will knock the average right out of whack. Social media only exacerbates the issue. In 2016, two McGill University computer scientists, Naghmeh Momeni and Michael Rabbit, analyzed millions of Twitter users' followers and tweets. They found that Super Connectors ruled the roost. Very few users boasted millions of followers, and the vast majority of users actually fell well short of the average number of followers, which stood at 155,657 at the time of the study. But there’s no need to get disheartened. It’s actually possible to become a Super Connector and to profit from it. Tim Ferriss is one such example. Before he published his best seller The Four-Hour Workweek in 2007, Ferriss was an unknown with no network to speak of. But he had a business plan up his sleeve. Ferriss worked out that his target audience would be men aged 18 to 35 and interested in technology. He therefore found the ten to 15 websites that were most popular with that demographic. After that, Ferriss targeted their owners: he attended conferences where he could meet them and struck up informal conversations that quickly segued into full-blown product pitches. Before long, most of these online bloggers and journalists were posting about him – the illusion had been created. To hordes of tech geeks, Ferris seemed to be a Super Connector. They came flooding to him, his book became a best seller and he became a genuine Super Connector for the first time. The old saying goes that birds of a feather flock together, and there’s a lot of truth in that. Just look at how US elections are split between increasingly polarized Democrats and Republicans. And science confirms the proverb: humans tend to cluster into groups of people similar to themselves. In 2009, sociologists Duncan Watt and Gueorgi Kossinets sat down to examine the email flow between the students at a large American university over the course of a year. They not only kept track of the emails and new recipients that appeared; they also created student profiles detailing age, gender, course choices and a number of other attributes. Watt and Kossinets found that students who shared similar characteristics were far more likely to get in contact with one another. However, they also discovered that this occurred because similar students tended to hang out in the same places on campus, studied in the same department or were even in the same course of study. A preference for similar people had consequences over time, too. Similar people started to cluster, and so the likelihood of meeting more similar people just kept on increasing. The repercussions of this sort of behavior are plain to see: people’s preference for more of the same makes it harder to establish diversity. Entrepreneurs and journalists Alex Blumberg and Matt Lieber learned just that in 2015, soon after founding Gimlet Media, a company that develops and sells podcasts. They noticed that their staff was almost entirely white, liberal and cosmopolitan, and they soon realized what had caused this. Blumberg and Lieber had mainly been recruiting from among their fellow New York-based journalists. And that was itself a replicating pool of talent that had been attracting similar types for decades. While they were happy that the company was doing well, they also recognized the importance of diversity, and that it wasn’t going to happen by itself – they would have to consciously start recruiting people from more diverse backgrounds. There’s a lesson in this example. Networking works best when you connect with different groups. Therefore, you’ll have to make a deliberate effort to do that so you don’t end up mingling with carbon copies of yourself and no one else. Whether you’re an introvert who’s mortified by the idea of social mixers, or an extrovert who finds them boring, you’ll be relieved to know that skipping them altogether is probably your best option. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, when you’re attending social mixers, you’re likely to spend most of the time talking to people you already know. In 2009, two business professors at Columbia University, Paul Ingram and Michael Morris, conducted a study to examine interactions at social mixers. They fitted students and business executives at the university with recording devices and tracked conversations that occurred during evening drinks on campus. Fascinatingly, they found that although 95 percent of the participants in the event classified themselves as \"highly motivated\" to meet new people, they actually spent at least 50 percent of their time conversing with old acquaintances. Secondly, even if you do decide to approach new people, the tendency is to head toward people who are similar to you. They’re probably also in the same network already, and so are hardly going to help you branch out into new ones. The message here is that social events are not the way to go. People actually bond more easily through shared activities. That’s the way to network! Behavioral scientist Jon Levy has put this thinking into practice. He regularly organizes dinner parties for movers and shakers. But Levy’s dinner parties are hardly run of the mill. When guests arrive at his New York home, they are split up into teams and then prepare the evening meal together. The guests may not disclose their identities or their occupations and, consequently, social hierarchies are eliminated. Once dinner is served, the guests play games during which they guess the identity of each diner in turn. Levy’s dinner parties have been a huge success – and not just on the night in question. His guests have gone on to collaboratively create start-ups and TV series! Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are probably the two biggest business magnates there are. Interestingly, they collaborate with one another as well. It’s a relationship based on a friendship that began while playing bridge in 1991. This demonstrates how friendships can lead to successful business relationships, too. In 2009, sociologists Simone Ferriani and Fabio Fonti contacted hundreds of companies in the Bologna area in Italy, where their university was based. They asked the companies who their suppliers were and drew maps of the companies’ business connections. Then, the company leaders detailed who they went to for advice or whom they just considered friends. Ferriani and Fonti then made a separate map for company-friendship connections. Needless to say, the researchers found that business connections and friendships often overlapped with each other. At this point, they asked participants what had come first, the business relationship or the friendship? Interestingly, when a friendship formed the foundation of a relationship, the probability of the two friends also going into business together was double that of a business connection resulting in friendship. Speaking of friendship, research has also shown that there is much to be gained when business colleagues become friends. In 2015, management researcher Jessica Methot examined whether work performance improved when friendships existed between work colleagues. She surveyed the employees of a large insurance company and mapped out the primary work connections within the company. Employees with work friends were found to be better performers when independently evaluated by their superiors. However, employees who had work friends also tended to get more emotionally drained than those without. That’s most probably because maintaining relationships requires emotional investment. Emotional fatigue seemed to slightly reduce work performance, but this was more than made up for by the increase in performance resulting from the added motivation of having a friend at work. So there we are! You now know that it’s necessary to network because it can boost your creativity and innovative power. And you’ve also learned how to do it – not least by avoiding social mixers. Before you know it, you’ll be on your way to becoming a Super Connector with a soaring career! The key message in these blinks: Networks aren’t just about networking, but that’s where you have to start. To most people, networking means going out and talking to strangers, but it’s not quite that simple – you need to be aware of who you’re talking to and also cultivate weak social ties. Once established, a proper network will diversify teams and contacts, leading to increased productivity and innovation. Shared activities are also more likely to break down social barriers and build stronger networks, and always remember that great friendships can lead to fantastic business partnerships.  Actionable advice: Learn from your friends. Teamwork is becoming increasingly important in modern workplaces, but you don’t even need to be part of a formal team to learn from others. Just invite your friends out and ask them what they do at their jobs. Instead of zoning out while thinking about your own problems, really listen to what they have to say, and see if you can learn something from them. Got feedback?

Womack & Jodi Womack","summary":"Do you have a dream project collecting dust on a shelf somewhere? Or do you feel that your life and your core ambitions just aren’t moving forward the way you’d like them to? If so, don’t feel bad – we all get stuck now and then. Luckily, there are some useful and efficient strategies to help you get unstuck. As you’ll see in these blinks, by taking a step back and examining your true motivations, learning the noble art of tracking your progress and finding good mentors, you’ll be well on the way to regaining your initiative. Let’s get into it and give your life the momentum it deserves! In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should always have some champagne on ice; what Benjamin Franklin has to do with gaining momentum; and how the 90/90 rule will help you reach your goals. Motivation is what makes great achievements possible. So what do you do if you have lofty goals but lack the motivation to see them through? While most motivational writers tell you not to care about what others think, striving for a certain reputation can be a powerful motivator. This was the case for one of the authors, business leader Jodi, who would often meet up with other female executives in her industry. Unfortunately, these meetings were far from empowering, as the women tended to discourage, rather than support, one another. Soon enough, Jodi realized that she wanted to be known not just as a successful businesswoman, but as a woman who empowered her female peers. This motivated Jodi to found No More Nylons, a social and professional network where women could connect, collaborate and encourage each other to thrive in a business world still dominated by men. Discovering the kind of person she wanted to be gave Jodi the motivation she needed to kickstart a new project. But to stay determined and focused, she made use of another motivating tool: progress tracking. Signs that we’re getting closer to achieving our goals are what keep us from giving up. In Jodi’s case, her goal was to help as many women as possible help each other. Each meeting, she tracked her progress by recording the number of women attending, which gave her an idea of how quickly her project was growing. Seeing in real, tangible numbers how more and more women were coming together through No More Nylons kept Jodi motivated. Even so, she had to consciously take a moment to stop and observe her progress – otherwise, it would pass by unnoticed. Pausing to reflect upon and celebrate your milestones along the way is essential to keeping your morale high. So, if your goal is to launch a new product, take the time to celebrate every step that brings you closer to achieving that goal, from coming up with a winning design, to finalizing your prototype, to finding your first loyal customers. Keep a bottle of champagne at the ready for these occasions – hard work is impossible without a little fun once in a while! To maintain the momentum you need to achieve your goals, it’s vital to have someone around to give you a little push when you need it. This person is your role model, or your mentor. They aren’t there to nag you to keep going when you feel like giving up; instead, they’ll give you momentum by inspiring you through their own work. The author, Jason, was inspired by Benjamin Franklin and devoured books about his life and work. Franklin was not only a brilliant inventor and natural scientist, but a man who played a central role in the birth of the United States. He didn’t lead the great life he did through luck – Franklin was also a master of productivity and self-improvement. He created a set of rules to live by to ensure lifelong learning, and also developed his own pros and cons chart for better decision making. Jason learned a great deal from Franklin and still quotes him today. While the space of a few centuries barred Jason from actually spending time with Benjamin Franklin, you might be lucky enough to find a potential role model or mentor in your own industry. If you can’t think of anyone you know, it’s time to start networking! In your search for a mentor, conferences are a great place to start. If you connect with someone you think might be a good candidate, simply ask them whether they’d like to mentor you – you’ve got nothing to lose! You can also discover potential mentors at smaller meet-ups and other social events like Jodi’s No More Nylons. You might even find ways to reach out to influential or famous figures beyond your local network. In such cases, be prepared to have your dedication tested. You’re also much more likely to get a response when you ask for advice on specific issues, rather than general words of wisdom. In the first blink, we touched on the importance of celebrating the goals you achieve on the way to success. To take full advantage of this technique’s motivational power, you’ll need to be smart about how you define your milestones. Start by creating a schedule for your long-term project that comprises several subprojects, or significant and clearly designated milestones that can be achieved at roughly 30-day intervals. These, in turn, can be organized into 90-day work cycles, with three milestones to be achieved during this time. Let’s return to the product launch example we used in the first blink. Completing your first prototype could be a single 90-day work cycle, with the three key milestones of completing your final design, creating your first prototype and undertaking rounds of testing. After this, you’ll be up for another three milestones in the following 90-day work cycle. This way, you’ll always have something to work toward and a path to follow, making big projects seem a lot less overwhelming. Following the 30/30 and 90/90 rules will also help you keep your momentum going. If you’ve ever felt like there simply aren’t enough hours in a day to get your projects off the ground, the 30/30 rule is for you. When working on one particular stage of a project, the upcoming phase might seem increasingly daunting as it approaches. However, if you work 30 undistracted minutes a day for the 30 days before you get officially started on the next milestone, you’ll already have put a total of 15 hours toward it by the time you get to work on it in earnest. This will ensure that even if you’re juggling a day job and family responsibilities, you’ll always find a way to push through to the next phase of your project. For those who find themselves feeling lost in the middle of projects, the 90/90 rule is another helpful tool. On the first working day of each month, spend 90 minutes looking at the tasks that lie 90 days into the future, considering what needs to be done in the interim and making a bit of headway wherever possible. This will give you more breathing room down the line, in case you need to deal with unforeseen problems or day-to-day annoyances. Even if we diligently plan our 90-day work cycles and follow the 90/90 rule, the odd slip-up is still possible. For instance, you might realize just a week away from a key deadline that you’re entirely off track. What’s the best way to avoid this unwelcome surprise? You can monitor your progress toward your milestones by identifying small indicators that highlight how you’re doing. Say you’re training to run a marathon. Each week of training can provide you with a whole host of different indicators to give you an idea of how on track you really are, from miles per run and running days per week to the number of days you slept well and ate healthily. Consider how each of these indicators should look as you work toward each milestone in your project. Then, monitor these key indicators to identify a loss of momentum before it becomes a problem. You can even make things visual with posters, a whiteboard or sticky notes to help you track these indicators and map your progress. However, keep in mind that you can’t monitor everything. Excessive monitoring might initially feel quite satisfying, giving the impression that you’ve got a handle on all the variables influencing your productivity. But the natural variations that appear when keeping track of minute details might discourage you and distract you from far more important indicators. Do your research and work out which indicators tell you the most about the health of your project; these should be monitored on a regular basis. By keeping up a good rhythm of monitoring your progress, you’ll save yourself time and energy down the road by nipping approaching crises in the bud. The final tool in your motivational toolbox is the ability to modify – in other words, being able to adjust your approach when you’ve figured out that something isn’t working. Often, when we run into problems with our projects, it’s tempting to just give up on the whole thing. By resisting this temptation and learning to modify instead, you’ll be able to find new routes to your goal that you’d have never seen before. Modification is not about changing your overall aims; it’s about modifying the strategies you apply to get there. Say you’re attempting to run ten miles once a week as part of your training for a marathon next month. After noticing that you’re only hitting 7.5 miles at your best, you opt for a marathon coming up in two months instead. By modifying your plan to give yourself a bit more time, rather than pushing your body past its limit or giving up on the marathon entirely, you’re able to continue on a path to the same goal of running a marathon without damaging your momentum. But beware of the temptation to modify too many things at once; when it comes to modification, less is more. The challenge of increasing your weekly miles is a good reason to give yourself a longer time to train, but this doesn’t mean that you should start altering your sleeping habits or caloric intake. Start with one small change, and if you don’t see an improvement after some time, take on another modification. The better your monitoring system is, the easier it’ll be to spot aspects that need changing. Above all, remember that modifications to your strategy and your timeline aren’t signs of failure. You’re simply maintaining momentum as you move toward what’s most important – your goals. The key message in this book: Finding the motivation to see our projects through to the end is challenging. By chasing a positive reputation, seeking inspiration, managing our time, monitoring our progress and, finally, modifying our strategies as needed, we can create and sustain the momentum we need to achieve our goals.  Actionable advice: Keep up your momentum and help others do the same by being thankful.  The next time someone you’re working with does something well, point it out to them! Not only will this encourage them to work with you in a way that benefits you both, it’ll also create an environment where celebrating each other’s minor victories is the norm. On top of this, boosting someone else’s motivation can boost your own, as you witness the positive impact you can have on other people. Taken together, this will help you and your team gain and maintain momentum. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

And because most women feel a distinct need to fit in and have similar values to their peers, they feel unsure about stepping out of line and doing things differently. For many women, this upbringing and peer pressure results in the need to apologize or ask for approval if they have desires that don’t align with the traditional female roles of wife and mom. For many, being a good mom means that you have to devote yourself fully to your kids and give up ideas of a full-time career. But as author Rachel Hollis succinctly puts it, it’s time for women to stop apologizing and start embracing their unique desires in life. Whether your dream is to start your own business, create an app, run a marathon or write a book, these blinks provide some empowering advice on how to break free from concerns about what others are thinking, and focus your attention on the goals that really matter. In these blinks you’ll find how five hours a week can put you on the right path; how the 10-10-1 exercise can keep you focused and motivated; and why you should always be specific regarding your goals. Imagine what the world would be like if every woman pursued what she really wanted without worrying about getting judged or being plagued by self-doubts. Chances are, if just 5 percent of the women in the world were to fearlessly follow their desires, it would be an entirely different and altogether better world. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is, far too many women are neglecting what they want – and there’s a number of reasons why. For starters, it’s human nature to crave attention and care about what other people think. If you’ve spent any time with children, you know that, as toddlers, they all begin to realize that certain behaviors result in adults paying attention to them. These attention-grabbing behaviors become habitual, and we carry them into adulthood in different ways. Some children will realize that if they behave as though they’re feeling sick, adults will be kind and take care of them. This can easily turn into hypochondriacal behavior later in life. Likewise, many children realize that if they achieve certain things, they’ll get showered with praise. This can turn into an adult becoming a workaholic overachiever. So, whether we’re conscious of it or not, our actions are often predicated on how others will respond. Compounding our already troublesome desire for attention and concern over what other people think is the fact that young girls are often raised to believe that their value is solely based on whether they’ll make a good wife or mom. As a result, women are developing behaviors that aren’t based on achieving personal goals, but on pleasing other people. To put it another way: boys are being raised to pursue their dreams, while girls are raised to pursue what they believe is expected of them. So, to break free of these deeply-rooted barriers that stop you from being true to yourself, you need to stop focusing on meeting someone else’s expectations. Recognize that it’s okay if one woman’s dream looks completely different than someone else’s, and stop making excuses for why you’re not going after what you really want in life. As the author sees it, there are quite a few common excuses for why women are afraid to follow their heart’s desires. In the blinks ahead, we’ll tear down these excuses and replace them with empowering behaviors and skills that will get you on track to setting goals and fearlessly pursuing them. For years, the author led a double life as a devoted wife and mom, who just happened to have a popular lifestyle blog. The other half of her life was the reality behind that blog, which involved working 60-hour weeks overseeing a small staff and running her own business, of which the blog was only one part of. This double life was due to the fact that, like many other working women, the author was keenly aware that after she had her first child, a lot of people were expecting her to reduce her work hours. After all, popular opinion states that someone working as much as she was could never devote the appropriate amount of time needed to be a good mom. This is why one of the biggest excuses for not following your dream is telling yourself, well, that’s not what other women do. One of the problems is that, during adolescence, the last thing most people want is to stand out. Of course, there are those teenage rebels who try to stand out by dying their hair and wearing flashy outfits, but many more care too much about what others think; they find comfort in being exactly like every other girl. As a result, years of fitting in can go by before you ever ask yourself: Does being like every other woman really make me happy and fulfilled? Then, when you actually consider pursuing the goals that would bring you happiness and fulfillment, you may feel ashamed for wanting something that other women seemingly do not. But the truth is, you shouldn’t let other people determine your self-worth or make you feel guilty or ashamed of pursuing what you want out of life. Some women are happiest when they’re looking after their home and kids, but there’s no reason to apologize if that’s not your thing. Another common excuse for giving up on your dreams before you even start is to say, well, I’m not a goal-oriented person. Indeed, it takes more than just crossing your fingers and hoping for the best to achieve your goals. But here’s the good news: planning is a skill just like any other, and it’s never too late to learn a new skill and become more organized and productive. In the blinks ahead, we’ll look at some ways to get you started. We’ve all at some point dismissed an exciting new idea with the response, “That sounds great, but I don’t have time.” Well, brace yourself for some tough love, because this is another excuse that needs to be banished from your mind. If you’re to have any hope of reaching your goals, you need to stop looking for free time and start making time. This may require some difficult decisions and sacrifices, but it won’t be long before you’re making progress and reaping the rewards. The first requirement for making time is to accept ownership of your life. Whether you’re a CEO or a stay-at-home mom, you need to accept responsibility and take control over your time and schedule. This includes spare-time activities like watching TV. After all, if there are busy moms and executives who are currently making time to train for marathons, you can surely find the time for your goals as well. It may require unpleasant changes like giving up TV during the workweek or taking on a miserable unpaid internship for a few months, but these changes will eventually pay off and bring you a step closer to fulfillment. If you’re finding it difficult to make time, try creating a schedule that lists every hour of how you currently spend a full week. Now, find a minimum of five hours anywhere in the week during which you’ll commit to actively pursuing your goal. The hours don’t have to be consecutive but should be during times when you’re at your best – if you’re a morning person or a night owl, choose hours during those times. Now, try out this new plan for the week ahead and, over the course of that week, think about any changes you could implement to make the following week’s plan even better. Another all too common excuse is to feel like you just don’t have what it takes to succeed. In other words, you feel insecure. For many of us, this feeling may stem from past events. Perhaps the various bullies you’ve encountered over the years who made fun of you, or perhaps a teacher who always told you you’d never succeed. But past negative experiences don’t have to quash your future successes. When it comes to personal growth, everyone experiences it in different ways – some excel in classrooms, while others do better with online tutorials. The point is, if you’re eager and willing, then it’s just a matter of figuring out what works for you. Hopefully, you’ve never had to feel selfish doing something for the purposes of self-improvement. But unfortunately, “mommy guilt” is a real thing, and it’s resulted in plenty of women feeling compelled to give up on higher education or career plans. Mommy guilt is just another name for the expectation women feel to put aside their own passions and priorities for the sake of raising a family or caring for others. This leads us to the next excuse: What will they think? Simply put, we sometimes need to be selfish in order to accomplish our goals. The author’s father recalled something his professor said when he started his PhD studies: The professor told the class that they had to be selfish in order to make time for the grueling coursework and thesis writing ahead. If they weren’t selfish, family and friends sidelined during this time would surely be able to talk them out of it. The next time you’re considering doing something different because of what someone else might think, remember that there are two types of people in the world: stupid, judgmental jerks and nice, non-judgmental people. Now, judgmental jerks are going to find something to be judgmental about no matter what you do! So you might as well follow your heart and not waste time worrying about what they think. In a way, fear of what others think is closely tied to another excuse not to pursue your personal goals, which is the fear of failure. More often than not, it’s not messing up that’s scary, it’s what other people will think of you for not having succeeded. The author has had her fair share of public failures. In one incident, she tried to orchestrate a big push to get one of her previous books to debut on the New York Times bestseller list. Yet despite her 850,000 social media fans hashtagging like crazy, it didn’t happen. Yes, sometimes your best efforts may result in tears and embarrassment, but each misstep brings valuable lessons and only serves to strengthen your ability to carry on. In fact, life’s successes are made all the more beautiful by the failures that come before. Ultimately, when you let your worries about other people’s opinions get in your way, you’re giving up your power and letting others dictate your life. Remember, only you know what’s best for you. And besides, more often than not, people spend far less time thinking about you than you suspect. For centuries, traditional – and outdated – rules of etiquette say that “good girls” shouldn’t talk about money or wealth. Instead, they should be demure and make the most of whatever life provides. But as historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich wrote, “Well-behaved women seldom make history.” So, instead of telling yourself “good girls don’t hustle,” embrace your ambition and look at some good behaviors you can adopt to increase the chances of successfully reaching your goals. First off, it’s time to stop asking for permission. You may have been raised to recognize the voice of authority as being distinctly male, and therefore feel the need to seek permission. But the truth is, as a woman, you have all the authority you need to follow your own goals in life. The second good behavior to adopt is to focus on one dream at a time. It can be tempting to spread your interests across multiple goals or projects as doing so reduces the stakes. If a project doesn’t work out, it’s no big loss since you’ve got other irons in the fire. But this also means that there’s less chance of anything significant happening. As the author puts it, “When everything is important, nothing is important.” To help you focus on one thing, embrace the 10-10-1 plan. Think ahead to ten years from now, and how you’d like your life to look. Get as specific and detailed as you can by visualizing and writing down everything about this future life – from where you’ll be living and what your day is like to the kind of clothes you’re wearing. Now, think of ten dreams that would help to make this imagined future a reality. Then, from those ten dreams, pick the one goal that you believe to be the most important. So, ten years, ten dreams, one goal: 10-10-1. To make this exercise as effective as possible, you should find a way of making your one big goal specific and measurable. Something like “I want to be better at managing my money” isn’t very clear at all, whereas “I have $10,000 in my savings account” certainly is. The final piece of advice on this exercise is to write down your ten dreams every single day. And not as “I wish” or “I want” statements, but as though they have already come true. Ten statements like “I am an exceptional mom” and “I have $10,000 in my savings account” will be powerful daily motivators to keep you on track. We like to think that our role models do everything themselves, but this is rarely the case. Every successful person is likely to have a team of loyal people in her corner, who make it possible for her to focus on the important things instead of getting bogged down by mundane details. Therefore, one of the best new behaviors you can adopt is to ask for help. Don’t think that you have to do it all yourself. Assistants, teachers, housekeepers and nannies can all be invaluable resources in providing you with the support needed to reach your goals. However, all the help in the world may not matter if you don’t have a solid foundation for success in your life. In order to effectively pursue your dreams, you need to have some foundational practices and empowering behaviors in place, the first of which is a healthy lifestyle. For the author, this means staying hydrated, getting up early and making sure you spend a part of each and every day on the move. Remember, your body was made to move, not to sit around! An empowering community is also a part of a strong foundation. If you feel like you’re the smartest person in your circle of friends and colleagues, you need to expand your circle. Don’t be pulled down by the people you spend time with. Instead, surround yourself with people who enlighten, educate and make you better. A good morning routine can be the cornerstone of your solid foundation. If you wake up to a chaotic, unorganized morning, that chaos is likely to linger throughout the rest of your day. So, why not plan a perfect morning for yourself every day? For the author, a perfect morning looks like this. First, she wakes up at 5:00 a.m. and utilizes this as quality time before the kids get up. During this time she meditates and does some journal writing, as well as writing down her 10-10-1 dreams. Then, she feeds the kids and gets them off to school, after which she’ll put on some music, have her morning smoothie and plan the day ahead. Finally, the last empowering behavior the author recommends is to learn how to say no. Generally, if you have a decision to make and the answer isn’t an obvious “Hell yes!” then it should probably be an honest and polite “No.” Stay away from maybes, and always strive to respond truthfully. Along with your foundation of empowering behaviors, there are also certain skills that can help anyone reach their goals. Now, as with any skill, these are all things that you can get better at with some intentional practice. First is planning. If you feel like you’re terrible at planning, try this road map exercise: set your goal at the finish line, and then work backward. Think to yourself about what needs to happen for you to get from where you are to that finish line. Brainstorm as many useful ideas as you can think of, and then narrow it down to three of the most important mile markers, that is, smaller goals to get you to your main goal. You might, for example, want to publish your own book. Even though you may have all sorts of research and networking ideas, three good mile markers would be to write a book proposal, hire a literary agent and submit your proposal to publishers. The second skill is confidence. To illustrate the gender disparity when it comes to confidence, one recent study showed that men will often apply for a job if they feel they meet 60 percent of the role’s criteria, whereas women tend to only apply if they’re 100 percent qualified. Don’t forget that you can grow on the job, even if it’s a challenging one. The author turned a corner in her earlier career as an event planner when she took on a catering gig during the Sundance film festival. She didn’t have any first-hand catering experience, but she had confidence that her experience in planning events involving catering would pay off – and it did. Along with confidence, there are the skills of persistence and effectiveness. Remember that your education and training is never finished – there are always more ways to learn and improve. It also helps to always be specific with your goals. Instead of putting “work on your book” on your to-do list, tell yourself to “write 2,000 words.” You’ll find this to be a much more effective approach. Finally, there are the skills of positivity and leadership. If things get messy, that’s when you have to choose gratitude and positivity. This may not be the easy thing to do, but it will keep you in control. Finally, leadership may not come naturally. You may imagine “leaders” as sitting in big offices wearing power suits. But erase that thought and understand that you are also a leader. You can change the world and make it brighter by letting the fire inside you glow for all to see. The key message in these blinks: Many women feel the need to apologize for their ambitions in life when they don’t fit into the traditional roles women are supposed to be happy settling for. But grown women should never apologize for having their own dreams and goals in life, and they should never ask for permission before going after those dreams. There are behaviors that can help women achieve their goals, such as being more focused, building a solid foundation for success and knowing when to say no. Acquiring skills like planning, persistence and positivity will also help. Actionable advice: Don’t let “it’s already been done” get in the way of your goal. Another way of talking yourself out of doing something is to think, “Why should I bother if someone else is already doing something similar?” If you’re good at knitting adorable, custom-made pot holders, you might see someone else selling potholders on Etsy and give up your potentially lucrative business before giving it a chance. What often happens in these situations is that you’re comparing your beginning against someone else’s career in progress, which isn’t really helpful. Many of today’s success stories began with failed first attempts or otherwise less-than-stellar beginnings. So, if your goal is to become a novelist, just concentrate on writing, and don’t worry about your book being compared to anyone else’s. Most first efforts are just a necessary stepping stone to bigger and better things. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Hansen","summary":"The author, Morten T. Hansen, wanted to know how top performers worked. What were their habits and techniques? So, in 2011, Hansen and a team of researchers set off to find out. They analyzed over 200 academic papers and interviewed and surveyed hundreds of professionals including both employees and their bosses. Based on this information, the team was able to extract seven “work smart” practices that seemed to explain the top performers’ methods and mind-sets. To test their hypothesis, they surveyed 5,000 people and found that the seven factors accounted for a whopping 66 percent of their performance. They also found that the more factors an individual adhered to, the better their performance ranking. To be more precise, the scoring went like this: Depending on how each of the 5,000 participants responded to the survey questions, they received a score that reflected how much of the seven factors they practiced. This score could then be turned into an overall performance ranking. So, if someone only used 20 percent of the principles within the seven factors, they’d get an overall 20 percent on their performance ranking, and so on. Sounds complicated? Don’t worry, we’ll explain all in the coming blinks. In the following blinks, you’ll also learn who won the race to the South Pole and why; how you can start using the learning loop today; and why fighting during a meeting is encouraged. It is still a commonly held belief that if we want to get more work done, we should put in more effort and work harder for longer hours. But the real trick isn’t about working harder; it’s about working smarter. The first step to working smarter is to do less – which means: stop juggling multiple tasks and instead prioritize your work so that you’re dealing with one task at a time. If you multitask and try to tackle a bunch of responsibilities at work, you’re bound to spread yourself too thin and waste both your time and effort. Since none of the tasks get your full attention, none of them will get optimal results. HR specialist Susan Bishop learned this the hard way. She opened her own search consultancy in New York City, aimed at finding and recruiting the perfect candidates for media jobs. But in an effort to beat the competition, Bishop went outside her area of expertise to bring in all sorts of clients from many different industries. Bishop’s efforts were unfocused, and as a result, performance and profits suffered. Even judges are not immune to the inefficiencies of multitasking. According to a 2015 study of judges in Milan, those who multitasked and tried to handle a variety of cases at once were ultimately slower in processing those cases. The fastest judge spent 178 days on a case, while the slowest multitasking judge spent 398 days! Now, instead of multitasking, you need to go further and obsess about the task that has your undivided attention. Roald Amundsen knew a thing or two about the benefits of an obsessive focus. Back in 1911, the Norwegian explorer was in a race to be the first man at the South Pole. His competitor was the veteran explorer and Royal Navy Commander, Robert Falcon Scott. Scott made the mistake of dividing his attention among a variety of transportation methods, including dogs, ponies, skis and motor sleds – all of which move at different paces. Scott also made the mistake of sending a dog expert to pick out his ponies, which resulted in a collection of 20 small horses that were all unfit for Antarctic conditions. So Amundsen won the race, and he did it by focusing on one means of transportation: dogs. Not only that, he was thoroughly obsessed with finding out which dogs were best suited to the climate and terrain of Antarctica. So he immersed himself in research and reached out to the top experts. In the author’s survey of 5,000 people, those who limited their focus but were still obsessed with their priorities performed better by an average of 25 percent. Let’s say you have a peer who is always outperforming you. You might decide to double down on your current work regimen. Instead of rethinking how you work, you’ll work harder. However, rethinking or redesigning the way you work is exactly what you should be doing if you want to improve your output. In the author’s survey, 5,000 participants ranked a series of work-related statements, such as: “Reinvented their job to add more value” and “Created new opportunities in their work - new activities, new projects, new ways of doing things.” The results clearly showed that those with a willingness to redesign the way they worked performed better. For a really beneficial redesign, you should think beyond simple productivity goals and focus on the ways in which your work provides value. Anyone can add hours to their workday, or think in terms of dollars and cents, but a genuine redesign should find ways to generate more value – whether it’s for your customers, your teammates or your suppliers. This value can take many forms, such as streamlining a process that makes it easier for a colleague to work, or improving the development stage for new products. So don’t just think of ways to better reach your goals or accomplish your tasks. At the end of the day, these steps could add zero value. For example, a dentist might redesign her process to see more patients during a workday, but this could end up reducing accurate diagnoses. Similarly, a lawyer might bill a lot of hours, regardless of whether he has provided valuable counsel. Along with this focus on value, a meaningful redesign should also find a good balance between quality and efficiency. Quality goes hand in hand with accuracy and reliability. So, if your work involves transcribing audio recordings, don’t measure your performance by how many words you can transcribe, but rather how few mistakes you make. In this case, more accuracy equals a higher quality and better performance. However, you don’t want to prove inefficient, either. If being accurate in your transcriptions means you only get through ten words every minute, that’s not very efficient work and, therefore, it doesn’t add much value. Just because you’re working, doesn’t mean you have to stop learning. This is the basic idea behind the learning loop, a technique for getting smarter while you’re on the job. The principle is to get constant feedback and check on your results so you can regularly make little tweaks to your process and improve those results. In other words, learning loops are a great way to improve performance. One of the participants in the author’s survey was Brittany Gavin, a manager of food and nutrition at a California hospital. Gavin had recently faced a big problem: many patients were complaining about the food, which was a sure sign that performance was suffering. As a manager, it was Gavin’s job to get her team to think up new ideas and flex their problem-solving muscles. Unfortunately, when Gavin asked her team if they had any new ideas, all she got in response was a whole lot of nothing. Eager for some help, Gavin enrolled in a training program where she learned an important lesson: When asking for ideas, make your questions specific and phrase them in a way that suggests you’re inviting participants to share ideas they already have. So, instead of a general question like, “Do we have any new ideas?” you should ask a more inviting question like, “What kind of ideas do we have for improving our food service?” Gavin then assessed the outcome, got feedback and made adjustments. She kept the learning loop going for weeks, and they made excellent progress. Eventually, patient satisfaction rose as 84 new ideas were implemented, including improvements like better handling for milk so that it would still be cold when served. A great way to start a learning loop is to spend 15 minutes of your workday improving a certain skill. The author used learning loops to hone his skills as a keynote speaker. He began by making video recordings of his speeches. After he finished, he’d watch a few minutes of the video to make his own assessment, and then ask someone else to watch a clip and to give him some feedback on a specific aspect he wanted to improve. This only took around a quarter of an hour to complete each day. If you’ve spent time trying to figure out the best career choice, you’ve probably been told, “Do whatever it is you’re passionate about.” But in reality, passion is only part of the solution, since you need to direct that passion with purpose. Passion is great for helping you identify what you love, but it’s purpose that creates meaningful work – the kind that has clear value and contributes to other individuals, organizations or society. According to the author’s survey, when people find both passion and purpose in their work, they perform 18 percent better than those who feel neither. The author also found that when passion is met with purpose, it galvanizes people and allows them to access a more focused energy that makes their work smarter. The results of his survey also showed that while purpose and passion aren’t predictors for how many hours people will work, they do predict how much effort will be given during those hours. If you feel like your passion or purpose need a good boost, you may need to discover a new role for yourself. But this doesn’t necessarily mean you need to quit your job altogether. You may be able to experience that boost by simply finding a new role within your current organization. That’s what Steven Birdsall did. As the COO for global sales at the German software giant, SAP, he found his passion levels were bottoming out. Birdsall missed the thrill of being an entrepreneur and having direct contact with customers, so he considered quitting his job until he realized that he could scratch that entrepreneurial itch by launching a new business within SAP. Birdsall’s new line of business would focus on rapid deployment solution (RDS), which would allow outside organizations to use SAP software for a set amount of time at a fixed price. RDS had some market demand but, prior to Birdsall’s initiative, it hadn’t been a priority for the sales department. There was a certain amount of risk in Birdsall’s plan, but he had both passion and purpose on his side as the endeavor allowed him to put on his entrepreneurial hat and shake hands with hundreds of potential customers. It paid off, too: within a couple of years, RDS was generating an annual revenue of $1.3 billion. Few of us truly work alone. We have co-workers, bosses or clients, and we depend on the expertise, information or money of others. Oftentimes, our work relies on the approval or support of others. Therefore, securing that support is a valuable skill. To get people on board, it helps to have an idea with a strong purpose, but it’s even better when that idea inspires and evokes the emotions of others. There are different ways to do this. For example, you can play to powerful feelings like fear, anger or resentment, which you can do by addressing a sensitive and pressing issue. And then you can touch on feelings of hope, joy and excitement with an idea that promises to fix that issue and make the future a better place. The British chef, Jamie Oliver, grabbed people’s attention and their emotions when he called for better food to be served in schools. At a West Virginia school, he had a mountain of fat dumped in front of students and their parents – an amount equal to the yearly fat consumption from the current school lunches. This definitely touched on feelings of anger and disgust about poor eating habits. Oliver then switched gears and made a plea to their passion and hope by raising the prospects of a new and healthier future. While these are great tactics to gain the support of others, we still meet resistance from time to time. Fortunately, there’s a way to get the support of people who oppose your ideas. By using smart grit, you can persevere with clever tactics that neutralize any resistance. One of the best tactics is to assume the perspective of your opponent. This way you can prepare a tailor-made response to address quickly whatever concerns are sure to arise. Lorenza Pasetti used this tactic well. As the manager of Volpi Foods, a US-based company that produces cured Italian meats, she was ready to counter the criticisms of the Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma. This strict organization didn’t like Volpi Food’s use of the words “Italian” and “prosciutto” on their products as they believed it disrespected the traditional Italian methods for curing meat. Once she assumed their perspective, Pasetti realized that their main concern was about Italian heritage, not any concern over US market shares. So, by the time she met the Consorzio, Pasetti was ready to explain the multiple generations of deep Italian ties behind the family-owned Volpi Foods. With this, the Consorzio was satisfied and backed off. If you’ve ever worked as part of a team, you’re likely familiar with how much of that work takes place in group meetings – it’s where the big decisions are taken to determine how projects move forward. So it stands to reason that knowing how to hold effective meetings is a crucial skill. If there’s one way to simplify the best approach to meetings, it would be: Fight – then unite! This might sound counterintuitive at first, but a good fight can be extremely useful. It allows people to debate, scrutinize opinions and speak their mind. In this environment, ideas can flourish, whereas, in a silent and sleepy meeting, no one will feel like challenging the status quo. While a heated debate is a good start, the discussion shouldn’t go on forever. The second and equally important part is to unite. From the very start of the meeting, the entire team should be committed to respecting and implementing whatever final decision is made by the team leader. According to the author’s study, teams who follow the “fight and unite” method perform better than teams that don’t. Now, if you want to ensure that your fights are constructive, you should make every effort to bring together a diverse team. Obviously, if everyone on the team is like-minded, with similar backgrounds and viewpoints, there’d be no conflict, the fight wouldn’t progress, and no innovative ideas would emerge. When the author researched team performance to rank the top 2,000 CEOs of public companies, he found Bart Becht, CEO of London-based company Reckitt Benckiser. Coming in at sixteenth place, the author was surprised he hadn’t previously heard of this multibillion pound consumer goods giant. Becht not only encouraged “constructive conflict” in his meetings, but he was also ranked alongside famous CEOs like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos because he made sure those meetings included people with different opinions and perspectives. When talking to the author, Becht elaborated on the kind of personal differences that mattered to him: not nationality, job title or anything like that, but experience, pure and simple. When people with different experiences come together, the magic happens, and the exciting new ideas begin to emerge. There’s no doubt about it; great things can happen when people collaborate. However, there are good ways and bad ways to facilitate collaboration. The author points to overcollaboration and undercollaboration as two common mistakes companies can make that end up hurting overall performance. In some organizations, people can feel forced to collaborate, even if they are highly experienced in a task and don’t need any outside input to excel in their job. This is what’s known as overcollaboration, and as a result, they end up wasting time and energy with a collaborator who ultimately offers no new insight. On the other hand, there’s the undercollaboration scenario, where people fail to collaborate when it’s crucial to get outside help. In these cases, the performance will end up being a fraction of what it could have been. Undercollaboration can be extremely unfortunate, especially in medical scenarios. Back in 2012, the hospital system in Fort Dodge, Iowa, still didn't have a way to exchange patient information readily between the various medical departments. Therefore, it wasn’t uncommon for a patient to be treated in one department by a doctor lacking important medical history from another. Unsurprisingly, the hospitals in Fort Dodge had a high readmission rate back then. The right way to go about it is to practice disciplined collaboration. This is how the top performers collaborate, and it’s about recognizing and choosing to collaborate only in activities that promise to offer value. According to the author’s survey, people who practice disciplined collaboration outperform under- and overcollaborators by 14 percent. So, if you’re not sure if a certain collaboration scenario is worthwhile, just ask yourself if it adds any benefit or value to what you and the other potential collaborators are working on. Keep this in mind when you’re trying to talk collaborators into working with you – if you really want to win them over, be sure to describe all the ways they can benefit. At the chemical company Agilent Technologies, the business unit manager, Mike, needed to convince the life sciences unit to collaborate on a new chemical liquids device. After getting turned down the first time around, Mike successfully wooed them once he produced calculations that showed how, within a period of eight years, the results of the collaboration would likely add a value of nearly $1 billion to the organization. That certainly got the life sciences unit interested. As with much of the other advice, using collaboration to its maximum potential is about striking the right balance and understanding the real value of your work. The key message in these blinks: Being great at work is about more than just talent and effort – it’s about working smarter. After crunching the numbers of a massive survey, the author Morten T. Hansen found some common habits and techniques that can help anyone get better results at work. These include being obsessively focused on one task at a time, being both passionate and purposeful, having a diversified team, and knowing the right time to collaborate. Actionable advice: Learn to say no.  It’s not easy to focus on one task at a time if your boss is burying you under an avalanche of work. But this is why it’s important to learn how to say “no.” If you already have a full plate of work, and your boss asks you to help with a sales pitch, be polite and say that you’d love to help out, but you’re already giving 100 percent to the merger case that was assigned to you yesterday.

Suggested further reading: Great by Choice by Jim Collins & Morten T. Hansen The world is an uncertain place, constantly changing and often chaotic. While many companies are unable to survive in this chaos, some companies are not only able to survive in these shifting conditions but even thrive in them. Great by Choice analyses why these companies succeed while most others fail. Great By Choice is the result of exhaustive, in-depth research into the business environment. It argues that success is not the result of a company being more innovative, bold or open to taking risks, nor is it a result of mere luck or chance. Success in fact comes from a mixture of discipline, evidence-based innovation and a fear of failure that borders on paranoia. It is this recipe, rather than luck, which enables certain companies to become great.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Maybe you think that you just weren’t talented enough. However, as these blinks will show you, talent is not enough. What you need is grit. Grit is what made Michael Jordan such a successful basketball player, it’s what made the iPhone possible and the reason you know who Oprah Winfrey is. So what is grit? It’s the ability to work hard and have a get-back-on-the-horse-again mentality. It’s what you need to develop if you want to fulfill your dreams.  In these blinks, you’ll learn why daydreams can be dangerous; how Jia Jang’s failure as an entrepreneur made him famous; and how to write a bestseller at the age of 98. Have you ever had the feeling that others excelled without trying, seemingly coasting on their talent? In schools the world over, some kids never study yet get great grades while others are bent over their books all the time just to keep up. But the truth is that those who rely on talent won’t get far in life. In fact, talent is totally overrated. That’s because plenty of talented people have the potential for greatness, but realize from a young age that they can get by on their talent without hard work. On the other hand, less-talented people strive for success and self-improvement. They seek out subjects and jobs they care about, not just ones they are naturally good at.  So, while it might seem as though talented people are the winners of the world, it’s actually those that have to work harder who end up being the most successful. That’s because while talented people dream, others achieve.  Take a look at a study conducted in New York by the psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen comparing the study habits and later careers of graduate students. The analysis found that the students who spent more time daydreaming about their aspirations than actually knuckling down to work ended up with fewer job offers and smaller paychecks following graduation than those who put in long hours!  Hard work will help get you the job you want. For instance, the authors run an advertising agency, and a few years ago they were desperate to land a big new client – the restaurant giant Wendy’s.  Their strategy? They pulled 70- and 80-hour weeks for months, even going as far as to work at Wendy’s themselves to learn the inside scoop on their operations. Not a waking minute went by that they weren’t preparing for their presentation. Well, they landed the contract and Wendy’s said they chose the firm because they worked the hardest – and therefore would be the best. When the highwire artist Nick Wallenda traversed the Grand Canyon on a 1,400-foot-long wire, he slipped and had no safety net to catch him. But he didn’t fall. Instead, using nothing but his ability and intensive training, he managed to stay on the wire.  And just like Nick, there’s going to come a time in your career when you need to lose the proverbial safety net. That’s because if you’ve got grit and passion, your career will take off, and if you want to ride the rising tide of this success you will have to let go of your safe zone. This is the moment when people with grit start taking calculated risks and diving headfirst into uncharted waters. But that doesn’t mean you should jump into just any situation. For instance, say you’re the CEO of a company and are itching to enter a new market. It’s essential to scope out the risks and competition first, because there’s nothing worse than failing to assess potential dangers and taking your company down as a result.  However, if you do fall short, grit will help you embrace and learn from rejection. For example, maybe you were an aspiring entrepreneur but couldn’t face being turned down by investors. Well, while rejection might sting, you can always shine a positive light on it.  Just take Jia Jiang, who left the safety of his tech job and, inspired by Steve Jobs, set out as an entrepreneur. He kept getting rejected and pretty soon was on the verge of giving up, but instead buckled down and turned his rejection to his advantage by starting the 100 Days of Rejection project. Jiang endeavored to do a different task every day for a hundred days – like ordering just a quarter of a shrimp at a restaurant or trying to borrow $100 from a stranger – each of which was meant to help him overcome his fear of rejection. He put his project online and became famous in the process. Now he’s got a book deal and has appeared on TED talks.  Did you know that Van Gogh only sold one painting before he died? It might come as a shock since his paintings have wowed art lovers across the world and fetched record-breaking prices. But even though he didn’t get recognition during his lifetime, Van Gogh still produced over 2,000 paintings! How? Through dedication and grit.  That’s because most projects take a long time to make real progress and even longer to find success. As a result, many people lose motivation and patience halfway through and simply give up. But there’s another option. You can keep motivated during long-term projects by taking joy in the little achievements that mark your way. For instance, state attorney Mike Moore, made famous by his legal battle against Big Tobacco, spent years trying to hold huge tobacco conglomerates responsible for countless lung cancer-related deaths. But his attempts were rejected time and time again by a variety of different state attorneys.  However, over the years, he slowly built a stellar team, was motivated by the small measures of support he did receive from other state attorneys and finally got the courts to force tobacco companies to pay $100 billion to 46 different states, covering the medical costs of smoking. But some people will feel that as they get older, less is possible. Therefore, it’s essential that as you age, you keep your motivation up and never settle. Instead, make productive use of your time by planning every year. Don’t let a “not-yet” attitude rule your decisions and never feel like you’re too old to do the things you’re passionate about. You aren’t too old, and you never will be.  For instance, Captain James Henry, who was raised on a farm but went on to become a fisherman, didn’t learn to read until he was 92. Not just that, but he wrote an autobiographical bestseller called In A Fisherman’s Language at the ripe age of 98. We’ve all experienced failure and everyone knows it can be tough. However, it’s not your failures that define you, but what you do with them. For instance, even star poker players are dealt losing hands some of the time, but the best of them know how to learn from their mistakes and grow through them. And it’s not just true for card players. Regardless of what you do, over the course of your career you’ll inevitably face failure and seemingly insurmountable obstacles, but every single one of these challenges is a chance to learn and improve. For instance, Eleanor Longden was diagnosed schizophrenic after hearing voices in her head that played on her most deep-seated fears of failure and abandonment.  But she didn’t let her illness defeat her. Instead she began studying psychology, earned her Ph.D. and is now on the board of a global support and research organization that helps people with the same mental illness she has.  However, rising from adversity doesn’t mean that grit should come from the fear of losing everything. Instead, it should be about gaining more than you’d ever imagined. In fact, people with grit aren’t successful because they fear failure, but because they see what they stand to gain by accomplishing their goals.  This way of thinking enables people with grit to accomplish what seems impossible and conquer any challenge they meet. In other words, they don’t fail, they fail forward. For instance, early on, Oprah Winfrey was demoted from her first job as a television anchor because her boss didn’t think she was “made for TV.” But obviously she didn’t give up. She was determined to succeed and we all know how she turned out: one of the biggest TV stars in history. Do you ever wonder how humans thousands of years ago managed to survive, despite the elements, diseases and wild animals? The key to their success was group work: helping each other, sharing food and increasing each other’s quality of life was essential to the development of the first human communities. The same is true today. In fact, helping others will actually boost your own motivation. For instance, have you ever lent a hand to an elderly women by carrying her heavy bags? Have you offered a blanket, shelter or food to a homeless person? If you have done these things, or anything like them, you’ve probably felt like a better person and experienced a wave of gratification. Well, it’s this gratification that can increase your grit. Just take Navyn Salen, who used to be a stay-at-home mom with three kids. One day she made the decision to help African children suffering from malnutrition. It took her years to build an NGO and the necessary support to expand her network, but after years of investing her every free moment, she has now managed to help over 2.5 million children in 44 countries. So, helping other people can lead you to do things you wouldn’t have thought possible, but it also helps you build character and meet new people. That’s because helping others will give you a deeper connection to your own emotions and personality. For instance, you’ll see that you can act selflessly and be kind. But you’ll also meet other like-minded people to collaborate with – something that will take your work to the next level. Not just that, but once you meet people who share your values, why not offer some of your grit to them? It’s easy, just teach other people to be kind, resilient, and to persevere. The result will be increased motivation for everyone involved. The key message in this book: The key to success is grit: resilience, patience, passion and hard work. So, instead of daydreaming and coasting on your natural abilities, buckle down and strive for your goals. Doing so means using failure to your advantage, taking calculated risks and courageously facing the unknown.  Actionable advice: Two birds with one stone: run a marathon and give up junk food. Lots of people wish they could run a marathon yet many of us still spend Saturday sprawled on the couch with a bag of chips. But it’s easy to meet this goal while kicking your junk food habit. Just make a training plan and every time you feel tempted to indulge in fast food, reach for your running shoes instead!

He captures examples of entrepreneurs and organizations helping themselves and their employees by encouraging passion and productivity at work. These high performers share five skills: asking the right question; seeing for themselves; talking to their outer circle; improving the mix; and delivering the difference. You’ll find out that making a difference and doing great work just means finding out what people truly love. You will learn how to make a difference that people take to heart, and to go on making a difference throughout your career. In these blink you will learn the story behind The Cat in the Hat; how Instagram was created from a single feature of a completely different app; and how the inventor of instant photography came up with the Polaroid. Imagine that you’re recovering from surgery in a hospital. Which would you prefer: a janitor who noisily rushes through his cleaning routine in the ward, or one who recognizes your suffering, and works carefully and quietly? Clearly, the way this janitor does his job affects your well-being. In the same way, the way you do your job will always have a huge impact on others. Yet most of us work with our heads down, so immersed in checking off our daily to-do list that we miss all of the other factors in work life. The noisy janitor, for example, isn’t trying to be insensitive. He’s just preoccupied with getting all the rooms cleaned as quickly as possible. However, we can broaden our perspective by working with our head up. Job crafting can help us change our perception of work – from being something we just need to do, to a vehicle through which we can make a positive difference in people’s lives. In this example, it means the janitor changing his routine so he causes the least disturbance and noise. But crafting your job isn’t enough. You can also reframe in order to discover what benefits you can provide for others. Reframing is when you make a mental link between your job and a greater purpose: its value to society and its potential to make a difference. Reframing is about considering how your work affects others, and trying to see a larger purpose beyond the immediate goals of your job. A hospital janitor might see the potential to improve patients’ mood simply by talking to them and making subtle rearrangements in their rooms. You too can take your work beyond the to-do list by reframing your role. Would you consider the person who invented the wheel to be a great inventor? Yes? Then what about the one who invented the axle? The wheel was a smart piece of work, but good work is just the starting point – the foundation upon which great work is made. Civilization’s game-changing innovations are the result of adding and tweaking good ideas and inventions in order to create something even better. As Carl Sagan said: “If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.” You need the ingredients – such as apple, wheat and cinnamon – to exist before you can turn them into delicious apple pie. However, if you only build upon what you already have, you’re placing considerable constraints on what you can do. But don’t see this as a problem; these constraints are actually the ideal starting point. They can lead to amazing creativity. For example, when illustrator Ted Geisel was trying to make a positive change in the way children learn to read, his boss narrowed down his options: he could use only the 225 words that every six-year-old knows – most of which are two syllables long and few of which are verbs – and then write a story they could read. Rather than becoming frustrated by the limitations of this project, he embraced them as a challenge. His breakthrough came when he found two words on this restrictive list that rhymed: “cat” and “hat.” In 1957 he published the first version of The Cat in the Hat and forever changed children’s literature. Geisel is the author you know as Dr Seuss, and his works remain popular to this day. In 1944 a three-year-old girl asked her father the right question as he was taking a picture of her: Why couldn’t she see the photo right there and then? Her father explained that the films needed to be developed in various chemical baths in a darkroom. For the kid, this answer meant nothing. Fortunately, her dad decided he didn’t like that answer either, and set out to do something about it. Great work comes from taking the time to question what’s missing in our lives that the rest of the world would love, too. Everything we use in our day-to-day existence was formed by the question of whether there are improvements that could be made to the status quo. Back to the three-year-old girl: three years after she asked about the picture, her father, Edwin Land, gave the world something that people would love when he co-founded the Polaroid Corporation, forever revolutionizing photo development with the creation of instant photography. When asking yourself these crucial questions, make sure you keep three things in mind: Tackle the problem. Problems are opportunities, so don’t run away from them! Edwin Land wasn’t satisfied with the initial answer he gave his daughter, and decided instead to look more closely at the question she asked. Consider what you’re good at and try to use it in your solution. Land had worked with a group of scientists to create a polarizing filter for sunglasses. He put this knowledge to use when answering his daughter’s question. Think outside the box. Think big! Try to imagine what kinds of things people would love if anything were possible. By asking the right questions and applying the right attitude, you’ll be able to change the world for the better. Today, Netflix is a household name with global success, which makes it easy to forget that, earlier on in their existence, the company was in serious trouble. At that time a large part of their business involved mailing DVDs to customers, who then returned them. But mail sorting machines destroyed DVDs packaged in normal envelopes. This was costing the company loads of money, but it only took a trip to the sorting office for Netflix co-founder Jim Cook to find a solution: a low-cost “Netflix Envelope” sturdy enough to protect DVDs. So what can we learn from this? Essentially, the best work often comes when you take a look for yourself. We all see things differently, and our own perspective draws on our own ideas and our personal knowledge. Seeing things for yourself isn’t just about being observant of the things around you – you can also gain perspective from looking into the past. Take a page out of Amazon’s or iTunes’ books: they’re constantly looking into your search and purchase history in order to see what you might be interested in now. You too can find patterns in the past, and use them to form insights about how to give people what they love. One of Whirlpool’s most famous products resulted from an examination of the past. After considering trends in washing machines over the years, they reintroduced the top loader, which would become one of Whirlpool’s most successful projects ever. Did you know that 80 percent of the 16,000 words that we utter each day are spoken to the same five-to-eight person group of friends and trusted confidants? That leaves you with only 3,000 words for the people you don’t usually talk to – and it’s these people who have the greatest impact on your creativity. Talking to people you don’t usually talk to can lead to ideas that you couldn’t put together on your own. Your inner circle is a comfortable place to start conversations about your ideas and aspirations. However, because they think like you, support you and don’t want to hurt your feelings, you can’t count on their objectivity, and this can put you at a disadvantage. But we do find divergent thinking, unexpected questions, difference of opinion and added expertise from our outside circle – people who operate beyond our more intimate peer group. These people will give you feedback that contradicts your ideas, and that’s an asset, because it shows you how your ideas or approach might be going wrong. But it’s crucial that this challenging feedback is high quality. You can obtain this by presenting your ideas to others in a way that taps into their desire to share their opinion. You aren’t merely asking them to solve your problem for you, you’re inviting them to participate in making a difference. This shared responsibility gives them an opportunity to focus their insights and talent in a way that is meaningful to them. Simple phrases like “Can I get your thoughts on something?” “I have this idea but don’t know where to start, so can you help me?” or “Have you had any experience with something like this before?” can be great starting places for productive conversations. Whatever you do, make sure that you don’t limit your conversations with outsiders to just 3,000 words! So far, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about how to approach work in a way that will give you positive, creative ideas. But this isn’t all. You must also edit and improve your ideas before implementing them in order to make a difference people love. Great workers create changes in their mind before making them a reality. Your goal should be to model, adjust and play with your awesome ideas before executing them, if you want to give them the greatest chance for success. There are three tricks which can help you along the way. First, add something new. Simple additions that lead to massive improvements are all around us: just think of the rolling suitcase (suitcase plus wheels) or heated car seat (car seat plus heater). Start by brainstorming with a ton of ideas, always asking yourself whether these additions improve the product or concept and whether people will love it. Also keep in mind that these additions must be useful. Sometimes we’re so eager to innovate that we end up with additions no one cares about. How many of your remote control’s features do you actually use, for example? And how many are just annoying or confusing? Second, you can improve by simplifying. When we want to improve something, our first impulse is to add to it. But additions don’t always lead to improvement. In fact, removing things can be a great way to make a difference that people love. Think of the iPod: by removing a set of buttons and replacing them with a scrolling wheel, Apple removed complexity from their MP3 player while also making it a design icon. In essence, look at the features that people don’t love. Those are the ones you can probably remove. Finally, harmonize all your ideas. Your ideas for improvement should be clearly related to one another. Make sure that everything works together. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger once created an app which they named Burbn. The app was designed to allow users to share their location with friends, as well as share photos. Never heard of it? That’s because it was a complete failure. People didn’t care about “checking in,” and the app was too slow and had too many features. This kind of failure is common with new ideas; it’s how you handle these failures that will separate you from everyone else. Great work does not end once the product is complete. It ends when you make a difference. However, to change this definition of “complete,” you need a growth mind-set rather than a fixed mind-set. People with fixed mind-sets believe that their successes are the result of their natural ability and intelligence, and don’t pay attention to negative feedback or learn from failure. On the other hand, people with a growth mind-set know that success isn’t innate – it’s the result of learning and failing. They’re always open to improvements led by feedback, good or bad. Systrom and Krieger could have easily given up on Burbn, or fixed its obvious errors. Instead, they embraced a growth mind-set, opting to find out whether their app had a redeeming quality that people loved. The answer was “photo sharing.” They took this information and ran with it. They added cool filters and borders and made the photos shareable across multiple social network platforms, and finally relaunched their app in 2010 under a new name: Instagram. The key message in this book: Everyone can make a difference in their work, as long as they have the right mind-set and a willingness to explore. By mastering the five skills of asking, seeing, talking, improving the mix and delivering the difference, you too can make a difference that people love. Actionable advice: Don't lock yourself inside your inner circle.  Close colleagues and old friends offer a kind of ease and comfort that allows us to freely share ideas, but this familiarity can actually stifle your creativity. The next time you have an idea, invite outsiders into the conversation in order to learn from their unique perspective.

Grove","summary":"Management seems like an overwhelming task. Managers are expected to be everywhere at every time, to listen and speak to their staff, to plan and organize workflows, to bring the best out of their employees and enhance overall performance. But how can one person master so many tasks? In these blinks, you’ll find out what the key responsibilities of a manager are and what you need to know about your employees and your role. You will learn how to collect the information you need to make the right decisions, how to motivate your team and how to make them perform well. You’ll also learn what management has to do with serving breakfast; how to find out quickly whether an employee lacks skill or motivation; and why managers may take a leaf out of a sports coach’s playbook. It might seem an odd idea, but working as a waiter will perfectly prepare you to manage the production processes of a company. How come? Well, managing production processes is actually just like serving breakfast. For instance, if your job is to deliver a three-minute boiled egg, toast and coffee, you’re already facing the essential requirements of production. You need to respond to demand by delivering your product according to a given schedule while meeting expectations for quality and keeping down costs. To succeed at this complicated series of tasks you need to keep the first question of production in mind: which step is the hardest to complete? When it comes to serving breakfast, it’s definitely boiling the egg as it takes the longest time. All the remaining steps should be planned around the time needed to accomplish this task. Then, once you’ve identified the priority step in production, it’s your job as a manager to find the most cost-effective way to use the resources at your disposal. Imagine a waiter has to stand in line every morning to use the toaster while his customer waits for her breakfast. How can he resolve the problem? His options are to ask a coworker for help, prepare toast in advance or buy another toaster. Essentially, managers are there to identify and solve these kinds of bottlenecks, and their solutions include hiring a larger workforce, increasing inventory or buying more equipment. But remember, all of these choices cost money, and the task of a manager is to balance them in the most cost-effective way. But that’s not all; managers also need to detect problems. That’s because problems arise all the time in production; to control damage, it’s essential to find and fix them as early as possible. For example, if the kitchen ends up with a bunch of rotten eggs, it’d be better to find that out when they’re in the fridge and before they’re being boiled or tipped onto a customer’s plate. This means it’s essential for managers to monitor carefully all production processes. Naturally, a manager can’t be everywhere at once. To get a comprehensive overview, a manager needs to rely on good measurements. To do so, she should choose at least five indicators that are presented to her every morning upon arrival at work. First, she’ll want the sales forecasts right away. In other words, how many breakfasts will she have to make today? Second, the inventory levels are key. That’s because she needs to know how many eggs, loaves of bread and pounds of coffee she has in reserve. Third, she needs to know the condition of the equipment. Because if her only toaster called it quits yesterday, it’s essential to replace it before rush hour. Fourth, it’s important to have an update on the workforce. After all, if three waiters have called in sick, the manager needs to find substitutes right away. And finally, she’ll want a quality indicator that measures public opinion. Basically, did customers like the breakfast they were served? But having these production indicators isn’t enough; a manager also needs to know how to extract important information from them. One good strategy for this involves pairing two of them together. For instance, to better understand your inventory levels, you should check them against your sales forecasts to determine the potential for inventory shortages. This will help you decide what the critical inventory level is. You should also pair indicators with the actual results you’re achieving. For example, if you were evaluating a salesperson, you wouldn’t just consider the number of calls she made but also the number of deals she closed. You can also extract helpful information from indicators by examining trends. For instance, our manager can compare the number of breakfasts she served this month to previous months to assess her performance and make a prediction about whether she’ll serve more or less in the coming month. It might not always seem like it, but management is a team effort. This is why a manager isn’t just rated on their personal skills and individual performance, but also the working achievements of her team. For instance, if a manager does well at planning production, allocating resources and sniffing out mistakes, but her staff fails to execute, the manager is still responsible. So, how can you improve your team’s performance overall? Well, one of a manager’s key responsibilities when running a team is to collect and share information. Sometimes the best way to do that is through quick, informal conversations. After all, a few words shared between a manager and an employee at the coffee machine will spread a lot faster than any memo. However, asking for written reports from team members is also key. That’s because the discipline it takes to write a report makes the employee reflect on her work and better comprehend current issues. That makes reports essential for providing valuable information to a manager. But managers are also responsible for making decisions, which makes the previous responsibility of collecting and sharing information all the more essential. For example, it’s up to a manager to decide to open a new branch or hire new employees. To do so she’ll need detailed information on all the possible choices as well as their pros and cons. Finally, it’s also a manager’s job to be a role model. A manager who spends working time making personal calls is unlikely to motivate their team. On the other hand, a manager who puts in long hours and takes the work seriously will provide a great example for others to follow. Just remember, values can’t be communicated through memos and conversations alone. This means managers need to show the right way to behave. After all, nothing leads better than an example. Many managers consider meetings the curse of their existence, and Peter Drucker, a leader in modern management, has even said that spending more than 25 percent of your time in meetings is a sign of poor organization. But nevertheless, meetings are essential to any manager’s daily routine. That’s because meetings are the foundation for all other managerial activities. For instance, you just learned about a manager’s core duties: gathering information, making decisions and serving as an example. Not one of these can be done well without holding meetings. So, you don’t need to be terrified if meetings are taking up half your day. They’re simply the necessary medium through which management works. That being said, there are different types of meetings. A mission-oriented meeting is meant to solve specific problems by arriving at a decision. These tend to be held spontaneously as an emergency arises, like a meeting called at the last minute to quickly deal with a huge product malfunction. Another kind of meeting is process-oriented. Here, information and opinions about less pressing matters are shared. These meetings rely on regularity to pay off. The most well-known form is a one-on-one meeting between a supervisor and her employee – an opportunity for them both to get informed. With inexperienced subordinates, this type of meeting should usually occur once a week, but its frequency also depends on the job area and how quickly conditions change. For example, you’ll need to hold them more often in a marketing environment, where the work pace is faster than in, say, a research department. Ideally, these one-on-ones last around an hour and occur in or near the employee’s workspace as their environment might be revealing. By looking at your employee’s desk you can tell whether he’s organized or if he suffers from frequent disruptions. Imagine an employee isn’t living up to expectations. Do you know how to quickly determine whether he lacks skills or just needs more motivation? Just ask yourself, “could he perform his task if his life depended on it?” If the answer is yes, then he’s probably struggling with low motivation. There’s no way you could play the violin beautifully without being a trained musician. But if you had to run 6 miles to flee a serial killer, you’d probably make it even if you weren’t in great shape. The fact is, employees who perform inefficiently usually lack skills or motivation. Therefore, it’s no surprise that motivation has become central to modern management, in large part due to the rise of knowledge workers whose main source of capital is information. After all, the quality of work performed by a manual laborer is easy to assess. That’s because if a poorly motivated bricklayer builds a crooked wall, the foreman will immediately notice and take corrective measures. But when it comes to knowledge workers, it’s hard to immediately tell if a task was done properly without being an expert in the field they’re operating in. That means it’s even more important to keep employees motivated to prevent these costly, tricky-to-spot errors. So, it’s up to a manager to motivate her employees. But motivation can only come from within, which means a manager’s job is to foster an environment that helps employees maintain their own motivation. To do so, a manager needs to know whether her employees are competence-driven or achievement-driven individuals. The former are motivated to expand their knowledge and skills. Think of a stellar musician who practices daily to improve his technique. Managers should encourage these employees to produce tangible results and deter them from focusing solely on self-improvement. The other type, achievement-driven employees, are driven by success. Employees like this should be put in a context where their objectives are ambitious enough that they flourish. Every worker expects to be rewarded for their professional commitments, and money is probably the most obvious reward. But is it the best? Well, up to a certain point, money is an incredible motivator, but it has its limits. For example, some people who are already rich see money only as a status symbol that shows the outside world how successful they are. Someone like this doesn’t really need additional income, so earning one, two or five million more won’t impact their motivation much. On the other hand even employees who depend on their salaries to support themselves find money’s motivational potential limited. That’s because money motivates people, but only until they achieve a decent standard of living where their basic needs are satisfied. After that, these employees will want more meaningful and relevant rewards. So, how can you keep employees at peak performance? By setting up a system that gauges their success. In fact, this is the only way for workers to make real progress. Just look at the competence-driven employees who love to expand their knowledge and skills. The best tactic for motivating them is to show them that they still have potential to improve. Because without this potential, the desire to do better all but disappears. To demonstrate the space for improvement, a manager can provide evaluations and feedback through, for instance, performance reviews that rate an employee on his achievements. But remember, when reviewing performance, it’s essential for a manager to know how a fear of failure can turn certain achievement-driven people into overly cautious underperformers. It’s crucial to communicate the importance of accepting failure and supporting such employees whenever they need it. Maybe you’ve come across people in your office who are slow workers and show little motivation, but can still push themselves to the limit to run a full marathon. What motivates people like this? Simply put, the desire to beat others. That’s because, when in competition, people are much more likely to take on challenges. This drive to beat the distance, stopwatch or competition is a result of self-actualization, an idea brought to prominence by the psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1954. A person who feels that she has the potential to master a challenge will also be compelled to take it on. She will feel this compulsion because of a need to attain her own potential – actualize herself – through the challenge. It’s no surprise, therefore, that the best environment for self-actualization is competitive sports. So, what does this mean for a manager? That you have to bring the sporting spirit of competition into the workplace, and that means letting employees compare themselves to their coworkers. For instance, the maintenance service that cleaned Intel’s facilities performed poorly for years until a program was created to put the teams from each building into competition with one another by rating their work and comparing the scores. Though there were no further incentives than the desire to beat the others, the cleanliness of every building improved dramatically, proving that competition alone can increase performance. In some respects, a good manager should act as if she were the coach of a sports team. For example, a coach never takes credit for the team’s success, and neither should a manager, because it might make her team feel cheated out of their well-deserved congratulations. Coaches also sometimes need to be tough on their players to force the best performance out of them. Similarly, managers need to know how to give employees constructive criticism. You might be wondering, is there one approach to management that trumps all others? Probably not. That’s because management styles are prone to shifts and no perfect style has yet emerged. For instance, in the early twentieth century, management was harsh and strictly hierarchical. Employees followed orders and didn’t question their superiors. Management theory then very slowly evolved into a more gentle approach that took the individual employee into consideration instead of just his productivity. But despite this transformation, researchers of motivation and leadership have never settled on one optimal style. However, for any given situation, researchers can point to a variable that indicates which approach should be relied on. This style of assessing your subordinates is called task-relevant maturity, or TRM. It’s a combination of an employee’s tendencies toward responsibility and achievement, as well as her education, training and experience. As a result, a worker’s TRM might be higher for one task or field and low for another. For instance, a sales manager’s TRM could be high for sales but low when she’s managing a production process. Asking her to do the latter would be a little like forcing a person who’s used to navigating on small country roads to all of a sudden drive on a major freeway. So, TRM levels can vary, and different management styles are required according to an employee’s ranking. For instance, if an employee has a low TRM for a certain task, a manager should lay out the process in clear, detailed instructions. Then, as the employee’s TRM increases, the manager can reduce her involvement while still monitoring progress. In this way, the manager–employee relationship mimics that between a parent and child. As a child ages, parenting style shifts. After all, a toddler needs to be told not to touch dangerous objects, but there’s no need to explain to a teenager why she shouldn’t touch the blade of a sharp knife. And the same goes for your employees. As they grow, they’ll learn for themselves how to best succeed. The key message in this book: The responsibilities of a manager are multi-faceted and the changing nature of work has transformed the role. This means modern managers are responsible for gathering information, making decisions, acting as role models, fostering motivation and flexibly assessing their employees.  Actionable advice: Decide whether being friends with your subordinates is right for you.  People often wonder whether it’s OK to form a friendship with people who work under them. That’s because such relationships can be difficult to maintain, especially when the higher-up has to take disciplinary action against her subordinate. So, as a manager you want to be clear where you stand on this issue. Simply imagine giving a critical performance review to an already close friend. If you can do that, then forming personal ties might make sense and could be used to strengthen your professional relationships. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

And, despite aiming for the stars, do you still tend to get caught up in answering emails and checking off tedious to-dos? Then you’re probably like most people: an average performer, stuck in the hamster wheel of life. Luckily, these blinks demonstrate why this needn’t be the case forever. In fact, a new body of research shows that the highest performing people in this world aren’t born with an extraordinary ability to achieve, and neither does their success stem from some specific kind of personality. Instead, the key to long-term success lies in certain habits – and with the help of just six of them, identified through research on high performance, you’ll be well on your way to extraordinary achievements. You’ll see why seeking clarity, generating energy, raising necessity, increasing productivity, developing influence, and demonstrating courage will help you perform your way to the stars. You’ll also learn what CEOs and professional athletes have in common; why you’d benefit from having your mother depend on your success; and how to understand and tame the seductions of email. Have you ever met someone who makes it all look so easy? Maybe she’s earned multiple degrees while working two jobs, all without breaking a sweat. Or maybe he’s the kind of guy with a Midas touch, and every project he tackles turns into a smashing success. Chances are they’re what’s known as a high performer. The author, Brendon Burchard, has conducted one of the biggest studies on high performance in history, examining people from over 190 countries to understand exactly how they achieve their long-term success. He concluded that gender, race, age and personality traits have very little to do with high performance. What really matters are certain key habits, like keeping yourself physically fit. In other words, it’s not who you are, but rather what you do that’s important. The author also discovered that these habits didn’t form by accident. High performers took them on deliberately. Now, don’t confuse these habits with “life hacks” or some simple, magical changes that take zero effort to implement. High performers outperform their peers because they consciously and consistently practice these habits. Another common trait is their confidence in being able to master even difficult tasks, like big new projects at work or learning new languages. Again, this isn’t an inherent trait; it’s an earned confidence achieved through diligent practice. This is good news for you, as it means you too can gain this confidence through practice. With continued practice, you’ll gain more knowledge, master more skills, and your confidence will grow, making it easier to keep learning and growing. This loop of continual growth and self-improvement is the hallmark of high performance. So far, so good, right? Now, without further ado, let’s look at those habits. When was the last time you asked yourself the big questions, such as, how do I want to be remembered? Or, what do I want to do with my life? Many will only think about these questions on their birthday or New Year’s Eve. But high performers ask these questions all the time; it’s a habit the author calls seeking clarity, and it keeps them goal oriented. It also gives them a strong purpose, direction and focus in everything they do, since they know precisely how their actions are helping them reach their goals. Conversely, when you lack clarity, you can end up sulking, mired in negative emotions. Clarity comprises four fields that you need to work on to improve: First is the self and knowing exactly what kind of person you want to become. High performers are focused on becoming the best version of themselves and being remembered this way. This could mean, for instance, being kind, attentive and humble. Once you determine the self you want to be, the question becomes: Have you behaved this way so far and if not, what do you need to change? Second is the social sphere and being aware and intentional about your interactions with others. High performers don’t have an autopilot for socializing. If there’s a lunch date, meeting or party coming up, the question becomes: How can I shape this meeting in a positive way? The third is the field of skills and knowing precisely which talents need to be developed. High performers will focus on a primary profession or field of interest and work on giving themselves time to practice while avoiding all distractions. If you want to be a great writer, this would mean setting aside time to write, not just learn about writing, and then getting feedback to learn what needs improving. The fourth field is service and finding a way to give back to others. High performers excel at working on behalf of others and not just themselves. Doing so helps motivate them while also endowing them with a passionate drive and granting meaning to their work. The question to ask here would be: Who needs me? If you were to list the habits you imagine a successful CEO might have, you might think of efficient scheduling and the ability to keep distractions to a minimum. But you might not think of exercise. People often associate CEOs with mental fitness, but research shows that they’re also physically fit, and their energy levels tend to be similar to those of professional athletes. The author calls the second habit generating energy, and it’s key to maintaining a high performance level. Neuroscientists have found that regular exercise increases the production of new neurons in the areas of your brain that are related to learning and memory. Exercise also improves mood and reduces stress, all of which adds up to greatly enhanced leadership performance. But everyone knows that exercise is good for you, right? High performers stand out because they make routine exercise a habit and stick to it, while underperformers are great at coming up with excuses to avoid working out. As for generating mental energy, this is achieved by having a positive outlook on life. Data shows high performers are more cheerful and positive than their peers, even though their personal and professional lives are no less difficult and troubled. They continually and intentionally focus on the good while avoiding getting mired in negative thinking. And the research suggests that this positive thinking directly relates to high performers leading happier emotional lives and having more mental energy. To get yourself into the habit of positive thinking, take a moment each morning to ask yourself what you have to look forward to in the day ahead. Maybe you’re meeting an old friend for lunch or celebrating a coworker’s birthday. Keep in mind that this isn’t just about staying in a good mood: Neuroscientists believe that anticipating positive events releases as much dopamine – the hormone associated with happiness – as experiencing the event itself. In this way, having a positive outlook is a very powerful tool since you get twice the joy – both in anticipation of the event and again when it actually happens! Let’s imagine two runners about to start a race, waiting for the starting pistol to go off. Both have a similar track record, and each has put in the same amount of training. But there’s one difference: one racer is thinking about the personal glory of winning, while the other is thinking, “I have to win this for my mother.” Who’s going to win? Probably, the latter. That’s because raising the stakes improves performance. The author calls this third habit raising necessity. High performers will bring an extra urgency to the work they’re doing, usually in the form of an outside obligation that is added to their own internal desires. This provides them with more motivation and increases their likelihood of success. Underperformers, on the other hand, will rely solely on their own desire to succeed. This makes their success a preferable outcome, but not a necessary one. So, to put this into practice, you first need to set a high standard for yourself. Remember, you want to master your craft, so don’t settle for simple and easily achievable goals. Now, you’ll also want to attach your personal goal to an external obligation so that a positive outcome will also benefit someone else in your life. If your local charity will gain exposure and a massive windfall of donations as a result of your project’s success, you’ll likely work twice as hard to ensure it comes together. Another high-performer habit for raising the stakes is simply to share your goal with a lot of people. Outside expectations are created, and the act of voicing your goal out loud can increase its importance. No one wants to fail publicly, so the more people you tell, the more committed you’ll feel. When the author set a goal to create an online video course on personal development, he not only told his friends and family about it, he also invited them to be the first to try it out and offer feedback. So his closest social circle was both aware and looking forward to him completing this project, and these expectations all-but guaranteed that Burchard would meet his deadline. It’s terrible to always feel busy and run down, yet still not getting enough done. This is a clear sign that there’s an imbalance between the energy you’re spending and the results you’re seeing. This brings us to the fourth habit of high performance: increasing productivity, which you can do by learning how to separate the important work from the unimportant work. This way, you only spend energy on the tasks that really matter. It’s common for underperformers to pay a lot of attention to small tasks that make them feel productive in the short run but add up to very little in the long run. One of the main offenders is email, on which people spend an average of 28 percent of their working week. This is because the simple act of answering an email can give you a reassuring feeling of accomplishment, even though it’s likely distracting you from more important work. Another important aspect of productivity is timing. Data shows that underperformers are over three times more likely to fall into a false deadline trap, which means that they set a deadline that’s not strictly enforced. Knowing that the due date is preferable, not a must, you won’t feel any motivation to meet it. In short, you’ll be unproductive. But high performers are great at planning, which means creating clear and challenging deadlines and goals. Having a visible finish line ahead of you is a great way to maintain focus, fight distraction and keep your energy levels up, and data shows that a person with a clear and challenging goal will always outperform someone with no strict deadline. Big projects that are carried out over long periods of time can be especially challenging, especially when it comes to staying focused and keeping the momentum going. In these cases, you’ll find it helpful to break the long-term goals down into subgoals of four or five small steps that will get you to that finish line. This way you can stay focused and move forward, even when there are months or years still to go. There’s a popular notion that it’s “lonely at the top,” meaning that once you reach the highest rung of the professional ladder, there will be no one around with whom to share your achievement. But this isn’t the case for high performers, as the research shows them to be quite capable of establishing meaningful and lasting connections with their peers. High performers are appreciative and giving people who aren’t afraid to also challenge those they work with and expect the same from others. In 2016, the American Psychological Association's Work and Well-Being Survey revealed that only half of the workers in the United States feel valued and recognized by their superiors. High-performing managers wouldn’t stand for this. In his study, Burchard found high performers routinely praising and cheering on their staff. They’re also more likely to notice and appreciate good work. High performers were found to have a giving mind-set – the fifth habit. They’re well aware of the struggles and desires of others and use that knowledge to provide people with what they need. They also know that their staff need the trust and freedom to make their own decisions. Having this power is a great motivator, and high performers are both aware and respectful of this. Being perceptive and aware of what people need to grow allows high performers to assign the right tasks to the right people so they can reach the next level. And when a high performer needs something themselves, they don’t hesitate to ask for a favor. This is something underperformers often resist for fear of being judged or rejected, even though statistics show that the average person will get a positive response three times more often than they expect. In fact, fears of being harshly judged by our peers are generally overestimated. The truth is, most people are too busy to spend time thinking about you, so relax! Are you the kind of person who prefers to be left alone in their comfort zone? If so, how much pressure does it take for you to break out? For high performers, risk-taking isn’t unusual at all. In fact, demonstrating courage is the sixth and final habit of high performers, and it goes hand-in-hand with gaining a positive perspective on challenging situations. Again, attitudes like these aren’t inherent personality traits; they’re characteristics that high-performing individuals have practiced and worked at over time. They recognize that taking bold action involves a higher risk of failing – that’s why these moves are considered bold! But high performers have learned how to overcome their fear and take action. With practice, you too can make bold decisions. And just like high performers, you can even come to enjoy the thrill of taking risks. Making a risky move is like any other learned skill – it gets easier the more you do it, so all you need to do is start taking those leaps. Like parachuting, the first time is always filled with panic and dread, but after each jump, it gradually becomes a little easier and less stressful. Most people will avoid any kind of struggle, but being extraordinary and reaching your goals means learning how to greet challenges with a smile. It’s all about having the right perspective, and rather than complaining about life being difficult, higher performers will see each new challenge as an opportunity to grow. One of the commonest bold acts is being open and honest about one’s true ambitions. This is another behavior that many will avoid due to unwanted judgment or ridicule. While the average person prefers to work toward their dreams in silence, high performers don’t hold back despite being fully aware that someone might call them “delusional,” “unrealistic” or even “crazy.” For them, it’s all part of life’s precious struggle. So don’t waste another day. Now’s the time to open yourself up to the world and all the good and bad it has to offer. By being open, you’ll find that there are a lot of people out there just waiting to help turn your dreams into reality. The key message in this book: High performers are not born extraordinary; they grow through steady and persistent practice that involves a conscious attempt to master certain habits. They are highly aware of the purpose of their work, stay energetic, use external motivators, know how to increase productivity through careful planning, regularly connect and give to those around and take bold risks. Actionable advice: Seek clarity in your social interactions. Don’t just enter a social interaction on autopilot. Ask yourself beforehand: How can I be a good person in the upcoming situation? What will the other person expect? What kind of mood and energy do I want to create, and how can I act to achieve that outcome? Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maxwell","summary":"The world’s most successful people have one thing in common: they aren’t afraid to think outside the box and carve out their own path. But the journey along that road can be lonely. After all, we’re a sociable species by nature. We like fitting in, and the price of social acceptance is falling in with accepted ideas. Going against the grain, questioning common notions and striking out on your own isn’t likely to win you many friends. Yet just think where we’d be if everyone had always kept their brilliant ideas to themselves! To claim, as Copernicus did, that the earth wasn’t at the center of the universe must have struck his contemporaries as some form of madness. But he was right, and we’re forever in his debt for having stuck to his guns. That goes to show just how important creative thinking and tenacity are when it comes to success. But, as John C. Maxwell shows, you don’t have to be an Einstein or Galileo to have great ideas. In fact, everyone can learn to think creatively – all it takes is knowing the right techniques and a bit of practice! In these blinks, you’ll discover why learning to be empathetic will help you achieve success; what Alfred Nobel did after reading his own obituary; and what Paul McCartney and John Lennon can teach you about collaboration. General Electric CEO Jack Welch regularly tells his employees that existing relationships with clients are more important than individual sales. Why? Because he knows that, when it comes to being successful in the long run, it’s sometimes necessary to leave the nitty-gritty behind for a moment and consider the bigger picture. But how can you start cultivating big picture thinking? By making sure you’re always learning. Big picture thinkers are always looking for opportunities to learn. They’re constantly on the go, visiting new places, meeting new people and honing new skills. The author has a handy technique that puts him in the right mindset to do that: he starts his day by looking at his schedule and asking himself what learning opportunities are likely to present themselves. Once he’s noted down the activities that are most likely to teach him something, he mentally primes himself to be on high alert. That means he’s much more likely to be receptive to what’s going on around him. So when he once had dinner with National Football League (NFL) coach Dave Wannstedt, for instance, he was well prepared. He used the time to ask him all sorts of questions about teamwork and left the restaurant brimming with new insights. That’s something you can take up too: spend a couple of minutes each morning looking over your itinerary and ask yourself what opportunities to learn new things you’re likely to encounter. Making an effort to become a big picture thinker is important because it gives you a window into how other people see the world. In other words, it makes you more empathetic. And that’s good for your relationships: whether it’s your clients, husband or wife, children or friends, empathizing with those around you will help you understand what they want and need. Seeing the big picture ultimately helps you think beyond your own narrow interests and take those of others into account. What is reality? Don’t worry, this isn’t a philosophy lecture! In fact, there’s a pretty simple answer: reality is the difference between your desires and how the world actually is. If you want to succeed in the real world, you have to leave your daydreams behind and start thinking realistically. That means setting targets and drawing up a game plan that’ll put you in a position to hit them. Consider a businessman who isn’t a realistic thinker: He’s positive and full of hope about the company’s future. That’s a great attitude to have, but there’s a problem – he doesn’t have a strategy. And without a strategy, his company’s likely to fail. In the end, he’s a bad leader. Realistic thinking, by contrast, promotes excellent leadership. That’s because facing up to the way things really are forces you to clearly define your aims and formulate a plan of action that’ll get you there. Realistic thinking also helps simplify things. Stripping away all the unnecessary details and vague hopes and dreams makes you more efficient. But what if you’re an optimist, rather than a realist, by nature? Then you should start by doing your homework. That means getting to know the facts. Say you’re a business leader mulling over your next move: ask yourself what you’d do if your revenue dried up, a customer didn’t pay or the bottom fell out of the market you’re in. Spend time researching these scenarios – after all, your realistic thinking won’t amount to much if you’re basing it on insufficient information. It’s important to clear your mind of all preconceptions, prejudices and second-hand opinions when you’re doing this kind of background work. Instead of making assumptions, get to know the facts yourself. Chances are, you’re not the only person facing this particular situation. Your thinking needs to be solid, it doesn’t have to be original. You can learn a lot by looking at what other people have done in similar circumstances. As the author puts it, some of his best thinking was done by others. Whatever line of work you’re in, creativity is pure professional gold. Einstein once said that “imagination is more important than knowledge.” He was right. Your ideas are far more important than your role in a company or your job title. That said, Einstein was a genius – creative thinking was second nature to him. That might not apply to everyone, but there are techniques you can use to jumpstart your creativity. The first point to remember is that creativity doesn’t just mean having lots of original ideas – you can start thinking creatively by simply considering a greater number of options. That’s one hallmark of creatives: they take as many possibilities into account as they can, which in turn gets the creative juices flowing and stimulates the imagination. So if you’ve got a great idea, ask yourself what changes you could make to improve it. Think of it like a fishing net – the wider you cast it, the more fish you’re likely to catch. The reason that’s so important is that the best thinkers aren’t looking for the only answer – they’re looking for the best answer out of many. The added bonus? It’ll help you craft a backup plan in case your preferred solution doesn’t work out. Creative thinking also makes you and your ideas more attractive to other people. No wonder! Creativity is your intelligence having fun. People admire intelligence and are attracted to fun – it’s an irresistible combination. Leonardo da Vinci is one example of someone who had fun with their brilliant mind. The diversity of his ideas and interests is truly breathtaking: painter, architect, musician, engineer – he was the very definition of the Renaissance man. That doesn’t mean you have to paint the Mona Lisa and design helicopters in your spare time, however. Set your mind free and explore your creativity in your own field and you’ll find that people will be irresistibly drawn to you! Adopting new modes of thinking boosts your chances of success, but there’s also a way of thinking about the world that can change your entire life: unselfish thinking. Taking that up might just redefine your concept of success itself. That’s because helping others is hugely rewarding. In fact, few things are anywhere near as fulfilling. Spend a day serving others unselfishly and you’re pretty much guaranteed a sound night’s sleep. Take it from Alfred Nobel, who learned that the hard way. As he was reading the newspaper one day, he was shocked to find his own obituary. It was a mistake, of course, but it was an illuminating experience. So what did it say? The paper mainly talked about how the inventor’s most famous brainchild – dynamite – had been responsible for so many deaths. Nobel was appalled at the idea that this was how people would regard his legacy. Wracked by guilt, he decided to make a more positive contribution to the world by supporting peace. The idea of the Nobel prize – an award given in recognition of noteworthy achievements in various fields – was born in 1895. It just goes to show that even if you’ve pursued selfish ends your whole life, you can always turn things around! But the best thing about unselfish thinking is that it lets you become part of something much bigger than yourself. That’s something the pharmaceutical corporation Merck and Company showed in the mid-1980s. The company decided it wanted to achieve more than rack up ever-greater profits. After successfully developing a cure for river blindness – a disease afflicting millions in the developing world – the firm decided to give the drug away for free. After all, those who needed it the most were the least able to afford it. It became the cornerstone of the company’s credo that people are more important than profits. The lesson here is that it’s always better to be part of something fantastic than aiming to be fantastic yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in the crowd and thoughtlessly accept other people’s ideas about the world. That applies as much to business leaders falling in line with a company’s traditions as it does to new parents acting on the old wives’ tales their parents told them. Thinking for yourself can be a risky business. Stray too far from the herd, and you’re unlikely to make many friends. If everybody accepts something as true, then it must be, right? Well, no. Think of the belief that the earth was the center of the universe. Pretty much everyone thought you’d have to be mad to question that idea. Then along came the astronomer Copernicus in the sixteenth century and mathematically proved that our solar system revolves around the sun. Conventional wisdom is often downright deadly too. Before Joseph Lister pioneered antiseptic procedures in the nineteenth century, surgeons were convinced that there wasn’t any point in washing medical instruments. Humans often seek safety in numbers, but history shows that’s not the best way of determining what’s true. But how do you break your habit of relying on others’ assumptions? A good place to start is cultivating the habit of thinking things through for yourself before following others. Once you start considering what’s best rather than what’s popular, you’ll already be well on the way to success. Take the weeks immediately following the 9/11 terror attacks: there was a widespread perception that it wasn’t safe to fly or visit New York. The author saw things differently. Flights to the city were dirt cheap, security was at an all-time high and the price of hotels and theatre tickets had plummeted because of low demand. It was actually a fantastic time to take a city break! So a month after the tragedy he boarded a plane with his family and flew to New York. They enjoyed a wonderful experience that they’d never have been able to afford otherwise – all because they’d avoided the trap of popular thinking. Say you need to pick up a new skill – how would you go about it? Spend some time figuring it out by yourself or ask someone already in the know to teach you the ins and outs? If you’re likely to go with the former, it might be time to reconsider. Whether learning a new recipe, putting the finishing touches on that golf swing or mastering a new piece of software, you’ve got a much better chance of getting the hang of things if you learn from someone with experience. Collaboration is the mother of innovation – shared thinking trumps solo thinking every time. That might sound slightly counterintuitive. After all, brilliant thinkers are often depicted as brooding soloists going it alone. But that’s not the case – innovative breakthroughs rarely happen in a vacuum. More often than not, they’re the result of people working together. Einstein often said that his achievements were founded in the labors of other men. Or think of the work of brilliant duos like scientists Pierre and Marie Curie or musical wunderkinds Paul McCartney and John Lennon. When people combine their unique talents and ideas, the results can be incredible. But before you can start working with others, you need to adopt the right mindset. So what’s that all about? Well, as the author of How to Become CEO Jeffrey J. Fox puts it, you have to be on constant high alert for good ideas, regardless of how likely or unlikely the source is. That means dropping prejudices and really listening to people. The next great idea might come from your taxi driver or your children. The point is that you’ll never know unless you’re receptive. Just as important is striving to adopt a mentality based on collaboration rather than competition. Cooperation happens when your aim is to complete the ideas of others, rather than one-up them. So next time you’re in a meeting with colleagues, don’t focus on selfishly getting ahead – work toward achieving the team’s goals. The key message in these blinks: Success is all about attitude. You’ve probably heard about the benefits of positive thinking, but there’s more to it than that. Leading a happy, fulfilled life is about learning to think collaboratively and unselfishly. It’s about asking what you can do for and with others rather than simply trying to get ahead yourself. That means opening your mind to creativity and avoiding following the crowd. Once you start doing that, you’ll be mentally prepared for success. Actionable advice: Plan your life, not your day. Lots of people don’t think further than the day ahead. They wake up and go through their mental checklists of what they have to get done that day. What they’ll be doing a month or year from now rarely crosses their mind. But long-term planning is vital to success. So take a cue from the author and begin the month by reviewing your calendar. Think about what you want to accomplish over the next thirty days: what projects you want to complete, what your objectives are and how much time to set aside for family and friends? This perspective will help you find the time you need to get the things that matter most done and make you happier and more successful! Got feedback?

Christensen, James Allworth and Karen Dillon","summary":"Author Clayton M. Christensen is an expert in business innovation. Having spent years working alongside high achievers and in successful enterprises, some of which he himself founded, he came to realize that a measure of a person’s life needs to be more than time spent at the office. With insightful, insider examples from his many years in the corporate world, Christensen is an able guide for readers looking to achieve the career of their dreams. Yet as a family man and cancer survivor, Christensen can also speak from the heart when it comes to work/life balance. In these blinks, you’ll discover that motivation, not money, is the source of job satisfaction, and that regardless of how hard you work at your job or how many times you’re promoted, it is your friends and family that are the true source of happiness. Through wisdom gained from the sum of his experiences, Christensen shows today’s professionals how to lead a life with balance, integrity and purpose. In the following blinks, you’ll also learn: why video rental company Blockbuster was destroyed by upstart Netflix; why it’s important to let your child make mistakes, and even fail; and why IKEA’s worldwide success is based on its mastery of one simple job.\n What do you think would make you happier at work? Perhaps a little more pay might be nice, or maybe some more admiration from fellow colleagues. Such assumptions are fairly common. In fact, the tangible aspects of your job, such as money and prestige, are not actually the things that will make you happy. If you think otherwise, go to a business school reunion where you’ll see just how often professional success is often tainted with personal dissatisfaction, family failures, professional struggles and even criminal behavior. Despite this, an unhealthy approach to the use of incentives in the workplace still prevails. Popularised by economist Michael Jensen and management theorist William Meckling, the incentive theory makes the straightforward statement that the more you are paid, the better you perform. In light of our business school reunion example, this theory seems too simplistic. What’s more, studies have shown that the hardest-working people are in fact those employed in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) – people who do world-changing work, but earn very little. In fact, it turns out that professional satisfaction and motivation are derived from work that matches your needs and interests. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg proposed that our needs and interests can be divided into two different categories – hygiene factors and motivation factors. This forms the basis of his hygiene-motivation theory.  Hygiene factors cover issues such as general conditions at work, company policies, supervisory practices and job security. If these issues are not satisfactory or are lacking, it’s a case of bad hygiene that then causes job dissatisfaction. However, would a job with great working conditions but no room for promotion or reward be satisfying? Probably not. Job satisfaction instead is achieved by combining hygiene factors with motivation factors. Motivation factors concern recognition, responsibility, challenges and personal growth. Consider a job that was intellectually stimulating but burdened with terrible management – would this give you satisfaction? Definitely not. It’s clear that the confluence of hygiene and motivation is crucial, and the next blink presents two strategies to attain this balance. What’s your career strategy? While most people have at least an idea of how they’d like to develop professionally, few know how to describe how exactly they plan to achieve their professional goals. A good starting point is recognising that career strategies take two different forms: deliberate and emergent. To understand these two approaches, we need to consider the ways in which opportunities in general arise. Academic and renowned author Henry Mintzberg explains that opportunities also fall into two categories. The first describes anticipated opportunities, those opportunities we can recognize and choose to pursue. Deliberate strategies are often built on anticipated opportunities. Let’s look at one example from Japanese car manufacturer Honda from the 1960s. At the time, large motorbikes like the ones produced by Harley Davidson were popular in the United States, so Honda decided to launch its own range of motorbikes there, too. The goal was to get a toehold in the U.S. market, but the low quality of Honda's bikes almost killed the company. This shows that deliberate strategies aren’t always successful. Everyone can think of a time when, despite their best efforts, absolutely nothing went to plan! This is where an emergent strategy comes in, by utilizing unanticipated opportunities. These often arise in the implementation process of a deliberate strategy. Honda found its emergent strategy in the United States by accident. Along with its big motorbikes, the company also had shipped its smaller, Super Cub motorbikes for employee use. Honda employees would ride up and down the hills of Los Angeles, and this unusual sight so intrigued the public that it stirred demand for the Super Cubs. Honda thus embraced the emergent strategy of selling its smaller bikes on a large scale, and thereby saved its American venture. Creating a balance between deliberate and emergent strategies will allow you to make use of any opportunity. If you’re both calculating and flexible, you’ll always find the right direction. When we talk about resources, we often think first of those that are business-related: assets, talent, finances and so on. This understanding is, however, quite narrow. To gain a better understanding of how we should use our resources, we must first broaden our definition. Consider the things that are important to you, such as family bonds, rewarding friendships and physical health. In a sense, these aspects of our personal lives are “businesses” as well, and the resources we invest in them are our personal time, energy, skills and wealth. However, just like in business, all our resources are limited. Though there are many goals we would like to achieve, we have to manage our priorities. It can be tempting to invest all our resources into one goal, and for many, this goal is a career. Nevertheless, it is crucial to ensure that we invest time and energy into other things that we also value. By taking control of your personal resource allocation process, you can avoid the mistake of investing everything into your career. One way to do this is to reconsider the default criteria according to which we typically allocate our time. Rather than automatically spending all your time on a work project, evaluate first whether the project is indeed the most important thing in your life right now, or whether there are other things more deserving of your time, such as your family or your well-being. For high-achieving professionals in particular, prioritizing immediate rewards over long-term gains is a common mistake. It is easy to become overly-fixated on a promotion or future bonus. The satisfaction these provide is instant but short-lived. Long-term goals, such as the task of raising your children well, while gradual and challenging, will provide a reward that is lifelong and far more valuable. We’ll explore this further in the next blink. If you’re a high achiever, you may feel that the effort you put into your job is what’s most rewarding in your life. However, the effort you dedicate to family life also brings valuable rewards. It’s just that these may not reveal themselves for many years. Unfortunately, underinvestment in these longer-term issues will ultimately prevent them from flourishing. What a relationship needs most is consistent attention and care. This can be difficult to provide, and the reasons are twofold. First, we are always tempted to invest our resources into a task with an immediate payoff, namely, our job. A spare 30 minutes after work could easily be spent as family time. But often the people and projects at work that demand your attention, as well as the promise of making money, can quickly banish thoughts of your family from your mind. Second, those with whom you share a deep relationship – family members, friends – rarely shout the loudest when demanding your attention. Instead, they’re likely to support your career without complaint. But remember: just because they don’t ask for your time, doesn’t mean that they don’t need it. In a sense, relationships reflect a paradox. They require consistent dedication even when it appears unnecessary. Many seem to think that they can compensate for neglecting their loved ones by showing greater care later on. However, damage done to a family in its early stages will manifest as problems later on. For example, research shows that the most influential period in the development of a child’s intelligence is within the first year, so the way parents speak to their child at this stage will shape their life as a thinker. Finally, it’s not just your family that needs you; at some point, you will depend on them. If you neglect these relationships now, you run the risk of losing support when you need it the most. Often companies seem to focus so intently on selling a product that they lose sight of the real needs of the customer. Unfortunately, many people approach relationships the same way. Whether your family or your business, your real job should always be to understand and fulfil the needs of others. This job is by no means easy. There are two tools that can help you: intuition and empathy. A marriage works when each spouse understands what is expected of him or her. Using empathy and intuition to grasp these expectations, however, takes practice. For example, a man comes home from work one day to find a mess in the kitchen. Intuitively assuming that his wife has had a rough day, he decides to tidy up. Expecting to be thanked, he instead is surprised to find his wife upset. She tells her husband that caring for two demanding children is incredibly difficult, as she is unable to speak to another adult all day. What she needed most was simply for her husband to listen to her. In this case, the husband’s initial intuition was off the mark. But through this experience, he’ll better know how to be more sensitive to his wife’s needs in the future. Another way to improve your relationship is if you think about it as a job. A key question to consider is, “What job does my family, friend or partner require me to do the most?” The Swedish home furnishings company IKEA can provide us with an example. What its customers need is to quickly and inexpensively furnish their homes. The company’s job is then to satisfy this need effectively. This is why the company doesn’t sell a specific kind of furniture: its job is more general. Because their needs are being met, IKEA customers remain loyal. The same goes for relationships: if you understand and fulfil the job required of you by your loved ones, they will remain loyal to you. Of all the jobs you have in life, one of the most important is educating your children. This does not simply mean teaching them all there is to know, but rather, giving them the tools to teach themselves. The best way for children to develop their own values is by allowing them to face challenges and find solutions independently. Such challenges could include learning to work with a problematic teacher, struggling with a new sport or negotiating cliques or bullies at school. By introducing children to everyday problems early on, their self-esteem will develop in a healthy way. You may be reluctant for your children to pursue goals on their own, or attempt to prevent them from making mistakes. However, don’t be afraid to let them fail. It is far more important that a parent is there to provide support when children make mistakes, from which they can then grow and learn. Another vital aspect of parenthood is the implementation of a healthy family culture. The foundation of this is family values, an informal but highly influential system of guidelines that will equip your children for any challenge they face, even as adults. In creating a family culture, it helps to think of it like an autopilot. Once programmed, it is perfectly capable of running itself. Let’s say you want your family to be known for kindness. You can help program this value by taking every opportunity to emphasise its importance. Such an opportunity could be as simple as a conversation with your child about schoolyard bullying, or praising your child when he demonstrates compassion. In this way, kindness will be at the core of your family culture. It’s easy to slip into the mind-set that raising children is centred on controlling bad behavior. This negative approach is in fact far less effective than a perspective that celebrates the good of your family in everyday interactions. The set of values that emerge as a result will be firmly established, and able to weather any challenge. What does it mean to live your life with integrity? It’s not only about our choices when faced with a dramatic moral challenge. Rather, integrity emerges from the decisions we make every day. In this way, integrity requires constant self-awareness. We must remain aware of the trap of marginal thinking. This danger can be illustrated through the example of DVD rental company Blockbuster. Blockbuster was aware of its rival Netflix, an innovative online movie rental company, but dismissed the company as non-threatening and certainly no reason to expand its business strategy to DVD rentals by post in response. But, while Blockbuster did nothing, Netflix crushed its competitors; so much so that Blockbuster declared bankruptcy in 2010. Though the company avoided paying the marginal costs of matching Netflix’s innovative business model, Blockbuster paid the ultimate cost for mismanagement, which was business failure. Now you know that focusing on marginal costs when faced with commercial decisions can prove disastrous. This marginal thinking becomes even more dangerous when the moral behavior of a person comes into play. In such cases, it is absolutely crucial that we don’t make ill-considered decisions as individuals, no matter the situation. Have you ever made a decision that went against what you believe, but justified it as something you’d only do “just this once?” Here’s an example of how harmful these exceptions can be. Nick Leeson was a stock trader whose marginal thinking led to the downfall of Barings, a British merchant bank. After incurring a loss on some trades he had managed, he decided that “just this once” he would hide the loss in an unmonitored trading account. This led to more marginal thinking as Leeson attempted to cover his increasingly irresponsible actions, and soon snowballed into forging documents and conning auditors, eventually resulting in a loss of $1.3 billion. Leeson was arrested and sent to jail; and Barings, after declaring bankruptcy, was sold to a competitor for just one pound sterling. The key message in this book: The most successful professionals are those who invest their resources not just into work, but into their family and lifestyle. By taking responsibility for the jobs that are required of us outside the workplace, such as raising our children, supporting a spouse or leading our own lives with integrity, we can achieve the work/life balance that we aspire to. Only then can we achieve true happiness.  Actionable advice: Don’t be afraid to let your kids solve problems for themselves!  You probably only have your children’s best interests in mind when you give them what they want. The fact is, they need to be challenged, perhaps through learning a musical instrument, grappling with a new sport or developing social skills. This will give them problems to solve, teaching them values, and providing experiences for them to be engaged in. Suggested further reading: The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton M.

For others, however, college life is punctuated by periods of extreme stress and anxiety from constantly worrying about their GPA. This, of course, makes perfect sense. Just think about the pressure they’re under! The grades you get on tests and papers can shape your entire future – for better or for worse. Luckily, it doesn’t all have to be doom and gloom if you have a hard time studying. Whether it’s writing a research paper or cramming for your exams, these blinks will give you all the tools you need to study efficiently. These techniques aren’t made up by just anybody. They come straight from the horse’s mouth, i.e., from actual straight-A students who majored in various academic disciplines across the United States. It all boils down to the fact that studying longer is not necessarily studying better. Studying better means taking the right kinds of notes, fighting procrastination, developing time management skills, and various other tricks that will help you study quickly and efficiently, and free up your weekends to do the things you really want to do. In these ten blinks, you’ll learn why sometimes less is more when it comes to studying; why you need to invest in some academic disaster insurance; and why finding a quiet coffee shop can improve your grades. How do you manage basketball practice, your English essay, your social life, and the rest of your homework? Many students believe there just aren’t enough hours in a day to get it all done. But that is simply untrue! Most people waste their time working at a low intensity, i.e., pseudo-working. This kind of “work” occurs when you study in a distracting environment, such as in front of the TV, or working through a long and continuous period of time where your concentration drops. For example, while it might feel like pulling an all-nighter was “hard work,” the loss of concentration due to sleep deprivation means that you were really just pseudo-working. A better way to focus your time is to work in short bursts with a high intensity. Indeed, many straight-A students spend a few intense intervals studying, while their less successful counterparts study much longer at lower intensity. In fact, studies show that the optimal learning period is roughly 50 minutes, so you should work no longer than one hour before giving yourself a break. Think of it this way: the work you accomplish is equal to the time spent working times the intensity of your focus. In other words, if you spend three separate hours of study at an intensity of “10,” you get the same outcome as you would if you study for ten hours in a row at an intensity of “3”! By reducing the time and ramping up the intensity, you’d find yourself with seven hours to do whatever you wanted – meet friends, party hard, sleep, relax, you name it! But in order to start working in short bursts, you’ll need to carefully manage your time. Keep a detailed calendar with all your deadlines and upcoming tasks. Always carry a list with your day’s schedule on your person and write down any new deadlines or tasks that crop up during the day. Spend five minutes each morning putting those new deadlines in your calendar. And remember: keeping a calendar will only help you manage your time if you actually use it. Procrastination is something most college students know intimately – that sneaky troll who makes you work the whole night through to finish that final paper on time, just a few days after it told you that you had all the time in the world. So how is it that some people are actually capable of avoiding this tendency to let things go until the very last second? Well, even straight-A students continuously struggle with the urge to procrastinate. The difference, however, is that they are equipped with strategies to actively fight the urge. One way is to keep a work progress journal, which can help prevent you from falling for your lame excuses. Here’s how it works: When you wake up each morning, write down the day’s most important tasks: important classes, exams and even chores, like buying groceries or calling the electrician. Then, each evening, record the tasks you’ve completed and provide an explanation for any tasks left uncompleted. For example, if you come home late after failing to study for your exam (again), your excuse might be: “It’s getting late and my concentration will be much better early tomorrow.” And yet, rather than get a full night’s sleep, the procrastination troll tells you to watch some TV to “clear your head” for the tough study day tomorrow. Five hours later, it’s 3 a.m., and you finally fall asleep. You wake up after your alarm the next day, groggy from a lack of sleep. Unwilling to study, your new excuse may be: “I can’t concentrate because I didn’t get enough sleep last night. I’d better wait until tomorrow after a good night’s sleep.” By recording your excuses every day, it will become much harder to believe the same ones over and over. Not only that, but the urge to procrastinate itself will also dwindle! Your exam is creeping ever closer, so instead of going out to have a drink or two (or three) with your friends, your Friday night will be spent in the library trying to read just a few more pages. If this sounds familiar to you, you’re doing it all wrong. First of all, you should study early so that don’t have to study late. In the evening your body starts to reduce its activity, slow down and prepare itself for sleep. This, of course, means that you have less energy to spend on concentrated studying. We also shouldn’t forget that your more efficient classmates, who studied earlier, will try to draw you away from your work with party invitations and other social gatherings. But you can prevent all this by simply studying earlier. Second, study in isolation. Find spots where you can avoid distractions like friends asking you to take a coffee break or a comfortable couch begging you to lie down and close your eyes for just a minute. Studying in isolation could mean anything from going to a tiny coffee shop to a public library or a quiet nook on campus – just go where the distractions will be minimal. Rotate between these choice spots in order to keep your mind stimulated. Something as simple as a different chair or different lighting can inspire motivation and prevent you from growing bored with the same four walls every day. Plus, having many study spots will provide you with a multitude of nearby places to fill a short break with intensive study no matter where you are. And finally, always keep your energy levels high. As your physical and mental resources are limited, it’s necessary to use them wisely. Make sure to take a break at least once per hour to recharge your batteries for the next round of studying. Drink water constantly. Don’t skip meals and don’t drink too much coffee. Otherwise, your body may become unnecessarily exhausted due to dehydration or lack of energy. Now that we’ve laid down some of basic principles, the following blinks will give you concrete tips on how to score higher while studying less. Here’s an obvious study tip that will save you a lot of trouble: always go to class! It doesn’t matter how tired, hungover or busy you are – going to class is the most efficient way to conquer the material. If for whatever reason you miss a lesson, you’ll have to spend the next few days studying extra hard to get back on track, so it’s important to avoid missing any if possible. Of course, going to class isn’t enough to earn you straight As. You also need to find a way of recording what you’ve learned by taking accurate notes. The type of notes you take will depend on the type of class you are taking. For a nontechnical course, such as politics, history or philosophy, you need to record the big ideas. Try to pull out the main concepts, arguments or theories from each lecture. Once you have those, you can then record them using the question/evidence/conclusion structure. All your notes should be focused on answering one large question, for example, “Why did the Roman Empire collapse?”. Then, your answer should be followed by a conclusion that quickly outlines the evidence. Technical courses, on the other hand, such as economics, engineering or mathematics, require a different approach. Luckily, taking notes in these classes is easier, as there are no real “big ideas.” Rather, these lectures are filled with sample problems, equations and formulas. Ideally, you’ll take notes that record the problem, the solution and the steps that lead you there. However, your professor will likely be going through these sample questions at high speed during the class, so you might occasionally lose track of the steps. When this happens, be sure to ask questions or write yourself a note to look it up later. Half-finished notes are useless when it comes to cramming. If you want to scale a wall, you won’t get very far running into it head first over and over again. Effective study habits are much the same way – they don’t depend on brute force but on the right technique. To study effectively, start by defining exactly what you need to learn. When studying, it’s tempting to try to learn everything you possibly can in the time available to you. However, this isn’t the most effective method. Remind yourself that you don’t need to learn everything! You only need to learn what will be relevant for acing your exams and papers. In addition to defining the topics relevant for your study session, you also need consider which details are worth remembering. Ask yourself: What will the exam focus on? Do I need to know exact dates and names for this test? Will I need to explain complex theories? Once you’ve narrowed your focus to the right topic, quiz yourself until you get it down pat. One way to do this is to concentrate intensely on a specific subject and then try and explain it in your own words. Another option is to write yourself a little test based on your notes and then answer the questions, either aloud or in writing. And, once you’re able to answer all the questions correctly, voila: you’re ready for the exam. Nevertheless, there is one nightmare scenario: when you show up at the exam only to discover that the main question is on a subject you don’t know much about. This could happen because you either skipped or napped through the lecture, but it’s more likely that it comes from not thoroughly understanding the subject matter. So, you should spare yourself that headache altogether by investing in academic disaster insurance, otherwise known as ensuring that there’s no single subject you’re unsure of. All this takes is a little bit of diligence: ask your professor or classmates questions when you don’t understand something in order to get all the necessary information. You’re in the classroom at your desk with your dreaded statistics exam in front of you. You’re nervous, your mouth is dry and your hands are shaking. Failure feels inevitable. Yet, there’s no need to worry! If you’ve studied well, just use the following three-part technique and you’re bound to succeed: When you get your exam, plan what you will do before starting the actual text. Start by reviewing the entire exam. Skimming quickly through the questions will prime your brain to think about the test’s topics and give you an impression of the length and difficulty of the exam. Next, create a rough schedule for the questions. Keeping ten minutes as a safety buffer, distribute the remaining time equally among the questions. Doing this will help you maintain focus and prevent you from getting absorbed by one particularly difficult question. Once you’ve made your plans, proceed with answering the questions in accordance with that plan. You should always start by answering the easiest questions first. Then, proceed through the exam answering questions as they progress in difficulty. Doing it the other way around, i.e., answering the hardest questions first, puts you under immense pressure. It’s far easier to answer difficult questions once you’ve already created solid foundation of answered questions. Finally, complete your exam by thoroughly proofreading it. Use your ten-minute safety buffer to check all your answers. If you have leftover time from your questions, then use it for proofreading as well. You’re almost certain to find at least one mistake in a problem or to identify an important concept you’ve forgotten to include. While many brush off proofreading, it’s incredibly important: staying until the very last minute of the exam period to check and correct your mistakes is what makes the difference between the average student and the straight-A student. Now that you have the tools to study efficiently, these final blinks will enlighten you on how to write captivating, A+ essays and research papers. Throughout your education, you’re sure to write many papers on a wide array of subjects. Regardless of how long it is, each paper is a huge undertaking. So where’s the best place to begin? A common trap most people fall into is the belief that they should spend most of their time on writing the papers. However, the quality of your paper and the opportunity for enjoyable writing starts much earlier... To write an excellent paper, you need to find a topic that actually interests you! Your topic is not your thesis, but rather a broad observation or a subject such as: “The economy of West Germany massively outstripped that of East Germany.” To ensure that this happens, start early and be constantly on the lookout for a topic or concept you find fascinating. Also: Don’t wait for the actual assignment! Keep your eyes peeled at all times – during class and while reading textbooks and researching – for that one thing that really excites you. If for whatever reason you don’t stumble upon an interesting topic, ask professors for advice. They’ll be able to help you narrow your focus and find a great subject. Once you have your subject, it’s time to dig deeper to develop a specific thesis. Start by skimming through sources that provide a broad overview of your topic (e.g., the economy of East Germany and twentieth-century European politics) and then have a look at their bibliographies to pinpoint promising next steps in your research. As you begin to scrutinize more specialized sources, you’re likely to discover a narrow question or argument you want to examine more closely, something like: “The economic constraints of Communism stifled the East German economy.” This will be your thesis. Having found an interesting topic and riveting thesis, you’ll find that both researching and writing your paper are much easier and more fun. When you research, do you find yourself trapped in a labyrinth of books? Many people end up lost because they’ve made the mistake of reading too many sources. Consequently, they have too much to remember, too much to cover and are thus wasting their time. However, there is a better way: learn to research effectively. When collecting sources, only gather necessary information and nothing else. Writing a convincing paper isn’t about overloading the reader with information. It’s about taking the necessary information repackaging it in a well-organized form. You don’t want to get lost in research recursion syndrome, or the never-ending search for just one more source. In order to research effectively, start by outlining the important arguments you need to research, breaking your topic or thesis into general chunks. For example, if your topic is “The influence of the Tea Party movement on US politics in the Middle East,” you could break it down into the following chunks: Tea Party ideology US politics in the Middle East Tea Party politicians You can then research these subjects in journal articles, bibliographies or even on Google. When you find relevant material, be sure to print or photocopy all the relevant pages. Having physical copies will allow you easy access to your material at all times and help you avoid feeling like you need more sources. The most important thing, however, is to you know where your cut-off is, i.e., knowing when you have all the information you need for your thesis. Any additional work is pointless. In order to determine whether you’ve reached an adequate amount of material, you should check two things:     First, that all the topics central to your thesis have at least two good sources. Second, that you have at least one good source for any topics will be helpful for your thesis, but aren’t necessary. If you have those two things, it’s time to stop researching. No matter how much more you think you need – stop! By now you’ve laid the foundation for your paper, you have both an intriguing thesis and organized research material. Now it’s time to shape a powerful story. In order to make your thesis worth the paper it’s printed on, you’ll have to connect your theories into arguments in a novel and interesting way. Unfortunately, there’s no single system for accomplishing this. Every paper is different and requires a unique approach. However, one thing you’ll need every time is creativity. And in order to develop creative, convincing arguments, you’ll have to draw on inspiration. You can find what inspires you by reading interesting articles, watching documentaries or simply discussing your ideas with your professor or a friend. In the process of seeing how others formulate their arguments and listening to what others have to say about your topic, you’ll develop the inspiration needed for creativity. Once you’re in that creative space, it’s time to go back to your sources and see if any exciting, new connections pop out at you. Finally, take a break and think about your arguments while doing something else to distract your conscious mind. Taking a nap, doing the dishes or performing other mindless activities will allow your subconscious mind to assemble the pieces based on what you’ve researched. It’s now time to take your thoughts and put them to paper by creating a solid structure out of your arguments. Create a skeleton structure from your arguments, complete with details and quotes backing them up before you start writing. Having the details laid out in a logical order will greatly help you to write creatively. Try to find the right balance of information: you don’t want your outline to be too sparse. At the same time, a bloated structure with multiple sub-points numbered with Roman numerals will also constrain the writing process. So you’re done with researching and you have your structure; now it’s time to put pen to paper. But, before you start fancying yourself the next Dostoevsky or Shakespeare, just remember: your essay isn’t the place for you to express your literary aspirations. The writing itself is only about translating your well-developed structure and ideas onto paper. This also isn’t the time to think beyond what’s in your structure – just stick to the following the plan. As you write, don’t allow yourself to become distracted by editing or additional research. Focusing on the writing alone will help you avoid distractions and prevent you from getting burned out or doing work that’s irrelevant to your essay. It’s also important that you do your writing in one of those isolated hideouts from before – perhaps the library or that small coffee shop. Writing is a complex task that requires total concentration, so you want to avoid all possible distractions. Finally, you’ll need to review your work. A thorough review takes three passes: During the first pass, focus on the presentation of your arguments. Clarify any overly intricate sentences, scrap repeated information, enhance thin reasoning and connect any loose ends. Be on the lookout for major structural flaws and reassemble where necessary, but ignore any small grammatical mistakes. Print your text and read it aloud on your second pass, marking all of the small mistakes and clumsy constructions with a pencil. When you’re done, edit the document on your computer. Finally, print out your edited paper and read it one last time. If any minor mistakes slipped through unseen during the previous two passes, you’ll spot them now. More importantly, enjoy the coherence of your polished piece of work. Bask in the wonderful, rewarding feeling of finally handing in your paper, knowing that you’ve submitted a great piece of writing! The key message in this book: Successful studying isn’t about how much time you invest in it but on the intensity and efficiency with which you do it. By applying these time management, exam-taking and paper-writing techniques, you can score higher grades while studying less and having more time to spend on things you enjoy. Actionable advice: Keep a work progress journal to smash procrastination. Procrastination doesn’t just happen once. It happens many times, over the course of weeks, months or even years. Keep a journal of all the work you accomplish and all the times you put things off, along with your reasons for procrastinating. Pretty soon, you’ll see just how flimsy those reasons are, and you’ll be forced to re-evaluate them. Studying in small intensive bursts saves a lot of time. Although it may seem counterintuitive, there is just no point to working for long periods of time. A long study session leaves you drained, sluggish, and distracted. It’s far better to study in short bursts – an hour or less – and with intensity. You’ll be surprised how much you get done.

Are you tired of moving from job to job and never finding the right fit? Or maybe you’re filled with great ideas, but none of them have really come to anything? Well, then you’ve got a thing or two to learn from Scott Adams, famous cartoonist and chronic failure. Before creating Dilbert, his hugely successful comic strip, Adams failed way more often than he succeeded: he got fired countless times, started a business that quickly went under and created a bunch of unsuccessful patents. But he used all this unsuccess as material for his comics and, in the end, came out on top. If you take a page from his book, you may find that your failures are merely the cobblestones on the path to success. In these blinks, you’ll also learn why you shouldn’t be a specialist; what the author named his failed burrito chain; and about the benefits of delusions. Walk into a bookstore, find the self-help section and flip open a book. Nine times out of ten, you’ll encounter page upon page of upbeat prose extolling the life-changing benefits of setting clear goals. But this praise is slightly misplaced, because goals, no matter how clear, have two problems: they’re future-oriented, and they’re overly specific. Let’s start with the temporal trouble. All goals are situated in the future, but in order to achieve them, you must do work in the present. And when you begin working toward a goal, you usually won’t see immediate results. This can be frustrating and discouraging. That’s why the author prefers systems, which are firmly grounded in the present. Unlike goals, systems are focused on the here and now and can be worked into your daily life, meaning that you can get daily pleasure from successfully operating them. Adams learned about systems by chance. On a flight, he was once seated next to a man who explained how systems had transformed him from an employee to a CEO. His system was simple: keep moving from job to job, always looking for something better. Even though he didn't have a clear end-goal in mind, this system allowed him to accumulate so much know-how that he ended up in the CEO’s chair. Systems also trump goals because they’re nonspecific. The specificity of goals often creates an illusion of failure. People tend to feel that, if they don’t accomplish exactly what they set out to do, they haven’t accomplished anything. For instance, say you want to lose 20 pounds before Valentine’s Day. This is a laudable goal, but it’s got some inherent issues. First, you’ll only get to celebrate when you achieve it; and second, if you fall one pound short, you’ve failed. It’d be wiser to set up a system – say, to commit to exercising every day, whether for five minutes or half an hour. This way, you’ll establish a habit and have an easier time staying motivated. This is what the author did as a young man. Whether writing or drawing or whatever it might have been, he’d create a system to produce and replicate material that people were receptive to, without a clear end-goal in mind. And this was a clever move. Considering the number of jobs and projects he abandoned before creating his hit comic strip Dilbert, he probably would have felt like a total failure had he set his sights on one particular goal. In the business world of the past, specialization was crucial. Today, however, possessing general knowledge about a variety of fields is often better than knowing everything about one. Far from making you mediocre, having many skills actually increases your market value. Adams is a generalist if ever there was one. When he started Dilbert, he couldn’t write, draw or conduct business at a truly top-notch level. Rather, he was relatively good at each skill, a general competence that, he believes, led to his comic’s success. Possessing a broad range of skills will help you adapt to the world’s constant changes, and it also comes with the added benefit of making you stand out from the competition. Of course, some skills will be more useful than others, so it’s wise to take your location into account. For instance, if you live in California, you’ll have an easier time landing a job if you can speak both Spanish and English. But there are some skills that’ll come in handy no matter where you are, such as grammar, vocal techniques, technological fluency and the ability to maintain a lively conversation. And here’s another great thing about trying to gain a range of skills: you’ll experience failure. Failing is often the last thing people want to do, but each failure offers an opportunity to learn. Let’s say you’re an aspiring author, and you’ve just published your debut novel. You’re eagerly awaiting notice from the critics, but when the reviews start to appear, they’re all horrible. Well, rather than despairing, keep the criticism in mind when writing your next novel. Let the failure help you. The author failed countless times before creating Dilbert: he got fired from Pacific Bell phone company; his ideas for computer games and patents came to nothing; he created a burrito chain called Dilberito, and it tanked. But he didn’t sink into a slump of dejection. He took this experience – and the knowledge it provided him about business and marketing – and used it to shape his hit comic. Most of us have experienced parental pressure to pursue a certain career. You should be a doctor! Or a lawyer! Or one of those super successful Silicon Valley tech people! But here’s the thing: you’re the only one who should decide what you want to do. And if that seems like a tall order, you should engage in a little old-fashioned introspection and identify your special skills. How will you know what these are? Well, what are you interested in? The things we like to do are usually the things we’re good at. For instance, if you’re comfortable around kids and like spending time with them, then your special skill might be working with children. Or were you obsessed with a certain subject or hobby as a child? Such childhood infatuations often end up being one’s special skill. If you’re still uncertain, then consider the areas in life where you’ve always been comfortable taking risks. Maybe you’ve never had a problem speaking or performing in front of crowds; this might indicate that your special skill is entertainment. As a child, Scott Adams loved to draw comics. He was obsessed with it and was always taking risks – for instance, drawing humorous comics in class which, if discovered by a teacher, would have gotten him in trouble. But even if your special skill is as apparent as the author’s, you may not have an easy time selecting a career. Finding the right job requires sampling – that is, trying out different things until you find work that is both enjoyable and makes use of your special skills. And who knows – for you, that might mean starting a business of your own and shunning the nine-to-five life. If that’s the case, and you do try to monetize your own product or idea, you should try to find its x-factor. This quality is hard to define exactly but it’s the part of your idea or product that generates consumer excitement, causing them to share it on social media or by word of mouth – and it’s the thing you should concentrate most on developing. For instance, despite being bulky and a bit confusing, the first iPhone clearly hit upon an x-factor: people couldn’t stop talking about it! Have you ever tried to go for a run even though you felt drained and unmotivated? Or forced yourself to eat some food even though you weren’t hungry? If you’ve done something like this, it’s probably because, instead of following your personal bodily rhythms, you were adhering to a schedule established by someone else. And this is never a good idea; it’s always best to heed your natural rhythms and energy levels. When do you feel most creative? When do you feel most energetic? Whether it’s at 8 a.m. or 8 p.m., figure out when you feel most able to engage in specific activities, be they mental, physical or utterly mundane. This will keep you energized and help you make the best of your time. It’s also a good idea to pay attention to location. For instance, if you like to relax on the couch, you might want to avoid working there. Same goes for your bed, which should be reserved for sleeping. Don’t make peaceful locations into places of work. Another good way to optimize your energy is to identify which tasks drain you and which you find energizing. The author likes to think of himself as a “soft robot,” with particular programming, as opposed to a spontaneous, mysterious being. If you think this way, you can take advantage of your own special programming, and hack the energy levels that are “softwired” into you. For instance, you might derive energy and focus from straightening up the living room. Or, if tidying up is a draining activity for you, try different things to figure out what activities do give you energy. The author’s energizing activity turned out to be blogging, which adds an extra jolt of stimulation to his day. In contrast, shopping is something that totally drains him, and he avoids it as much as possible. Location and energy are crucial – but without good health, you’ll have trouble focusing, no matter what you do or where you do it. And that’s what we’ll discuss next. If you’ve ever embarked on a new diet or a rigorous exercise regimen, then you know how hard it can be to stick to a virtuous routine. So how do you stay consistent and maintain healthy habits? Let’s start with some dietary tips. Remember, your mood is ruled by food, so you should stay smart about what you put on your plate. Certain foods, like certain activities, are energizing, while others are draining. The author calls this the food-is-mood hypothesis, and he advises paying attention to which foods give you an extra boost and which simply make you feel slow. Processed carbs, for instance, make lots of people feel lethargic and tired. But if you’re struggling to replace trashy-but-delicious junk food with healthy-but-bland forms of nourishment, such as vegetables and grains, then take a tip from Adams and spice things up with nutritious additions. For instance, put butter and pepper on otherwise unexciting steamed broccoli. Other flavorful add-ons include honey, lemon, soy sauce, cheese, various dressings and, of course, salt. Exercise is as healthy and natural a mood booster as food, so be sure to make it part of your daily routine. Sure, we’re all busy, and fitness can often seem like a low priority. But the benefits to your mood and energy are well worth the scheduling headache. If you’re having trouble sticking to a particular regimen, try joining a group that meets consistently every week. This will hold you accountable and make it harder for you to simply give up. For instance, the author’s wife plays tennis every Thursday, and since people expect her to show up, she can’t just bail. Meanwhile, Adams works out at 12:40 on Tuesdays, which, for him, is the perfect time. Now, in the author’s view, people are a bit like dogs – they strive for rewards and try to avoid punishment. So, whenever you complete a successful workout, give yourself a reward, be it a healthy snack or a tiny indulgence.The author’s reward of choice is a nice cup of coffee. Moods are infectious. Maybe you’ve had your day thrown off by the grumpiness of a coworker. Or perhaps the opposite has happened, and you’ve found yourself grinning after being smiled at by a stranger. This infectiousness is known as associate energy, so named because it refers to the energy you get – or are drained of – by associating with others. So how can you use this energy? Well, it’s really quite straightforward: you should associate with the people you want to be like. One of the author’s friends took this injunction very seriously. He once told the author that he wanted to live in an affluent neighborhood so that he himself would become affluent. Naturally, Adams thought this was ridiculous – but then, later, he read an article about how spending time with overweight friends can lead to you gaining weight as well. He then began noticing this effect in his own life; whenever he was in great physical condition, he noticed that his friends usually were, too. Prior to his writing Dilbert, he worked with three aspiring writers, and he now wonders whether he was influenced by the associate energy and if that’s why he got inspired to write his comic. Maybe he’s being delusional, but that hardly matters, since delusions can be extremely useful. If they’re not doing any harm, there’s no reason not to entertain certain delusions. Plenty of performers and athletes engage in harmless delusional behavior: they keep lucky coins in their pockets, for instance, or wear special socks. Even the author indulges a delusion: he uses affirmations. It’s of little importance that there’s no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of affirmations; they work for the author and keep him concentrated on his priorities. Don’t believe it? Before he created Dilbert, he used to recite a specific affirmation every day: “I, Scott Adams, will be a famous cartoonist.” The key message in this book: The path to success isn’t necessarily straight and narrow. Instead of setting goals, you should use systems, take chances and explore many different options. This will give you the opportunity to learn from your failures and develop a broad range of skills. Once you figure out what your special skills are, manage your energy levels with a healthy diet and exercise, and surround yourself with creative, supportive people who inspire you. Actionable advice: Study the systems and methods of successful people. What did Steve Jobs do that made him successful? The author encourages researching what successful people in your area of work do and what types of systems they use. Then, test out what they’ve done and combine it with what works for you.

You’ve (finally) finished college; you’ve been waiting forever to get this far. All you want is to start working, earn money, and enjoy some of that free time stolen by late hours of study – time you plan to put toward pursuing your beloved hobbies. But then what happens? Day after day you get stuck at work; you feel unimportant and bored. Each spare moment finds you dreaming yourself away to a tropical island. There’s no time for leisure or fun. You expect the gray hairs to start sprouting apace. Finding fulfilling work is not easy – at all. Today, it’s not only about providing for yourself and your family. Work is much more than that. It’s about finding work that fulfills you. In these blinks, the author defines the concept of fulfilling work, and, maybe more importantly, introduces several steps you can take to find and achieve it. In these blinks, you’ll discover what psychologists say about the regret you’ll feel if you don’t do what’s important to you;  what Benjamin Franklin has to do with your choice of career; and the pros and cons of being self-employed. Did you know that at least 50 percent of workers in the Western world are unhappy with their jobs? A survey across Europe even suggests that if people had the option to start over, 60 percent would choose a different career path. But what makes them so unhappy? The dissatisfaction we feel at work often stems from the fact that our expectations are higher than ever before. Modern workers don't just pursue decent pay – they expect their job to give their life meaning.  However, this wasn’t always the case. People used to be happy with having a roof over their heads and food on the table. But now that most of us, in the Western world, are relatively affluent and can meet our basic needs, we're looking for more than just good pay.  So while you would probably reach the end of your tether toiling away on an assembly line, your grandparents were probably fine with it and even grateful to be able to pay their bills.  Nowadays, we’re after a feeling of purpose and want to pursue our personal passions, values and talents. Basically, we want our job to be fulfilling.  What, then, should we do? Well, you can either lower your expectations (supporters of this approach say that work has always been tedious and never a joy, and that therefore we should lower our expectations and look for fulfillment outside of work) or you can join those who think finding fulfilling work is possible, if perhaps challenging. The latter approach encourages you to pursue your dreams, instead of regretting that you never tried to free yourself from the shackles of your unfulfilling job. It’s fairly obvious that we’ll now proceed with the latter strategy! But before we see exactly what makes a career fulfilling, let's try to better understand why meaningful work can be so difficult to find. In the world of today, many of us face a crisis of uncertainty and confusion when trying to choose a career path. At the root of our bewilderment lies the fact that there are simply too many paths to choose from. Such an overwhelming wealth of options is unprecedented in our history, so we’re pretty ill-equipped to handle it. A few decades ago, there simply weren’t many career choices to face. Consider the young Benjamin Franklin. At the spritely age of twelve, he was tired of working as a tallow chandler, so his father decided to help him find a new job. Together, they took a stroll through the streets and observed different workers in action, such as joiners and bricklayers. They ended up at a printer, where young Benjamin’s father decided that his son, an incorrigible bookworm, should take up the profession. And so Benjamin was a printer for the next nine years. If only things were still so simple. Today, when you visit a career website, such as careerplanner.com, you'll come across around 12,000 different careers. Hardly a quantity that is easy to sift, let alone choose from! Paradoxically, we don’t feel thankful for this plethora of possibility, all because we're not psychologically able to deal with an overload of choice. In his book, The Paradox of Choice, psychologist Barry Schwartz says the consequence of facing too many options is, not feelings of happiness and liberation, but a sort of paralysis, an inability to do anything at all. And even if we do make a decision, we often still feel unsatisfied. Why? Because, though the decision has been made, the rejected options lurk in the back of the mind. Is ours really the right career? What if we’ve made a terrible mistake? And so we’re haunted by the possibility that our choice was the wrong one. Sometimes it's not being inundated with choice that’s the problem, but feeling trapped in a particular job. In such cases, change is what’s difficult. We often feel stuck because we’ve spent so much time and energy on the education that landed us a certain job – a job with which we’re now dissatisfied. So what to do? There’s a considerable force that keeps us trapped in unfulfilling work: those early decisions that led us down a particular career path. As a result, we feel bound by our educational past. The problem is that we’re asked to make career decisions too early. How is an eighteen-year-old high school graduate supposed to know the exact job that best suits her interests and talents? Most of us have been through it: When you were in your late teens, your parents told you to study law or medicine. But as you grew older, you discovered more about yourself, you grew and changed, and by your late twenties it dawned on you that you’d rather pursue something completely different, like music or psychology. But once you start down a career path, it’s very hard to stray from it. All those years, all that money, wasted on education! If you want to make a career change, you have to change your mindset and overcome this psychological hurdle. Think of it as a decision between two types of regret: you’ll either regret that you abandoned the career you invested so much time and energy in, or you’ll regret that you never had the guts to quit and set out in pursuit of a more fulfilling future. Perhaps this will help you choose: psychological research has shown that the regret of not taking action on things that are really important to you is one of the most corrosive emotions you can experience. Opting for career change is the way to go. So what are the core components that make a career fulfilling? The old-fashioned, knee-jerk response is “money and status.” But is that really true? Sure, the bills must be paid with something, but money, as a pure happiness-enhancer, isn’t very effective. In fact, countless social science studies have shown that there is no clear relationship between happiness and monetary wealth.  While evidence shows that money contributes to your well-being up to a certain point – the meeting of your basic needs – it gives but little satisfaction once you earn beyond this point. This is due to a psychological mechanism called the “hedonic treadmill”: we purchase some new product, like a wide-screen TV, and quickly grow accustomed to and tired of it. This leads to higher expectations, and we hope the next thing, like a bigger, better screen, will bring satisfaction. Thus we get caught up in a vicious cycle of wanting – to which there’s no happy end.  So money isn’t the answer. But what about social status or recognition from others? It’s true that we all love to be acknowledged; the road to higher status, however, is also strewn with pitfalls. For one, we limit ourselves to doing the things that make other people appreciate us. We judge ourselves through the eyes of others, instead of pursuing what we want for ourselves. Another pitfall is that once we’ve attained some status – being promoted, say – there is still another, more prestigious position above us, and there forever will be. And so we lust after the next position, and then the next, until we are again stuck on an endless, unfulfilling treadmill of wanting something we don’t have. So if it's not money and status – what does bring fulfillment? There are different core elements that make up fulfilling work. One of these elements is the sense that your work has meaning. That is, your work imparts a feeling of contributing to the world in a positive way. When young students are asked about what they expect from their future employment, they’ll often answer, “I want to make a difference.” But what do they mean by this and how do they intend to do it? Well, we tend to think of our jobs as more fulfilling when we feel we’re making a meaningful contribution to something that benefits our planet and our fellow humans. When afforded such an opportunity, our personal happiness increases, too. One study on ethical work shows that people who regard their job as “work of expert quality that benefits the broader society” also report significantly higher job satisfaction. But people hoping to wed ethics and enterprise often hit a snag; ethics and business seem irreconcilable. These two things, however, are not mutually exclusive.  Take, for example, Anita Roddick, the founder of The Body Shop. She described The Body Shop as “a hair and skin company that works for positive social change.” From the start, she was able to combine enterprise and ethics: she displayed photos of missing persons on Body Shop trucks, launched a magazine sold by homeless people and pioneered fair trade, buying ingredients from indigenous communities in Brazil. It may not be a walk in the park, but Anita Roddick is proof that integrating your ethical ideals into your business may not be as difficult as you think, either. When sharing your career ideas with friends and family, you've probably been instructed to “just do what you love.” Although encouraging, this nugget of wisdom, easily said, is harder to adhere to. Because the question is – what exactly do you love doing? In order to find out what you’re passionate about, set aside some time to mull over what gives you a flow experience. Flow is a state of total focus and concentration where you're so absorbed in your activity that you forget about everything else. Engaging in what you love is usually accompanied by this feeling. There are different ways to experience flow, depending on your own unique blend of talents and passions. It might be playing piano, public speaking, building things, doing yoga, programing or doing a surgical operation. Interestingly, surgeons who require absolute concentration when performing difficult operations often report that they lose their sense of time or that it passes faster than usual. There’s overwhelming evidence that the flow experience is crucial to happiness in life and work because it gives us a gratifying sense of being able to fully access our potential. So if you’re stuck in a job where you experience no flow at all, consider finding another that does allow you this sensation. Here are two ways to go about finding this work: First, try conversational research. This means simply asking different people about their work. Don’t be too broad; ask specifically if they ever experience flow in their job. Second, you could observe yourself and your flow experiences by keeping a flow diary. Was that report absorbing and satisfying to write? Or did you feel more flow during that weekend when you were cooking for your guests? Here’s why most people are frustrated with their current job: they come home late, with no energy left to do what they really love, and tomorrow is but another identical day. If you can sympathize, you’re certainly not alone. Most people feel trapped in some abysmal job.  A core element proven to be part of job satisfaction is to have a “span of autonomy,” that is, some time where you're at liberty to make your own decisions. The more freedom you experience, the happier you’ll be. So what can you do? Well, when it comes to work, there are two different ways to increase autonomy and freedom.  The first is through self-employment, which comes, naturally, with both pros and cons. One advantage is that the self-employed stand a higher chance of feeling fulfilled than those wallowing in ordinary jobs. In a study of the UK's Work Foundation, 47 percent of self-employed workers stated they were “very satisfied” with their work; in contrast, a mere 17 percent of workers employed by others reported high satisfaction. But of course there are drawbacks, too. Self-employment does come with financial risks and additional working hours in the evening or on the weekend; there’s no regular holiday or sick pay, and no promotions. The other option is to find freedom outside the office by working less. Why not try working four days a week instead of five? You could use the free day to focus on what you really love or even to spend more time with your family. Working less might seem unrealistic financially, but if you make it your goal to cut the fat on your expenses, spending less time and money on things you don't really need, you won’t need to work as much and you’ll have more time to enjoy your life. So now that you know what makes a job fulfilling, let’s get straight to the part that so many of us really seem to struggle with – actually finding fulfilling work. The first hurdle is overcoming the fear that goes hand in hand with the thought of a major career change. However, if you’re fully aware of the psychology behind this fear, you’ll be able to defeat it. What’s this fear all about? One answer is our psychological approach to risk. Psychologists have found that it’s in our nature to fear loss twice as much as we covet gain. Therefore, we naturally abhor risk-taking and are inclined to focus more on the negative than the positive effects. So rather than being bound by risk and letting fear dictate your life, remember that you're probably overdoing it on the negative thoughts. Try taking the risk regardless!  The next step is to reflect on what kind of job you'd love. There are three steps that can help you do this: First, consider your career so far. What qualifications and skills have you earned and learned? What motivated you to acquire them? The second step is a straightforward yet powerful thought experiment. Imagine you could lead five different lives in five different parallel universes; in each, you are totally free to pursue any career you want. What kind of jobs would you choose for yourself? Could you potentially do them in this earthly reality, too? Third, ask people in your social circles what job they think you’d shine in. Sometimes people around us can be better judges than ourselves. Be sure to ask for concrete answers. For example, “helping street kids in Rio de Janeiro” is far more useful than “something with children.” Most career advisors instruct you to plan out your career in as much detail as possible before you execute it. There’s a problem with this approach, however: it hardly ever works. A far more effective approach is adopting the mantra “act first, and reflect later” – meaning it’s better to try out several jobs than to fritter away the hours in search of the perfect position in print or online. Recent research has shown that substantial change is best seen by “experiential learning.” Consider Laura van Bouchet. She was frustrated about not landing a fulfilling job in her late twenties. As her career counselor was also at a loss, Laura took it upon herself to try an experiment: she tried out 30 different jobs in a year to see which would suit her best. She contacted people who she thought had fulfilling jobs and asked if she could follow them, ultimately involving herself in everything from fashion photography to shadowing a member of the European Parliament. The “radical sabbatical” taken by Laura offers total freedom to flirt with a wide range of jobs, either by shadowing people or by volunteering. But if this isn’t quite feasible for you, there are other approaches to try out. A less radical approach is the “temporary assignment.” For example, if you’re languishing in your current job and toying with the idea of becoming a yoga teacher, you could try doing this on your weekends. If you find the work is as rewarding as you’d hoped, you can gradually increase your work and eventually quit the stuffy job you never really enjoyed. Finally, there’s “conversational research.” It's simple, but very effective: talk to people about whose jobs you’re curious. Ask them to describe their daily work in detail and see if you could picture yourself doing it. When it comes to career and family, most of us want to have it all: we want the rewards of meaningful work and of dedicated partnership and parenthood. But is this possible and, if so, how do we get it? Start by rethinking the roles traditionally laid out for men and women; if you don’t already, you should start regarding both father and mother as equal partners. The last few decades have been rife with emancipation, and yet it’s still often assumed that women will do most of the childcare and domestic work. It's therefore often women, not men, who end up leaving or adapting their careers. Parents should strive to equally share work and support one another, instead of making mom the sole juggler of family and career. It also pays to alternate between family and career, instead of trying to excel at both simultaneously. Try being a full-time parent first; afterwards, concentrate solely on your career. When a couple has a child, one parent – usually the mother – prunes work down to part-time hours, which is considered the way the family can “have it all.” Instead, however, such families are often able to reap neither the benefits of work nor family, as they can’t fully focus on one thing or the other. They’re unable to thrive in their part-time job and they can’t completely dedicate themselves to their children.  Finally, take another look at parenthood. It can lead your career down paths that you wouldn't have dreamed of before. Brian Campbell, a Canadian single-father of four boys, left his academic career to become a full-time parent. Passionate about getting his boys involved with nature, he started keeping bees. As a result, he ended up owning a small bee farm, in addition to some hives around the city, and began teaching courses on urban beekeeping. We've learned nearly everything about finding fulfilling work, but there is a final, vital element – your vocation. Why is a vocation so critical? Well, vocation is something that gives purpose to your work in its entirety. It’s a broader goal that you are pursuing, the thing that gets you out of bed every day. For example, if you're a medical researcher, your goal might be to find a cure for lung cancer. If you're an environmental activist, your dream might be to have cities flourish with reduced carbon emissions. If you're a writer, you might set your sights on penning the greatest novel since Joyce's Ulysses. But while a vocation provides your life with meaning, it's hard to develop. This is because we hold certain fundamentally flawed assumptions about the nature of vocations. Most people believe there is one perfect job out there waiting for them, and that it will reveal itself in a sudden flash of inspiration. Or that they just have to search long and hard enough to find it. But that's not how it goes. You won’t suddenly stumble upon the perfect vocation; instead, it germinates within you, slowly growing as your sustained work nurtures it. Consider Marie Curie. Moving to Paris at the age of 24, penniless, with only her talent to support her, she started her medical studies; she then shifted to chemistry and physics. She was absolutely devoted to her work and spent up to 12 hours in the laboratory every day, surviving on only bread and butter for months on end. She then turned her research to uranium rays. As she became more and more interested in them, her vocation developed until she realized she wanted to dedicate her life to discovering the secrets of radiation. She finally did this and, in 1903, she became the first woman ever to win a Nobel Prize. It really does pay, then, not to demand that your vocation be revealed to you immediately. Instead, allow it to form through your experience. The key message in this book: In these times of complexity and choice, good pay and social status are no longer good enough. We want our work to be purposeful, meaningful and rich with freedom and flow. In order to find exactly that, we must abort meticulous planning, try things out, take some risks and learn from our experiences. Actionable advice: Write a job advertisement for yourself. Step one: Imagine you have to advertise yourself in a newspaper. Describe your qualities, passions and talents and your minimum expectations of a future job. Don’t be overly specific and don’t mention a particular job you want. Step two: Send your job advertisement to 10 people you know. Make sure these people have varied experiences – send it to a police officer as well as a cartoonist. Then ask these 10 people to suggest three jobs that they think would suit you best.

But exactly how much smarter? Smarter than you? No, you might think. And you might very well be right. But what happens when computers start detecting human emotions? And are you quite sure that an emotionally enabled computer wouldn’t kick your ass if you were to battle in the art of storytelling?  Well, these blinks introduce you to some important advances that computers have made in recent decades. And they are not insignificant. However, you’ll also learn about those human skills that, as the title implies, do not even compare to – or cannot be substituted by – those of a computer. Because humans are indeed underrated. In these blinks, you’ll discover what the “Love Machine” is all about; how a computer is able to detect your emotions; why spending hours and hours in front of a screen is a very bad idea; and who is more likely to win the storytelling battle – humans or computers. Wouldn’t it be nice to increase your brain power by 100 percent every two years? Impossible, you say.  But not for computers. According to Moore’s law, IT systems increase their computing power by 100 percent every two years. In the long run, that’s a big increase. For example, Sony’s first transistor radio had five transistors and would barely fit into a pocket. Today, Intel’s latest processor has five billion transistors and it fits in the palm of your hand. So, will computers become infinitely powerful? Not quite. Eventually Moore’s law will end due to sheer physical limitations: you can only fit a finite number of transistors in a certain space. But until that time, you’d better not compare your brain power to a computer. In fact, nowadays computers can surpass us in tasks we usually think are uniquely human. For example, computers can detect emotions more effectively than humans. Paul Ekman, a famous psychologist, discovered micro-expressions: the minimal movements in your 40 facial muscles that lead to certain expressions. After many years of research, Ekman figured out which of 3,000 different micro-expressions is connected to which emotion. The result is his Facial Action Coding System. This is how it works: If you put all this emotional data into a computer equipped with a camera, and point it at a human face, the computer can correctly detect the emotion 85 percent of the time. Whereas humans, even with training, got it right only 55 percent of the time! Have you ever thought about how much your cell phone or tablet affects you?  It turns out that the use of phones, computers and other “screens” decreases our social skills. In today’s world it’s easy to spend hours in front of a screen without even noticing. The problem is that the more time we spend in front of screens, the worse our social skills, like reading body language or understanding emotions, become. In fact, when sixth-graders stayed at a screen-free camp for only five days, researchers found a substantial increase in the children’s emotional understanding. They did two more tests to verify the results, and each time they were statistically significant. But what about social media? Doesn’t that bring us closer? Nope. It turns out that social media isn’t that social after all. Originally, humans evolved to be sociable in order to stay connected to a tribe that could keep us safe and provide us with food.  But today we can maintain connections from our computer at home, and find our food in the fridge. Even though at first glance that seems like a revolutionary development, it’s actually the opposite.  For example, a study showed that US teenagers who use a lot of social media are less likely to have good relationships with their parents or their peers, and are often unhappy. This might be because bonding via social media is less effective than in person or over the phone. Another reason might be that social media users typically become less trusting, so the quality of their relationships suffers. So although computers do improve our lives in many ways, we should be careful when using them, especially since social skills like empathy have become more important – as we’ll see in the next blink. The old saying goes: Knowledge is power. These days though, knowledge is increasingly stored in computers, with little need to keep it your head. So where does this leave us humans? We have to shift our main focus from acquiring knowledge to other uniquely human capabilities – like social skills. Consider a lawyer: She has to possess skills ranging from the ability to analyze a case to figuring out a strategy to support her position: all time- and cost-intensive labor. But today a computer can analyze millions of cases and find all the supporting literature in a bleep. Computers can even predict the outcomes of Supreme Court decisions more accurately than legal experts! So do we no longer need lawyers? We do need them, but their focus is shifting toward skills that computers cannot replace: social skills, like building an emotional connection with a client, and helping them act in their own best interest. But there’s another reason why social skills are becoming ever more crucial. As the world becomes more interconnected, people from different cultures are interacting more and more. One step out of place can be taken as a deep insult – and in the wrong context, it can be deadly. For example, in 2004, during the war in Iraq, an American marine drove too close to the third holiest site in Shia Islam, the Imam Ali Mosque, causing an uproar. If the soldier had known better, they could have avoided the conflict. But when harnessed, social skills can be incredibly powerful. A few weeks earlier, a group of American soldiers was surrounded by hundreds of enraged Iraqis. But instead of attacking them, the soldiers used their knowledge of local culture, and knelt down, pointing their guns to the ground. This simple use of body language calmed the Iraqis down, and the soldiers could withdraw in peace. Have you ever had a bad experience with a call-center person? It’s partly because they typically have to follow rigid scripts instead of having genuine empathy for your problem. We find this irritating because empathy is a basic element for every relationship – even in business. In fact, being empathic – understanding what the other person is feeling – is becoming more important in every area of the economy. Whether you show it as a doctor or a call-center worker, empathy is the first step of every meaningful relationship. For example, consider how American Express is using empathy in business. When Jim Bush was placed in charge of AmEx’s call centers, he threw out all the scripts. Instead, the workers received information about each individual customer, and could act as they personally felt right. This led to higher recommendation scores from customers, higher profit margins and a 50 percent reduction in the employee attrition rate. And the good news about empathy is that it’s a skill everybody can learn that will probably never be replaced by a computer. Empathy consists of two elements: understanding the thoughts and feelings of others, and reacting appropriately. For example, an empathic doctor would try to understand what the patient is going through and show an appropriate level of concern. And this is where we have an advantage over computers. We are hardwired to only accept empathy in its most powerful form from fellow humans, so no matter how elaborately a computer responds to our problems, we simply won’t be convinced. Have you ever worked in a team where things just didn’t click? While everyone in a team can bring great skills to the table, their different personalities may be a bad fit. So what determines the success of a team? While many factors such as size, stability or appropriate rewards do matter, they are not as important as social sensitivity, meaning the social abilities of the subject.  Consider the US golf team in 2008. Their coach, Paul Azinger, wanted to assemble a team that would win the Ryder Cup. In previous years the United States had lost five out of six tournaments because they couldn’t work together as a team. So Azinger tried a new approach: instead of choosing the players with the best skills, he selected those whose personalities would best fit together. He made sure that each golfer felt comfortable and understood in the team. The result? One of the biggest US wins in the past 25 years. F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, “No grand idea was ever born in a conference,” but today he might be wrong. Being able to work together in a group is crucial for the success of any organization. In the world of scientific research, the most influential work is generally conducted by teams. This system allows each member to specialize in specific topics, helping them break into new territory faster. Teamwork is also critical in the business world. In addition to the CEO, there’s usually an entire team running a business, like the chief financial officer (who emerged in the 1970s) and chief information officer (a product of the 1980s), as well as many other coordinating roles. This kind of team composition is essential for success today. We’ve all left the cinema after experiencing a movie with a great plot that has moved us to tears. But did you know that if you can tell a good story like that, you’ll find it’s more convincing for people than a purely logical argument – and can change millions of lives? Consider Stephen Denning, the director of the Africa region at the World Bank. He realized that the World Bank had an incredible amount of information on important subjects like malaria. If this information were made accessible to, for example, Zambian health workers, they could use it to help millions of people.  At first Denning tried to sell his idea to his colleagues with logic, charts and slides, but they didn’t listen. So he tried a new method, and told them the story of a health worker in Zambia logging onto the World Bank’s site to access all the information about malaria.  The problem: the worker couldn’t access the information. So despite the wealth of information that the World Bank possessed, the bank wasn’t actually making any difference. This story led to a change in the World Bank’s strategy, which eventually helped millions of people. Denning used a skill in which humans have a clear advantage over computers: he told a good story. Stories exist to “move people to change,” but a computer-written story will never achieve this because it lacks authenticity. We humans want to know and evaluate the teller of the story, and computer-written stories simply seem suspicious. Even though in recent years computers have been getting better at writing stories, from simple reports on sports matches to more complicated narratives, they still do not beat those of humans. Have you ever made a meal from a recipe devised by a computer? You haven’t? Well, if you get the chance, you should try it! Computers can indeed be creative, and cooking is a great example. IBM taught their supercomputer Watson to be the ultimate creative cook. At first, Watson scanned thousands of existing recipes and all of the food combinations involved, such as tomatoes and oregano. He was also “fed” the chemical profiles of thousands of ingredients. He was then asked to create brand new recipes.  One of the results, the Austrian Chocolate burrito, which included the astonishing combination of ground beef, dark chocolate, mashed edamame, apricot purée and cheese, was sold from a food truck at the South by Southwest festival in Austin – and people loved it. Clearly then, computers can perform creative tasks. But it seems true creative breakthroughs are still generated by human interaction. Consider really creative companies like Apple, Google and Pixar. They actively encourage creativity by increasing “random” interactions between employees – interactions that make the innovation sparks fly. For example, Google serves really good food in their cafeteria. As a result, everybody goes there. When standing in line, people often start talking with someone they wouldn’t normally interact with. There are also long tables instead of small ones, which increases the chances of sitting next to someone unknown.   Then there’s Steve Jobs’ methods: he designed Pixar’s headquarters with one central meeting spot where everyone interacted. And at Apple, he was famous for his face-to-face meetings, which got everyone’s input directly. As you’ve seen in these blinks, humans are still superior to computers in many areas. But it gets even better: computers can also help us to excel.  Take education, for instance: it turns out that learning at a computer is more effective than learning in a crowded classroom. For example, the US Navy uses software to teach students how to repair technical systems on ships, a purely knowledge-based task that doesn’t require any human interaction. Then there’s Stanford University, which in 2011 launched the first MOOC or Massive Open Online Course on artificial intelligence, inviting everyone to follow it from their own homes around the world. Eventually, some 160,000 students from 190 countries registered, but the biggest shock was that the top 400 performers were not the elite students in the parallel classroom course – they were the online participants! Nowadays there are even ways of learning the social skills crucial to your success by simply using software.  For example, there’s a piece of software called Love Machine that helps employees build better social skills by incentivizing them to interact with each other. With it you can send a thank you message to a helpful colleague. The twist is that all the other employees can also see your thank you message. The goal is to encourage employees not to hide and protect their knowledge, but instead to share it and help others.  As it turns out, the thank you message creates an incentive for other people to help. It sometimes even develops into a competition about who can be the most helpful! The key message in this book: Technological progress is inevitable, but has both positive and negative consequences. If we humans want to keep our jobs, we need to build up human skills that computers can’t develop, such as empathy, and take action to manage technology’s negative effects.  Actionable advice: Use technology to enhance your skillset. Take advantage of the huge range of online learning communities and learn something for free that will boost your skillset – and your résumé. For example, you can learn leadership, decision-making or project management skills with thousands of other learners, and even get a certificate from the university when you successfully complete the course.

This catchy song should be your new mantra. Why? Because hustling will give you an edge and help you break away from the boring, mundane work life that’s dragging you down. To hustle is to make the small tweaks that will propel you into a new and better life. In these blinks, we will look at what that entails. You’ll learn to think like a hustler and discover actionable tips on how to get where you want to be in life. In these blinks, you’ll learn how half of Americans under 30 view the American dream; what the three M’s are and why you need them; and how POP is not just an email protocol. Are you one of those people who considers her job to be perfect and wouldn’t change a thing about it? Well, the majority of folks don’t fit that description. In fact, many people feel that their daily working life amounts to no less than a daunting, repetitive slog. Just take a Gallup poll which found that around 90 percent of the world’s workers don’t feel emotionally connected to their jobs. While the majority of people want to move away from this lifestyle, doing so is nearly impossible because of the way society is structured. After all, people end up in these jobs by following a very specific and common path. They go to college, maybe even graduate school, because they are told that’s the only way to land the kind of career they are expected to want. But education is expensive. Outstanding student loans in America rose to a staggering $516 billion in 2007. By 2015, that number had climbed to $1.2 trillion! This travesty means that the average college graduate owes over $30,000 in student loans. For graduate students, that number easily climbs to six figures. For most people, going to college means loading up on debt. Simultaneously, salaries have dropped and technology, paired with globalization, has meant an overall decline in the number of jobs. And who knows when people who are lucky enough to have jobs will be hit by the next major crisis and put out of work? In this frightening climate, people take jobs to pay off their debt and cover their bills rather than fulfill their dreams. Just take a 2015 study, in which researchers asked 18- to 29-year-olds if they thought the American Dream was dead or alive. While 49 percent answered “alive,” 48 percent said “dead.” But what other option is there other than doing these unfulfilling jobs? Well, that’s exactly what we’ll explore in the blinks that follow. By now it’s probably clear that lots of people are unfulfilled in their work lives and don’t see any way to break out of the pattern they’re in. However, there is an escape route: hustling. Hustling is an approach to life that’s designed to get you money, meaning and momentum. While some people might assume this means taking advantage of others, that’s absolutely not the case. Contrary to popular belief, hustling is not about stepping on the toes of other people, stealing, conning, or anything like that. It’s about forging ahead despite obstacles and difficulties. In other words, to hustle is to pursue your dreams. But if you’re an artist, do you really even need money? Well, historically, some artists haven’t. These creative practitioners claim to do their work solely for the sake of art, and, for a few, money is even repellent. Just take the copywriter and cartoonist, Hugh MacLeod. He says that artists inevitably compromise their art when they’re offered money for it. That being said, you need money to sustain your hustle, and if you can’t sustain your hustle, you can’t make your art. After all, if you don’t have the money to pursue your dreams, you won’t find meaning in your work or build the momentum to sustain your passion. The truth is, lots of artists were only able to pursue their work, and thereby create meaning and momentum, by turning a profit. Picasso is a great example. If it wasn’t for his financial success, he would have stopped making the paintings that both fulfilled him and captivated audiences for generations to come. Picasso even said that an artist must succeed enough to sustain his art. Money, whether people like it or not, is key. Do you own your dream? It may seem like an odd question, but most people are merely renting theirs. In other words, they’re playing by the rules of the rigged system and closing their eyes to what truly brings them joy. Such an outlook means accepting the dreams doled out by the system and never having ownership over your own. It means doing the job you don’t like and telling yourself it’s a great opportunity. So how are you going to achieve your dreams? To reach your goals, you need to hustle, even if it means taking a gamble. Hustling is all about risk-taking; it’s about setting out on a journey that might afford you new opportunities, change and even the fulfillment of your dreams. Just take the electrical engineer Ernesto and his wife, a nurse named Luci. In their native Cuba, businesses are burdened by an overbearing government bureaucracy that siphons away people’s hard-earned money. Ernesto often thought of starting a business but wanted to do it beyond the reach of the government, which would mean serious risks, even jail time, if he were caught. While it was a tough decision, he finally decided to start off doing small projects for friends and acquaintances, which slowly grew into a bigger business. By the end of his career he’d earned a handsome chunk of money and, while the hazards were real, it was all worth it in the end. His family had enough to take care of their basic needs and even afford a nice car. Breaking out of the convenience of a sheltered life – even one that’s monotonous and unfulfilling – can be tough. But to snag your dream while you still can and make truly life-altering changes, you’ll need to push yourself into territory that’s somewhat painful and uncomfortable. However, you only need to takes small steps at a time. What if you dream of being a star public speaker but you’re terrified of appearing in front of crowds. Instead of talking to a massive crowd straightaway, start giving short speeches every night at the dinner table. Doing so might be uncomfortable, but this discomfort is actually good. It’s a small dose of discomfort that you can overcome, improving in the process. Then, when your dinnertime speeches are a piece of cake, make them longer, or speak to more people. Slowly but surely you can broaden your experience until you’re living your dream. And remember, such momentum can bring luck. When you push through and persevere, luck becomes more likely. So, while you might feel like giving up, whether on a job, a book, or a personal project you’re invested in, persisting will pay off in the end. When famous director Francis Ford Coppola was filming Apocalypse Now, practically everything went wrong. There was bad weather on the set, the schedule kept getting pushed back and the costs were getting out of hand. Not just that, but Coppola was in constant conflict with his actors, who were regularly drunk or stoned. He wanted nothing more than to quit, but he didn’t. He persevered instead and, all of a sudden, luck started to come his way. The weather cleared up, the actors gave powerful performances and, by the end of it, they had produced a film that won multiple Academy Awards. By now you know a decent amount about hustling, but you don’t know the Three Unseen Laws: heart, head and habits. The first of these is crucial because doing something that’s close to your heart will move you to action and keep you forging ahead. You might have a feeling of joy, anger or revenge that will push you to accomplish your goals. Maybe you’re pissed off that your smartphone earbuds keep getting tangled up in your pocket and are certain there’s another way. Before you know it you’re thinking through the design for a pocket-sized box that keeps your headphones neat and tidy. Next, you must use your head to observe and benefit from things that aren’t immediately visible. Just imagine you’re the captain of a ship. You naturally need to stay abreast of the wind and waves to navigate accurately, but you also need to check the undercurrents. You might want to avoid them or you might be able to use them to arrive at your destination faster. The point is, while lots of people only see obstacles, a hustler keeps her head cool and sees opportunities wherever they might be. And finally, it’s important to make a habit of setting milestones and deadlines. After all, everyone needs closure at one point or another. Setting intermediate goals will commit you to doing a certain amount of work, and deadlines will push you to get it done. Say you want to write a book. You could set a one-week deadline for writing 10,000 words and make a daily habit of waking up at seven in the morning and writing for two hours. Once you achieve your one-week deadline you can set another one and keep moving toward your goal. Do you have a portfolio of your work? If not, you should definitely consider putting one together. After all, a Personal Opportunity Portfolio, or POP, is a great way to showcase you and your work while attracting people and companies that will help you attain your dreams. This tool, which consists of four parts, lays out exactly who you are, which is invaluable in making progress. While a resumé describes what you’ve done so far, a future employer really wants to understand where you’re going. That’s where the first part of the POP comes in: potential. If your dream is to be an online marketing manager for a cosmetics company you might try experimenting with different brands and writing up your experiences on a blog. If you can get enough traffic flowing to your site, you’ll have demonstrated the potential you have to engage in the field. The next pillar of your POP is people, which naturally is all about your network, both on and offline. A great way to expand this network is to connect others. By facilitating such connections you’ll benefit others, but you’ll also pull people into your own network. The third piece is projects. This portion of your POP should detail everything you’re currently working on, whether it’s volunteering at the Red Cross, writing your blog or pitching ideas to new acquaintances at meetups. This section presents your interests while showing your ability to do work and get results. And finally, the proof section is essential to demonstrate your credibility. After all, if you can’t back up your words with evidence, you’ll never be able to impress the right people. Anybody can say that they write compelling blog posts, but very few people can provide links, references and examples of such captivating work. Being able to do so will show that you can deliver what you say you will. The key message in this book: Hustling tends to get a bad rap but actually, it’s a positive way of persevering and shooting for your dreams. You’ll always be able to find a way to reach your deepest goals as long as you’re willing to step off the conventional path, push ahead no matter what and aim for what you truly want.  Actionable advice: Find your talents in the mirror. Many people feel pressure to excel at school, get into a good college and go on to be a respected professional. However, this conventional wisdom isn’t universally applicable, and you might want to do something completely different. To find out, take a deep look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, “what are my talents?” By taking this time to identify your true abilities, you’ll find the dream you need to guide you.

They fear how people perceive them and struggle to shake off the nagging doubts that they are small and insignificant – that their voice doesn’t matter. Well, Jessica Honegger is living proof that you should do away with your fears, step outside of your comfort zone and live a life of meaning and purpose. Honegger once hosted a jewelry sale to fund her goal of adopting a Rwandan orphan and generate income for poor artisans in Uganda at the same time. She didn’t know it at the time, but her home jewelry sale would, over several years, grow into a $17-million business run by 4,000 Noonday ambassadors, supporting thousands of artisans, many of them women, in countries across the globe. With no business know-how but some Christian faith, more than a little fear and a whole lot of determination, Honegger stepped outside of her comfort zone. In doing so, she achieved her dream of adoption, built a socially responsible business and discovered a life of purpose. In these blinks, you’ll learn why courage, even imperfect courage, is better than comfort; the importance of showing vulnerability; and how you can stop chasing impossible ideals and value yourself as you are. Jessica Honegger never intended to start Noonday, her jewelry and fashion business; it all kind of happened by accident. What she initially intended to do was adopt a child. Years earlier, on a trip to Africa, she held a young child, orphaned after her parents died from AIDS, in her arms. From that moment on, she knew in her heart that the next step for her family would be, eventually, to adopt. Unfortunately, international adoption is expensive, and just at the time their plan for adoption was coming together, the housing market collapsed. Since she and her husband were making a living from refurbishing and reselling properties, their income disappeared too. Honegger needed a side hustle, and she needed it now. She remembered that friends of hers in Uganda had been bemoaning the fact that two incredible local artists, Jalia and Daniel Matovu, a husband and wife team, had no way of selling their artisan crafts for a price their work deserved. Honegger made a decision. She would host a sale for the Matovus’ products to friends and family back in Austin, as well as clothes from her own closet and anything else she could find. She wasn’t sure whether it would work; in fact, she was slightly afraid none of her friends would turn up to her sale, and of what people would think of her. But it worked. Her friends showed up. They cared about her journey toward adoption and were captivated by the connections between fashion and impact, style and history, profit and purpose that came together in the sale of these beautiful Ugandan objects. After an hour, Honegger had sold almost everything. That night, she realized she was on to something. Her first sale led to a second, and a third. She emailed the Matovus asking for more stock while wiring money back to them. Honegger had no experience in business, but she had a whole lot of courage - the courage to stand up and pursue what she cared about. With the help of friends and a little common sense, she turned her hustle into an international business employing and supporting, among others, thousands of women in the United States and around the world. And what started as a dream for adoption later turned into a reality, as the following year, the Honeggers welcomed Rwandan orphan Jack Honegger into their home. For those of us from privileged backgrounds, comfort is an easy option. Staying in your comfort zone is, well, comfortable. For most of us, settling in on the couch to binge-watch Netflix while sipping a warm tea or glass of wine sounds like an ideal plan. It brings a sense of safety, security, comfort and the nice feeling that things are alright – after all, not much can go wrong during a Netflix binge. Many of us go through life seeking comfort, choosing a pizza night on the couch over going out and learning something new or meeting new people. It seems we can’t get hurt by staying in and sticking with what’s familiar. But what does this comfort really offer us? A boring life, in which we have no impact and live in a spiritual void. A better approach is to choose courage, not comfort. For the author, courage had always meant complete fearlessness. Courage evokes thoughts of Martin Luther King Jr, who stood up for what he believed in, despite facing threats to his life. Or of the firefighters who ran toward danger on 9/11, while everyone around them ran away from it. But the truth is that for most of us, courage is something a little less bold. For the author, courage was pursuing her adoption process despite having a near-empty bank account; courage was opening up her home for a jewelry sale, not knowing whether any of her friends would turn up. It may have been imperfect courage, but that was the only kind she had. And making that choice, to embrace risk instead of accepting her lot in life – to run scared toward her goal – changed her life profoundly. It led to her successful adoption and also launched a business career that she, as a house flipper and educationalist with no business experience, never imagined she could lead. And, in doing so, she managed to forge connections with thousands of inspiring women, who themselves were finding their own courage daily, in the company’s US offices and abroad. Do you also have goals in life but feel unable to break through your fears? What follows is a guide to how you too can find the imperfect courage that you need to get up and chase your dreams head-on. A study by political scientists at Brigham Young University recently found that if women are the minority in a group that is trying to solve a problem they speak up to 75 percent less than the men in the group do. Girls and women are trained by society to be nice, polite and humble, and not to speak out. But if you want to achieve your full potential and follow your dreams, you have to speak up. When the Honeggers’ adoption of their child, Jack, was nearly complete, there was just one final, crucial step. They needed official permission from a local judge in Rwanda – and they needed it urgently. On very short notice, Rwanda was changing its policies on international adoption, and any delay could mean losing the opportunity to adopt Jack. Unfortunately, their attorneys told them that immediate granting of permission almost never happened. So Honegger went and waited at the judge’s office, along with her husband and other prospective adoptive parents. Facing up to the possibility of losing her new baby boy, the author decided that she couldn’t just wait for her family’s fate to be decided for them. She had no idea of acceptable etiquette in such a situation in Rwanda and was wracked with nerves. But she stood up, stepped forward and addressed the judge. She told him what an honor it was to be in his country and to meet with him. And she told him that all those present would be honored if they could be granted permission to take their children out of the orphanage that day. To the shock of the attorneys and the judges’ staff, he acquiesced. Everyone’s adoptions were approved that day. If Honegger hadn’t had the courage to stand up and speak out, the process could have dragged on and all the scheduled adoptions would have been in jeopardy. Whenever Honegger is tempted to keep quiet, she thinks back to that moment and is reminded of the power of embracing her fear, standing up and speaking out. So if you ever find in life that you have a nagging feeling in your gut and that you should stand up and say something, then listen to it. Respond to those thoughts and don’t let your fear hold you back. There is a world of opportunity out there if you’re willing to stand up, step out and reach for it. When Honegger was a schoolchild, she hated sports. In particular, she hated one exercise in gym class. A teacher would hand one end of a rope to Honegger and the other end to one of the fastest kids in school. The other kid was told to run off at her normal pace, and Honegger just had to try and keep up. Sweating and panting, she’d chase around, desperately trying to maintain the pace. It was a miserable experience, but sadly one that millions of women are replicating every day. Too many women have internalized the idea that they need to keep up with others. This is particularly true when it comes to body image. One international study showed that 98 percent of women want to change at least something about their physical appearance. So unless you are one of the incredibly lucky 2 percent, chances are that you are chasing what you believe is a better version of yourself, instead of loving who you are. So how can we get better at embracing our true worth? First, take a global perspective. In the United States, thinness is highly prized. According to the author, though, many African women regard big hips as beautiful, because they show you are living a life of plenty. And, she says, many Latin Americans value gold front teeth as both beautiful and a sign that you can afford dental treatment. So whatever your imperfections are, from frizzy hair to a little extra cushion on your bones, remember that there is a culture somewhere that values these traits as beautiful. Recognizing that standards are subjective is one thing; another challenge is to speak and think kindly to yourself. One practical way to get better at this is to reconsider the labels you attach to yourself and to others. If you call yourself “unstylish,” change that to, “I’m a person who struggles with style sometimes.” If you find yourself saying, “I’m flat-chested,” say instead that you are “a person who has smaller breasts.” Why? Well, you may struggle with style, your breast size, your weight or any number of your features of traits, but this does not define you. Put yourself, as a whole person with dignity, at the center of your own conversation. We all have parts of ourselves – particularly those parts that contain our fears and anxieties – that we prefer to keep to ourselves. The thing is, it’s only when we share those parts that we can truly connect with others, invite support, empathy and compassion, and build true and meaningful relationships. It’s not always easy to reveal our vulnerabilities, but doing so can have a powerful effect. It could even be a life-changer, as in the case of a young Ugandan girl named Hope. In Uganda, HIV carries a huge stigma and, as a result, many people hide their positive diagnoses. Hope’s mother had contracted HIV and passed it on to Hope during pregnancy. When Hope discovered her condition as a girl, she was filled with shame. She denied the reality of her condition and became iller. Hope’s mother pleaded with Jalia Matovu, Honegger’s artisan friend, to persuade Hope to take treatment. For Hope, admitting her vulnerability – in this case, her HIV diagnosis – to Matovu, was the first step in her treatment and was almost too much for her to bear. But Matovu not only heard Hope’s story, she accepted it with empathy and compassion. Hope’s sense of shame disappeared, and she learned that owning her vulnerability was the only way she could emerge from her pain. Today, Hope lives like someone with nothing to be ashamed of. In treatment, and open about her condition, she is both happy and healthy. Early on in Honegger’s journey, she also spent a lot of time hiding her vulnerability: her anxiety that when it came to business, she wasn’t the real deal. She was worried that if people knew the truth behind her business story – that it all started in a spare room in her home and that she muddled her way through – then they wouldn’t regard her as a legitimate businesswoman. Working with other women and listening to their stories, Honegger started to see the benefits of practicing vulnerability and embracing the truth of her life and business. Whenever she got invited to speak on a panel with super-successful business leaders, she’d be honest. She’d introduce herself by saying that she didn’t want to fake it anymore, and would openly admit that she had no experience leading an executive team, just a lot of experience hustling. And the more open she was about her vulnerabilities, the more she experienced true connection with other people, because she was able to show her whole, true self. Try it yourself and embrace your own vulnerabilities. After all, what is a more valuable thing to share than the reality of who you are? Have you ever encountered another woman in a store, at the beach or in a cafe and judged her? Perhaps because she looked more attractive and thinner than you, you resented her at that moment? Or maybe because her kids were misbehaving, you felt a little disdain for her parenting? Honegger once found herself in such a situation in a shoe store. Another woman was shopping while her children were causing a fuss, making noise and crashing into displays. But as Honegger found herself slipping into judgmental thoughts, she remembered that, on a different day, this could have been Honegger herself, with her own kids. So instead of judging, she started to play with one of the children. She also started talking with the mom, who said she had recently moved to Texas from Egypt. The mom, Honegger realized, was doing her best, struggling with everyday tasks while adjusting to a new life. At that moment, Honegger also realized that if you want to build a better world, women need to look at each other with compassion and understanding, not judgement. Women need a Sisterhood. And this Sisterhood, at its best, can be an unstoppable force. After Noonday took off, Honegger’s Ugandan partner, Jalia Matovu, hired new women for her workshop in Uganda. One of them, Nakato, often arrived at work with a bruised face and body. She was obviously upset, and Matovu suspected domestic violence but wasn’t sure what she could do. When Nakato arrived at work one day so badly bruised that she could barely open her eyes, Matovu decided enough was enough. She summoned up her courage, walked down to the police station and demanded an arrest shouting, “you will support this woman!” Matovu couldn’t afford to bribe the police to convince them to take action. But what she lacked in money, she made up in sisterly tenacity. So she resolved to go to the police every day until they did something. Day after day, she arrived, until eventually, the police could no longer ignore her. Thanks to Matovu’s efforts, Nakato’s husband was arrested and sent to jail. This just goes to show that when sisters decide not to stand back, but to stand up for one another, they can achieve great things. We all know that there are many problems in the world, from girls’ education in rural Africa to urban poverty in the United States. But sometimes, the scale of the challenge can be intimidating. It can seem impossible to solve the world’s problems, so we stay focused on our immediate surroundings – our work, our friends and our family. But the truth is, just because you can’t make a big contribution doesn’t mean you can’t do anything at all. A few years ago, a friend of Honegger’s, Dee, welcomed Ugandan teenager Rachel to her home. Rachel required major brain surgery, and while a charity had organized a medical evacuation from Rwanda to a hospital in Texas, she would need a local foster family to take her in and look after her following the surgery. As a busy mom, Dee didn’t have much time or money, but she had a big heart and volunteered to help. Dee had never met Rachel before, but she spent nights by her side in the hospital. She took her home, bathed her, nursed her and was her friend and foster mother for 18 months. During this time, Honegger herself was particularly busy with work commitments, and she felt a little guilty that she couldn’t do much to help Dee. One day, while grocery shopping, Honegger realized that just because she felt unable to make a large contribution, she could still help. She loaded up her cart with groceries and goodies and dropped them off at Dee’s house. From then on, she just kept doing the same, week in, week out. This story reminds us that even if we can’t all do big, incredible deeds, such as what Dee did, there is always something we can do to help make the world a better place. So what can you do? You don’t have to turn your world upside down. Think about how you could make a small adjustment to your current life that would have an impact in the world. For example, if you are a photographer, why not help out Heart Gallery, an organization that takes and showcases compelling photo-portraits of adoptable children to help them find parents. If you are an accountant, you could choose a local charity and help it get its accounts in order. Whoever you are, whatever you do, you have the power to make a difference in our world. Use it. When Honegger’s daughter was days old, Honegger admitted that, amidst the exhausting chaos of having a newborn, she wished she could put the baby back inside her. Her doctor told Honegger to give the baby to her own mother and get some sleep. Five hours later, Honegger felt better. The challenge of motherhood was still a large one, but it felt more manageable. You can't always be available for others; eventually, you will simply burn out. It’s essential to dedicate some time to taking care of yourself, so here are some practical tips for avoiding burnout to make sure you pace yourself and take the occasional break. First up is meditation. For Honegger, meditation is simply about spending ten minutes affirming her value in front of God. She has found a mantra that she repeats to herself until she believes it saying, “In your presence, I have nothing to change, fix or prove.” So take ten minutes out of your day to affirm to yourself that you don’t need to be thinner, harder working, a better mom or anything else except what you are, right there and right then. It will help remind you of your own value. The next tip is to be present. If you, like many people, struggle to put down your phones and really connect with people around you, give your children, husband or friends permission to unplug you. When Honegger gets home, she operates phone-free until the next morning. And if she gets caught breaking the rule, her children have permission to hide her phone. To date, they’ve only forgotten where they hid it once. Finally, celebrate effort. When Honegger talks to her Noonday ambassadors on Facebook Live and asks what there is to celebrate, she’s not looking for results; she wants to hear about the new girl who pushed through her fear to lead her first sale or the teammate who made the bold decision to miss out on short-term sales in order to properly recover from an illness. Effort is worth celebrating because it’s effort that, in the long run, brings results. There’s no point in getting to where you want to go in life if, when you arrive, you aren’t in one piece. So take care of yourself. You will flourish, and you will be able to make your best possible contribution toward a continually evolving world. The key message in these blinks: Many women know, deep down, that something more fulfilling is out there. But instead of pursuing their deepest desires for a meaningful, impactful life, they stay in their places of safety and comfort. If we do find our courage and step scared but hopeful out into the world, huge opportunities await. Stop letting fear keep you on the sidelines, and embrace your courage today.  Actionable advice: Unwrap some of the bubble wrap surrounding your life.  Consider enrolling your children in a public charter school. Shop at a grocery store where you rub shoulders with people different to you. Make friends with foster families and diverse members of your community. Try to take off a little of the bubble wrap surrounding your life, and you’ll find you’ll not only learn more about the world, but you’ll also be better positioned to help make it a better place.

Just think of all the politicians out there, struggling to get people to adopt their viewpoint. Most fail. And only a handful ever reach a position of power. But there is a way to win people over. You can become an influencer. You just need to know how. And this is where these blinks come in. By approaching the act of influencing from fields such as sociology and psychology, you can learn some key techniques and get more people to join your side. If you work in a client-focused role, or in public policy, then these blinks are essential reading. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why the size of your workspace determines what people think of you; how a powerful Tanzanian radio drama helped transforms society; and how, if meted out correctly, rewards can help change behavior. We all want to influence the world, to make it a better place for ourselves and everyone else. But what’s the best way to actually do that? Merely wanting to improve things isn’t the same as actually making improvements. So what should we do? For starters, you need to pinpoint the goal you’re striving for. Most of us have some vague conception of what we want to achieve, and, because of this haziness, we never make concrete plans to get there. As a result, we often fail. If you want to positively influence the world, you must have a goal – a tangible, measurable goal, and a timeframe for getting there. Take Dr. Don Berwick, former CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). Berwick wanted to decrease the mortality rate of people who use health care, for instance, by checking into a hospital. Actually, he claims that health care is one of the main causes of death in the US. So he set a concrete goal: Save 100,000 lives by 9 a.m. on June 14, 2006. Such precision is already a step toward effecting change. To make headway on your goal, it’s vital that you concentrate on the behaviors that will get you there. True influencers don’t care about behaviors unrelated to the impact they want to have. Instead, they concentrate their efforts on two or three behaviors that will yield the biggest impact once mastered. Take Dr. Wiwat, Thailand’s Minister for Public Health. Wiwat set out to drastically cut the AIDS rate in his home country. After discovering that 97 percent of HIV infections resulted from intercourse with heterosexual sex workers, he saw that the behavior that needed to change was the sex worker’s decision of whether or not to use a condom. Targeting this behavior only, Wiwat successfully stopped Thailand from becoming the country with the highest percentage of HIV-infected people in the world. If you want to influence people’s behavior, you need to convince them of your way of thinking. So what’s the most effective way of doing this? When we feel we’re being forced to change, we feel as if we’re surrendering our free will. Being able to persuade others is therefore a far better approach. One technique you can use to do this is motivational interviewing, developed by Dr. William Miller. Here, you can use open questions to guide the interviewee to think about their behavior. Let’s say you’re speaking with someone with an alcohol problem. You might first ask about their everyday life and general happiness, then transition to their eating habits and, finally, move on to their drinking. The questions you ask should allow the other person to approach the subject on their own terms, without any pressure from you. There are times, though, when verbal persuasion isn’t enough. In these cases, give the person the chance to gain some real experience about it. This is what Dr. Don Berwick did after leading a Harvard seminar on patient safety for hospital CEOs. The seminar went well, but the CEOs failed to put theory into practice. After realizing this, Berwick advised the CEOs to investigate some of the injured patients themselves. This firsthand experience considerably reinforced the CEOs’ commitment to the issue. Storytelling is another powerful influence tool that ensures lasting behavioral change. For example, in 1993, Martha Swai changed the behavior of the Tanzanian people through storytelling. On her radio program “Twende na Wakati“ (“Let's Go with the Times”), she created a character, a man named Mkwaju, who abused alcohol and had unprotected sex with prostitutes. Many husbands who’d listened to the show later reported that they identified with Mkwaju, who embodied their own shameful transgressions. This story helped reflect upon and change their behavior for the better. Storytelling works well when it comes to influence. But don’t forget to provide real experiences, so that others don’t get caught up in merely thinking or imagining circumstances. Many stories tell of a solitary, brave hero who solves all humanity’s problems. But, in reality, this rarely ever happens. Being a true influencer means working with and inspiring others so that you can realize your goals collectively, not saving the day singlehandedly.A great way to influence people is to help them reach a goal that they already share with others. There is a natural drive in people with a mutual goal, and often an influencer’s job is simply to identify these group members and give them the best opportunity to reach that goal together. This is what Dr. Muhammad Yunus did after witnessing poverty in Bangladesh. The people there were trapped in destitution because they couldn’t receive even modest credit from local banks, which barred them from establishing small businesses that might bring a profit. So, Dr. Yunus created the Grameen Bank and gave credit to groups of five people. He knew that getting five people to work together to pull themselves out of poverty would instigate a shared ambition and generate the best ideas. Dr. Yunus’s initiative worked, and poverty in Bangladesh dropped dramatically. Grameen Bank is now worth millions of dollars. Working together also entails sharing individual problems with one another. Often, we’re terrified of admitting our problems or mistakes, but the only way we can solve them is to share them and recruit others to help us. For instance, in software-development culture, lying about one’s inability to meet a deadline happens so often that it gave rise to the term project chicken. Here, the first person in a meeting to openly admit that they need a new deadline is known as the “chicken.” Although being the “chicken” doesn’t sound desirable, it’s actually helpful, because only when problems are shared do we know exactly what needs to be done. Once this is known, the group can move in the right direction. Doing the right thing often isn’t the same as doing the easiest thing. And, when we try to influence others to change their ways for the better, we often end up making them do things they don’t want to do. This is where rewards – when given wisely – can help. If somebody is intrinsically highly motivated to do something, a reward will energize and strengthen that commitment. Even minor rewards can influence people to produce unexpectedly positive results. Take Dr. Stephen Higgins, who helps cocaine addicts. Often, people struggling with addiction drop out of rehabilitation programs too early, and therefore relapse. So, to increase the percentage of people completing these programs, Dr. Higgins gave participants a voucher. These participants were tested for cocaine once per month for three months; if all three tests came back negative, they could exchange the voucher for goods. This simple incentive produced some great results: the voucher was responsible for 90 percent of the recovering addicts finishing the three-month treatment program. Out of those who didn’t receive a voucher, only 65 percent finished the program. It’s important to note, however, that rewards can backfire when misused. To prevent this from happening, you must take some psychological patterns into account when trying to positively influence someone.  It’s natural for people to assume that their behavior is right, no matter how “bad” it is. A reward therefore only assists people if it doesn’t encourage their behavior. A theory known as the overjustification hypothesis describes this phenomenon of rewards exacerbating negative behavior. It states that people often interpret rewards as a reason for perpetuating certain behaviors. For example, the reason an alcoholic may keep drinking might be precisely because they know they’ll be rewarded for quitting. It’s also key to remember that rewards are no substitute for motivation. The person you’re trying to influence may only behave differently because of the reward, which is hardly enough motivation to make lasting change. In daily life, we take our surroundings for granted. But changing them can have a dramatic effect on our behavior. And, of course, the same goes for others and the influence we have on them.Let’s start with space. Space is an influencing tool that functions subtly and without pressure. If we want to influence people without directly catching their attention, one of the best ways is to alter their space. But how?  Distance has a tremendous effect on our psyche, yet it’s easy to overlook once we’ve become accustomed to the structure of our environment. Simple yet powerful characteristics of a room such as its dimensions or the size of the windows exert great influence over us. For example, long distances and large rooms create an atmosphere of power, particularly in places of business. So, if you want to develop a rapport with others, you should opt for smaller spaces. One CEO who wanted to create a closer relationship with his employees failed to realize this. When the authors visited him, they needed to pass through six long hallways and four secretary stations. Not a great way to bond with your employees! Besides dimensions and room features, the quality of the surroundings also shapes behavior. A chaotic environment, for instance, makes us agitated and even angry, even if we’re normally calm. Moreover, the broken windows theory – essentially, that squalor leads to more squalor – tells us that disordered environments can result in antisocial behavior, because disorder signifies an absence of authority. Many customer-service departments have to know all about the connection between environment and mood. For example, to ensure that customers keep calm, service areas are kept clean, with comfortable seats and pleasant artwork decorating the walls. From the moment we wake up to the moment we settle back in for sleep, objects play a central role in our lives. The best influencers know how to harness and shift behavior by using these objects. Much like space, objects are silent influencers that trigger zero resistance. Take the following two examples: Beautiful things make us curious. We want to look at them, touch them and try them out. Therefore, if you want someone to read a book you have written, be sure to give it an eye-catching, attractive cover. We can also harness the power of the freebie by playing to our propensity to strive for equality in social relationships. According to psychologist John Stacey Adam’s equity theory, we’re always trying to pay back offers we receive from other people to re-establish equality. So, start giving away things for nothing to influence others to give something back! The way you present things also affects and has an impact on people's behavior. Packaging has a massive influence over our consumption without our even being aware of it. For example, social scientist Brian Wansink gave moviegoers differently sized popcorn bags. Despite the fact that all participants had the same appetite, those with large bags ate 50 percent more popcorn than those with smaller bags. Making invisible quantities visible also ensures that goods are used in the most efficient way. For example, before the fill to here line became the standard in international shipping containers, they were only filled to capacity about half the time. After the introduction of this simple line, this increased to 95 percent.  Lastly, if you want to guarantee results, you can go further than suggesting behavior by using packaging and objects; you can completely eliminate undesired behavior. This is the most radical method of influencing. Examples of this can be seen in the automatization of customer service, where customer orders at fast food restaurants are taken only by using special buttons. The key message in this book: If you want to have an impact on people and become an expert influencer, you must hone the necessary verbal skills, be able to understand psychological patterns and understand how everyday objects and surroundings shape and control our behavior. Actionable advice: Practice your storytelling. Telling an engaging, convincing story is an art that requires training. It can also make you a powerful influencer. To better your powers of persuasion, try attending a few public events associated with your goal where nobody knows you. After introducing yourself to the attendees, practice telling people about a project you'd like to launch and attempt to convince them to partake in it. The more you practice your story, asking others questions about themselves, and incorporating direct experience, the better you will become at influencing others. Got feedback?

And that’s a shame because it’s an extremely useful tool in our personal and professional lives. Being familiar with our own feelings and being aware of how others see us is crucial to successfully navigating social situations, both at home and at work. These blinks will teach you to recognize damaging thoughts and behaviors in yourself and others. Step by step, you will learn how to deal with your emotions and how to request and receive feedback in order to make positive changes. And it’s not just about individual self-improvement. You’ll realize that self-awareness is a group activity, which will help your entire team work better together. In these blinks, you’ll find out what naming your child Luxx might say about your self-perception; how taking five minutes today can improve your entire day tomorrow; and that if your partner doesn’t pick up on romantic cues now, they probably never will. Self-awareness is one of the more remarkable features that set humans apart from animals. Some 150,000 years ago, the brain of Homo sapiens developed in a way that led our ancestors to begin examining their own behavior, thoughts and emotions. In this way, self-awareness was born. Self-awareness is defined as the ability to know oneself and be conscious of how others see us. Psychologists separate self-awareness into two categories: internal and external. Internal self-awareness is about knowing ourselves; being conscious of our likes and dislikes, our ambitions, our place in the environment and our impact on other people. External self-awareness has to do with understanding how other people see us. It’s about being able to look at ourselves from an outside perspective. Surprisingly, scientific research shows there’s hardly any relationship between internal and external self-awareness. But research has found a relationship between a person’s happiness and how self-aware they are. People who have both internal and external self-awareness are able to make better decisions, have stronger professional and personal relationships, are more successful and more creative. So how do we develop self-awareness? To be fully self-aware requires seven types of insight, the first of which involves insight into our values. Our values are the principles guiding how we live our lives. Examples of these include honesty, humility and fairness. The second and third insights are our passions and aspirations, which are concerned with discovering the things we love doing, and what our life goals are. Fit is the fourth insight. It involves understanding which environment will make us happiest, keep us engaged and enable us to thrive. Then come patterns – the consistent behaviors that make up our personality. We must understand how we think, feel and act in various situations. The sixth insight refers to our reactions – the emotional and physical behaviors we exhibit in certain circumstances. For example, our ability to control our feelings under stress. And the final insight is impact – understanding how our own behavior affects others. It’s not uncommon to encounter the kind of boss who truly believes they’re a visionary leader when everybody else in the office just sees an incompetent jerk. This is because many people are utterly delusional about their own abilities. But how does this come about? The author believes there are three inner roadblocks to self-awareness – knowledge blindness, emotional blindness and behavior blindness. Knowledge blindness occurs when you assess your competencies not on how you actually perform, but on general beliefs about how you should perform. An experiment conducted by American psychologist David Dunning demonstrates this well. Participants were asked to take a geography test. Those who thought they were generally good at geography believed they had scored particularly highly, even though, as a group, their score was average. Emotional blindness is being oblivious to your own feelings. Say somebody asks you how happy you are. You may think your answer is rational, based on an evaluation of your circumstances. But in all likelihood, how you respond will be a gut decision made in that moment. Behavior blindness is the failure to see your own behavior through the eyes of others. The author gives the example of a talk she once delivered. She thought it had been a disaster. However, it turned out that the audience loved it, proven by the fact that she had a record number of sign-ups to her monthly newsletter. And it’s not only these three obstacles that get in the way. The cult of self in our society is another barrier to self-awareness. Have you ever wondered why there’s a growing craze for novel names in America? Names like Izander, Luxx or Sharpay? These are examples of a growing cult of self, where people become convinced that they, and therefore their children, are special. It’s part of the age of esteem that we’re entering, where everybody thinks they’re unique. But be careful. You may feel special, but that doesn’t make you superior. If you behave as if you’re better than everybody else, you’ll soon find yourself the object of other people’s resentment, and you’ll find it challenging to cope with even minor mistakes you make. If we spend enough time and effort navel-gazing, we’ll eventually come to understand ourselves, right? Not necessarily. Yes, examining our thoughts, emotions and habits can lead to greater self-awareness, but the wrong type of introspection can have the opposite effect. In fact, there’s even research that shows self-analyzers have higher levels of anxiety, less positive relationships and a lower opinion of themselves. The problem is that, while we may be quick to grasp at any insights gained from self-analysis, we don’t often question their validity. So, how can we use introspection to become more self-aware? For introspection to be successful, we need to have a flexible mindset. When we accept that we may not find one definite answer, we can let our curious mind wander and explore various perspectives. Another common mistake people make is to ask themselves why they are the way they are. They look for the causes of their thought patterns and behavior. But the human brain is lazy, and often just presents us with the most convenient answer. Therefore, it’s more helpful to ask what kind of person we are. What do we feel and think and do in any given situation? The benefit of asking what rather than why is that we begin to put names to our emotions. Research shows that when we name our feelings – especially the less positive ones – we’re in a better position to recognize them, rather than letting them set off a fight-or-flight response. When it comes to positive thoughts, we should be aware of the risk of over-analyzing. When we try to rationalize our positive experiences, we’re in danger of taking the joy out of them. Lastly, watch out for introspection’s evil twin – rumination. The author defines rumination as a fixation on our anxieties, weaknesses and insecurities. Not only does this prevent us from gaining insight, it could have damaging consequences, including depression. What do you think of when you hear the word “meditation”? If you’re anything like the author, you might feel intimidated by the thought of yoga mats, incense and chanting. But it’s nothing to be scared of – for millennia meditation has helped people increase their self-awareness, and you don’t have to become a monk or make a grand lifestyle change to do it. The author suggests three alternative techniques to increase your mindfulness and, with it, your internal self-awareness. It’s easy to confuse introspection and rumination with mindfulness, but they’re opposites. Rather than analyzing and judging our thoughts, mindfulness encourages you to notice them without judgment. By taking this approach, you’ll begin to make new observations about yourself, and improve your self-awareness. You may even improve your happiness, health and productivity, as many people who practice mindfulness find. The first technique is called reframing. Reframing is all about looking at the bigger picture of your experiences. For example, if you lose your job, you might fixate on what you have lost. To reframe this experience, you would also focus on what you could gain from it. Perhaps you realize that you’d become stuck in a career rut, and that you’re now free to find new opportunities, or even start your own business. Another technique is called comparing and contrasting. It involves noticing how our thoughts, feelings and behaviors have remained the same or changed over time. It’s a mindfulness technique that the author herself has used. Two years into her second job, she began to get restless. When she thought back to how she’d felt two years into her last job, the author realized she felt the same way this time. She was then able to recognize that the problem wasn’t her current job, but an internal pattern that made her feel this way. Why not try this technique yourself? Ask yourself questions about your job and relationships – what has remained the same, and what is different from past jobs or relationships? The third mindfulness technique is the daily check-in. Take five minutes each day to reflect on what went well and what could have been better. Is there anything you can learn from your experience today that you can improve on tomorrow? If you want to know how other people think of you, and gain external self-awareness, you might think it’s as easy as asking friends and family directly. But that’s where the trouble begins – the people closest to you won’t be honest about how they see you. The author calls this the MUM Effect. It means we keep Mum about Undesirable Messages. We tend to remain silent rather than giving others information that will make them feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, we even tell white lies rather than the truth, and this is the first roadblock to self-awareness. The second roadblock is our reluctance to ask for feedback. We tend to make excuses, which fall into three categories. First, we convince ourselves we don’t need feedback. That’s plain incorrect. In fact, how other people see us is just as important when it comes to achieving self-awareness as how we view ourselves. The second excuse we make is that we shouldn’t ask for feedback because surely it’s a sign of weakness. But just think; if somebody asked you for feedback, would you see it as a sign of incompetence in that person, or would you respect their efforts to better themselves? Leaders who ask for critical feedback are seen as more effective. And the final excuse is that we don’t want feedback. We’re afraid of feeling hurt by others’ comments, and for that we need to have courage. It’s easier said than done, but once you’re aware of these barriers and you’re ready to overcome them, there are several ways to do so. One way is to ask for 360-degree feedback. As the name suggests, that means feedback from all angles. In business, this would involve asking everyone from colleagues and managers to clients and board members to fill out a feedback form. One benefit of this technique is anonymity, which allows people to be honest. On the flip side, people who are jealous or resentful may take it as an opportunity to let off steam. To get around this, ask only those who you trust to be fair and truthful. So you finally plucked up the courage to ask your colleagues for feedback. Great! Only, they say you seem over-confident. Your first instinct might be to get snarky with them, or to dismiss or deny what they’ve said, but that’s not helpful. So what is the best way to process feedback? To digest your feedback into something you can use to gain insight, you need to learn how to receive, reflect and respond to comments. This is called the 3R model. Let’s start with receiving feedback. In order to receive feedback successfully, you must first ensure that you’ve understood it correctly. If you’re unsure, ask for clarification. Ask colleagues to explain further what they mean by “over-confident,” with examples if possible. Then you can start to reflect. The following three questions can guide this process of reflection: Can I relate to this feedback? How will this feedback affect me in the long run in terms of my success and my well-being? Should I act on this feedback? You also need to consider how you might act on the feedback. Perhaps you should consult more colleagues before committing to changing your behavior, or you could choose to frame your perceived over-confidence as a strength rather than a weakness. There are two other general points to keep in mind when receiving feedback. First, when you receive harsh feedback that confirms a view you already had of yourself – that you’re a poor team player, or an ineffective leader – it’s tempting to shut down completely. To counter these feelings, try self-affirmation. Before you receive any feedback, remind yourself of your positive qualities. It might be as simple as reminding yourself that you’re a loyal friend and loving family member. Second, you should acknowledge that although it’s worth making the effort to change your behavior, there are some aspects of your personality that you cannot change. Say you’re really bad at reading other people’s emotions and intentions. Particularly if it’s something you’ve already tried to improve but you just can’t seem to do it as well as others, it’s sometimes best to accept it, be open about your weakness, and communicate it clearly so that others will understand. Self-awareness isn’t just a useful quality for an individual to possess – it can exist on a collective level, too. So how can a team of people become self-aware? Just like a self-aware individual, a self-aware team knows itself and knows how others see it. To achieve this, a team must develop five areas of insight, which the author calls the Five Cornerstones of Collective Insight. These cornerstones are objectives, progress, process, assumptions and individual contributions. Any self-aware team must regularly assess how well it’s performing in each area. By asking the right questions and examining issues from all possible angles, the team can become more efficient and effective. What sort of questions might a team ask to gain insight with these five cornerstones? Take objectives. When assessing its objectives, a team must ask itself what its most important goal is. Is it more important to increase sales, or is it more important to focus on the company’s environmental impact, for example? Assessing progress is perhaps the most straight forward. The team might ask “How many units have we sold?” or “How many new clients have we gained?” To evaluate its process, a team should focus on the way it’s currently working, and look for areas of improvement. This could involve questioning how effective the marketing strategy is, or even the format of internal meetings. As you’ve already learned, it’s just as important to be aware of how others see you, and this is no different for teams. That’s where assumptions come in. Assumptions are the judgments made about a brand by outsiders. A self-aware team will take the time to understand how its work is viewed by others, and consider how to build and improve on its image. Finally, a team can gain insight through evaluating individual contributions. This can be done by considering which team members are having the most impact. If you really want to go the extra mile when building your self-aware team, there are three more general areas to consider: role models, psychological safety nets and a culture of evaluation. Any self-aware team needs a role model. This person should be a leader who can communicate their principles clearly and, crucially, act upon those principles. Psychologists have a name for such behavior – authentic leadership. They’ve observed that when leaders are open and genuine about their own performance and how it measures against their own standards, it encourages other members of the team to be honest, too. This allows the entire team to reflect on the five cornerstones of insight truthfully. As well as good leadership, a self-aware team needs a psychological safety net. That means cultivating an atmosphere in which any member of the team feels safe asking for help. A supportive environment also encourages team members to admit failures and raise criticism without fear of negative repercussions. Finally, though following the pillars of insight will help your team gain self-awareness, it’s important to remember this is not a one-off solution. The process of being self-aware should be ongoing, and built into the team’s culture. A great example of this can be seen at computer animation company Pixar. President Ed Catmull introduced a regular “day of honesty” called Notes Day, which encourages employees to think about any issues the company might be facing with complete honesty. You don’t have to look far to find an example of a deluded individual. We’ve all seen the angry, aggressive boss who thinks his approach to leadership is the only way, or the partner completely oblivious to obvious relationship cues. The author calls these people un-self-aware, and how we deal with an un-self-aware person depends on the type of delusion they have. There are three kinds of delusional people – the Lost Cause, the Aware Don’t Care, and the Nudgable. The Lost Causes really hold onto their delusion. They have beliefs that cannot be shaken, and they cannot conceive of any opinion other than their own. As you might have guessed, these people can’t be changed. You can only minimize the negative impact they might have on our own success and happiness by realizing that the problem is theirs, not yours, and be conscious of how you react to their behavior. The Aware Don’t Care is a person who knows exactly how their behavior impacts others, but couldn’t care less. Again, the best way to deal with these people is to manage our own reactions, as any attempt to change such people is doomed to fail. The author has adopted a technique called the laugh track. Her former boss used to make cruel comments toward her. Whenever he did this, rather than cry, she would imagine a laugh track behind his words, which made the experience bearable, and sometimes even amusing. The third delusional person is the Nudgable. Finally, a person we can change – at least in a small way. Nudgables are open to other people’s opinions. The problem is that they’re totally oblivious to what those opinions are. It then falls to you to help the un-self-aware by letting them know how others see them. This enables them – and the team – to become more self-aware and successful at work and at home. The key message in these blinks: Self-awareness is the ability to know our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and understand what others think of us. It’s a vital skill in today’s professional and personal environment, but one that we often lack. This is due to both internal and external societal roadblocks. The good news? The more aware you are of these obstacles, the more easily they can be overcome.  Actionable advice: Rather than a “Meformer,” become an “Informer!” Most of us use social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. And research shows that those who use social media generally fall into one of two categories: “Meformers,” who make up about 80 percent of users and who mostly post information about themselves, and “Informers,” who comprise of about 20 percent of users, and who post information that isn’t immediately related to themselves. The issue is, if we always only post about ourselves, we aren’t engaging and connecting with others. So if you’re one of the 80 percent, try to suppress a little vanity and become an Informer. Move from self-absorption to self-awareness by posting less about yourself and more about the world around you. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Most likely yes, you jump to it. What about an air steward who tells you to switch off your cellphone just before takeoff – do you? Yes, of course. In both cases you obey their commands.  And society expects you to. In order to facilitate its smooth running, we are encouraged to do what people, especially those in positions of authority, tell us. But should we? These blinks show you that, whatever society might suggest, it is often necessary or even right to disobey an order, especially when that order could lead to harm and disaster. By understanding the right conditions for disobedience, we can make the world a better place. In these blinks you’ll discover why you shouldn’t take medical instructions from the hospital janitor; why Intelligent Disobedience can help stop plane crashes; and why you should teach your children to question rather than obey. Would you consider yourself to be an obedient person? Most people will say: “No! I make decisions for myself.” But imagine that you’re working in a nuclear plant, and your boss hurriedly tells you to shut off the reactor. Would you do it? Most likely you would, without any hesitation.  But why would we be so quick to follow orders in this particular case? Well, certain situations require obedience, while others don’t. For a system to demand your obedience, it must meet particular conditions.  First, systems that require obedience should have rules and orders which are “reasonably fair,” meaning both that the system is based on moral principles and that it can function properly. In contrast, systems whose rules are arbitrary or lead to negative outcomes (such as the suffering of others) should not be obeyed. Second, the person who gives the orders must hold their position of authority over others legitimately, and act competently. For example, a senior doctor who gives a junior colleague an instruction during a brain operation has both competence and legitimate authority. If the junior doctor ignores her expertise, the consequences could be severe. But if the hospital janitor gives the junior doctor instructions on brain surgery (or if a senior doctor gave the janitor instructions on how to best clean the floors), then their orders aren’t based on competency or legitimate authority. Finally, the order should be constructive. If obeying an order would cause more harm than good, then it shouldn’t be followed. Complying with immoral orders is wrong, and the person acting upon them can be held responsible for any harm caused by their actions. For example, those who carried out Nazi war crimes tried to hide behind the fact they were “just following orders.” This plea was ignored, and many were convicted for their terrible deeds. Obedience to laws, orders and regulations is a cornerstone of our society. We are expected to stop at red lights, pay taxes and keep the music down at 2 a.m., and normally we adhere to these rules.  However, as the last blink showed, there are situations in which obedience is dangerous, or even immoral.  While most cultures operate under the assumption that obedience is good and disobedience is bad, there are plenty of occasions when this kind of binary thinking is insufficient.  Imagine, for example, that a nurse receives an order from a doctor to give a drug to a cardiac patient, but the nurse knows that the drug will cause the patient to die. The nurse informs the doctor about his concerns, but the doctor stubbornly insists. Is the nurse obligated to administer the drug anyway?  Of course not. It would kill the patient! This sensible refusal to comply with an instruction is called Intelligent Disobedience. But the nature of our social organization causes many of us not to exercise this right. Instead, most people find it simpler to obey bad orders than to face the wrath of an authority figure.  In practical terms, it’s often better to comply with a bad order, as saying “no” could cause us to lose our job altogether.  For example, if you’re a marketing director and the CEO orders you to increase all product prices by 25 percent, you’re likely to comply even though you know that this move will hurt the relationships with existing customers and cost the firm loads of money. But saying no could mean losing projects or, even worse, your job! Saying yes to this terrible idea is simply easier – in the short term, at least. It’s times like these when Intelligent Disobedience shines. Our remaining blinks will reveal how. So far, we’ve established that people not only have the right but also the obligation to disagree with and refuse bad orders. But how do you know which orders are ill-thought but harmless and which are genuinely harmful? If you want to know whether applying Intelligent Disobedience is justified, ask yourself: Does the order come from a legitimate source? Or is the legitimate source missing important information that is relevant to the rule or order? Think back to the janitor and the junior doctor. Did the janitor have legitimate authority in matters concerning brain surgery? Is the aim of the order itself wrong? Or if the goal is just, will the order actually achieve that goal? If, for instance, your friend tells you that you should turn off your TV to make it stop raining, you can safely apply Intelligent Disobedience.  Finally, will the order have severe moral consequences? Is it likely to cause serious harm? For instance, if the employee of a fumigator firm is ordered to fumigate an inhabited house, she should probably say no. That’s dangerous! As you can see, Intelligent Disobedience is very narrow, and is not the same as civil disobedience. Civil disobedience involves the intentional disruption of the system as a whole and aims to incite similar acts of disobedience. Intelligent Disobedience challenges only the particular order in question. However, in cases of truly unfair systems, civil disobedience may actually constitute Intelligent Disobedience.  For example, in pre-civil rights America, when it was against the law for some doctors to treat black patients, those who ignored the order were committing civil disobedience that was also Intelligent Disobedience. Have you ever worked at a job where the manager took any attempt at constructive criticism as a personal attack? This type of leader, as well as being a nightmare to work with, dissuades Intelligent Disobedience. Teams with no opportunity to disagree intelligently are very unhealthy. Intelligent Disobedience helps the team as a whole perform to the best of their ability. Consider the nurse who refused the doctor’s orders to give a potentially harmful drug to a patient. If he hadn’t refused or at least questioned the order, there is a chance that the patient would have died, and it is the doctor who would have been held responsible for medical malpractice.  But in order for Intelligent Disobedience to work in a way that means the whole team benefits, it must be communicated in a constructive way. The authority figure has to understand why you’re disobeying and trust that you are acting in everyone’s best interests. If you can’t get this across, then you’ll only breed distrust, which weakens the team. In order to keep your relationship with your leader healthy, you need to effectively communicate why you are questioning or disobeying the order that you have been given. You may be completely right: writing a sales report the week before Christmas (when the company makes half of its annual sales) may make no sense.  But if you don’t communicate that to your superiors, and instead ignore or simply “forget” the order, then they will not understand why you disobeyed them, and may instead simply think of you as disloyal or rude. If you have to apply Intelligent Disobedience, always make it clear that you won’t be carrying out the order and explain the reasons why. It’s the only way your superiors will understand that something is amiss. Now that you know why you should apply Intelligent Disobedience, it’s important to be familiar with the different strategies available to you. But before you start, you should build up your situational awareness so that you know when to be intelligently disobedient. The more you know about your situation and your surroundings, the better you can assess whether the order you have been given is worthy of being followed – or not. To illustrate this, imagine that a soldier has been ordered to fire on a specific target. However, because of his keen awareness of his situation, he knows that the “enemy” is in fact one of his fellow soldiers! Naturally, he applies Intelligent Disobedience and disobeys the order.  If he hadn’t been paying attention to the world around him, then he could have committed a terrible mistake! But what if you’ve been given a bad order? How should you make your intention of intelligently disobeying known? There are two ways of communicating this to your superior. If the situation isn’t urgent, then you should use mitigating language, which is “soft” or “mild,” when communicating your disobedience. This communication style is helpful in managing social and professional relations. For example, if your spouse is driving and you’re pretty sure they’re going the wrong way, you don’t want to just grab the wheel to correct them. Instead, you could ask “Are you sure this is the right way?” This gentle, non-challenging question is perfect for correcting small mistakes.  Assertive language, on the other hand, is useful when the situation is potentially or immediately harmful. In these cases, you have to be much more clear and take decisive action to avert disaster. If a plane is about to leave the runway, for example, any safety concerns that the first officer has must be expressed assertively and immediately, in a way that demands action. One pre-flight mistake could spell disaster for hundreds of people. Learning to obey authority and social norms is a crucial part of children’s education. However, children should also be aware that there are some situations in which the rules shouldn’t be followed.  Unfortunately, the institutions where children spend a lot of their time (like church and school) require strict obedience and deference to authority figures. But if children only learn to obey, then the consequences can be drastic. We can see this in a 2004 abuse case surrounding an 18-year-old McDonald’s employee named Louise Ogborn. Her assistant manager received a phone call from someone claiming to be a police officer, who made allegations that Louise has stolen a purse. Under this pretence, Louise was submitted to all kinds of abuse, such as being shut in a storage room naked and ultimately being sexually assaulted by the assistant manager’s husband, who was issued instructions by the “police officer.”  The actions of the assistant manager and her husband show the dangers of not questioning orders critically. Why would a police officer ask someone to look after, and interrogate a suspect themselves? Why did the husband simply follow the dreadful instructions from someone on the other end of a phone?  Society will be much better off when people are able to think critically and enact Intelligent Disobedience when presented with orders that are harmful or make no sense. This has to be taught at an early age. Asking children questions like “Why do you think I’m telling you to do that?” or “Can you think of another way for us to do X?” will replace subjection with understanding. Guide dogs are a good way to think about this. Guide dogs have to follow orders from their owners, unless they know the order would put them both in danger. If the human tells the dog to go forward when there’s a bottomless sinkhole right in front of him, the dog won’t budge. Kids too need to know when to follow, and when to push back. The key message in this book: While we have been socially programed to respect authority and follow orders, not all orders should be obeyed. Sometimes you have to apply Intelligent Disobedience in order to help leaders stay consistent with everyone’s goals and values.

You could think of him as a modern day, English version of Mad Men’s Don Draper. Through working with some of the world’s biggest companies, Arden learned not only how to pitch an idea to a potential client. He also learned how anyone can make a splash with their big ideas. So, if you’ve ever had a brilliant product or service that you wanted to bring to life, you’ll want to find out what Paul Arden has to say and learn from one of the best in the business. In these blinks, you’ll discover how a laundry detergent inspired one of the Spice Girls; which Fat Bastard set a good example to follow; and why being trendy isn’t always a plus. Everyone wants to be good at what they do. But what does “being good” mean to you? Do you want to be the best in your workplace? The best in your community? Or perhaps the best in the world? Many believe that the most successful people in the world are also the most talented, but that’s only one piece of the pie. Sure, talent is important. But talent on its own will only get you so far. If you want to reach the level of world-class greatness, you’ll need to combine talent with another key factor – ambition. Think of your friends and classmates growing up. Did the smartest or most talented students end up being the most successful? When someone has smarts, but no ambition, they'll usually get by on whatever past accomplishments they may have. The brightest stars, on the other hand, are the ones who combine their know-how with ambition and a vision for the future. The truth is, lots of people are smart and talented, but there’s no replacing real ambition and persistence in planning for your future. And this involves setting goals that may not seem achievable today. In other words, the secret to reaching great heights is to ignore your current limitations and set goals above and beyond what you think you’re capable of. Keep in mind that you can always continue learning and adding to your skillset. You may not think you’re capable of running your own business, for example, but don’t let that stop you from making it your goal. Just because you’re ill-prepared for something today, it doesn’t mean you won’t be ready tomorrow. Even if your goal isn’t entirely logical, it can be a perfect source of ambition, inspiration and motivation. When former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham was a teenager, she told herself, “I want to be as famous as Persil Automatic.” Persil Automatic is one of the most popular brands of detergent in England, so Beckham wasn’t even thinking in terms of singers or even human beings. She wanted to become a household name, and that’s just what she did. And so can you, if you set the right goals and have the ambition to see them through. Once you decide how good you want to be and create a goal for yourself, you are essentially creating a vision of yourself in the future. All you need to do then is lay the foundation that will take you from vision to reality. Three traits make up this foundation. The first is accountability; which means holding yourself to only the highest of standards. One of the best ways to do this is to set up a system of feedback from honest and trustworthy colleagues. It’s easy to ask a coworker for their opinion on some work you’ve done, but when you put someone on the spot like that, you’re likely to get a polite and positive response. So it’s up to you to make sure the feedback you receive is honest, genuine and offers constructive criticism. Instead of asking for an opinion, ask them, “What would you improve?” Or, “If you had to pick one problem with this proposal, what would it be?” By taking accountability, you’ll be putting yourself in a position to recognize your weaknesses and shortcomings, which is the first step to self-improvement. The second foundational trait is to be open and share your ideas. Many of us have the unfortunate tendency to be overprotective of our ideas, for fear that someone, even a coworker, might steal or take credit for it. But the trouble with being so closed off is that when you hoard your ideas, you tend to stop coming up with new ones. Over time your collection of old ideas will become stale, outdated and irrelevant. Instead, be open with your ideas, and don’t waste time with concerns about ownership. Once you let go of an idea, it frees up your mind to move on to the next one. The more ideas you put out into the world, the more you’re likely to get in return. The third and final trait is to always focus on the positive. This pertains to your work as well as your life by always highlighting the most positive aspects of your product or idea. Much like how caricaturists make drawings that exaggerate someone’s facial features, you should do the same with the positive aspects of whatever it is you’re promoting. Even if you’re  stretching the truth, you’ll be effectively communicating its selling point. If a car gets good gas mileage, for example, suggest that someone could drive it around the world on one tank of gas! When talking about his experiments, Thomas Edison claimed he’d never failed; he’d simply discovered thousands of ideas that didn’t work. This positive perspective underlines the importance of persevering through the ideas that don’t pan out so that you can land on the ones that do. In fact, you could say that if you’re not making mistakes, then you’re probably not making much of anything. Edison uncovered clues and gained insights from his failed experiments. Many of which illuminated the path to something completely revolutionary; a final working light bulb. So, don’t feel like you need to be right all the time. You’ll only end up being inflexible, unoriginal and uncreative. It’s normal to want to be right, since it’s safe from potentially negative judgment or criticism. But letting go of the desire to be right all the time opens up a world of possibility before you – one where you have the freedom to be a creative and flexible risk-taker. You’ll find that risk-takers are also often well-rewarded. If you’ve tried letting go of the need to be right but still find yourself restrained by anxious mental blocks, you can try to reduce your inhibitions by being playful and embracing silly, illogical ideas. When searching for the solution to a problem, try doing the opposite of what your intuition tells you. Don’t just think “outside the box” – think outside the office! Going for a walk and using what catches your eye could inspire a potential solution. A bird in a tree, a duck in a pond or a dog on a leash might be just the thing to spark your imagination. Defy logic, liberate yourself and gain attention by also embracing silly or unusual names. When browsing the shelves looking for a bottle of wine, you wouldn’t expect to see one labeled “Fat Bastard Chardonnay,” would you? But that’s a big reason why this brand with the silly name has achieved international attention and has become a smash success. You don’t have to be a movie expert to know the name Citizen Kane. This movie is often regarded as one of the best and most influential films of all time. But what you may not know is that Citizen Kane was only brought into existence through the sheer determination of its creator, Orson Welles. Getting this movie made is a perfect example of how powerful one individual’s determination can be, and how important it is not to take no for an answer. When Welles was first pitching his script to investors, no one was interested. But he was scrappy and ambitious, taking matters into his own hands by getting together just enough resources to film a few scenes. Soon enough, Welles had a strong visual sample to present, rather than just words on a page. Investors quickly jumped on board, and Welles had the money he needed to finish his movie. The author, Paul Arden, has used this strategy of determination in his own career. He was once among five advertising agencies pitching for a government contract. After months of hard work and preparation, one Wednesday evening he got the call that he was out of the running. But Arden wasn’t quite ready to give up. Instead, he called the potential client to say that before they make a final decision, they should take a look at a second campaign he had prepared. Of course, Arden didn’t actually have a second campaign, and his team spent all of Wednesday night creating it so they would have something to show the next morning. Arden’s hustle paid off, and they got that contract. But pitching is about more than just dogged determination. It’s also important to understand the underlying motivations of your target audience. No matter what, there’s a simple relationship between every ad agency and their client: the agency wants to show off how creative they can be, while the client wants to show off their brand. Knowing this, any agency should start their pitch by creating layouts and potential ad campaigns for clients. As long as you highlight the logo and show off the brand, the client will be at ease. They’ll know you can deliver the goods. At that point, you’ll be able to pitch the client more creative ideas. Advertisers love to be creative. There are few things that excite and boost the morale of an ad agency more than receiving a request for a creative pitch. A creative pitch is when a potential client challenges an agency to show how creative they are. It’s a great opportunity for an ad agency to show how innovative and creative they can be. But tread carefully: when working on a new pitch, no matter how creative you want to be, don’t forget that visual layout is just as important as idea generation. Indeed, both of these elements are of equal importance to a good pitch and should be treated as such. The first key to a perfect visual layout is to make sure it is engaging. A high-quality visual layout should project the image of the brand well enough that a customer is able to see the ad from a great distance and recognize it without needing to read the name. Another smart tip is to leave the rough draft of the layout genuinely rough when presenting it to the client. If the layout is too polished in the early stages, it will give the impression that you’ve no room left for collaboration, or for them to be part of the idea generation process. You’ll find more success when you make your client feel like there’s still room to work together on the creative side of things. To avoid boring layouts and help spark creativity, try experimenting with different tools: instead of using the same black felt-tip marker, for example, try using paint brushes, charcoal pencils or a fountain pen. Once, when Arden’s team used watercolors on a layout, the client was so impressed that they increased the team’s budget from £150,000 to £200,000. If you’re truly aiming for greatness, you’ll also have to be original. The stark reality of the advertising world is that most people read the same books and pay little attention to what’s going on outside their field. As a result, the author believes around 90 percent of advertising is inspired by previous ads. This means there’s a wealth of opportunity to be original by looking beyond the advertising world and finding inspiration in unexpected places. Being original also means avoiding current trends, which are created through a group consensus based on what’s fashionable at the moment. Originality, on the other hand, hasn’t received this sort of approval and therefore can never be considered “trendy.” We’ve mentioned creativity a lot in the previous blinks, since the advertising world is obsessed with it! But how you define creativity may be different to someone else’s definition. That’s why it’s always a good idea to understand precisely what creativity means to your client. One client could think that being creative means making an ad that’s only slightly different to their competitors. Another client may want the kind of creativity that makes a minimal adjustment to the same campaign they’ve been running for years on end. The one similarity that most clients have is that they rarely want something that’s so creative they’ve never seen anything like it before. When you’re pitching ideas to a client, it’s wise to remember that clients interpret creativity differently. They won’t necessarily pick the most creative pitch. Sometimes, clients have to decide from a pool of up to 200 ideas, so keep in mind that their attention is going to be quite divided. On top of that, there’s probably more than one person on the client’s side, each with their own idea of creativity. But there are effective ways of cutting through all of this to really grab a client’s attention. Slogans are a great way to put a smile on the client’s face and make them feel warm and fuzzy about the company they work for. This is what happened when Toyota first heard the slogan, “The car in front is a Toyota.” A strong slogan like this can be even more effective and attention-grabbing by repeating it throughout the pitch with little variations, like, “The car in front costs (X amount of) dollars.” Winning pitches also tend to highlight the company logo every step of the way, as this is always appreciated by the client. The last tip is to make sure your business is making adequate financial room for creativity. Keep this in mind if you’re a junior or a senior account manager. Always promote the importance of the creative team to ensure they receive an adequate budget that allows them to do their best possible work. For example, you could suggest that 95 percent of the budget goes toward serving the client, while 5 percent goes toward getting new supplies for the creative team. This kind of gesture is sure to make the team feel respected and motivated while helping them reach their creative potential. The key message in these blinks: We’re all capable of reaching higher levels of success than we are aware of. But we have to deliberately decide how much success we wish to have and set goals accordingly. Achieving our desired level of success also requires embracing failure, being accountable for the outcome of everything we do or are involved in, and being willing to do whatever it takes.  Actionable advice: Paint a Picture with Your Words  People are not good at remembering words. They are much better at remembering visuals. When speaking – whether it’s a formal presentation or an informal pitch during a conversation – you’ll want to paint a picture in your audience's mind. That way, your idea will become even more visual, concrete and memorable. Got feedback?  We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

No employer in their right mind would employ someone without a college degree – someone like that must be an idiot! If you think like this, you might be in line for a shock. Employers in many of the fastest growing industries in the United States aren’t looking for college graduates. What they are looking for are the specific skills needed for specific roles, and for people with good experience. For them, a college degree is worse than useless. So what should you do instead? These blinks show you the alternatives to college that don’t cost the Earth and which give you the skills you need to find the job you want. In these blinks you’ll discover why you don’t even need to leave your home to get an education; and why student debt could bring down the US economy. Have you got kids? If you do, it’s a fair bet that once they’ve finished high school, you’d like them to go to college. A college degree will give them the best chance of a good job with a high salary, and that’s a fact. Or is it? You might be surprised to hear that every day, jobs are created that do not require a college education. In fact, according to a forecast by the Labour Department of the United States, a mere 27 percent of new jobs that will be generated from 2014 to 2024 require college education. Moreover, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that of the 20 occupations expected to create the most new jobs from 2012 to 2022, only one of these – general and operations management – requires a bachelor’s degree. So if we continue to force the norm of college education upon our children, they may later find themselves fighting for jobs where their degree is no longer relevant. And it’s not just graduates in a decade’s time who’ll find themselves unemployed – the problems have already begun. The jobless rate for college graduates under the age of 25 was 8.2 percent  in 2013 compared to 5.4 percent in 2007. So if a college education can no longer secure a job, what can? There are two keys to finding a job today: technical skills and work experience. Rapidly growing industries, such as the tech world, require you to have both the technical know-how and, where possible, real world experience. Most college degrees can give you neither. In this way, workers who did not go to traditional colleges to study are increasingly better off than those that did. For example, in Florida and Virginia, graduates with technical or occupational associate degrees currently outearn the state’s bachelor’s degree recipients by almost $2,500 per year. So statistics show loud and clear that a college degree may not benefit you as an individual. But did you know that they are harming society too? Read on to the next blink to find out why. With such a rapidly changing workforce, our society’s “college for everybody” mentality is not only misleading for many graduates seeking employment – this mind-set will also damage society as a whole. But how? Because we promote a college degree above all else, there has been a marked decrease in vocational and technical courses. For example, faced with a budget deficit in 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School System slated nearly all its shop classes for elimination by the year’s end. That’s around 600,000 students being denied vocational training. Though such a decision might save money in the short term, it will nevertheless create complex problems for our future, as jobs requiring technical skills find fewer and fewer potential employees to fill them. In fact, the increasingly unproductive workforce we’ll be left with will cost society far more. Another alarming cost on the horizon is our skyrocketing student debt. Today, most students attending college will take out a student loan and hope they’ll be able to pay it back once they’re earning higher wages. However, these higher wages are far from guaranteed. In fact, it’s highly unlikely that many students will be able to pay off their loans. This has huge consequences, not just for the students, but for our economy. At the beginning of 2014, US student loan debt already exceeded $1 trillion and was rising. That put it well above the total US credit card debt, making student loans the largest category of unsecured credit. If a whole generation of students are unable to pay off these loans, we would see an economic crisis worse than the subprime mortgage collapse that lead to the 2008 financial crisis. Today, life after high school looks somewhat like a minefield. If college is not the best route for young individuals, or the society they live in, what is? Read on to explore the alternatives in the following blinks. Want to get an education that’s proven practical for thousands of years? Consider an apprenticeship. Back in the classical world, youngsters would learn their trade on the job alongside experts. Yet, as “college for everybody” took over, apprenticeships took a back seat. However, the benefits of apprenticeship are plenty, and with our increasingly precarious world of work, it might be time to bring the apprentice back to the fore. First, have a guess which group yields more dropouts: apprentices or college students? If you thought college students were less likely to quit, you’re mistaken! The professional relationship between apprentice and mentor is incredibly personal, challenging and inspiring. Apprentices find themselves engaged in a constant back-and-forth exchange that involves solving problems and receiving feedback from the mentor. And, if an apprentice ever feels lost or unable to handle the workload, they’ll always have someone to talk to. Compare this situation to a college student going it alone with no one to turn to in a crisis, and it’s clear why an apprentice has a better shot of completing their education! It’s not just high school leavers that can benefit from an apprenticeship. Countries which encourage young people to take apprenticeships are significantly more productive than countries where college is promoted blindly. When Britain’s former prime minister Tony Blair asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel why her country’s economy was so strong, her answer was short and simple: “We still make things.” And behind this confident answer? Apprenticeships.   Germany’s apprenticeships and wider vocational programs provide employees suited to the actual workforces. It’s no surprise that three out of every four German secondary school students complete apprenticeships. As a result, youth unemployment in Germany was 7.7 percent in 2014, compared to 14.4 percent in the United States and an even higher 19.7 percent in the United Kingdom. Wouldn’t it be great to get a huge slice of the teaching you get from a college degree, but for a fraction of price plus a better chance of finding a job? Nope, it’s not just a fantasy – it’s a very real thing called an associate degree! Associate degrees are two year courses, usually taken at a community or a technical college, that combine elements of traditional academic learning with specific professional skills, such as those required by an engineer, lab technician or midwife. So why do an associate degree? First of all, it’s cost-effective. According to research by the College Board, the cost of a two-year associate degree in the United States averages about $6,300. But tuition and fees for four-year bachelor’s degree programs at in-state public institutions cost about $34,000 and an unbelievable $116,000 at private institutions! Associate degrees aren’t just good for your wallet – they’re also good for your future. Research shows that many associate degree holders enjoy better employment prospects than their collegiate counterparts, and a full one-third of them start their careers at higher pay levels. This is because associate degrees are offered in a wide range of skill areas, including aviation, computer technology, biomedical design, paralegal design and dozens more. Associate degree graduates with vocational skills in a specific area are far more attractive to employers, compared to college degree graduates with more abstract skills and purely academic abilities. So if you want a better job and less debt, an associate degree is a smart option. However, they do require you to study full time. If you’re looking for a part-time option, you’re in luck, as the following blink outlines an alternative path. If associate degrees sound like a great option to you, but you’re unable to complete one because of work commitments, don’t despair! There is a way of studying for a degree without giving up your job, and there’s even a charming acronym for it – meet the MOOC. MOOCs, or massive open online courses, offer you a broad range of study paths ranging from theory to technical skills and hands-on subjects. Wait, hands-on subjects? Can you really teach that online? You sure can! One of the most popular skills-based subjects is a course called “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.” It’s a powerful example of how even the most hands-on skills can be taught virtually. After all, what could be more tangible than the smells and tastes of food? A MOOC does more than give you a great range of study options – these degrees democratize the entire system of elite education. Think about it: An incredibly expensive college degree seems “worth it” because of the prestige that comes from studying at a particular university. But with MOOCs, this myth is shattered. The quality of teaching is superb, it’s free and you don’t even have to leave your own home. Through MOOCs, a great education is available to all, no matter your financial position. And if you’re still not convinced that you should swap your college dream for a MOOC, just think of the flexibility. As a MOOC student and employee at your job, you can undertake your studies at any place,  any time. And, you’re able to learn any course you want, regardless of your academic background. In this way, MOOCs can even help employees to skill up in a different profession in order to change their current vocations without having to leave their job first. The key message in this book: Despite what you’ve heard, college is not for everyone. This attitude will not only disadvantage you, but the broader workforce. However, high unemployment, underemployment and drop-out rates can be solved by exploring many paths to a fulfilling and successful work life that will take you further than a college degree ever could.  Actionable advice: Decide for yourself!  So it’s time for you to decide what you want to do with your life and all you hear from your friends, family and the media is college, college, college? Take a step back to consider what you want. If you’re not sure about college, take a look at your options – you’ve got lots of them! Then decide what’s best for you.

Yet, despite these wishes, time is something of which we never seem to have enough. This is where these blinks come in. They show you how you can find time in your schedule and space in your brain to spend most of your time doing what you want to do. Based on three central aims – Optimize, Automate and Outsource – they inform you how to unleash waves of efficiency in everything you do, from organizing your finances to maintaining your health. In these blinks, you’ll discover why you’ll never have to personally book a table in a restaurant ever again; why running errands is a thing of the past; and how to turn your smartphone into a portable bank manager. Maybe you’ve heard of the 80-20 rule? It states that 80 percent of what you accomplish is the result of a mere 20 percent of all the time and energy you invest. And this isn’t only applicable to work or study. It’s the case for everything you do. So how can we figure out what time isn’t worth spending? One way is to start tracking. But who’s got time to live their busy schedule and observe it? Luckily, there are resources out there to make tracking your time much easier. Enter RescueTime, a program that monitors what you’re actually doing on your computer all day. If you find that a particular website or application is stealing your day away, RescueTime will help you block access to it. Problem solved! But what if it’s not just your productivity you want to track, but your health? Take it back to basics with an old-school paper journal to record everything you eat during the day. You could also get your hands on a pedometer to count all the steps you take, or simply make an effort to weigh yourself each day. Because the more you know about your day, the sooner you’ll be able to improve it. But what does it mean to improve something as broad as our daily routine? Think of it as optimizing your processes. For a role model, look to IKEA. Each IKEA product comes with highly optimized instruction manuals for assembling each product, whether it’s a coffee table or geometric lamp. These instructions have been boiled down to their very essence – a few language-independent, easy-to-follow steps. It’s time to approach your life like IKEA approaches their manuals. Whatever the task, whether it’s writing emails or organizing meetings, you should minimize fuss and get it done in as few steps as possible. We all like to think of ourselves as great multi-taskers with brilliant memories. But often we don’t actually have enough room to juggle everything in our minds. Life would be so much simpler if we just had an extra brain. Well, guess what? You can have one! Several new tools have emerged to help us remember all those dates and details. Evernote, for example, is an app for taking notes of all kinds: textual or pictorial, hand-drawn or web-based. It’s also free and has no storage limit. The author himself has about 1800 notes in his Evernote at the moment! You can consider Evernote simply as a backup of your brain. Neuroscientists have even shown that Evernote organizes information in a very similar way to the human brain, linking similar thoughts together into complex, interconnected networks. But what if you know how to organize but want to spend less time organizing? Say hello to your very own virtual assistant. Today, you can hire a person or several people and delegate tasks to them online. Additionally, there are two kinds of virtual assistants: on demand and dedicated. An on-demand assistant service consists of a pool of assistants. Say you’ve got a task that needs doing, like proofreading a document or improving a PowerPoint presentation. Whoever’s available in the pool will do it. For $25 a month, Fancy Hands allows you to get assistance with as many as five tasks. For $95, you can request assistance with an unlimited amount of tasks per month. Dedicated assistants, on the other hand, will do all your tasks personally. This means there’s a closer relationship; they’ll get to know you and eventually take on more difficult tasks. For $197 a month, Zirtual gives you a dedicated assistant for ten hours every month.   Say you’ve got a great idea for the perfect bedroom shelving unit to suit your needs. You know you’ll have to build it yourself, which means buying the materials, borrowing tools and spending hours preparing and cleaning up. But if only there were an easier and less expensive way! Well, there is: 3D printing. 3D printing offers a world of possibilities for creating your own customized products. Take Shapeways, a site where you simply upload a 3D model, and they print it for you. The author, for example, wanted to create a custom bracket to mount his new MacMini to the wall. He made a simple sketch of his idea and used the online outsourcing platform Fiverr to find someone who could make a complete 3D model of it. He then sent this model to Shapeways and, a week later, the completed bracket was waiting for him in his mailbox. If that sounds like a success to you, then get this: the author then used the Shapeways ecommerce platform to sell his MacMini bracket, and made $400 by selling six of them. Customization won’t just save and earn you money, however. It will also give you more free time. Consider Vitamins on Demand, a service that collects all the medications and supplements you require and then organizes them into separate packs for each day. Say goodbye to loading up your holiday suitcase with all your pill bottles while worrying whether you’ve got them all. Instead, just grab the number of packs you need and head out the door! Want another example? Think about the arduous task of finding a suit that fits. If you want to cut that time in half, sign up to Indochino. This company produces tailored suits and will guide you through your measuring process, ensuring you’ve got measurements you can use again and again for a suit that fits just right. When Tim Ferriss published The 4-Hour Workweek, there was obviously some exaggeration involved – you simply can’t get a book written if you only work four hours each week! Nevertheless, the book made an important point: you need to make your workweek yours, and decide what to do, and when. So what’s the first step? Begin by determining which hours of the day are your best working hours. This will automatically make you more effective. Some people prefer working in the night; others, in the morning. Some like working a bit every day, while others like to squeeze a lot into shorter periods of time. Everybody works differently, so figure out what works best for you! It’s also vital to figure out what is slowing you down. Often it’s external factors – a supplier that’s always late, or those indecisive clients. The solution? Make the window for interaction with your clients smaller. This won’t only make your own day more effective, but force your clients to be more efficient, too. They can thank you for it later! And there’s also another part of your workday that’s sapping your time: the scheduling of meetings. Did you know that, on average, the normal procedure for organizing a meeting requires an exchange of seven emails? Luckily, applications such as ScheduleOnce will, as the name suggests, help you get that meeting scheduled the first time around. The app allows you to make your calendar public, so that you and your colleagues can find meeting times that work for all involved parties. If you had a clear conception of how much time you spend running errands each month, you’d be shocked. But come on, a dash to the corner store for toilet paper or dish soap? No big deal, right? Well, the fact is, these errands add up. If you want more productivity, you’ve got to kill those errands! But how to get started? One great way is by signing up for an online delivery service. Amazon’s Subscribe & Save, for instance, delivers necessities like toilet paper, razors, shampoo and laundry detergent to your door at certain intervals. Perhaps you go through two tubes of toothpaste every month; so arrange to have those two tubes delivered to you at the end of each month and never waste time buying toothpaste again. Though toilet paper is an obvious necessity, there are plenty of other important items that you can have delivered. For instance, by arranging via Subscribe & Save for an order of nine-volt batteries to arrive every six months, the author ensures that his smoke detectors always work. There are some errands that you can’t automate, however. You know, those ones that catch you by surprise, forcing you to rush out and do them before it’s too late. Well, thanks to outsourcing, you don’t have to waste time on these, either. TaskRabbit is a great example of an online outsourcing marketplace for those small, unforeseeable tasks – a quick run for groceries, for instance, or a sprint to get your computer or car fixed. Here’s how the author put this service to use: His nephew, who lives in Los Angeles, wanted a slide for his second birthday. The author, who lives in New York, used TaskRabbit to contract a person in Los Angeles to purchase the slide at an IKEA in Long Beach, take it to his nephew’s parents’ house and assemble it. A truly unforgettable gift – all for $47. In the first blink, we learned about the value of tracking things like your time and dietary habits. However, it’s not always beneficial to spend loads of time tracking everything. Trying to track your finances, for example, often results in strain and stress. Keeping tabs on what and where you spend is a challenge, especially when you have several bank accounts and credit cards, not to mention things like loans, mortgages and stocks and bonds. So why not take advantage of some new tools and cut the time spent agonizing over your budget? Mint.com is a great tool for organizing your finances and keeping track of your financial health. Just provide Mint.com with your details and logins for bank accounts, loans and credit cards, and they’ll let you know via email when a balance is dipping toward the red, or if there’s been a big deposit or withdrawal from an account, as well as making sure that you’re getting paid. Mint.com can also provide a categorized and comprehensive overview of your financing that allows you to see how you spend your money and time. Mint.com can even use your previous spending patterns to suggest budgets for you! Another innovative new tool to help you stop stressing and start saving is BillShrink. BillShrink simply asks for a few personal details: your checking account information, your driving habits, how often you use your cellphone and how much you spend on other services, such as movie streaming and magazine subscriptions. Based on this information, Billshrink outlines cost-effective alternatives and outlines how much these alternatives would help you save over a two-year period; they also alert you to new deals and offers. But don’t be shocked if you find you could be saving more than you realized: when the author used BillShrink for the first time, he realized he could save around $14,000 in two years! We’ve all been there: a desk seething with piles of paper; a floor only traversable via a narrow path through a chaos of stuff. And surrounded by all that stuff, you can never find exactly what you need when you need it. But there’s no need for this headache! You can overcome it simply by setting limits for yourself. Start off by setting an upper limit. This will help you locate and keep track of your possessions. Take the author’s electronic gear stash, which once occupied an entire closet. Over time, though, the closet became overcrowded, and finding a specific cable meant dragging the whole mess out of the closet and onto the floor. The author realized things had gotten out of hand, and decided to take action. So he bid his electronics goodbye and sold off most of his gear on Ebay. What was left fit into one box, which became the upper limit. If he buys a new piece of electronic gear, some other piece has got to go. This way, his stash is manageable, tidy and he can always find what he needs. Just as you can use upper limits to control things that you might be overindulging in (like perusing Facebook, perhaps), you can also make sure you’re doing more of the things that lift your quality of life, such as exercising, meditating and traveling. How? By setting lower limits. The author, for example, has set a lower limit of at least one trip every month, at least 30 miles of running per week and cooking meals at home at least three days a week. By setting lower limits for your leisure time in this way, you’ll make sure your time doesn’t always get gobbled up by work. Have you ever had the frustrating experience of just getting into something – and then being interrupted by a distracting text or email? It ruins your focus and now you’re irritated to boot. Well, there’s a way to keep your focus from being destroyed like this: batching.  Batching is the simple process of grouping similar tasks together and completing them in batches, instead of one at a time, here and there. This way, it’s easier to focus on what you’re doing right now.  Some people use batching by deciding that they’ll only answer emails during the first 10 minutes of every hour, instead of replying as they arrive. The author pays all his bills for the week on Fridays, instead of paying them as they come in. Of course, when you start batching, you learn exactly how much time certain things take up. Take note when things seem to be taking longer than they should, as this tells you that you might need to optimize. A great place to start is by getting rid of unnecessary paperwork. Sure, there’s a lot of talk about living in a paper-free society, but everyday we still find ourselves dealing with pesky papers. Which is why online tools are around: to help us eliminate paperwork even further. If you ever have to send a document via snail mail, Postal Methods can help you out. All you have to do is upload your document. The company prints it for you, puts it in a stamped envelope and then sends it on its way in the mailbox. This saves you a lot of time, and who likes licking stamps, anyway? It’s as simple as this: getting enough shut-eye and eating healthy determines how much energy you will have to do the things you want to do. No amount of productivity apps in the world can change this! When you deprive yourself of sleep, your body starts producing a rather unpleasantly named hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin increases hunger and lowers levels of another hormone, leptin, which regulates metabolism. When our metabolism doesn’t function properly, we will inevitably get tired. If you want to improve your sleep, there are two simple steps that will help. Firstly, take D-vitamins with your breakfast each day. Secondly, avoid devices emitting blue light, such as TVs, iPads and computers in the hour before you go to bed. Starting to live more healthily is also simple. Just eliminate fats, right? Wrong. A lot of people still see fat as the enemy, but sugar is the real villain here. Our brains can’t function without fat, whereas too much sugar prevents us from absorbing vitamins A, D, E and K. So, no more wasting your time on processed foods and sweets! Start seeking out natural options and increasing your intake of the “good” fats found in olive oil and avocados. Once you’ve made sure you’re sleeping enough and eating well, it’s time to start thinking about getting your body moving. Claiming that you’re too stressed to exercise is simply no excuse! The truth is that exercise reduces stress, and you’ll find that a good fitness program will allow you to cope better and better each day. Design your own exercise regimen to include three types of movement. First, there should be a strength and skill component – something like rock climbing or parkour will do the trick. Second, include high-intensity interval training – a short interval of exerting yourself to the maximum, followed by an interval of active rest. And, finally, you should engage in some kind of mobility training – something like yoga or just a good old-fashioned stretching session. The key message in this book: Though life today seems to be stress-filled, there are ways to cut through the clutter and own your hours. With simple techniques and innovative new tools and services to guide you, you’ll be saving time for the things you love in no time at all.  Actionable advice: De-clutter your inbox! Use your e-mail service’s filter to automatically put all e-mails that have the term “Unsubscribe” and don’t have “FW” or “RE” in them in a folder called Optional. This will weed out a lot of non-essential and distracting e-mails from your inbox that you can look at later once you’ve got time.

As a day laborer, he and many others wait on a street corner in Queens every morning for contractors to drive by and choose a few of them to do a day’s work at minimum wage. From the contractors’ point of view, all these workers are the same – they have no differentiating skills – so there is no special reason to pick Hector over any of the other laborers there. Hence, Hector will be lucky to get chosen. The industrial revolution was sparked by the discovery that highly skilled people are not necessarily needed to manufacture complicated products. Instead, almost any production process can be split into steps so simple that relatively unskilled workers can do them. Adam Smith wrote that ten barely trained – and hence poorly paid – factory workers could produce a thousand times more pins than one highly skilled pin maker. This is why many manufacturing jobs are simple, requiring only that employees show up and follow instructions precisely – like cogs in a machine. If you are such a worker, the problem is that you are easily replaceable and certainly in no position to negotiate a raise. Consider how manufacturing jobs in the West are being outsourced to China and India, where people are equally capable of following instructions but for a fraction of the cost. Today, even supposedly outsourcing-proof, white-collar jobs are under threat. Stock brokers, travel agents, secretaries and other professionals who were used to just showing up at work and doing what they were told are all finding themselves more and more replaceable and outsourceable. Jobs that involve purely following instructions can be done by anyone, anywhere. Today, if your job involves just following instructions, you are replaceable. There’s a big, grey mass of people out there for whom work means showing up for X hours a day in return for a monthly paycheck. They see their work as a frustrating and tedious chore, a necessary evil in their lives. And guess what? Their lack of motivation does not go unnoticed by management, and when times get tough, they are the first to be fired. This army of drones provides an opportunity for those who refuse to be unremarkable: the so-called linchpins, who are indispensable to their company. You need not be a CEO to be a linchpin. Consider the extra-friendly barista, whose great service makes you a regular customer, even though the coffee shop isn’t the closest or cheapest one. That barista is a linchpin, because the coffee shop can’t easily find someone with a similar passion for service to replace him with. Linchpins are like artists: they pour all their energy, heart and soul into their work. They don’t need detailed instructions from managers but rather find their own way of solving problems and doing their job. And they do this with such flare and passion that they gain a reputation. While others stand on the sidelines, linchpins stop the show. These abilities make linchpins not just slightly more valuable but a hundred times more valuable than the average mindless worker. Therefore, linchpins will always find work and be treated fairly – only a foolish company would lose one. And when a linchpin does look for a new job, usually her reputation has preceded her and she can count on employers to snag her up quickly. Linchpins are indispensable, so they get the best jobs. Becoming a linchpin means being brave enough to stand out of the crowd. But why is this so difficult? Why do most of us shy away from the limelight? The human brain evolved in stages, and one of the earliest parts to develop was the so-called lizard brain. It generates primal emotions like fear, hunger and anger, and it used to play a very important part in our survival; for example, by telling us to run away from saber-toothed tigers. Because this role was so important for our ancestors’ survival, the lizard brain still exerts a great deal of influence on our higher thinking. Today, however, the lizard brain’s influence can be damaging. When we’re supposed to stand up and give a speech, for example, the lizard brain goes berserk and fills us with fear. It screams: “No, don’t put yourself on stage where others can laugh at you, shout at you or attack you!” Similarly, if you’re trying to become an exalted, remarkable linchpin employee, the lizard brain will fill you with fear and doubt. It wants you to remain average, because this is the way it has survived until now; hiding from predators. It will probably even generate a wide variety of excuses for why you cannot be a linchpin, like: “You don’t have any good ideas!” “You don’t know what to do!” “Your boss would never let you!” Or even subtler: “Put off work for a bit, just procrastinate a little.” Basically, it will do everything it can to make sure your status quo doesn’t change into something new and scary. The lizard brain generates fear to stop you becoming a linchpin. In many ways, we are brought up to fit in. Consider school: we’re taught to prepare for exams, keep our heads down and follow instructions like, “Use #2 pencils.” Coloring outside the lines gets you a D, and not doing as you’re told gets you detention. Is it any wonder that by the time we reach a working age, we are afraid of doing anything that might make us stand out from the crowd? This is why most people are content to just show up at work and do what they are told. They are afraid of being special and afraid of ruining the safe and secure status quo. There are a number of ways you can try to abate fear. One is to stop indulging it. For example, if you’re afraid of your boss criticizing your work, you might constantly check your emails to see if he has sent you some negative feedback. Stop scratching this particular itch: force yourself to sit still and focus on something other than checking your emails. The fear will eventually recede. If you’re worried about failure, try pursuing multiple paths and setting multiple goals. If you line up three important presentations, failing in one will not matter so much and you will fear it less. Becoming a linchpin does not demand any particular natural talent or an Ivy League education. What it demands is that you overcome your fears and make a conscious choice to do so. Linchpins feel the same fear as everyone else, but they merely acknowledge it and move on; there’s work to be done. Don’t let your fear stop you – make the choice to be a linchpin. Not all artists are painters, sculptors or composers. Anyone who changes other people by giving them an emotional gift is an artist. A customer service person who uses his smile and charm to change an angry customer into a delighted fan of the company is just as much an artist as Picasso is. Similarly, the founder of online shoe store Zappos, Tony Hsieh, is an artist of great customer service. You can be an artist at your job, too, but not if you just show up and grudgingly do the bare minimum until it’s time to go home at the end of the day. Making art demands so-called emotional labor: investing your own emotions into your work to espouse creativity and generosity. It also means you have to make autonomous choices without clear instructions to follow. This is not easy, which is why many avoid it. For example, have you ever heard a flight attendant read out the safety announcements as if it’s the last thing he wants to be doing and he thinks no one is really listening? This happens because the person in question does not see his job as an opportunity for art. It would be much more demanding and stimulating for him to really invest himself into this mundane task and come up with an entertaining and unique way to read the announcements. If he can achieve this, his job becomes a platform for him to create art, something he can happily give away for people to enjoy. As an artist, he would likely find his job far more fulfilling and his employer would value him more highly, too. Pour emotional labor into your job and make it a platform for your art. How many of Picasso’s paintings can you name? Two? Three? He actually painted over 1000 works of art. That is the nature of artists; they produce. Artists don’t worry about having bad ideas that turn into failures, because they know that as long as they persistently produce art, good ideas will be made. The fact that some failures are produced is an inevitable cost of success. At the last moment before completing something, most people begin doubting themselves: Is this really ready? Is it good enough to show the world? This is when true artists – true linchpins – step up and ship anyway. Products must ship or they won’t be bought. Stories must be printed or they won’t be read. Even the best ideas are useless if they lack an audience. The TV show Saturday Night Live, for example, goes live on the air every Saturday whether the skits are fully rehearsed or not. This ability to ship on time is so rare that it makes linchpins indispensable: They have the discipline to make sure the projects they undertake get defined, done and delivered as promised. They strip away everything pseudo-productive and focus on things that help them ship. Shipping is difficult because the primal lizard brain in all of us does not want us to show our work to the world, as it might get criticized or laughed at. This phenomenon is called the resistance, and it creates procrastination and self-doubt. The best way to deal with resistance is to acknowledge it. Sure, you will fail often, and you will probably be criticized sooner or later, but you can choose to listen only to constructive criticism and ignore the harmful kind. Whatever you do, don’t stop producing and shipping. True artists get stuff done – they ship. For a long time, the economy has been based on equitable trades, preferably enforced by a contract: “You can listen to my music if you pay me twenty dollars.” Genuine gifts – as in giving someone something with no expectation of getting anything in return – were practically unheard of. In fact, if you tried to give a stranger a genuine gift, for example by offering a shared cab ride to someone going in the same direction as you, they would have probably refused, because they were nervous about how they should reciprocate the favor. But unreciprocated gifts are becoming a winning tactic, especially on the Internet. Consider the digital photographer Thomas Hawk. He shares all his pictures online for free. A cynic might say, “All that work and no reward,” but in fact, giving away his photos has made him famous: people talk about him, follow him and ultimately give him plenty of paid work. Gifts, given with good intentions and not as manipulation tactics, are talked about and the givers are rewarded. The linchpins who pour themselves into their work to give such gifts become well-known, celebrated and desired as employees. True artists give their art away without demanding or expecting reciprocation; it is simply in their nature to produce it. In fact, because their art is so unique, it would be impossible to compensate for it monetarily. How could anyone adequately compensate the waiter who devotes himself to great customer service, bringing in countless customers and brightening everyone’s day? Ironically, although artists may demand no compensation, true artists of this kind are so rare that people often pay whatever it takes to keep them. Otherwise, someone else will. To succeed today, you must give people genuine gifts. The key message in this book: Today, you can no longer succeed by being unremarkable and just following instructions. Instead, no matter how scary it seems, you must choose to be an outstanding, indispensable linchpin. Linchpins are like artists; they see their work as a platform for their art and pour emotional labor into it every day. Their art is a unique, immeasurably valuable gift that they give to others. The questions this book answered: Why is it essential you become a linchpin? Today, if your job involves just following instructions, you are replaceable. Linchpins are indispensable, so they get the best jobs. What stops most people from becoming linchpins? The lizard brain generates fear to stop you becoming a linchpin. Don’t let your fear stop you – make the choice to be a linchpin. How do linchpins create so much value? Pour emotional labor into your job and make it a platform for your art.

And you know what? They’re right. Sadly though, many people never reach their full potential since they lack the tools to do so. Instead, they lead their lives as mere mediocre versions of who they could be. These blinks will outline how to realize your own inherent potential and become your best possible self. You’ll discover concrete tools that will help you identify your priorities, set goals in line with those priorities and then attain your goals through consistent work. In these blinks, you’ll also discover: why you shouldn’t worry about your weaknesses but rather leverage your strengths, why Walt Disney was once fired from his job at a newspaper and how Arnold Schwarzenegger succeeded in not one but four very competitive areas. You’re probably eager to start your journey to becoming your best possible self, but first, let’s take a breath and look at you. Start by identifying the core areas of your life. Look at where you are and what you’ve done thus far; and with this in mind, think about which things in life are important to you. Your core areas depend mostly on your personal preferences. They can include things such as your career, your health, your financial situation or your relationships. The main thing is that you trust your gut and be honest with yourself about what those preferences are. Don’t, for example, fool yourself into chasing ambitious career goals if you really only care about having a stable family life with lots of time for your stamp collection. Once you have your list, rate each core area from one to ten, based on how happy you are with each area right now. The ranking will show you what your priorities are, and which areas are most in need of intervention. But before you start working on them, it’s important to prioritize yourself. Today, many people are willing to bend over backwards to help others, but continuously ignore their own needs. But sadly, if you don’t make yourself a priority, no one else will either. Just as flight attendants tell you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others, you should make sure to first help yourself, so that you can thereafter properly help others. So how can you prioritize yourself? Make a list of seven actions – that take less than fifteen minutes to complete – where you make yourself a priority (i.e., reading a magazine). Over the next week, complete one action a day. Both these factors – knowing what is important to you and making yourself a priority – are key prerequisites for both personal and professional fulfillment. When you try your hand at something new and fail, how do you react? This question is explored in the book Mindset by Carol Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford University. According to Dweck, there are two distinct types of mindsets. People with a growth mindset think of life as a learning process, in which they can improve their abilities. They believe that their skills are not fixed, so they seek out new things to learn and thus grow as individuals. They say things such as, “If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.” Yet people with a fixed mindset believe they are stuck with whatever abilities they already have, and no amount of practice will change this. They say things such as, “Basketball is just not the right game for me.” Why is this important? Because people with a growth mindset are far more likely to succeed in life than those with a fixed mindset. Therefore, you to should try to actively adopt a growth mindset, by staying positive and optimistic. How? Focus on positivity, for example, with a simple exercise that encourages you to use more positive words. Set up a jar in which you place a dollar every time you say something negative, whether a word or statement, such as “I can’t“ or “Today was a disaster.“ At the end of each month, donate the money to a charity of your choice. This should help you think more positive thoughts, which in turn trigger more positive emotions. But overcoming negativity is no easy task. Psychologist Barbara Fredrickson discovered that for a person to “flourish,” or have high levels of mental well-being, that person needed to experience roughly three positive emotions to neutralize just one negative emotion. Thus you cannot simply be slightly more positive than negative – you really have to tilt the tables. We all have our weaknesses, and many of us think we should devote a lot of effort to fixing them. But in fact, it would be more productive and much less of a chore to focus on our strengths, working with what we’re already good at – for example, at work. This strength-based approach is an important prerequisite for personal excellence. This was shown through decades of research by the Gallup Organization on how people can excel and be their best every day. Gallup found that people who use their strengths daily are six times more likely to feel engaged in their jobs and three times more likely to report an excellent quality of life than people who don’t. Using your strengths regularly is also advocated by the positive psychology movement, founded in 1998 by psychologist Martin Seligman. His research indicates that people tend to be happier when they use their strengths on a regular basis, rather than focusing on fixing their weaknesses and improving what they’re not so great at. The amazing thing about using your strengths is that it can cause a virtuous cycle. The positive emotions you get from using your strengths encourage you to be creative, which in turn helps you build new skills and relationships – yet more strengths for you to use! So you might be wondering: What exactly are my strengths? Getting a comprehensive view of your strengths is important, so consider using these online tools to map them properly. The VIA Survey of Character Strengths is a free online assessment tool, with 240 questions to help you identify your top-five strengths. It can be found here: www.authentichappiness.com. Gallup uses Strengthsfinder, another assessment tool to help identify a person’s strengths. To access this tool, you need to purchase the book StrengthsFinder 2.0 by author Tom Rath for a registration code. Every mentor, life coach and self-help author says the same thing: you have to leave your comfort zone to challenge yourself and develop as an individual. But what may be surprising is that you shouldn’t stray too far. Why? Because there are three different zones of comfort to consider: The comfort zone refers to actions you are the most comfortable taking. Here, both the level of stress and mental stimulation are low. In the stretch zone, things are a little less comfortable as you feel increasingly challenged. Stress levels are still manageable, however, and actually keep you sharp and focused. As a result, you learn and grow. In the stress zone, your challenges constantly overwhelm you, and can’t do your best as you’re simply too stressed. Because you’re in survival mode, you don’t learn and soon become exhausted. So which zone do you think is the right one if you want to keep growing as an individual? You guessed it: the stretch zone. You should try to figure out exactly where your stretch zone lies and then get in there as often as possible. But how do you do this? Try scheduling your priorities: If getting in shape is a priority for you, adhere to a workout schedule. Ideally, get some friends to join you, so peer pressure will keep you from skipping workouts. But you also need to mind your stress levels. One way to do this is a simple productivity mantra: “Do it, dump it or delegate it.” If something is important, do it yourself. If not, forget about it. And finally, if someone else can do it, delegate the task. This will help you avoid taking on so much that you slide into the stress zone. If you don’t yet have clearly defined goals in life, it’s time to make them. Why? Having a goal to strive toward is good for you. Studies show that people who have a goal that is personally significant are happier than people who don’t. This is because goals motivate, give hope and once they’re reached, boost confidence as you realize: “Hey, I did it!” Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, always set extremely ambitious goals for himself, and as a result was successful in four highly competitive areas: acting, bodybuilding, politics and real estate. So how do you set goals the right way? One common approach is to set goals that are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely. For example, “Every Tuesday at 2 p.m., I am going to do thirty push-ups.” Just make sure your goals are in line with your personal priorities so that you’ll be motivated in the long run. For example, if a sense of adventure in life is a priority for you, then you could set a goal to organize every year four long hikes with your family. Once you’ve set your goals, start taking small steps toward attaining them. Why small? Because each step will be easier to complete and thus help you get started as well as build confidence. You won’t feel overwhelmed if you take it one small step at a time. The Japanese refer to this approach as “kaizen,” meaning making continuous, small improvements that have a big cumulative impact. So define the right goals and plot small, manageable steps to attain them. After all, you wouldn’t try to read a 400-page book in a single sitting. You’d probably read about twenty pages a night, and in this way, you’d be finished in under a month without once feeling overwhelmed. Once you’ve set your goals, it’s time to take action to attain them. If you want to become healthier, for example, you need to start exercising! You’ll probably quickly realize that you have lots of paths toward achieving your health goal. You could start running, hiking, biking, swimming, shooting hoops, lifting weights and so on. So how do you choose the right course of action for you? Some options have a bigger impact on your health and fitness than others, so naturally it’s important to be selective about where you invest your time and energy. To properly evaluate your options, look at the goals you’ve set and ask yourself: Would this course of action really help me reach my goals? Is there an even better way? This kind of critical examination should help you decide which action to take. Of course, whatever choice you make, it will bring some results. The only way not to get results is to sit back and do nothing. In addition to choosing the right actions, another key determinant of reaching your goals is consistency. Arnold Schwarzenegger didn’t become a world-famous bodybuilder by working out every now and then. He adhered to a consistent and rigorous workout regimen for years to achieve his goals! So how can you become consistent in your actions so that you reach your own goals? One way is to tell a friend or your partner about your goals over the next thirty days, and the specific actions you’ll take to reach them. Ask them to hold you accountable by asking for status updates and punishing you if you fail. This way their watchful eye will keep you moving forward! Nothing meaningful in life can be achieved easily. So don’t delude yourself into thinking that you can reach your goals and become your best possible self without putting in lots of hard work and overcoming a few obstacles on the way. What’s important is that you shouldn’t let a few bumps discourage you from your quest. Adversity is just an inevitable part of your journey to success. Consider Thomas Edison: He ran over 2,000 failed experiments before he succeeded and invented the light bulb. Imagine if he had given up after the first 1,000 failures! Obstacles are just a part of life, which means that success can be yours only if you have the perseverance to overcome them. So how can you do this best? By redefining your obstacles. Understand that you’re not the only person facing roadblocks – everyone encounters them, so you just have to deal with them as effectively as possible. One method is to start looking at solutions, instead of just seeing the obstacle. Whenever you encounter an obstacle, write down three possible solutions for overcoming it. For example, if your boss doesn’t give you that promotion this time, write down three things you could do better next time around. This approach prevents you from being discouraged, as while you can identify the obstacle, you’re already taking the first steps to overcoming it. The Chinese philosopher Confucius once said, “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.” He was right. Resilience – the ability to bounce back from setbacks and keep going – is a key determinant of success. Consider that even Michael Jordan was once cut from his high school basketball team, only to later become the greatest basketball player of all time. Or that Walt Disney was once fired by his newspaper editor for his supposed lack of imagination and good ideas. The importance of resilience can also be seen in a study by psychologists Emily Werner and Ruth Smith, in which for over 30 years, they followed the lives of 689 high-risk children born in Hawaii. They wanted to understand why some of them became successful despite facing challenges such as poverty, abuse, lack of parenting and alcoholism. And the result? The children who succeeded did so thanks to having built resilience. Luckily for you, resilience is a quality that can be trained and strengthened. One useful exercise is composing a list of important life lessons learned as a result of mistakes you’ve made, and then thinking about how those lessons have helped you. This will make you understand that failure is an important and beneficial part of life, and you’ll find yourself bouncing back from future failures far more quickly. But the most important way to train resilience is to invest time in building and strengthening your relationships with your community, friends and family. Research shows that people are more resilient to stress and get sick less often if they have a supportive social circle. We spend our lives juggling our time and attention among things that are important to us, such as work, family, friends and hobbies. We strive for balance, hoping that one or two areas don’t overwhelm everything else to the point of neglect. You probably know some people who are particularly adept at this balancing act. They are the ones who are always busy but still find time to help you move or meet for lunch. But others are obviously completely out of balance: they may have little going on but never manage to return a phone call. Learning to control the balance in your life is the final factor in becoming your best possible self. To achieve this control, you have three tools at your disposal. Look at the bigger picture. Understand which actions will lead to which outcomes, so that you never blindly act without considering how it will affect you in the long run. For instance, if you feel like taking on a new project at work, ask yourself, at what cost? Will this new responsibility prevent you from seeing your family, or force you to drop a hobby that’s important to you? Identify your non-negotiables. These are things in life – beliefs, commitments and values – that you’re not willing to compromise for any reason. One example could be watching every one of your daughter’s basketball games. Once you know your non-negotiables, you’ll have an easier time defining how you should balance your life. Make conscious trade-offs. There’s only 24 hours in a day, and you can’t be in three places at once, so you have to make conscious trade-offs. Do you go to your cousin’s wedding or work overtime to finish that important presentation? The right answer depends on you, but by making a proactive, conscious choice, you’re empowering yourself. The key message in this book: To become your best possible self, you need to start by looking at yourself. What’s important to you? Then it’s just a matter of setting meaningful goals and taking small steps toward them, no matter what obstacles or setbacks you encounter.

Or do you spend your days running around, scrambling to get work done? What if you could spend your time more productively? You can, if you follow the 80/20 principle. It states that 20 percent of your time and resources goes into 80 percent of the results. Thus 20 percent of a record label’s artists generate 80 percent of sales; and the world’s top 20 percent of people generate 80 percent of its wealth. These blinks will show you how to use this principle to transform your own life. You’ll learn to identify all the places, from finance to productivity, in which living the 80/20 way can simplify how you live and make you happier, too. In these blinks, you’ll discover how one woman turned $5,000 into $22 million by doing next to nothing; why married people are happier than unmarried singles; and why living the simple life is the best way to live. Some 50 years ago, computers could do little in terms of processing, yet were massive machines. But today we carry incredibly powerful computers around in our pockets! The story of how computers evolved matches a wider trend in human activity: doing more with less. And in fact, the history of agriculture followed a similar path. More than 300 years ago, close to 98 percent of the labor force worked in the fields, harvesting food. Due to technological advances, today in developed countries only 2 to 3 percent of the working population is involved with agriculture. And yet we grow and harvest more food than ever! This is the driving force behind the 80/20 principle: the best 20 percent of our efforts produce 80 percent of the results. And by applying this principle everywhere, we can transform our lives. We tend to believe that if we spend as much time as possible working, we’ll be the most productive. Yet if you apply the 80/20 principle, you would realize that the best way to achieve more is to work less! Say you’re a freelancer and you need to get a project done in a week. If you give yourself all week to do it, you’ll procrastinate, spending your time fiddling around and not working on what matters. But if you give yourself only 20 percent of the week to complete the project (just one day), then you’ll work diligently and efficiently. The end results will be better, and you’ll have more time to spend on other things. Interested in how the 80/20 way can work for you? Next we’ll show you exactly how to apply this principle to the most important areas of your life. Let’s say you want to take a vacation. First, you choose a destination, and then you figure out how to get there. And then finally, you go! It’s simple, right? Luckily it’s exactly the same process you can use to change your life and start living by the 80/20 principle. So first, pick a destination: Where do you want the 80/20 principle to take you? Reflect upon your dreams, goals and objectives. Ask yourself, “What’s the best 20 percent of my life on which I’d like to focus?” For example, when Steve, a restaurant owner in Cape Town, decided to start living an 80/20 life, he identified some key professional and personal areas on which to focus. He decided that the most important things to him were starting a business, focusing on hospitality, and developing his rock music and teaching. Once you’ve followed Steve’s example and selected a destination, you’ll need to find the best route, or how to get there. To do so, take time to figure out how can you concentrate on these areas with the least amount of effort, but with the best results. Remember, there’s never just one path: think outside the box! For instance, if you want to become a better salesperson, you could take lessons, find a mentor, get an entry-level job, and so on. All you need to do is figure out which path will get you where you want to go in the fastest and easiest way possible. And lastly, remember to actually go! You need to take action and start moving. But keep the 80/20 principle in mind: You’re trying to get the maximum result from a minimum amount of effort. Most of us are in awe of time. It is an extremely valuable and scarce resource, and thus we live our lives feeling that we don’t have enough time to do what we want. It may come as a surprise that time is one of the areas that stands to benefit from the 80/20 principle. Once you commit to producing the best results with the least amount of effort, you need to figure out how to make the most of the time you have. So whether you’re a freelance designer or a postman, if you dedicate yourself to working harder for a shorter period of time, you’ll find your work improved and your free time expanded. But how can you actually achieve this effective use of your time? You can start by identifying your happiness islands (times when you feel happiest) and achievement islands (times when you are the most creative or productive). And once you’ve identified these islands in your own life, you can maximize your output by focusing on them. That’s exactly what Richard Adams did. Adams was a mid-level bureaucrat in the British civil service, and his job was boring and hours long. But he did experience periods of happiness outside of work, especially when he told stories to his daughters. He started to focus on these small islands of happiness. He then wrote down the stories, and they eventually became his best-selling book, Watership Down. From small happiness islands in a sea of boredom came success! So ultimately, when you let go of your notions about the scarcity of time and start working intelligently, you can achieve miracles. We’ll find out more about the concept of intelligence (and how it connects to laziness) in the next blink. As you may know, 20 percent of Americans own over 80 percent of the entire country’s wealth. And many of these wealthy individuals followed the same 80/20 logic to earn their fortunes, in that they realized you can use a small amount of money to produce unbelievable returns. In short, they relied on the effect of compounding (when profits are put to the task of generating more profit) to grow relatively tiny amounts of money into large fortunes. You can also take advantage of this financial strategy by investing your money wisely (say, in the stock market) and thinking in the long term. In other words, even though there might be periods in which your investment doesn’t increase much, in the long term, it will increase. For example, at the end of World War II, Anne Schreiber put $5,000 into the stock market and simply left it there. By 1995, some 50 years later, her small investment had turned into $22 million! Of course, to invest, you need some savings first. And saving needn’t be difficult if you do it incrementally. So for instance, you might set up a bank transfer that automatically sends a small portion of your income (consider 10 percent) into a savings account. That’s what Steve and Helen did to realize their 80/20 goal of buying an apartment that cost $60,000. Together, the couple had an annual income of $78,000. At the end of every month, they hardly had anything left, meaning they weren’t putting any money aside. To avoid spending everything, they channeled 10 percent of their pay directly into a savings account. After six years, they had saved $66,000, which allowed them to buy the apartment (and also fund necessary repairs). In the modern world, relationships matter. But many of us overextend ourselves. In our desire to build strong relationships with everyone, we end up pleasing no one. Here the 80/20 principle can help, too. Since 80 percent of our relationship satisfaction stems from just 20 percent of our actual relationships, to lead a happy life, we need to concentrate on the few relationships that actually matter, such as the ones we have with our romantic partners. After all, this is one of the most important relationships we have! A study showed that people who scored in the top percentile for happiness were also involved in a romantic relationship. Nearly 40 percent of married Americans say they are extremely happy; meanwhile, only 23 percent of unmarried Americans would describe themselves the same way. But to have a strong relationship that supports your happiness rather than undermining it, it’s important to ensure that you and your partner agree on a few basic values. Some 50 percent of marriages end in divorce! The best way to avoid this fate is to choose your partner wisely. If you don’t agree on the basics from the outset, it doesn’t matter how much effort you put into the relationship later on. For example, when Steve met Helen, he tried to figure out what made her happy. He soon realized what really mattered to her. She wanted him to be home on time; she wanted to be able to rely on him; and she wanted him to support her projects. What’s more, she loved surprises. And so Steve focused on meeting these basic needs to make Helen happy and strengthen their relationship. You should now have a good idea of how to apply the 80/20 principle to the main areas of your life. To finish, let’s spend a few moments focusing on the principle’s most basic aspect: When it comes to living a good life, simplicity is key.  But what is a good life anyway? Philosophers have spent centuries debating this question. One Greek philosopher, Epicurus, came up with an answer that aligns with the 80/20 principle. The basic components of a good life are food, shelter, clothes, friends, freedom and thought. And that’s it! Ultimately, he unknowingly followed the less-is-more strategy by focusing his energy on the most important tasks. And Epicurus put this philosophy into practice by living a life ordered by the principle of simplicity. He lived with seven friends in a commune. They grew all their food themselves and didn’t worry about accumulating wealth. Instead, they spent their time writing books and sharing ideas. If you want to follow a similar path, cut out everything in your life that doesn’t make you happy. Consider the story of Ann, who was a successful, well-paid account executive in advertising. Stressed out by her job and exhausted, she quit and gave up her huge apartment for a one-room studio. She started spending all of her time painting, an activity she loved. Although her parents didn’t approve of her new life and criticized her decision to quit a secure job, Ann stuck to her path. And eventually, she started to make good money selling her paintings. So by simplifying her life, Ann managed to find more happiness and success than she could have ever imagined. The key message in this book: The 80/20 principle says that 80 percent of what we want is generated by 20 percent of what we actually do. In other words, if you figure out what you want and focus on what makes you happy, you’ll be able to create more with less.  Actionable advice: Make a list of things that actually matter to you and then focus your energy on them. Doing so will prioritize your happiness and fulfillment. And it has an added benefit: When you focus on yourself and what you really want, you stop wasting as much energy worrying about what other people think of you. What to read next: The 80/20 Principle, by Richard Koch These blinks have shown you how to use the 80/20 principle in various areas of your life, from your hobbies to your finances. But the technique can be used for far more than just developing your personal life – which is what Richard Koch’s first book is all about. In The 80/20 Principle, you’ll learn how to apply the Pareto principle to a range of different fields, from linguistics to business management. To gain a deeper understanding of this society-defining metric, and to find out where it comes from and what it has to do with the size of goldfish, check out the blinks to The 80/20 Principle.   Got feedback?

Usually the things that we are most scared of (snakes, spiders, heights) are the things with the capability to kill us. Our fear keeps us from venturing too close to them and thus being injured. However, despite its ability to keep us alive, fear can also hold us back. How? Because fear keeps us from exploring the unknown or trying something new. Unfortunately, if we want to succeed in the modern world, where things are changing all the time, we need to constantly step outside our comfort zone in order to keep up. If we allow our fears of the new to dominate we will be left stagnating and unhappy. But how do we overcome those natural fears? These blinks will provide the answer. In these blinks you’ll discover why being persistent is better than being intelligent; and why being paranoid can help you stay one step ahead. You’re at a meeting with an important client, but he is no longer happy with your product and wants to cancel your contract immediately. What do you do? Panic and beg him not to drop you? Or resign yourself to the loss of business? You could do neither. Rather than letting your emotions dictate your actions, you can instead approach problems rationally by using the FEAR method: Focus, Engage, Assess and React. Start by focusing on your problem, studying it closely before engaging and taking appropriate action. Ask yourself: How threatening is this problem really? And does anyone on your team already have experience of solving a similar problem? Is it possible to find a way to improve your product or service according to the client’s wishes? Or might it be better to simply drop this client and search for new ones? If this has happened before, how did you resolve the situation? After you have made sufficient preparations, it’s time to develop an action plan. Analyze which resources you’ll need, and what steps you must take to reach your goal. This could mean, for example, developing new technologies for your client which no other provider can offer. Once you’ve begun implementing your action plan don’t forget to assess outcomes and react accordingly. Always analyze the results of your plan. Are they satisfactory? If not, what are the underlying problems, and what can you learn from your mistakes? If your plan has delighted your customer, that’s great. But if not, what else do you need to do to stop him from searching for a new service provider? Once you’ve assessed your plan’s weaknesses, it’s time to tweak your plan until you’ve solved the problem. By differentiating opportunities and risks, the FEAR model provides you with a good opportunity to assess emotional situations objectively and produce the best outcome. Some people seem to take risks all the time without the slightest sense of insecurity. But how do they do it? No one is born with unlimited courage. Rather, it’s a skill which can be learned. Because having courage doesn’t mean that you don’t have fear. Instead, it simply means that you’re being practical and realistic. Courageous people carefully analyze risks before taking action. They also learn from their mistakes, and constantly recalibrate their next moves to make them more effective (and less risky). If you undergo this process enough times, you’ll become resilient, that is, you can turn adversity into positive feedback. Psychology professor Martin Seligman explained it in Harvard Business Review quite simply: Imagine Douglas and Walter both lose their jobs. Douglas is courageous, and thus sees his predicament as a temporary stumbling block. He analyzes his earlier mistakes, looks for the jobs he can reasonably get and finds a new opportunity shortly after. Walter, however, is full of fear. He therefore blames himself for his situation, becomes depressed and unable to move on. If you don’t want to end up like Walter, you’ll need to train your courage by taking small risks. Willpower, i.e., the force behind courage, is like a muscle – when you exercise your willpower, you strengthen it, and thus increase your tolerance for risks. In practice, this means seeking out new opportunities at work, and getting involved in projects that test and expand your capabilities. As you surmount these small challenges and learn from your experiences, you’ll simultaneously be preparing yourself for bigger, more serious challenges in the future. So the next time you see an opportunity, analyze the risks and then take a chance! If it goes wrong, you can at least say that you learned something from it. Fear is a destructive force. It distracts us from our goals and erects barriers that negatively impact our choices. To overcome these barriers, you’ll need to practice mindfulness, that is, being aware of when you feel discomfort or anxiety, and taking the time to pause and assess your situation. As soon as you recognize your fears for what they are, they immediately lose their power over you, because now you can start working on them objectively. The next time you find yourself getting worked up about a big presentation, take some time to analyze why you’re feeling so anxious. Is it because you don’t like speaking in front of people? If you know that, then you have an opportunity to practice your presentation with a friend. If you’re unsure whether the facts you present are correct, then you have an opportunity to get feedback from colleagues to double-check your work. By adopting this strategy, you effectively turn your worries into sources of feedback. In other words, your fears become learning tools. Indeed, fear does have a positive side: it keeps us alert and open to potential signs change in important areas, be they markets, customers, relationships, etc. In this way, fear helps us consider problems before they even occur. This gives us an opportunity to prepare our mind for possible upcoming challenges and think up creative solutions. For instance, artists, who rarely have a stable income, always have to worry about where their next paycheck will come from. As a result, they must be creative to offer their audience what it wants. It is this forced creativity that has driven the band OK GO to not only produce music, but also run a record label, develop apps and produce videos. Accept your fear for what it is: a normal response to stressful situations that you can use as both a learning tool and a source of motivation. Fear takes many different forms, one of which is paranoia, the suspicion of being outperformed and outmaneuvered by competitors. As with the fear of failure, paranoia can also be translated into signals which can help you to assess your situation. First, analyze whether competitors actually represent a real threat, and under what circumstances. A good way to do this is by asking yourself tough questions: What would happen to your company if the economic conditions changed? If new technologies arise, or a competitor cuts prices? If the answers to some of those strategies make you feel uncomfortable, think of some strategies to tackle possible problems and develop some back-up plans. Never let yourself feel too safe; it’s easy to become complacent if you’re not careful. You’ll want to be like the legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk. As he grew older, he realized that his career in sports couldn’t last: there were always new, up-and-coming skateboarders ready to take his share of the market. So he decided to enlarge his business interests and keep himself relevant, developing his own brand of clothing and sports equipment, and endorsing a video game series. Having established a self-assessment system, your mind will be primed for innovation, always trying to stay one step ahead of the competition. It is this mind-set that is the ultimate driving force for successful businesses, as they can foresee problems well in advance, resolve them before they become unmanageable and foster growth opportunities. P&G, for example, is able to continually improve its disposable Pampers diapers because it knows that competitors are following its lead and waiting for the company to falter. This means that Pampers must constantly produce new improvements, such as leak-proof waist shields, that have a lasting impact on the market. As we’ve seen, failure is a valuable part of learning for future projects. However, this means nothing if you don’t have the will to actually carry through your goals. Sustaining interest in a long-term goal and maintaining your efforts to achieve that goal require grit. Grit demands a great degree of self-control. To achieve your goal, you need to prepare a solid plan which includes all the steps you’ll need to take to get there. But you also need the persistence to carry your plan through – to never give up – and a tolerance for any small adaptations that have to be made along the way. Grit is absolutely important in determining your success. In fact, according to the six-month-long study that psychologist Angela Lee Duckworth conducted with West Point cadets, college undergrads, working adults and Scripps National Spelling Bee contestants, persistence and perseverance are more important than IQ or GPA in determining success. But having grit doesn’t mean taking every single hurdle in your path head on. You still need to make sure that your actions aren’t going to harm you in the long run. Instead, you want to take healthy risks that push your boundaries without extending yourself far beyond your capabilities and qualifications. You can have all the grit in the world, but you still need to weigh potential losses against potential gains. Only then can you know which opportunities are worth taking and which are just too risky. For example, Phil Gordon, professional poker player and owner of the app maker Jawfish Games, always has two experts test his apps before he puts them on the market. Sure, this might be costly, but the feedback gives him an idea of whether the apps are actually worth making available to the world. Becoming a daredevil doesn’t mean being free from worries. Rather, it means objectively scrutinizing challenges and making the right bets. It seems like everyone is looking for some magical formula for success. Luckily, such a formula exists, but we tend to overlook it due to its simplicity. All we have to do is try, learn and try again, despite uncertainties and anxiety, until we succeed. Indeed, with enough attempts and enough time, sooner or later you’ll stumble upon a successful innovation. This, of course, means dedicating time to tinkering and experimenting with your ideas, and likely failing in the process. But failure and experimentation are intertwined: the more you experiment, the more your failures will point you toward a successful solution. Often this requires a shift in mind-set, one that requires you to see your career or organization as a constant work in progress. You want the flexibility to adjust course when necessary, and this means adopting an attitude that can handle change. It’s this very principle that pushes companies to release beta versions of their products before release, to let the public test and scrutinize them, and detect problems on the spot. This open-minded attitude to development ends up saving a lot of money in the long run. When unforeseen challenges do arise, it’s time to improvise. You don’t need to be a genius, just ingenious. Your improvisational talent is worth more than intelligence when decisions have to be made quickly. Today’s young people are becoming experts in this way of thinking. The business world is undergoing a generation flux: a new cohort of young professionals has entered the workforce, one with the talent to adapt to various circumstances, make fast decisions and think outside the box if needed. Even if your business is successful and relevant, there’s no guarantee that it will always be that way. In today’s dynamic markets, relevance is more like a condition than a quality, so you’ll need to keep changing to remain valuable to customers! The key for sustaining relevancy is constant reinvention. In order to recognize and take full advantage of opportunities, you must always be willing to change and adapt yourself. Becoming an expert in reinvention means learning new skills and keeping your finger on the pulse of market trends. In fact, in business a qualification that you earned from six-months’ of evening classes can be worth more than a PhD (both on your CV and in practice) because it underlines your willingness to adapt to new challenges and your ability to learn fast. Workers and managers who can’t keep up-to-date with changes in market trends will quickly find the quality of their work slipping, while their skills and qualifications become obsolete. The same applies to companies: they too must constantly be on the lookout for opportunities to gain a competitive advantage, e.g., with products or processes, in order to stay relevant. This can pose a huge problem for large enterprises in particular, as they often aren’t designed for change. Moreover, new adaptive strategies often fly in the face of convention. But it is possible! Take the drugstore chain Walgreens, which had to deal with decreasing consumer spending and growing competition. To combat these trends, it implemented a whole new concept of customer service, including a mobile app and pill reminder and one-stop shops complete with a new assortment of healthy food, manicure services, and so on. If your company can’t undergo huge changes, small adjustments such as regular brainstorming meetings can help push you in the right direction. As we’ve seen, change isn’t always easy to welcome, but in order to stay innovative and successful we have to find ways to deal with it and see it as an opportunity. The key message in this book: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” This is a mantra that so many live by, and it’s the mantra that will kill your business. Today’s companies need to be on a constant lookout for opportunities, and to be prepared to take calculated risks before things breakdown. Otherwise they risk being left behind. Actionable advice: Ask yourself the tough questions. Most people feel stress about their performance at work, wondering whether they are actually valuable to their company. Whether or not that’s true can be easily assessed by asking a few simple questions: Are you taking all the opportunities you can? And are you constantly learning and taking on new projects which could expand your capabilities? If yes, then your company should be happy to have you as an employee. If not, then it’s time to start taking risks!

McRaven","summary":"Sometimes, the simplest of things can be the most effective. And that’s what these blinks are all about. It may seem obvious, but even something as small as making your bed in the morning – every morning – can hugely affect your quality of life. As a Navy SEAL, William H. McRaven fought in both Afghanistan and Iraq. While there, and during his years of training beforehand, he collected an impressive array of life lessons. From the necessity of accepting failure and the importance of never, ever giving up, Admiral McRaven’s advice is sure to inspire. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should never, in any situation, judge a book by its cover; what a “sugar cookie” is (and why it’s not as nice as it sounds); and how the simple act of singing saved his comrade’s military career. If you’ve ever seen a movie where young soldiers were struggling through boot camp, you may have noticed their bunk beds and how orderly and neat they’re kept. It may seem like a small and insignificant detail but a made bed can get your day started on the right foot. The author and his fellow cadets were taught the proper way to make a bed in Coronado, California, as part of the basic training for being a member of the US SEAL team. And they also learned when to make their bed: first thing after waking up. If someone failed to follow the bed-making code, they would perform the “sugar cookie” ritual, which involved diving into the Pacific Ocean and then immediately rolling in the hot sand on the beach. Now, you may be thinking, “What’s the big deal about making your bed?” Well, it may be an easy task, but accomplishing any task first thing in the morning is the best and most productive way to start your day. It gets the ball rolling, so to speak: by finishing one job, you’ll find it easier to begin checking off the other tasks on your list. And before you know it, you’ll be feeling great and productive – all thanks to making your bed. Another life lesson from the military is the importance of teammates in your life. The author learned this the hard way, after a near-fatal parachute jump. Falling through the air, McRaven was struck by another jumper’s parachute, which caused his own parachute to become entangled with his leg. The force of his parachute’s deployment broke his pelvis and tore his stomach muscles from the bone. During his months of recovery, the author came to learn how important it is to have someone to help you carry on. If not for his wife, Georgeann, McRaven would likely have succumbed to depression and self-pity. Everyone experiences a time in life when he needs the support of someone who believes in him. You can’t make it through life on your own. Were you ever surprised by someone? Perhaps you initially assumed the person was dull and boring, only to end up, later on, as great friends. The lesson here is to never make the mistake of judging someone by anything other than their heart. The opposite scenario also holds true. You might think a stranger is something they’re not, so before you place your confidence in them, ask yourself, “What do I really know about this person?” When McRaven was in college and considering his future as a Navy SEAL, he visited a recruitment center to learn more. While he was there, he noticed Tom Norris, a small, balding and frail-looking man. He looked like the exact opposite of a badass SEAL team veteran. Yet that’s exactly who Lieutenant Tom Norris was: a war hero who’d been shot in Vietnam while risking his life to save others. Norris fought through painful injuries and exhausting recovery to continue serving his country as a member of the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team. This brings us to another valuable lesson: that you shouldn’t expect life to be fair and reasonable. McRaven faced a fair amount of “sugar cookies” during his SEAL training – diving into the waves of the Pacific and then rolling around in the sand. This punishment was inflicted even if he hadn’t gone against the SEAL training rules, which could make life seem unfair and unreasonable. But after you spend enough time running around with sand rubbing against every inch of your body, you come to accept that life is unfair and that it’s futile to resist this fact. The ridiculous thing to do would be to waste time by refusing to accept life’s challenges. Instead, you need to pick yourself up and march forward. No one likes to hear the word “failure.” It’s loaded with negativity – something everyone wants to avoid. But with the right perspective, failure can be used as an advantage. Sometimes, failing is unavoidable. And though it can cause pain and suffering, that doesn’t mean we should allow it to overpower us. Instead, we can use it to make us stronger and more determined. While training with the Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL Teams, the author was part of a swim team that was constantly finishing in last place. This meant they were subject to another dreaded Navy SEAL ritual: The Circus. Legendary among SEAL members, The Circus is a strenuous endurance test that has been known to make many cadets give up and quit SEAL training. The Circus was an exhausting trial for McRaven, but it worked – improving the results of his swim team. And when it came time for the graduation test, which featured a swim that was more challenging than any they’d faced before, they ended up finishing first. Their previous failure had made them stronger than any of the other cadets. Part of learning from failure is a willingness to take chances. Because, in order to win big, you have to take big risks. While comfort has its pleasures, there’s a certain thrill in taking risks as well. And if you let your anxieties and fears control all your decisions, you won’t get very far. In 2004, McRaven was faced with a tricky situation. There was an enemy compound in Iraq that was holding three hostages and the intel was that the enemy and their captives would soon be on the move. His best chance of freeing the hostages required a risky daytime raid on the compound. Of course it wasn’t ideal. They’d be out in the daylight, and the compound was barely big enough to accommodate the three helicopters the team required. It was risky, but McRaven gave the orders to execute the mission. They had to push aside their fears of failure and death, but it was a success and the hostages were rescued. Life can throw a lot of challenges your way. You may be confronted by bullies or false friends. Or, if you’re a Navy SEAL, maybe shark-infested waters are between you and what you want to accomplish. The time may come when it feels easier to shy away rather than rise to the challenge, but this would be a mistake. Everyone has fears. You can’t let them stand in your way. Be courageous and stay determined to reach your goals. There are countless fears to overcome in order to join the ranks of the Navy SEALs. One night, McRaven and his swim partner had to swim four miles in the dark, which can be unnerving enough on it’s own. But this night, there were reports that they’d be swimming with hammerhead sharks, leopard sharks and even the most aggressive and feared of all, great white sharks. McRaven couldn’t let a fear of sharks prevent him from completing his SEAL training, however, and so he used this goal to boost his courage and continue. Courage is also what it takes to persevere in the face of tragedy and life’s grimmest moments. It’s during such moments that we need to put our best selves forward. Times of darkness are sure to befall each and every one of us at on time or another. A friend, family member or loved one may die, or you may need to fight an illness that takes every bit of your strength. Though terribly trying, these times require that you rise to the challenge. McRaven has seen far too many people die in battle. These are always the toughest and bleakest of times, but they’re also the times when he’s been most impressed with the endurance and resilience that people have shown. After a Navy Special Operator died in Iraq, his twin brother was there to stand tall and offer a shoulder to cry on for grieving friends and family. It was an inspiring thing to witness. He said he wanted to make his twin brother proud. Does this sound familiar? You’re at the end of your rope, ready to call it quits, and then you talk to a friend who offers a fresh perspective and gives you that second wind. These are moments that show how much difference one person can make. We should all strive to be someone who can instill hope in others and lead them forward in life. Even if you know very little about the Navy SEALs, you may have heard of Hell Week, a seven-day endurance test that often serves as the point where cadets either make it or call it quits. At one point, trainees have to spend a night sitting, covered in cold mud. During McRaven’s Hell Week, one of the cadets got up and walked away, ready to quit. But then one of the other men began to sing, and then a second and third joined in. Soon, they were all singing. It began with one man, but it was enough to get that cadet to turn around and rejoin the group with renewed hope. This brings us to the final lesson: Don’t give up! Life is beautiful, even in the times when it’s a painful mess. Remember, those blissful moments are impossible without the bad ones. So when times get tough, don’t feel sorry for yourself or blame others. Life is what you make of it, and it will only be as good as the effort you put into it. And if you give it nothing, you’ll only feel regret. In Afghanistan, a soldier named Adam Bates was badly wounded by a landmine. When McRaven visited him in the hospital, Bates was covered in burns; tubes ran in and out of him. Not only that, he’d lost both legs. Nevertheless, Bates used sign language to signify that he’d be all right. It’s the kind of response McRaven is so proud to see in soldiers. So often they face hardship but refuse to succumb to self-pity. A SEAL learns to never give up. And if Adam Bates can find what it takes to keep going, surely you can as well. The key message in this book: Regardless of who you are, there are valuable life lessons to be learned from a veteran of the US Navy SEALs. A SEAL is someone who’s been through the worst trials and tribulations; who’s faced their worst fears and grown stronger from doing so; who’s lost friends and witnessed acts of heroism that others can only read about. From these experiences comes a unique perspective on life and what it takes to make the most of it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

This is where the concept of mastery becomes especially relevant. True mastery isn’t just about reaching goals; it’s just as much about internalizing a philosophy that will keep you learning even after you’ve reached your goals. In short, true mastery is a lifelong journey. But what constitutes true mastery? How can you find it in yourself and what can you do to make sure you stay on your path, even when the going gets tough? That’s what these blinks are all about. In these blinks, you’ll learn why goals, prizes and recognition are overrated; what made John Wooden such a great basketball coach; and which ritual surgeons perform before every operation. Most of the time, we take on new activities with a singular aim – to master them. Be it tennis, chess or a new job, new pursuits can go from exciting to frustrating once we reach the point where our lack of talent seems to be staring us in the face. It’s tempting to give up, but you shouldn’t; you might still have a shot at mastery if you change the way you think. The first step here is to rethink your motivations for learning a new skill. Many of us are seeking simple recognition from others and the gratification that comes with it. But if you practice tennis until you can do a handful of impressive shots, beat a few of your friends and be congratulated by spectators, you’ll only have the motivation to improve up to a point. Once you’ve reached a level of skill that’s sufficient to earn you a bit of recognition, you’ll find yourself stuck in your comfort zone. Attempting new shots or competing against more challenging opponents becomes daunting, as you fear you won’t look as good while playing. A true master develops her talents by pushing forward for the sake of it, rather than chasing praise and encouragement. Another key to mastery is your approach to learning itself, namely by cultivating a certain respect for the process. If you want to master tennis, you’ve got to accept that it’ll take time, patience and perseverance to perfect your forehand. Learning isn’t something you do for a while until you’re good enough – it’s an ongoing journey. By shifting your mindset, you’ll find that you’re capable of mastering whatever you set your mind to. After all, you were a baby once! Babies enter the world incredibly vulnerable, with very few of the skills adults need to survive. And yet, they learn at their own pace to crawl, walk, communicate, understand and think for themselves. Some infants learn to walk between nine and ten months of age, while others don’t master it until much later. Children are capable of learning motor skills despite their lack of physique and often slow learning speed. In this way, learning isn’t about how fast you acquire new skills or how talented or fit you are when you start out; rather, it has much more to do with the journey you take along the way. So, the student who shows the most promise during the first few tennis lessons might not be the one who excels, while an initially clumsier player with a mastery mindset is far more likely to go on to be a pro. But while a mastery mindset offers us a clear path to excellence, our society seems to reject it at every turn. Find out more in the next blink. American society, like most Western societies, seems to be waging war upon mindful mastery. We’re bombarded with slogans like “Get fit in two weeks!” or “Hit the jackpot!” as advertisers try to convince us that buying their products will allow us to “master” something instantly. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Mastery is built on long periods of practice without tangible results, which lead to bursts of improvement, which then give way to steady, deliberate practice once again. The journey toward mastery isn’t shaped like a steep incline, but rather a series of plateaus punctuated by spurts of progress. Learning to love these plateaus is essential to achieving mastery. When the author first began attending an Aikido school, he soon began to enjoy the ritual of classes and the seemingly endless repetition of exercises. While his classmates dropped out, he stuck around through the plateaus and worked his way toward mastery. Why do many of us find these plateaus so hard to bear? Well, typically because we’re one of three personality types that struggle with mastery – dabblers, obsessives and hackers. Which one are you? Dabblers tend to approach new hobbies with a lot of enthusiasm. They might pick up an expensive tennis racket, dress like their favorite pro and pat themselves on the back after their first improvements. But they aren’t able to handle the plateaus and end up dropping out, justifying their decision with excuses along the lines of “It just wasn’t the right sport for me . . .” The obsessive is determined to master his forehand in just one tennis lesson. The learning journey doesn’t matter to him, it’s results that matter. Most of the time, the plateaus after the first small spurts of progress will discourage obsessives enough for them to quit. Finally, hackers are perfectly comfortable spending the rest of their time in the plateau. They’re happy just to hit the tennis ball over the net a few times when playing against a superior opponent, and aren’t particularly motivated to push themselves to improve any further. If, to your dismay, you’ve identified yourself as a dabbler, obsessive or hacker, don’t fret! Recognizing the behaviors that prevent you from mastering the skills you’ve always wanted to have is the first step to overcoming them. So what’s the next step? Instruction and practice are two of the five key elements of achieving mastery. In this blink, we’ll find out just how important they both are. Of course, there are many skills you can teach yourself without too much help. But on the road to mastery, finding great instruction is a must. Instruction can come in many forms, from video tutorials, computer programs, real-life experiences or even a good old-fashioned book. They’re all valid, but social contact is particularly crucial to great learning experiences. For this reason, one-on-one or group instruction is definitely worth pursuing. But how can you know if your instructor is worth sticking with? The best way is to observe how they treat their students. Take UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, otherwise known as the “Wizard of Westwood” and one of the best basketball mentors in history. Wooden’s respect for his players is what made his coaching stand out, as did his balanced focus on the team’s strengths and weaknesses. He would split training sessions fifty-fifty between correcting problems and reinforcing what the team already did well. Practice, like instruction, is vital in your journey to mastery – but not practice as you know it. While most of us think of practice as repeating a task until we’re good at it, mastery requires us to think of practice as more than a simple action. Instead, think of practice as a noun, as a synonym for “path” or “journey.” To illustrate this, consider why a martial arts master would continue to train even after receiving his black belt, the highest qualification. The answer is simple: the black belt is just another milestone along the journey, and a license to continue practicing for as long as you wish. Here, the black belt doesn’t represent practice as the act of repetition, but the notion of practice as a noun that captures the joy of ongoing learning. Now that we’ve explored the roles of instruction and practice in mastery, let’s explore three more key elements that’ll help you on your way to excellence: surrender, intentionality and edge control. These terms are a little less familiar than instruction and practice, so let’s take a closer look. What does surrender have to do with mastery? Well, it refers to the need to surrender to your teacher and the demands of your discipline. Sometimes this means sacrificing your pride, too. Say your top-notch tennis instructor, who you respect and trust, asks you to stand on one foot and hold the other foot against your back with one hand, while your other hand rotates in the air above your head. You’ll have to do this for five minutes at the start of every class for your entire first month. You could, of course, refuse and complain that you’d look ridiculous. But by doing so, you’ll miss out on what the exercise teaches you – improved balance, for instance. Though your instructor might sometimes ask you to do things that you don’t understand, if you trust their wisdom and want to benefit from it, you’ll need to put your pride aside and surrender to them. Let’s turn now to intentionality. This element focuses on the power of the mind in mastery. Intentionality is the ability to visualize yourself succeeding, and is a technique that golf professionals, for example, rely on heavily. Take international golf legend Jack Nicklaus; he believes that a successful shot consists of 50 percent visualization, 40 percent set-up and just 10 percent swing! Finally, edges are those moments when you’re confronted with a challenge and, therefore, the opportunity to exceed your own expectations. Masters recognize an edge as a chance to grow, and they’ll concentrate their efforts to make sure they make the most of it. How do you know when you’re facing an edge? It’s a pretty familiar feeling. For dabblers, the plateau is an edge. For the obsessive, it’s their inability to understand their own limits, while hackers rarely stay on a path long enough to reach an edge in the first place. The next time you feel you’re facing a task that you simply can’t complete, you’ll need to choose between giving up or focusing hard to overcoming the obstacle. The master will always choose the latter. Say you decide to follow the path of the master. You’ve told your friends, have gotten into the rhythm of practice and feel great. But then, all of a sudden, it happens: a backslide. Let’s imagine, for instance, that you’ve decided to run five kilometers every morning as part of your practice routine. But after a little while, beyond the first successful mornings, breathing becomes difficult and your heart races like never before. This is your body sending you a clear signal – you’ve pushed yourself too far out of your regular state and your body can no longer keep homeostasis going. Homeostasis is a process by which organisms regulate their internal systems, ensuring they function in balanced conditions and avoid drastic changes. Despite all the well-intentioned resolutions you made, your body wins and interrupts your practice. This will happen for almost anyone learning a new physical skill. So how can you prevent your resolutions from falling apart? Well, there are three steps you can take. The first is to surround yourself with people who have already made it through the same challenges you are currently facing. They’ll understand exactly what’s going on when you push up against your body’s natural limits, and can offer advice on how to overcome these limits in your practice sessions. The next step to take is to ensure you have the right approach to your goals. Remember how our desire for instant success and recognition is counterproductive to mastery? The master finds joy in practice itself, and that should be your focus too. In other words, if you reach the top of the mountain, keep on climbing! Finally, work hard to stay consistent in your practice and learning. You can even make routines more engaging by turning them into rituals that give you time to reflect on the task at hand. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi observed that this is what master surgeons do when they wash their hands the exact same way prior to every operation – they create a ritual for themselves to focus their minds more deeply. The last thing you’ll need to ensure a successful journey toward mastery is energy to sustain yourself. The author considers humans to be rather like machines full of energy. Unfortunately, troublesome behavior and social mores prevent us from using this energy to its full potential. This inhibition of natural human energy begins when we’re kids. Think of how curious young children are – they won’t rest until they’ve explored and experienced everything for themselves. But parents, keen to ensure their children’s safety, quickly limit this exploration with rules; from “Don’t touch that!” to “Be quiet!” to “Not until you eat your vegetables”, we grow up listening to negative commands that curtail our natural curiosity and drain our energy. Luckily, we’re all capable of reclaiming this childlike energy through a few simple practices. One of these is maintaining physical fitness. By making sure we walk or cycle instead of driving, for instance, we can remind ourselves of the strength our bodies possess and put it to good use. Another step is to set your priorities well. Focusing our energy toward one main goal means we may have to let go of other goals, but this is by no means a disadvantage; rather, prioritization gives us a better understanding of our energy levels and helps us learn to work within our limits. And priorities can always be shifted according to how you perceive your needs. Finally, learning to accept your commitment to a goal, rather than fighting it, can give you an unparalleled energy boost. By diving into a new endeavor wholeheartedly, and by recognizing and welcoming the work that comes along with mastery, you’ll give yourself plenty of fuel for the entire journey. The key message in this book Mastering a new skill isn’t about the results you achieve, the recognition you get from your peers or  even repetitive practice that helps you get there. Instead, mastery is a path that you can follow to ensure your new endeavors are shaped by ongoing learning, passionate and patient practice and a rediscovery of your own human potential.  Actionable advice: Turn your dishwashing into mastery practice. Next time you’re doing the dishes, don’t just try to finish them as quickly as possible. Instead, take a moment before you start and consider how you could do them in the most effective way. Then, once you begin, be mindful of every movement you make, taking care to do things well, rather than forcing yourself to rush. Though doing the dishes will feel slower this way at first, you’ll soon find that a more considered approach is faster and cleaner! Got feedback?

Glei","summary":"“Follow your passion.” At some point in your life, you’ve probably heard this advice. But is it any good? Well, you might be passionate about the concept of being a rock star, but unless you have some serious musical chops, it probably isn’t the smartest thing to blindly pursue that goal. And you’ve probably noticed that having a natural talent for something often makes doing that something more enjoyable. Of course, skills can be developed and honed – but there’s often something that we’re naturally good at and naturally enjoy doing, whether it’s science, math, art or baking. That’s what maximizing your potential is all about: lining up your natural talent and your passion. These blinks, inspired by the thinking of experts and influencers such as Cal Newport and Joshua Foer, show how anyone can easily reach their potential. Inside, you’ll learn Why you shouldn’t focus on a job title How you can increase your luck And why asking for help makes you look good Do you wonder how some people simply seem to find the job they love doing? You might think it’ll happen to you, too, as long as you stay true to your passion and let it guide you. That might sound nice, but it’s a bit off the mark. When people really find happiness at work it often has less to do with what the job entails and more about the culture and lifestyle of the job. For instance, Bill McKibben loves his job as an environmental journalist. But this happiness doesn’t come from a passion for writing or a devotion to environmental issues. Rather, McKibben is happy about the control he has in deciding when and where he works. He also likes that his writing has a positive impact on the world. In his case, journalism was just one of many options that could have allowed him to meet these conditions for happiness. McKibben’s career also reveals how skill is more important than passion in helping you reach your career goals. After all, passion won’t get you very far if you don’t have the skills to back it up. McKibben wasn’t a highly skilled journalist when he was an undergrad, writing his first articles for the Harvard Crimson newspaper. It took a lot of practice and tenacity – and over 400 articles! – before he was skilled enough to work for The New Yorker. But he didn’t stop there. He kept honing his skills, until he finally felt confident enough to be his own boss. Only then did he quit his job and retreat to a cabin in upstate New York to write his first book. So, ultimately, McKibben got to where he wanted to be through hard work and focusing on his craft. The rapid rate at which technology is advancing affects everyone. It can even make you feel uncertain about how much longer your position will exist, or be taken over by robots. So what can you do to protect yourself? One way of resting a little easier is to focus on a mission, not your job title. After all, not long ago the term “app designer” didn’t mean anything. Job titles can disappear just as quickly as they pop up! So rather than betting on the staying power of a specific role, create a mission for yourself that says what you want to accomplish and which problems you want to solve. This way, for example, instead of becoming an “online innovation director,” you can be clearer about the value of your mission by being someone who wants to develop innovative ways of publishing books online. Also, while you might feel uncertain about the future, you don’t have to feel like luck isn’t on your side. Luck isn’t some mysterious force. It’s something you can cultivate by being both alert and open to all of life’s possibilities. For example, one way to seemingly be presented with a lucky opportunity is to meet the right person. You could call these “lucky chance encounters,” but you can also make them more likely to happen by putting yourself out there, meeting people and networking rather than staying glued to your computer. Even if your job is writing, you can make sure to make time to meet up with friends. You never know – one friend might have another friend whose sister runs a publishing company. The more people you meet, the more inspiration you’ll get for stories and characters, as well as career opportunities. So don’t think of luck as something that only happens to other people. Good things can happen to you as long as you’re open and receptive to life’s infinite possibilities. When you start your day, which of these attitudes best describes your outlook? I’m going to be good at my job. Or, I’m going to get better at my job. For the benefit of your career, you should be striving for a get-better attitude. Someone with a be-good attitude wants to prove that she is very capable. She doesn't focus on how to get better, but on being good. In fact, it makes her uncomfortable when people excel when she doesn’t. On the other hand, someone with a get-better attitude will see someone with superior skills as a chance to learn and acquire new skills, which is an opportunity she’s always on the lookout for. In fact, the get-better person doesn’t compare themselves to others. Instead, she measures her growth by comparing her work from today to her work from yesterday. With her focus on learning and growing, the get-better person handles setbacks well, doesn’t give up and sees challenges as just another opportunity for improvement. If you tend to approach work with a be-good attitude, don’t despair. The brain is highly adaptable and can always be trained to learn better habits. How? First of all, don’t be afraid to make mistakes. There are a number of studies that show how people who freely acknowledge the possibility for errors are actually less likely to make a mistake. In fact, by giving yourself the freedom to mess up, you are preparing yourself to notice and catch those mistakes when they arrive. Another habit you can start is to not be afraid to ask for help. After all, you can’t improve or learn if you don’t admit that you need help and allow someone to teach you. If you’re afraid of looking dumb, well – don’t be. Studies show that, when you ask for help, the person you ask will tend to see you as more capable, not less. Keeping a diary or daily journal shouldn’t seem like a childish thing to do. After all, Che Guevara, Virginia Woolf and Andy Warhol are just a few examples of the impressive people who’ve kept a diary. But journaling isn’t just a way to make a record for posterity, it’s also a way for you to write down thoughts and ideas and be your own sounding board. A sounding board is another person or group of people that can provide feedback on your thoughts. Of course, not all of us are lucky enough to have access to bright individuals who are capable and willing to nurture our ideas. So capture all your thoughts and sparks of inspiration in the pages of a journal and be your own sounding board. This way, moments of brilliance won’t get lost or forgotten, and when you’re searching for you next big idea you can look back and see which ones still have potential and deserve some nurturing. But for a journal to really work like a sounding board, you can’t just jot something down and leave it behind. You need to revisit those old pages regularly. Finding a regular time to look back at your ideas – and nurturing the good ones! – is just as important as developing a daily journaling habit. You can help make sure your journaling habit sticks by finding a regular time to write, even if it’s just ten minutes, and finding a peaceful place to write in. By making it the same time and location, you will ritualize the activity and increase the chances that it continues. There’s no need to put overwhelming pressure on yourself, either. Start out with a small goal of writing an entry every day for a week. When that works, keep it going for a month. From there, it will gradually become a normal part of your day. Life is full of ups and downs, and this extends to your working relationships as well. It doesn’t matter what business you’re in, eventually you’ll run into a problem with a new employee, a new boss or a troublesome supplier. Try to remember, though, that the ideal business relationship is a strong collaboration where both parties happily get what they want. The way to build this kind of relationship is to form a social contract that lays out the terms of how you’ll be collaborating. Social contracting is a practice that was first introduced in the 1981 book Flawless Consulting, by the management expert Peter Block. He made it clear that a strong social contract clearly focuses on how to collaborate. You get to the how by asking about and articulating what each party wants. You might find this a difficult thing to put into precise words, but it’s in your best interest to try. Once you clearly define what you expect from the relationship, it’ll be a whole lot easier to manage. And be honest! Even if your main goal in a collaboration is to get a promotion, it’s best to be up front about it, because for the collaboration to work you need to find a way to align your goal with your partner’s goal. So ask questions and find out what you can provide the other person – and what they’re ready to provide for you. Prior relationships can help you as well. Talk about what’s worked in the past as well as what hasn’t worked and what you want to avoid. As you’re building your social contract, take turns telling each other what happened in the perfectly successful relationships you had in the past. And ask your new partner what it was that their previous partner did to make it work so well. In prehistoric times, our life expectancy wasn’t very high. Dangerous animals, exposure to extreme weather and any number of other dangers were waiting around every corner. So it’s no wonder that, even though the world has changed, our instincts are still highly attuned to avoiding risk. There’s no escaping the fact that we live in an unpredictable world and that it’s impossible for us to know every possible outcome to the decisions we make. No matter how much information you collect, no matter how much you try to make the most informed decision possible, you can still be left with doubts and worries over whether you made the right choice. These fears are part of our innate aversion to risk, but you can train your brain to focus on the opportunities that are part of the decisions you make, rather than the potential pitfalls. How many times did you say no to something that sounded exciting yet too risky? Did you ever stop to think about the potential benefits? This isn’t to suggest that you should ignore risks altogether, but, there’s no reason to fixate on them either. Let’s end on a classic example of an interesting time for The Coca-Cola Company. In 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down, Coca-Cola’s German management team wanted to take the opportunity to expand into East Germany. However, the division president at the time, Don Keough, quickly dismissed the idea as too costly and risky. But the management team didn’t give up. Instead, they threatened to quit! So Keough gave it a second thought and agreed to travel to East Germany, where his eyes were finally opened to some great opportunities. Eventually, the company purchased a couple of plants and expanded their business into the East. And sure enough, they encountered plenty of pitfalls – but they overcame each one and the area went on to become a profitable market. There’s nothing special in finding things to worry about.

Some are highly productive and help the company move forward, while others just settle in for the ride without contributing much. So how do you create an organization in which everyone helps push toward a common goal? Part of the answer lies in expecting more of everyone in the company. People grow when those around them have higher expectations of them. It’s also important that those who contribute more, who are more engaged and motivated to move the company toward its goals, get to shine and receive the credit they deserve. Everyone in the company should try to learn from them.  In these blinks, you’ll learn what the Flintstones have to do with creating a more successful company; why every organization is like a big bus; and what’s wrong with work ethics in the United States today. For business owners, it’s a tough world out there. But luckily there are a few simple tools for improving ourselves, motivating others and helping our companies succeed.  First, cultivate high expectations of yourself and others. In other words, set goals to accomplish more, be better and succeed faster.  But here’s the thing: high expectations don’t mean bupkis if you aren’t accountable. Meaning, if you expect a lot from someone, you have to make it possible for them to deliver by clearly communicating what you expect. For instance, you might ask them to prepare two pages on a specific subject by tomorrow morning.  And if they don’t come through, deliver the message again with more clarity and specificity. You should be encouraging and make sure you don’t communicate everything all at once. By making requests in small doses, you’ll make it possible for the other person to take it one thing at a time.  Consider Ron Clark’s eponymous Ron Clark Academy, an award-winning nonprofit middle school in Atlanta. The institution makes a point of educating its teachers, thus sending them into the classroom with energy and passion. When it conducts staff seminars, the school motivates teachers by challenging them, helping them set high expectations for their own classroom performance.  To show others how to adapt this model, Ron Clark developed the following metaphor: imagine a bus in a Flintstones cartoon. There’s no engine, so your team has to push the bus to get it to move. The bus stands for your goals: you’ll only be able to move the bus (i.e., reach your goals) if everyone performs together at a high level.  The “everyone” part is really crucial: each member of the team – no matter what their role – has a contribution to make. And in the end, you’ll only succeed by working together.  Let’s stick with the bus metaphor to understand how it works. On our Flintstones bus, people have different roles.  First, there’s the Driver – steering the team, pushing everyone forward. Then there are the Runners, who are top performers. Next we’ve got the Joggers: these are conscientious, diligent workers doing a good job. Then come the Walkers, who contribute little forward momentum. And then finally, the Riders: essentially dead weight. In an organization, Drivers are the managers; they give direction and support. Drivers should make the Runners their first priority: these workers want to be part of something special. They typically contribute many new ideas, have a strong work ethic and don’t make excuses. In other words, Runners put their job first. And if you let them, they’ll be the backbone of your organization. Just make sure you don’t crush their spirit with criticism – instead give them direction and support.  Meanwhile, Joggers don’t regularly exceed expectations, but when called upon, they will switch into high gear. Typically, these workers believe that they’re already doing their best and lack the confidence to try harder. But at the same time, they burn for recognition.  Next come the Walkers, who perform slowly but steadily. Walkers don’t like change and they often complain, which slows others down and spreads negativity throughout the organization.  But they’re still far better than Riders, who only perform when someone is watching, choosing to hide behind the team instead. These workers are often smart, but they lack a work ethic. Turning them into Walkers is tough, since they’re only likely to become motivated once fired. That makes it very hard to handle them.  Nonetheless, Walkers and Joggers do have the potential to become Runners. And in the following blinks, we’ll figure out how to make that happen. If you want to improve your organization, you must adopt the habits and behaviors of a Runner. Start with the easy parts: show up early, put in the time to perform well and always dress your best.  That last point might seem trivial, but if you want to be a Runner, you should have no dress-down days with regards to your clothing or your performance. By dressing well, you’re displaying your engagement and commitment to your job. You should also be mindful of how you communicate. Make sure you never participate in negative conversations. Instead, either change topics or pose the question: “How can we make things better?” Positive conversations are the only way to produce positive results and empower those around you.  One more thing: make sure you complete tasks. If you have something on your plate, finish it. That way you will show others that you can meet high expectations.  The best way to speed up your progress is by learning from Runners themselves. Ask for help: this won’t show weakness; it’ll let others know that you care about your performance. (Plus, networking with high achievers will help you move forward in the future.) But when you reach out to Runners, make sure you’re open to their criticism. After all, you’re trying to improve. And you might not be able to see what others see – so take their advice and make the best of it.  For example, if your boss points out a mistake, there is only one acceptable answer: “I am sorry. It will never happen again.” That way, instead of having a long conversation about it, you can simply show your boss that you’ve heard their feedback. And then you can both move on.  But what happens if you just don’t have it in you to become a Runner? Keep reading to find out. You don’t have to be a Runner to play a vital role in your organization. But you do have to put the needs of the organization ahead of your desire to reap rewards. Personal rewards will come to you – but first you have to know your role. If you’re not a Runner and you want to become one, start by taking on menial tasks, take the hint when your ideas are put down and listen more than you talk. Be present in meetings, look others in the eye while they’re talking and be attentive: show that you value other people’s ideas by taking notes.  And when you do voice ideas in meetings, always ensure you present solutions. If your solution doesn’t work, try again. Show that you’re a solutions person and pretty soon, people might start to see you as a Runner. It’s also hugely important to be highly credible: honor your commitments and complete your tasks. You should also smile a lot to show your positive spirit.  Following those tips might help you become a Runner. But in the meantime, step aside to let the already established Runners reap their rewards.  This might seem counterintuitive: contemporary work culture has created an environment of entitlement. Many of us feel that we deserve bonuses and high paychecks, as though everyone on the team deserves a trophy, and not just the Most Valuable Player. But that sends the wrong message: you shouldn’t get something if someone else worked harder for it. Unfortunately, today many people have forgotten how to work hard, but it’s important to remember that you don’t deserve an award just for showing up. We’ve discussed how to become a Runner and how to work with other Runners. But what do you need to know to succeed as a driver? The Driver is the boss: you map the route, you give directions, you ask for support.  It’s a vital role, but sometimes Drivers worry that the Runners will overtake them. Don’t think that way! For the team to succeed, Runners and Drivers have to work together. At first, Runners rely on their Driver for management and direction. But if the Driver doesn’t allow the Runners to shine they will feel unappreciated and slow down. The Driver can prevent that by motivating employees, protecting them from jealousy and making sure they aren’t constrained.  Then, after taking care of the Runners, the Driver can turn their attention to other staffers. Joggers need support to become their best selves: to help boost their performance, tell them what you like about their work and give directions with praise. Walkers can also improve. These workers typically lack role models – they have never learned how to have a strong work ethic. With Walkers, you need to be explicit about your high expectations – but if you guide them, they will grow. Help them cultivate a willingness to learn, grow and improve.  Like Walkers, Riders are hopeless without role models. You have to decide whether they have the capacity to improve and make a worthwhile contribution to the organization. If so, start them out on grunt work and spend time guiding them. If that doesn’t work, kick them out.  And lastly, focus on the workplace culture. Make sure each member of your staff has the tools they need to meet your high expectations. Then make the journey toward your goals fun and enjoyable.  To that end, creating space for special moments and joking around will boost productivity and produce an inspiring environment. For that to work, it’s hugely important that you show your appreciation on an individual basis.  Last tip: whenever you receive a reward, don’t take it for granted – otherwise, that’ll be your last reward! The key message in this book: If you want to build a successful organization, don’t waste your time coddling underperformers. Instead, make high achievers your priority: these top workers are the ones bringing speed, creativity and energy into your organization. And if you can keep them motivated, they’ll be the backbone of your organization.  Actionable advice: Credibility is everything.  If you want to play a significant role in any kind of organization, you must be credible. Otherwise, people won’t feel that they can rely on you to do what’s best for the team. And the thing is, once you lose your credibility, it’s almost impossible to gain it back. That’s why you should always honor your commitments and take responsibility for your mistakes.

Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. For most young people graduating from college today, securing any job at all seems to be little more than a dream. And even if they do find something, the paychecks of a typical corporate job will do nothing to help with their mountains of debt. These blinks encourage you to forget working for the Man. Forget about outdated, traditional business practices and the glut of business books repackaging the same old coaching advice. These blinks offer practical tips and advice that were hard-won through both success and failure in the real world. So roll up your shirtsleeves and get to work! In these blinks, you’ll learn: how good the odds of success are – or aren’t – for start-ups; how to write a better business plan in a paragraph; and why Facebook isn’t a marketing panacea. So you’ve got an idea for a successful business, one that you really believe in. Congratulations! But no matter how good your idea is, the numbers aren’t great; as the U.S. Small Business Association notes, a third of small businesses fail by their second year, and less than half last four years. Clearly, you can’t count on success, no matter how good your idea is. In fact, when it comes to starting a business, there’s only one thing you can be certain of – that it won’t be easy. So it’s best to accept that fact and check your expectations before you begin. First of all, you should accept that you’re guaranteed to fail along the way. But despite what most people think, this isn’t always bad. Analyzing failures teaches you valuable lessons that help you avoid failure in the future. Also, expect that things will never go according to plan. Successful entrepreneurs know that things change every day, so it’s impossible to predict the future. That’s why they don’t hang their hopes on everything going right according to some “perfect plan.” Instead, they plan for rock bottom. That means looking at any scenario and imagining its worst possible outcome in order to be prepared for it. To do that, there are four steps that you should take before making any business decision. Step one is looking at pros and cons in order to assess the risks. Is the best possible outcome so good that it outweighs the risks of the worst? Or are the two more evenly balanced, making the action riskier? Next, figure out what the consequences will be if things don’t work out. For example, if your business’s financial health could potentially be wiped out in your rock-bottom outcome, you need to realize that ahead of time. The third step is figuring out whether the thing that you’re considering doing would seem like a good idea at any point in time. If not – if you can imagine yourself regretfully looking back at it as having seemed like a good idea “at the time” – you should definitely think twice before proceeding. Finally, examine your alternatives. If your number one plan doesn’t work out, what’s next? Could, in fact, plan number two be a better option in the first place? It may not be as fun as imagining a scenario where everything works out perfectly, but being prepared for every eventuality makes you a more resilient entrepreneur in the long run. Let’s face it: when you start a business from scratch, there’s a ton of uncertainty, and you don’t have a lot of knowledge or resources at your disposal. But whining about it is a waste of time. Instead, you need to make the most of what you do know. Start by showing who you really are. By being authentic in your interactions with customers, you become more relatable, and it makes customers like and respect you. For example, if you’re a sci-fi loving tech person, wear your Star Trek pin when you meet with a client whose computer is on the fritz. The same idea goes for resources, too. So you can’t afford a fleet of delivery trucks for your product. But what do you have? Can you borrow your mom’s car for deliveries for the time being instead? Now you know what your assets are. But before you’re ready to start up, you need to ensure that you can actually deliver. Chances are, if you’re passionate enough to start a business, the idea is already based on a hobby that you really love. And while loving what you do is important, it’s not enough. There are four key points that you’ll need to look at before you can turn that hobby into a business you can actually deliver on. First, is your hobby really enough to support a business? It’s great that you love working with your Legos, but it’s tough to see the revenue in that. Second, are you really enough of an expert at your hobby that people should pay you to do it? If you want people to pay to see your driftwood sculptures, they’d better be more than just “okay.” Third, don’t assume that others will share your passion. Are there really enough people interested in visiting an expertly handcrafted driftwood sculpture garden? Or is that a little niche? Fourth, make sure it’s realistic that you can make it happen on your own. You’re not a world-renowned sculptor yet, so you’re not going to be able to hire a team of underlings to do the work for you. If answering these questions makes you confident that you can deliver, then it’s time to get the ball rolling. It’ll be much easier now that you know what you have to work with. When you start a new business, everyone typically insists that a crucial first step is a cumbersome, painstakingly detailed business plan. But instead of wasting time on one, you should be focused on building the business itself. For this, you need a practical tool for the real world: a One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan. A One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan lets you test your ideas by doing, and it creates an action strategy that grows and changes along the way together with your business. To create your plan, first ask yourself fundamental questions about your business: What is your product or service you’re offering? Who are your primary clients? How do you plan to generate immediate revenue? Answer these questions by writing down a maximum of one or two sentences for each. Each answer is a hypothesis about your business, and the paragraph that results will be a rough draft of your One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan. Next, turn your plan into lists filled with action steps, called Guess and Checklists. From each sentence in your plan, generate five points you can put into action right now. Use them to make a chronological checklist, including deadlines and expenses for each item. One hypothesis in the author’s plan described his start-up’s clientele as boutique PR firms, for example. So his first point was to make a list of all the boutique PR firms that existed in his area. The next was to look up contact info for each. Each time you complete a step on a checklist, evaluate it. What worked? What did you learn? Which steps can now be modified for the future? Now go back to your hypotheses. Were they true, false or incomplete? Continue to evolve your plan by eliminating the hypotheses and action steps that didn’t work and improving on those that did. The process of revising the hypothesis about his clientele took the author two months. In that time, he refined his clientele from boutique PR firms to independent PR specialists and brand managers, as well as senior account executives at boutique PR firms and marketing agencies. After two months, he had a proven, tested marketing formula that he still uses today! That doesn’t mean that he quit coming up with new hypotheses, of course. A One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan is an organic, living plan that’s integral to your business’ evolution, not some stuffy formal document. As long as your business is growing and evolving, your Plan should too. Choosing a potential business partner is a tricky business. Some partnerships click, and the business thrives as a result. Others... well, others can be like a bad marriage, or worse. So just like in a marriage, it’s important to be sure before you commit. There are five important questions you should ask yourself before diving into a partnership. First, are you sure you need a partner? Will she bring something to the table that you can’t? If so, could you bring that thing in without involving another shareholder? Maybe just hiring someone would do the trick. Next, ask whether a standard partnership is the best model. A partner with a dynamite idea for a new product but zero business acumen might end up just hindering you. In that case, something like a licensing deal or a joint venture might be a better idea, with all of the benefits and none of the loss of equity. If a partnership really is the best arrangement, what about your prospective partner? If you had to, could you defend your choice without a shadow of a doubt? What about your reasons for choosing her? Does she bring assets and skills to the table that complement yours? Do your goals really align? If your answers reveal any reservations, keep looking. Settling for someone who isn’t right will just undermine your business in the long run. Fourth, could the partnership work in theory and in practice? To make sure, consider a trial period in which you can both test out working together. Establish some short-term goals, and see what working together to achieve them reveals. Chances are that within just days or weeks, it will be clear how well you align. Finally, make sure your agreement is clear to both people and put everything down in writing. Things can seem rosy in the early stages of working together, and having things on paper might feel unnecessary. But clearly defining things like equity ownership, corporate responsibilities and rules for company stock purchases will pay off if things go badly and you end up in court. As tempting as it might be to dive in headfirst, you and your business will be glad that you took that time to ask these questions. It pays to look before you leap! An entrepreneur has freedoms that an employee doesn’t have. On the other hand, an entrepreneur doesn’t get to go home and call it a day at 5:00 p.m. An entrepreneur’s lifestyle is not a “normal” one because, ultimately, you are your business. It’s a symbiotic relationship where the time you put in is what allows both you and your business to thrive, especially in the beginning. That’s a time when you’ll be at maximum hustle, wearing all the hats there are to wear. Some of these hats will fit, while others might be uncomfortable. Maybe you’re great at budgeting, but cold-calling customers gives you nightmares. Never fear. You’ll figure it out – because you have to! At this stage of the game, anything that you aren’t willing to do simply won’t get done. What’s more, you’ll need to intimately understand each aspect of your business before you’re able to hire someone else to do it. To make all of this possible, you'll need to design a power routine, which allows you to tailor your life around your entrepreneurial strategy in a way that’s focused and productive. Here’s how. For starters, you’ll need to work every day for an entire month. Putting in seven days a week for a month might not be easy, but it will give you the information you need. Note your big successes during this time, and write down the days and times when they occurred. Next, categorize each of these successes as one of three things: strategic planning, internal operations or revenue generation. Working on your One-Paragraph Start-Up Plan is a strategic planning activity, for example, whereas contacting vendors is internal operations. Discussing a project with clients is, of course, revenue generation. Now look at the successes and failures in your schedule. When did you do best in certain categories? When did your slow periods happen? Try to figure out why your productivity ebbed and flowed when it did; then tweak your schedule to capitalize on this. For example, if you’ve been successfully generating revenue from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Wednesdays, and Sunday afternoons are best for strategic planning, take advantage of this by locking it into your schedule. Keep adjusting your power routine until you’re confident that it’s perfect. Then commit to your routine and stick to that commitment. That means that if Saturday afternoons are your sweet spot for successful internal operations work, then you’ll have to skip plans with friends that day. Your schedule is meant to revolve around maximum results for your business, not socializing. You’ve got to make a professional impression – everyone knows this. That’s why businesses spend huge amounts of cash on design, messaging and consultants. A start-up isn’t going to be flush with cash right at the beginning, though. That’s why it helps to know a few savvy tricks that can make you look like a winner without breaking the bank. It all starts with your website – the most important component of your brand. A website that makes you look like a big fish should be, above all, simple. Quick to load and easy to navigate will beat complicated or beautiful every time, and you don’t need an expert programmer or designer to make that happen. Try one of the many inexpensive, subscription-based service providers online, like Weebly. They offer online tools for your business, along with useful templates, and they can get your site up and running fast. Best of all? The upfront costs are low, and you can easily update your content yourself. But what about other costly investments, like expert advice? While business coaches and self-appointed experts are everywhere these days, a lot of them just offer repackaged common sense sprinkled with advice that anyone can get off of the internet. What’s more, they charge hundreds of dollars for it! So save your money and a lot of frustration. Instead, think about lunch. First, figure out what kind of information you’re looking for. Then brainstorm a long list of people who might be able to help, and figure out how you might be connected to them. Social networking sites are a great tool for this, and you can turn to your existing network of friends and contacts to ask for introductions. Once you’ve figured out your contacts, pick about 10 people from your long list and reach out to invite them to lunch. Make this a personal invitation, with information about yourself, your connection to each person, and what you think he or she might know that could help you. Then make that lunch count! Plan what you’d like to discuss and stick to it. Really listen to what your lunchtime consultant has to say. Also, no matter how useful the information is or isn’t, be gracious and follow up with a thank-you email. If you’re savvy enough to create a website and reach out to people like a pro, you should be able to act like a pro too. So your business is up and running – now how do you reach out to customers? Social media is a great marketing tool, but contrary to popular belief, just putting your name out there isn’t going to bring in customers. For that, you need effective marketing to get a well-crafted message out there in a targeted way. The first step is to create a brand language. This consists of words and key phrases that describe what you do. Just three or four should be enough as you’re getting started. These should be bold enough to grab and keep customers’ attention. With time and focus, they’ll be synonymous with your business in consumers’ minds. Think about the term “online search”; anyone who hears it will probably think of Google right away. The next step is an active brand message – a single, easy-to-read sentence of about eight words. An active brand message combines promotion with establishing expectations about what your company actually does. For example; a math tutoring service’s brand message might be something like “multiply your math successes by subtracting the confusion.” Now you’ll want to make sure that the distribution channels for your marketing fit the goals in your active brand message. The key idea here is to target carefully; just spamming every available channel is lazy and ineffective. So is sticking to a single channel. Despite what some people might think, Facebook isn’t a good fit for every marketing message. Let’s say that you want to market a dog-walking service, for example. You could rely on posting to social media. But what about a small flier that you give away at dog parks instead – or better still, offering a free dog treat in exchange for dog owners’ contact information? That’s much more direct than a Facebook post, and it does more, too. Beyond just attracting attention, it encourages immediate action in the form of giving contact info. Action generates revenue, and at the end of the day, that should be the goal of all marketing activity, since it’s revenue, not “buzz,” that will grow a start-up. Remember, keep your marketing goals clear and targeted – in fact, keep all your goals this way. Striking out on your own will be a wild ride, and you’ll need all the clarity you can get! The key message in these blinks: Being an entrepreneur isn’t easy, and it isn’t for the faint of heart. But it does offer independence and the satisfaction that comes from handling every challenge that comes your way. If you’re willing to put in the hours, and if you have savvy and a whole lot of hustle, you’ll ditch your “real” job in no time and never look back.  Actionable advice: Prioritize your health.  Starting up requires a huge commitment, but that doesn’t mean working 24/7. If you want to be able to keep working in the long term, you also need to take care of yourself. That means scheduling some downtime to decompress and also making a habit of exercise. This doesn’t have to be overly ambitious; it can just be a matter of doing simple exercises, such as push-ups or stretches, which you can do in the privacy of your bedroom. Your business will benefit from you feeling your best. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Most of us fail to convince others on a fairly regular basis. No matter how hard we try, our pleas fall on deaf ears. That’s because we aren’t negotiating right. And that’s exactly where these blinks come in. You’ll find out the secrets of successful negotiation from none other than Chriss Voss, once the FBI’s number one international kidnapping negotiator. You will also learn: which emotional characteristic is your strongest weapon; what kind of voice to use when negotiating; and how labeling can save lives. People tend to think of negotiation as something reserved for lawyers and corporate board rooms, but the truth is, humans negotiate in every part of life. In other words, while negotiating is what the police do when dealing with hostage situations, it’s also something that happens at work, at home, with your partner and with your kids. In a simple sense, negotiation is just trying to get things to go your way; it’s having an interaction or communication with a specific outcome in mind. Whenever two or more people want something from one another, negotiation is taking place. Say you want a raise and your boss wants your salary to stay where it is. Or maybe you want your kids to go to bed by eight, but they want to stay up till ten. OK, so negotiation is more common than most people think. But what makes for a successful negotiator? It’s more than just mathematical logic and a keen intellect. That’s because humans aren’t always rational; they often fail to act on the basis of logic or reason. To make matters more complicated, humans aren’t always predictable either. People often act based on their animal nature, which is irrational, spontaneous and a bit wild. That’s precisely what the psychologist Daniel Kahneman and the economist Amos Tversky found after years of study. Their findings challenged conventional thinking on negotiation. Here’s how. In the 1970s, when negotiation first became defined as a field, it was based on the assumption that each individual acted rationally and to her own advantage. However, Tversky and Kahneman’s research discovered that humans are prone to what’s called cognitive bias, which makes them unconsciously irrational. They even identified 150 different types of biases, including the so-called framing effect; this concept states that, when faced with the same options, people will make different choices depending on how the alternatives are framed. Simply put, to be a successful negotiator, your approach has to take into account the complex nature of humankind. In the blinks that follow, you’ll learn how to do just that. Good negotiators approach the bargaining table attempting to gain as much information as possible, both about the situation and their counterpart. Naturally, during this process, new stuff comes to light, so success means being prepared for a bend in the road. For instance, you won’t really know what a hostage-taking terrorist wants or how he’ll behave; he might be armed even though you were told that he wasn’t; he could even feed you incorrect information to lead you astray. A real-life example of such a situation dates back to 1993 when the author was involved in negotiations after a robbery resulted in the taking of three hostages in a Manhattan bank – two bank tellers and a security guard. The robber who communicated with the FBI said that there were four robbers, but he was in fact alone; while his partners had just robbed the ATM, he went for the whole bank, taking hostages in the process. Looking back on the situation, the author realizes that the robber only spread this misinformation to confuse the author and his colleagues, buying himself time to plot his escape. So, information is key, and to get it you need to establish an amicable rapport with your counterpart. That’s why one goal of negotiation is to get the other party to talk a lot. As she does, you’ll be able to figure out what she needs and wants. That being said, nobody is going to provide you with information if they don’t trust you, and that’s why rapport is essential. If you manage to establish it, you’ll build trust in the process, making it much more likely that the other person will divulge useful information. But how can you establish rapport? Explore the next blink to find out. So, you know that trust is key, but how do you establish it? The best route is to engage in active listening, which means showing empathy and demonstrating that you understand what the other person is going through. Several techniques can help. The first is called mirroring, which essentially means repeating what your counterpart says but with an inquisitive tone. Just consider the Manhattan bank robbery negotiation from the previous blink. The robber in that situation, Chris Watts, made continual demands for a vehicle. He mentioned that his own car was gone as his driver had fled. Hearing this, the author mirrored it by saying, “Your driver was chased away?” In response, Watts went on to say that the driver had fled when the police arrived on the scene. The author held onto this information, along with other tidbits he teased out through mirroring, many of which assisted the FBI and NYPD in apprehending the driver. But why does mirroring work? Largely because it makes the other person feel that you’re similar to him. After all, your counterpart is only human and will naturally be drawn to similarities. That’s because, just like other animals, people like to be in groups with similar traits. Doing so gives us a sense of belonging and forges trust. This is powerful in a negotiation: when your counterpart starts to trust you, he will become more likely to talk and find a solution. To test the effects of this approach more scientifically, the psychologist, Richard Wiseman conducted an experiment in which waiters would take orders from customers. One group of waiters was asked to use mirroring while the other was asked to utilize positive reinforcement through phrases like “no problem” and “great.” In the end, the waiters who mirrored the orders made by customers received much higher tips, earning 70 per cent more than the other group. Have you ever been upset with another person not because of what she said, but because of how she said it? Well, it makes sense since intonation and the human voice are powerful tools that you can use in successful negotiating. For instance, if the other party is likely to become upset or nervous, you should employ a deep but soft voice, or what the author has called your Late-Night FM DJ voice. By being slow and reassuring, this tone is sure to have a profound effect on the other person. After all, it’ll comfort him, making him more likely to share the information you’re looking for. At a certain point during the bank robbery negotiation, the author had to take over communication with the robber from his colleague, Joe. To prevent Watts from growing upset or nervous due to the shift, the author told him in a deep, calm voice that Joe was out and he was in. It was put forward in such a downward-inflecting manner, radiating calmness and reason, that Watts didn’t even flinch. That being said, most situations call for a different tone, namely your positive/playful voice. This voice communicates that you’re easygoing and empathetic; it puts things in a positive light with an encouraging attitude. If you smile while speaking, this voice will often come out naturally. Even if your counterpart can’t see your smile, it’ll come through in the tone of your voice. While on vacation in Istanbul, a colleague of the author’s was amazed by his girlfriend’s ability to cut great deals with backstreet spice merchants. He soon realized that she always pushed for better prices, but did so in a playful, positive way. While the merchants were themselves skilled bargainers, her approach drew them in, convincing them to give her a better deal. Try this yourself, when you’re at a store or market! In psychotherapy, progress is made by tapping into and understanding a patient’s emotions. The same goes for negotiation. Rather than ignoring emotions, you have to combine them with empathy to your tactical advantage. However, being empathetic doesn’t necessarily mean agreeing with the other person. It just means attempting to see his perspective. This is where tactical empathy comes into play; it refers to using your understanding of your counterpart’s perspective to better position yourself in the negotiation. One technique to do so is called labeling. It simply refers to telling your counterpart that you understand and acknowledge both his position and feelings. This simple approach works by calming the other person down and making him behave more rationally. Just take a 2007 study by psychologist Matthew Lieberman at the University of California. Lieberman showed participants pictures of people expressing a strong emotion, thereby activating their amygdalas, the brain area responsible for fear. However, when the same participants were asked to state what emotions they saw, their brains experienced activity in the areas related to rational thinking. Or consider an example from 1998 when four prison fugitives, believed to be in possession of automatic weapons, hid out in a Harlem apartment. The author figured out what they were feeling and then labeled those feelings; he told them that he knew they didn’t want to leave the apartment, that they were worried that if they opened the door, they would be shot and that they must be scared of going back to prison. After six hours of dead silence, the fugitives surrendered and later told the author that he had calmed them down. In other words, his labeling had worked. He simply understood and acknowledged their emotions, reaching a favorable outcome in the process. Have you ever been in such a hurry to settle a dispute that you ended up unhappy with the final result? Nobody wants that, and it’s crucial to remember that accepting a bad deal or even compromising is always a mistake. This is called splitting the difference, and you’ve got to avoid it at all costs. After all, every human, your counterpart included, has thoughts and needs that she won’t share or maybe isn’t even aware of. When your counterpart asks for something, you can never be sure if she actually wants it, so giving her what she asks for won’t necessarily solve the issue. Say someone is holding a politician hostage and saying that he’ll cut off her head unless he receives one million dollars. While the hostage-taker says that money is what he’s after, he might want to make a political point. If that’s true, and you give him the ransom, there’s no telling if he’ll release the hostage. For the same reason, it’s essential to take your time, even when your counterpart sets deadlines. Remember, your job is to learn about the other party and, if you’re pressed for time, chances are your judgment will be clouded. It’s important that you avoid this. It can help to remember that most deadlines are flexible and relatively random. Just take an example in which the wife of a Haitian police officer was kidnapped. The kidnappers demanded $150,000 and, following weeks of negotiation, the author saw a pattern; as Friday approached, the kidnappers would push extra hard for the ransom before laying low for the weekend. He realized that they wanted to party and, to do so, they needed money! Understanding this, the author could ascertain that the deadlines weren’t so serious and that he could negotiate a much lower price since you don’t need $150,000 to have a good time in Haiti. As in all other negotiations, patience, time and information were critical for a successful outcome. The key message in this book: By employing a few simple techniques and understanding where the other party is coming from, you can negotiate your way through just about any situation, whether it’s with your boss, your partner at home, or your local used-car dealer. The key is to stay calm and establish trust with the other person. Actionable advice: Be prepared for the extreme. In one respect, negotiation is just like war:  it’s crucial to know your enemy. That’s why you should always let your counterpart make the first offer. That being said, you should also be prepared for this initial offer to be extreme. In fact, it’s entirely normal for first offers to be far afield of your expectations. Just keep in mind that this only represents the limit for your counterpart and you can almost certainly get a much better deal.   Got feedback?

Frankel","summary":"Did you know that, even after years of progress in women’s rights, women all over the world still earn consistently less than men? Women are also less likely to hold highly influential positions. For example, they make up a mere 3.8 percent of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Even in Western countries, women are still not on an equal footing with men. There are many reasons for this inequality, most of which can’t be changed by one woman alone. Yet there’s one thing women can change: if you’re a woman, chances are good that over time you’ve learned to unconsciously sabotage yourself. For example, you may avoid assertive behavior for fear of being labeled “bossy” or find yourself reluctant to compete because competing is “unfeminine.” Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office will make you aware of the typical mistakes that prevent women from reaching their full potential. It will help you learn how to stand your ground in a competitive environment, such as the workplace, and find the right balance between embracing your femininity and not making the wrong move in a game still ruled by men. In these blinks, you’ll find out: why some girls sigh in relief when they lose a game of Monopoly, why smiling less might be the key to getting that promotion, why you could work 24 hours a day and still not get promoted, and why there’s nothing immoral about capitalizing on your relationships. Did you know that, until 1934, an American woman would lose her citizenship if she married a man from another country? Or that, until 1977, a married West-German woman wasn’t allowed to sign her own work contract without her husband’s approval? In many Western countries, men and women weren’t equal before the law until well into the twentieth century. In fact, most American and European women weren’t even allowed to vote before the end of World War I. Since then, women’s rights movements in many Western countries have successfully established near gender equality before the law – but when it comes to their careers, women are still at a disadvantage. For example, women earn consistently less than men. In the United States, Hispanic women make only 59 percent of what Hispanic men earn for the same job. And while Caucasian women fare better, they still earn only 77 percent compared to their male co-workers. Furthermore, in the first year after they finish college, female graduates already earn 8 percent less than their male peers; two decades down the line, the gap increases to 20 percent. But this gap is not only a problem in the United States: women are less likely to hold well-paid and highly influential positions all over the world. In fact, a modest 8 percent of all top executives worldwide are women, and there are no more than twenty female heads of state throughout the world. Have you ever felt guilty for hitting a winning streak at Monopoly? You might be surprised to learn that this reaction is as widespread among women as it is rare in men. Is it due to some natural feminine reluctance to compete or something else at work here? In actuality, girls are raised to strive for sympathy and physical attractiveness – not success or self-assertion. From early childhood on, girls are taught that they will only fare well if they win the sympathy of the people around them. For example, they will be praised and rewarded for being polite and compliant, and punished for being aggressive, whereas boys’ aggressive behavior tends to be tolerated a lot more. How childrens’ toys are gendered also reflect these role expectations. Many toys typically given to girls are associated with attractiveness and mothering, like Barbie dolls, whereas typical toys for boys are related to fighting and competition, like wrestling action figures. But the gendered treatment of girls doesn’t stop there: in adult women, too, assertiveness and competitive behaviors are discouraged. Why? Because they counter social stereotypes of femininity, like being passive, agreeable and compassionate. This means that a level of competitiveness deemed acceptable in men may raise eyebrows when exhibited by a woman. Just imagine the public’s reaction if a female electoral candidate savored her victory over an opponent by violently punching the air! These continual behavioral expectations mean that if a woman acts assertively, just like a man would, she may be ridiculed or criticized for being “bossy.” Imagine a hospital’s new medical director learning that some of the physicians used to drink small amounts of alcohol at work. If she confronts the staff and implements a program of random alcohol testing, chances are that she’ll be called bossy – or even a bitch. Imagine your boyfriend asks you how you’d prefer to spend your joint summer vacation – cycling through Scandinavia or chilling on the beaches of Hawaii. Are you one of the many women who react by asking, “Well, what would you like to do?” As well intentioned a response that may be, this manner of letting another decide for you is best limited to your private life. Why? Because if it’s your job to make a decision and you let others decide in your place, you’ll appear reluctant or incapable of doing your job. Let’s say your boss wants you to decide when to inform your company’s shareholders about a substantial upcoming loss – either right away or after the extent of the loss has been specified. In this case, she explicitly makes it your job to decide what to do next. Therefore, if you respond by asking your boss which course of action she’d take, what you’re really telling her is that you won’t do what she asked. Plus, she’ll get the impression that you’re incapable of making a risky decision. Considering others’ opinions too carefully can damage your professional image in other ways. For example, if you can’t take action without polling everyone, you’ll appear unfit to lead. Why? Because it’s important for a leader to be able to take action quickly and decisively. Imagine your company has the chance to seize a great business opportunity. If you asked your whole team what they thought about it first, it might be so time-consuming that your competitors beat you to it. Furthermore, sometimes leaders have to be responsible for taking unpopular steps, like reducing bonuses. Asking advice from the affected employees would only slow everything down and make things more painful. When you picture some successful female politicians, like Thatcher, Clinton and Merkel, do any of them strike you as particularly feminine? Is that because too much femininity is detrimental to a woman’s career? In a word, yup. For example, it’s very feminine to smile a lot. And although smiling can win you lots of sympathy, it can also distort your message and make you appear less assertive. This is tough for women to control, because they’re raised to smile much more than men, and thus often smile without being conscious of it. Yet smiling makes you look less authoritative and can distort the message you’re trying to deliver. For example, if you’re trying to deliver a serious message, smiling will clash with what you want to communicate. Another smiling issue arises when women smile as they criticize another person. This may be out of habit or due to the desire to soften the message, but it can make a woman look insecure or insincere. Moreover, in situations of potential conflict, a smile could be mistaken for a smirk – and escalate the conflict. Here’s something else women need to be aware of: if you present yourself in an overly feminine way, you’ll distract people from your professional competence and what you want to say. The feminine features of your presentation make a strong impact on other people – at the expense of other aspects of your professional persona. If you tend to style yourself in a noticeably feminine or playful way, those may well be the features that others will associate with your personality – and not your professionalism. For example, if you wear too many accessories to a conference, people might be too mesmerized by the jewels dangling from your ears to listen to the well-founded thoughts you want to share. They say that in every woman there still lives the little girl she used to be. This may be true, but it’s crucial to leave your childhood at home when you enter the office. Why? Because thinking like a little girl will affect your professional judgement. For example, it make sense that many little girls see fathers as authority figures. But if you’re still viewing men in authoritative positions as father figures, you won’t have the objectivity and independence to deal with them in a professional way. If you see your boss as a father figure, your reactions to him might be very emotional. For example, you might find yourself tuning in to his moods rather than paying attention to the information he’s communicating. Furthermore, bending to your boss’s every mood is not part of your job description and might distract you from the tasks that you’re responsible for. And while you might be busy improving your boss’s mood with compliments and home-made cookies, a colleague might earn himself a promotion by solving the problem that fouled your boss’s mood in the first place. Little-girl thinking has other negative consequences for businesswomen. Little girls are often taught to doubt their own knowledge and intuition and, over the years, this self-doubt becomes so deeply ingrained that even seasoned experts in a field will second-guess their judgements when laypeople doubt their expertise. This can lead you to make very bad decisions in spite of the fact that you know more. For example, if you believe that someone you’re negotiating with is better informed than you are, you’re likely to be won over prematurely. But if you’re aware of this tendency, you can pay closer attention and make sure you don’t fall into the little-girl trap. Imagine you’re a manager interviewing two highly qualified applicants for a top position: Would you go for the candidate who sits upright, speaks with a loud voice and accentuates his remarks with lively gestures – or for the one who seems to shrink before your eyes, speaking so softly you wish you wore a hearing aid? Sadly, too many women fit the profile of the second candidate without even realizing it. If women want to make it in the business world, they need to make themselves aware of this behavior because taking up too little space makes you look too timid and insecure for a leadership position. The problem is that women are taught to take up as little space as possible all their lives. They learn to hold their arms close to their bodies, cross their legs at the knees and use few gestures if they give a presentation. And, just as taking up lots of space makes you look confident, taking up too little space conveys another message: that you’re insecure, submissive and unwilling to take risks. Not the ideal self-presentation to win over any manager. Another bad habit women learn as they grow up is using too many qualifiers and minimizers when they speak. If you use qualifiers – e.g., “We have to take committed action, but I might be wrong” – you’ll appear unsure about what you’re saying and, in turn, less convincing and competent. If you use minimizers when you talk about your work or achievements – e.g., “Oh, I’m just a teacher” – then you’re saying that what you are isn’t important. So pay attention to how you talk, try and cut out the minimizers and qualifiers, and you’ll start to appear much more confident. Do you agree that employees show their dedication by working hard and skipping breaks? If so, then how could working hard be detrimental your career? Because if you invest all your time and strength into getting work done, you may miss out on the crucial social aspects of career development. Although delivering high-quality work is important for getting promoted, networking and good teamwork skills play an equally important role. So if you tend to isolate yourself to get more work done instead of chatting with your colleagues, you’ll soon appear like a mediocre team player. Furthermore, working too hard diminishes the quality of your work and actually makes you look ineffective. Productivity experts have found out that a high level of concentration and accuracy – both requisites for high-quality work – can only be maintained when a break is taken every 90 minutes. Furthermore, working without a break can actually give a bad impression: people will think that you’re working so much because you’re inefficient or overwhelmed by your workload. Finally, no matter how hard you work, if you do the wrong kind of work, you won’t get any closer to a promotion. If you’re always busy with low-profile assignments, you’ll never take the risk necessary to catch your superiors’ eye. So what you’re working on is actually far more important than how much you work. Imagine a student who wants to get into a doctoral program. In order to make a good impression on her supervisor, she volunteers to do all the grunt work, like writing protocols and copying scripts for her fellow students. Ultimately, however, the person who’ll get accepted won’t be someone like her but a student who distinguished herself by taking a bold move, like applying to a top research group. Imagine you’re at a party and you’ve just met a charming man. You’re both chatting away when he tells you he’s an executive of the company you’re planning to apply to. Would you ask your new acquaintance to support your application? Most women are reluctant to take advantage of this kind of interaction. But if you’re not willing to capitalize on relationships, you’re missing the whole point of networking and the great chances it offers to push your career forward. Let’s admit it: in the end, whether it’s friendships or workplace connections, the point of every relationship is to trade favors or other things you need. There’s nothing immoral about capitalizing on relationships! Furthermore, relationships are crucial because some immaterial goods, e.g., exclusive positions, are distributed solely via relationships and networks. One way women don’t capitalize on potential relationships is their reluctance to seek out a sponsor, i.e., a mentor who introduces them to people who can help them get promoted, and who uses his or her influence with senior executives to promote them as leaders. So if you shy away from asking someone to be your sponsor, you miss out on a great career accelerator. In fact, it’s been shown that women get fewer promotions than men because they’re less likely to have a sponsor. And women without sponsors are less likely to even try to get a top position. The people you know help pave the path to your own corner office. You might not like it, but working hard while avoiding office politics is not an option – if you’re going for the corner office. The key message in this book: Girls are not traditionally raised to be tough players in the competitive workplace environment. They learn from a very young age to self-sabotage their success by undermining their value in the eyes of others, and by shying away from behaviors traditionally perceived as exclusively male, such as competitiveness. The way to overcome these self-defeating behaviors is to become aware of them and take active steps to correct their negative effects. Actionable advice: Answer only to your name. Whenever someone in business calls you a nickname, they are subtly relegating you to a childlike status. The next time you introduce yourself, make sure to use your full formal name, and only answer when that’s how people address you. Even if people usually call you a nickname, if you establish this new dynamic, people will adjust over time. This simple measure will ensure you’re taken seriously.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

We all want the same things – financial security, personal fulfillment, long-term happiness – and, more often than not, we know what we have to do to get these things. However, our lack of discipline and endless list of excuses can get in the way. So how can you overcome this? That’s the question these blinks set out to answer. Whether you work for a company or run your own business, we’ve selected the most powerful techniques that will help you stop living a life that’s full of excuses. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the Seven-Step Method is; how to do a Disaster Report to conquer your fears; and what delayed gratification can do for your financial freedom. Have you ever wondered how certain individuals, though allotted no more time than most people, manage to accumulate vast wealth and achieve great success? Well, it’s mostly a matter of self-discipline applied to the three fundamental areas of life: personal success, career and overall happiness. You can do this, too. And it’s best to start by becoming disciplined about your personal success. A great way to do that is to learn from the experts in your field. Attend their conferences, read their books and listen to their podcasts. Just consider the author’s San Diego-based dentist. He attended every dental conference he could, and, at a conference in Hong Kong, he learned a technique that transformed his career. At the conference, a Japanese dentist shared a new procedure that permanently improved the appearance of teeth. The author’s dentist immediately began implementing this new technique, and within a few years, clients from all across the United States were booking treatments at his clinic. By the age of 55, he was known as a “dentist’s dentist” and had earned enough money to retire. Is the thought of early retirement appealing to you? Well, then it’s time to accept responsibility in your life. The author learned this the hard way. When he was 21, he worked in construction, earning just enough money to get by. He had no car, no savings and lived in a tiny apartment. Then he had an epiphany: he had to take responsibility and change his life. He had to stop blaming his problems on his childhood and lack of education. The very next day, he began working harder. He also started buying self-help books and dedicating his life to self-improvement. His conscious decision to no longer make excuses or blame others played an important role in his future success. It’s hard sticking to New Year’s resolutions. In January, you’re dedicated to whatever you’ve resolved to do – be it taking a daily jog or quitting smoking. Come February, you find yourself skipping scheduled runs and sneaking forbidden smokes. So why can’t we stick to the program? USA Today reported that, in one study, a mere 4 percent of participants followed through with their resolutions. However, of those who did manage to stick to their resolutions, 44 percent wrote the resolution down. Committing your goals to paper makes it much likelier that you’ll achieve them; the simple act of writing out what you want minimizes distractions and focusses your energy in the right areas. To cash in on the power of the pen (and paper!), use the Seven-Step Method to achieve your goals: Step 1: Decide what you want and be specific. If you want to accumulate more wealth, decide on exactly how much money you want. Or if you want to lose weight, determine exactly how many pounds you wish to shed. Step 2: Write down your specific goal. Step 3: Set a date by which you think you could accomplish it. Be realistic. If it’s a large goal, break it down to sub-deadlines. Step 4: Write down a list of everything you could possibly do to achieve your goal. This includes listing the obstacles that you’ll face and the additional knowledge and skills you’ll need to achieve it. Step 5: Prioritize the most beneficial tasks and add them to your calendar. Your most important tasks should be completed first. Step 6: Start on your tasks right away. Step 7: Do something every day that helps you achieve your goal. In addition to employing the Seven-Step Method, ask for advice on how to achieve your goals more quickly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of seeking advice, consider the story of Bob Barton, one of the author's seminar attendees. Bob wanted to get ahead in his career. He paid close attention to how the senior salespeople at his company talked and dressed, and made a conscious effort to imitate them. This helped, but it wasn't until he asked one of the top salespeople to recommend a book that he really started to see results. They were flattered that he asked them and continued to recommend more books and audio programs. By disciplining himself to read and listen to them, Bob became the best salesperson in the office. Is your fear of failure – like not earning enough money or losing what cash you do have – holding you back from reaching your potential? If so, don’t fret: such fears aren’t hardwired into our brains. They’re learned during life, which means that, with a little willpower, they can be unlearned. An effective aid to overcoming your fears is The Disaster Report, which is comprised of four steps. Step 1: Describe your fear clearly. Step 2: Determine the worst-case scenario. Are you holding back from investing because you’re afraid that you’ll lose all your money in the process? When you confront your fears, they gradually become manageable instead of dominating your thoughts and feelings. Step 3: Find solutions for the worst-case scenario. For example, say you did lose money in the process. Big deal! You can always find a job and earn it back. Fear often stems from an unwillingness to consider the worst possible outcome, so it really does help to confront it. Step 4: Do everything in your power to ensure the worst-case scenario doesn’t play out. Not only will you be so busy making sure that the worst thing doesn’t happen; you also won’t have any time to worry. Another way to overcome your fears is to train yourself to deal with them straight away. For instance, one of the author’s seminar participants was unhappy at work because her boss kept criticizing and belittling her, even though she was a top employee. It’s no wonder that she slowly became afraid of interacting with her boss. After receiving advice from the author, however, she knew how to deal with the situation. The next time her boss berated her, she repeated what the author had advised her to say: Please don’t talk to me like that. I’d appreciate being spoken to differently. When my feelings are hurt, I can’t focus on my work or do as good of a job.  How did her boss react? Well, he apologized and never unfairly criticized her again. From that point on, she no longer resented her boss or her job. Did you know that 80 percent of global wealth is owned by 20 percent of the global population? Fortunately, in Western countries such as the United States, there is high income mobility. That means it’s possible to move from the lower-income brackets to the higher ones through hard work. So, if you work for a company, you should do your best at whatever work your boss delegates to you. This is what the author sought to do when he worked at a property-development company. He would ask his boss for more responsibility and discipline himself to complete the task as quickly and as well as he could. This earned him a reputation as the “go-to guy.” His boss once asked him to go to Reno to start developing the property of a company they’d bought. But instead of flying out within a couple of weeks, as suggested, the author booked a flight for the next day. He immediately met with the lawyer and engineer, eventually discovering that the property had no access to water and could not be developed. He terminated the contract, which would otherwise have ended up costing his company $2 million! His boss was impressed and, within a year, the author was promoted, managing 42 employees in the company. Now, if you have your own business, you’ll also need to work hard if you want to achieve your goals. Bear in mind that the average business owner works 59 hours every week. This requires willpower and constant improvement, so, to help you and your business succeed, try using the CANEI formula, which stands for Continuous And Never-Ending Improvement. This is how it works: When you start a new business, one of the first things you do is write up a business plan detailing your target market, pricing, marketing strategies and so on. But this business plan isn’t set in stone. Regardless of how successfully your business is performing today, it’s crucial that you continuously improve it. Indeed, you should revise and update it on a yearly basis to keep up with your competition and customers’ needs. You need to keep in mind that running a successful, constantly improving business requires months, or even years, of working long hours. Imagine a life of complete financial freedom. You live off the interest from your savings – spending all your time traveling and engaging in your favorite activities. Sounds dreamy! The good thing is this goal is achievable if you’re willing to apply certain tools. The first step toward financial freedom is practicing delayed gratification, and the One Percent Formula is here to help you do just that. Simply force yourself to start saving 1 percent of your income and discipline yourself to live off the remaining 99 percent. So, say you earn $3,000 per month; 1 percent is just $30. And if you’re like most people who live paycheck to paycheck or have accumulated a large amount of debt, the One Percent Formula is still a realistic goal. As soon as you learn to start living off the remaining 99 percent, you can increase your savings ratio to 2 percent, and so on. Each month, you’ll train yourself to consciously spend less and save more. And as you move toward financial independence, you can even pay off any debt you have and begin to attract more wealth. Then you must overcome procrastination by applying the A B C D E Method of prioritizing. To start doing this, you need to write out a list of all the tasks you have to complete at the beginning of each day. Then prioritize them by following the A B C D E Method. The only rule is that you shouldn’t complete a lower-value task before completing all the higher value tasks first. It takes a great deal of discipline to choose your most important tasks and start on them immediately, but the following steps will assist in instantly doubling your productivity and earnings. Under A, list your “Must do” tasks – those that hold major consequences if uncompleted. Under B, write your “Should do” tasks, which have mild consequences if uncompleted. C tasks are “Nice to do” activities, which have no consequences if uncompleted. D tasks should be delegated to others so you can focus on the more important jobs. And, lastly, E tasks aren’t essential to your goals and should be eliminated. These days, people are living longer than ever before, and there’s no reason you shouldn’t live a long and meaningful life, too. The big question is how to do this. One of the key ingredients is having a healthy lifestyle, and that means eating well and exercising. You can take control of your weight by following the author’s Thinking Big weight-loss program, which is centered around avoiding the “three whites”: sugar, salt and flour. First, you should eliminate all sugars from your diet. That means no sugary desserts, no soft drinks and no more sugar in your morning coffee. This should help you shave off one pound per day and boost your energy levels. Next, for permanent weight loss, you should stop adding salt to your meals. And, lastly, eliminate white-flour products such as breads, pastries and pasta from your diet. It really does work. Just six months after starting the Thinking Big program, a 32-year-old man from Florida who had been struggling to lose weight managed to drop 22 pounds. Not only did he look different, he also felt happier and more confident and attracted more dates than ever before. On top of eating healthily, you should realize that it’s never too late to start exercising. The perfect example of this is a 68-year-old woman who lived in a senior-citizens home. She’d never really been into exercise, but then she watched an interview featuring marathon runners her age. Right then and there, she decided that she also wanted to complete a marathon. The very next day, she bought running shoes, invested in running books and started walking around her local neighborhood. At the end of the first year, she was able to complete a mini-marathon, and by the time she reached 75, she’d finished two 50-mile cross-country marathons. When you become a parent, your children become your priority. But can you guess one of the biggest regrets expressed by parents? That they didn’t spend enough time with their children when they were young. However, you have the power to cut back and get rid of other commitments that get in the way of you becoming the best parent possible. Start by making a decision today to spend more time with your family. Just consider one of the author’s friends, a man who used to play golf five days per week and who took frequent golfing holidays in the winter. Even after getting married and having four kids, he continued to play golf several times a week. As you can imagine, his wife wasn’t happy with his lack of familial commitment, and she confronted him about it. Consequently, he made a conscious decision to be responsible and reduce his golfing to once a week. This decision not only made him a better father and husband; it made him happier, too. On the path to happiness, you also need to learn to forgive others. This is perhaps most common when people harbor resentment toward their parents for something they did many decades ago. Such people complain about their childhood experiences and use them as an excuse for their failures. The only way you can reach peace of mind is through the discipline of forgiveness. By developing the habit of forgiving those who have hurt you in the past, you free yourself from the emotional baggage that holds you back from happiness. The key message in this book: You should always strive to learn more in your chosen field. This includes reading books, listening to podcasts and attending seminars by experts. Don’t waste your time with shortcuts. Achieving your goals requires great self-discipline and hard work, as well as dealing with your fears as they arise. Do this, and you can achieve financial freedom and more overall happiness. Actionable advice: Invest 3 percent of your income in yourself. According to the American Society for Training and Development, 3 percent is the percentage that profitable companies invest in their employees’ self-development. If you make $50,000 every year, decide to put at least $1,500 toward improving your knowledge and skills. It’ll pay off in the long run. Got feedback?

Your punctuation is poor, you have a hard time with networking and basketball just isn’t your sport.  But what are your strengths? What is a strength to begin with? And most importantly, why don’t you focus on them? In Now, Discover Your Strengths, you’ll find valuable knowledge on strengths, where to spot them, how they’re created and what they consist of. These blinks will also provide some great insights into how you can engage with your employees’ strengths and make your business thrive.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how your brain holds the key to your hidden talents; why you should hope that showing empathy comes naturally to you; and whether you’re an analytic type or a commander. In schools and in workplaces, we’re constantly encouraged to seek out and correct our weaknesses in order to improve our productivity. But why? After all, it’s uncovering and using your strengths that will really send you on your way to success.  How do you know a strength when you see one? There are many different answers to this question, but we can stick with the simplest: a strength is an activity that you can perform repeatedly to perfection. In other words, any activity that you can do well time and time again, while also enjoying yourself, is a strength. It’s no surprise that organizations where employees are able to use their strengths every day are successful and sustainable. The Gallup Organization asked 198,000 employees across different businesses whether they’re able to do what they do best at work each day.  The 20 percent of employees that strongly agreed with the question were 50 percent more likely to work in organizations with lower employee turnover, 38 percent more likely to work in more productive businesses and 44 percent more likely to work for companies with higher customer satisfaction.  Despite this, many organizations still waste time, money and resources by concentrating on fixing employee weaknesses. Think about it: employees get sent off to special training programs not to expand on their strengths, but to correct weaknesses. By focusing on damage control rather than development, the true potential of employees is neglected.  Of course, damage control is sometimes necessary; a clever but inarticulate employee would benefit greatly from a communication class. Still, damage control should not be the focal point of employee management. If you want your employees to develop and grow, and your company to grow with them, you need a different approach.  Everyone loves to do things they’re good at. But why are we good at these things in the first place? We often hear that practice makes perfect – but that’s not quite true! You’ve built up the strengths you have because you started off with a natural talent.  Talents are patterns of thought and behavior that make some things easier for you. You might, for example, be great at connecting with strangers. That’s a talent! Others don’t find socializing so easy. Either way, we can’t alter this predisposition.  But what we can do is take a predisposition we like and develop it. Developing your strengths entails refining your talent with knowledge and skills.  Knowledge can be factual or experiential. If you’re learning to play the piano, you’ll have to retain a certain amount of factual knowledge, such as by learning different musical notations. But you’ll also acquire knowledge through the experiences of practicing, performing and listening. As you gather experiential knowledge, you also start building up skills. These are the key aspects of your chosen activity that will improve your performance. So, if you’re an experienced public speaker, you’ll have become skilled at catching and holding the attention of your audience. Developing your strengths is a long-term process, and being specific about the skills you have will help you identify exactly where your strengths lie. By way of comparison, think about how diverse the language of human flaws is. Neurosis, psychosis, mania, perfectionism, depression, anxiety – the labels for human difficulties are plentiful and precise. Strangely enough, the language for human strengths is incredibly limited. Human Resources professionals are known to choose candidates based on their “people skills.” Yet, two people with people skills could consist of one person that is great at building trust in long-term relationships, while the other is great at facilitating conversations. It’s time we give talents the close-up attention they deserve. In the next blink, we’ll dive into one particularly important question: how are talents created? In the previous blink, we learned that a talent is a pattern of thought or behavior, and that we naturally possess some patterns but not others. But why is that? To find out, we can take a closer look at the neuroscience behind the development of talents.  Up until the age of three, our brains possess a hundred billion neurons that are capable of making around fifteen thousand connections between synapses. These synaptic connections allow brain cells to communicate with each other – which is a lot of communication! Does this mean we all had the brain of a potential genius as toddlers? Not quite. For our brains and our intelligence to really develop, we had to lose a significant portion of synaptic connections. By the time we turn 15, billions of these connections are wiped out permanently. But it’s actually a good thing: with fewer synaptic connections, sensory overload is prevented and specific connections can be reinforced.  Some connections become much stronger than others, and these are the connections that allow us to perform certain actions with greater proficiency. This explains why certain movements, responses or activities come to you naturally, while others will always feel uncomfortable.  In order to improve certain connections, we need to practice them so that they’re strong enough to overtake the connections that cause behavior we don’t want.  But, of course, this isn’t always possible. If you’ve ever worked on your ability to stay calm in an argument, you might find that your short-tempered reactions still take over. All that practice to help you reflect, maintain eye contact or keep an open and accepting attitude go right out the window!  Take a look at all the people around you. Whether you’re on the train or in your workplace, you’re surrounded by people who possess strengths. Unfortunately, many strengths go to waste when talents remain undetected.  Discovering talents is a crucial task. We’re actually presented with numerous opportunities to uncover talents in our daily lives. But if you want to find talent where you least expect it, start by observing your spontaneous reactions.  Say you’re attending an event where you don’t know too many people. If you hang back and chat to people you’re already acquainted with, you might have a talent for reinforcing existing relationships. If you dive into the crowd and start making friends with strangers, you might have a talent for winning people over.  Or, imagine one of your employees informs you that he can’t come to work because his child is sick. If you automatically asked about the child, this might be a sign that you’ve got a natural ability for empathy. On the other hand, if you immediately thought about who could potentially fill in for your employee, you might have a talent for rapid problem solving.  When examining your instinctive reactions, it helps to understand the two different indicators for different kinds of talent: yearnings and rapid learning.   Yearnings reveal the talents that appear early on in our lives. Mozart was only 12 years old when he wrote his first symphony! If you had a burning interest in as a child, why not explore it further? You may find a hidden talent there. Rapid learning is another way to spot talent. When you pick up a new skill, how fast do you learn the ropes? If you master something in record time, there’s a good chance that a natural talent is calling out to you. Believe it or not, Henri Matisse only began painting by chance. He started off with a basic manual to painting as his guide, and was accepted to Paris’s most prestigious art school just four years later!  Now that we’ve explored the origins and signs of natural talents, it’s time for you to start seeking them out in your employees. By uncovering their strengths, you’ll help them and your organization achieve top performance and productivity.  In the second blink, we learned that it was important to be specific when describing talents. This is particularly important in the workplace, where different roles have diverse requirements. There are at least 34 types of talents relevant to organizations, so let’s look at a few that might already exist in your workplace.  Do you have an analytical employee? He’s the one that challenges others, argues objectively and believes that data reveals the truth. He likes to back up his claims with logical thinking, and expects the same of others. This is something to remember when giving instructions to an analytical employee: keep them as detailed, clear and sensible as possible.  Or perhaps you’ve discovered that one of your employees is a commander. She’s rather skilled at convincing others to take her side in a conflict, and is always ready to share her opinion. She’s determined and won’t back down from confrontation when looking for solutions.  Managers can rely on commanding types for insights about what’s going on within workplace relations. But if they start overpowering quieter employees or ignoring commitments, you’ll need to meet them head-on and back up your claims with concrete examples.  Another employee of yours might be a restorative type. He likes solving problems and is always there to lift spirits when things seem hopeless. There’s no challenge for which he can’t tease out a solution, which makes him great for positions in customer relations. Managers can turn to restorative types for help and expect a focused, reassuring response.  The key message in this book: It’s time we stopped focusing on correcting weaknesses and started recognizing and developing our strengths. If you give yourself a chance and know what to look out for, you’ll see natural talent jump out at you. These talents can be combined with skills and knowledge to bring powerful strengths to life.

Is it superior talent? Were they born advantageously?  No. Successful people come from all backgrounds and walks of life, and not every person starts out as a stellar success. But they all do share one feature – they all have awesome habits.  So what exactly are successful habits, and how do you get them, too? These blinks will explain in detail the eight ways to retrain your mind and change for the better. Even focusing on one new habit will help you go the distance when it comes to becoming more focused and productive.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why being abnormal is preferable to being normal; how multitasking is just a ruse to pretending you’re productive; and how establishing a ritual can help you to turn good behaviors into habits.  Have you ever felt the need to make a positive change in your life? Maybe you’ve already made a list of all the small things you’d like to alter. But making a long list isn’t the most effective way to go about making improvements. Why? It’s a fact that our conscious mind can only process between five to nine concepts, or pieces of information, at a time. This phenomenon is called channel capacity, and was first identified by psychologist George A. Miller in 1956. No matter what you’re reading or looking at, from words to colors or numbers, your working memory can only store a limited amount of data at any given time. And working memory is all a person has from moment to moment, whether making an argument or trying to solve a math problem. So given this limitation, it makes sense that trying to tackle too many tasks at once can be overwhelming. This also holds true when you try to change too many things at once in your life. Since every task you try to complete requires its own amount of data, your working memory can suffer from information overload when you try to juggle multiple tasks. When this happens, important data can get improperly processed and you might make a mistake, or worse, your conscious mind will shut down. You can think of this like a computer freezing when you’ve opened up too many applications. The author has witnessed this dilemma firsthand. People have told him that when they try to change two or three things in their life at the same time, they get stuck. But when they focus on only one thing, the results can be unbelievable. So the best way to improve your life and get positive results is to commit yourself to changing just one thing at a time! People may look productive when they frantically hurry from one task to the next, or by multitasking to the point of distraction. But such behavior just points to a person who has poor time management skills! The secret to having a productive tomorrow is to organize it today. Organizing effectively means prioritizing your tasks by making a list of the Three Most Important things you want to achieve. Be sure as well to include the time needed to accomplish these tasks.  Then from your three tasks, pick one that absolutely needs to be done that very day.  In doing so, you’ll be sure to focus on what’s most important to you, and will be less likely to forget or push aside a task that might be more difficult in favor of an easier goal.  Plus, by only focusing on three tasks, instead of being overwhelmed, you’ll find increased confidence in being able to accomplish all your stated goals. There are also three important things to keep in mind when making your list. First: Don’t make the mistake of listing a big, complex project as one item. Instead, find smaller and more manageable tasks within the big project that you can add to the list. Second: Prioritize and schedule wisely. Carefully identify your most important task for tomorrow and make sure you schedule enough time to complete it. For many, the period between lunch and 3 p.m. is a great window for uninterrupted work. Third: Write it down. Putting your plan on paper is about more than just remembering what to do. Writing activates a specific part of your brain called the reticular activating system (RAS). This area acts like a filter and puts important information, such as the things you write down, at the forefront of your mind. So with a prioritized, written plan of attack, you’ll be ready to conquer the day ahead!  Do you ever look at your to-do list and wish there were more than 24 hours in a day? Here are four tips on how you can make the most out of the time you have. Tip #1: Don’t waste time waiting around. You might not think the time between appointments is valuable, but these short periods can add up to significant hours. So instead of twiddling your thumbs or checking Facebook, spend your extra time productively. Chances are there’s an email you can reply to, or paperwork that needs to be done. Tip #2: Use the ask and chop technique to avoid procrastination. This is a helpful technique when you’re confronted with a task that feels too overwhelming to even start. First, ask yourself: What is the first step that needs to be taken? Then simply focus on chopping off that first step by completing it, then repeat the question. By chopping away the task in small steps, you’ll make progress without being intimidated by the scale of the larger project. Tip #3: Set your game clock. Create a challenge by giving yourself a short amount of time for a small task. When you meet your deadline, you’ll see how efficient you can be and learn that you really can do more with less time. And finally, tip #4: Pre-structure your meetings to meet solid goals. Unstructured, aimless meetings are a waste of time. People end up jumping from topic to topic or spending the meeting focusing on minor details. Make your meeting productive by giving it a focus. Open the meeting by articulating a clear goal that outlines what you want to accomplish. Everyone at the meeting will then be aware of the meeting’s focus, and you can spend the rest of the time productively in reaching that goal. Close the meeting by dedicating a short amount of time for questions or proposals. With these tips, you’ll be well on your way to creating more time in your working day by using each minute as efficiently as possible. Many people make New Year’s resolutions to kick a bad habit or to get into better shape. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon to revert to old habits or bad behavior after just a few weeks.  So how can you stick to a plan and develop new, better habits? Start by making a ritual of the positive habit you want to adopt. Making a ritual means doing something at the exact same time, each and every day. If you want to go to the gym more often, ritualize this new habit by setting a specific time to go, like 8:30 a.m. every day, and commit to it. By making your new goal a ritual, you’ll be less tempted to procrastinate or postpone. But if you start to doubt or feel like slacking off, remember that changing habits gets easier with time! As you start trying to change your habits, you can run into situations where old behaviors, like lying on the couch watching television, might feel like a better option. When this happens, resist the temptation by reminding yourself that this is a normal, temporary phase on the path to a great new lifestyle.  You might have to fight through these early stages – but it will get easier the longer you stick with it! To boost your fighting spirit, ask yourself two questions: How will I feel when I win this fight and stay committed to my new habit? How will I feel if I give up? These questions will help provoke feelings within you that can motivate you to stick with your goals. Finally, imagine how your new lifestyle will change things for you in the long run. It helps to do this through visualization: imagine your new self as a healthy, productive and confident person. This technique keeps your goal in mind and will motivate you to keep going for it! By applying these basic thinking techniques, anyone can stay committed to establishing new habits or making lifestyle changes – until the change finally becomes second nature.  Do you ever hesitate starting a task for fear that you may make a mistake or fall short of your own expectations? If so, you might be a perfectionist, and this can get in the way of evaluating yourself fairly.  When a perfectionist performs a self-evaluation, he is likely to focus more on shortcomings over whether something as a whole was done well. By basing a self-evaluation on the highest of standards, you are simply setting yourself up for disappointment. You can either fail to reach those standards and let yourself down, or you can meet expectations and see no reason to appreciate good work.  This can result in negative feedback, which in turn leads to stress and low self-confidence.  The better method is to appreciate when you do things well! Take the advice of legendary basketball coach John Wooden. He said that the most successful people always give themselves credit when it’s due. It’s also important to focus more on the process than on results.  By paying attention only to results, you won’t learn what needs to be done to get the results you want. When you focus on the process, you’ll learn what works best to reach your goals and what you might need to improve. Consider creating a success log, or a daily journal that will help you evaluate your process in a useful way. To start your journal, write down the realistic goals you hope to achieve each day, and take the time to evaluate your goals afterward. You should answer three questions: What did I do well today? What is one aspect I’d like to improve for tomorrow? Is there one thing I can do differently? When you answer these questions, you are focusing on setting goals around behavior and not on the external results. So be on the lookout for behaviors that contribute to success – they’ll point the way to continued progress! Have you ever talked yourself out of doing something? Maybe you were going to apply for a new job or ask for a promotion, but then you thought, “Why bother, it’s not going to happen, I’ll just end up getting my hopes crushed.” This is a bad habit that you can change. How you talk to yourself impacts your self-confidence. Over time we tend to believe whatever it is that we tell ourselves. You can either convince yourself that you’ll fail by thinking negatively, or you can boost your confidence and increase your chances of success by encouraging yourself. Even if you are doubtful in the face of a challenge, you’ll find that by continuing to feed yourself with positive thoughts, you’ll eventually feel the necessary confidence to get on with it. After all, you’ll never even approach a challenge if you don’t allow yourself the belief that you will succeed! Think of it like a coach: When a team is facing a tough match, it’s a coach’s job to rally the team with positive messages and keep them motivated. Without hope, no one would bother trying! Another important technique is to keep yourself from overthinking a problem. When you overthink, your mind turns the problem into an unsolvable obstacle, which can end up paralyzing you into inaction. Your brain releases stress hormones, leading to tension and the loss of any creative intelligence. This usually ends with the overthinker giving up to escape the stress. A much better way to achieve a goal is to relax and, instead of focusing on the problem, concentrate on a solution. Take stock of everything you have at your disposal, the tools that can help you solve your problem. Rather than becoming overwhelmed, take the task step by step, think positively and work out a gradual solution. Chances are you don’t enjoy making speeches in front of large groups of people. But every professional can learn how to give a decent speech; here are some keys to help you learn how. There are two important points to giving a good presentation: preparation and practice. When you prepare a speech, you want to make sure your audience understands your main ideas. In previous blinks, we learned that the mind can only handle a certain amount of information. Building on this, be aware that your audience, to stay engaged, requires a well-structured speech. You’ll also need to remove any elements in your speech that might distract a listener or obscure your message. To do this, write down your entire presentation and look at the first and last five minutes. Take out any details that seem superfluous. With your presentation lean and organized, you can then rehearse delivering it to an audience. If you’re overly nervous, you might appear awkward, fidgeting with clothes or hair. Before you take to the stage, reassure yourself that you’re well-prepared and boost your self-confidence by rehearsing the speech until you can recite it effortlessly. Take moments throughout the day, even during mealtimes, to mentally recite the details in your speech. Don’t forget to talk slowly, and pause after you make a point. People who speak at a calm, measured pace are often seen as more confident than people who speak quickly. And by allowing for pauses, you’ll give your audience time to better process the points you are trying to make. In contrast, if you’re preparing a one-on-one talk, there are two important things to keep in mind: First, keep the tone of your voice calm and friendly. This will allow the other person to be at ease, and what’s more, the person will also be more receptive to your message. Second, be sure to give the other person a chance to voice his thoughts, and listen carefully to what he has to say. If you speak slowly and pause frequently, this gives your partner the opportunity to respond. Why are people so hung up on being normal? Can you think of any great artist, writer or scientist who was considered normal? Normal people have traits, or “viruses,” that can keep them from achieving their goals. But abnormal people are immune to these viruses, and refuse to let them interfere with personal success. The main virus that plagues normal people is procrastination. The normal person is scared to pursue an ambitious goal, worried that failure awaits. And for that normal person, it is easy to find excuses not to start: laundry, a dirty kitchen, and so on.  But the abnormal person doesn’t look for excuses. Abnormal people look for ways around any obstacle. If the dog ate a notebook, the abnormal person will staple together some paper and make a new one. Abnormal people take control of their fate, convinced that they alone can achieve their goals. A secondary virus, related to procrastination, is focusing on things you can’t control. Normal people can blind themselves from the things they can control by obsessing over things they can’t. It’s too cold or rainy outside, the neighbor’s dog is barking, the coffee shop raised its prices, and so on. By focusing on such concerns, normal people distance themselves from the aspects of their life that they can actually improve. For abnormal people, such concerns are a waste of time and energy. Instead, they pay attention to what they can control and the parts of their lives they can improve. So do what abnormal people do: create a step-by-step plan of action on what you’d like to improve in your life and how to make it happen. You can even add a list of things that you can and can’t control, to make sure you don’t get distracted along the way. The key message in this book: If you want to be highly successful, you need to know how to control your mind and talk with yourself in a positive fashion. Always remember to focus on the solution rather than on the problem. And even when you’re at the top of your game, never forget the process that got you there.  Actionable advice: Build an evaluation ritual. Next time you have a bad day at the office and you feel that your self-esteem is flagging, don’t focus on what you did wrong. It’s much better to write down everything you did well. Such a positive evaluation will immediately increase your confidence, motivate you and improve your performance tomorrow.  Practice the Mental Workout to reduce anxiety about a task. First, relax your mind by controlling your breath. Inhale for five seconds, hold your breath for two seconds, and exhale for six seconds. Next recite a personal mantra, or a fixed set of encouraging statements. For example, “I’m strong, smart and confident and things will work out well.” Spend 60 seconds visualizing the situation you’re afraid of. Imagine what you’re going to see, how you’re going to feel, and what you’re going to say. Repeat your personal mantra and return to the breathing technique. Got feedback?

But that voice was once stifled. Though written in 1938, Outwitting the Devil wasn’t published until 2011 because Hill had some controversial thoughts about churches and schools, which, to his mind, discouraged individuality and kept people in a stifling web of fear. So here we are 70 years later, and Hill’s book is finally seeing the light of day. In some ways, this narrative is very much in line with Hill’s belief in perseverance and resisting the urge to give up. As you’ll see, the advice here is centered around the power of positive thinking, finding the silver lining of every temporary setback and surrounding yourself with good influences. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to avoid becoming a drifter; the importance of keeping an eye on bad habits; and what a jockey can teach us about perseverance. Is there a dream you’ve held onto for years but have been afraid to pursue? There probably is, since, in the author’s estimation, 98 percent of us are letting our minds be controlled by fear. As a result, we tend to drift through life without thinking for ourselves or following our own desires. The fear that causes us to drift is instilled early on. First, there are the churches that teach children to beware of the insidious “Devil.” Then there are the schools that offer very little preparation for children to be individuals in the real world, and focus instead on having students memorize endless facts and figures. The author, Napoleon Hill, learned firsthand about this overwhelming fear and lack of individuality while working toward his life goal: creating the first philosophy of individual achievement. For years, he’d interviewed people about their successes and failures, but his notes were starting to become aimless, and they certainly didn’t add up to a concrete philosophy. He was stuck and his mind was fogged with fear and indecision. Then, one day, he had an epiphany. While out walking and taking in some much-needed fresh air, he was suddenly confronted by a voice that felt like his “other self” talking to him. The voice was commanding, and it told Hill that he could finish his manuscript on the philosophy of individual achievement; all he had to do was stop giving in to fear and doubt. Hill came to believe that this voice represented something we all possess. He calls it Infinite Intelligence – an abundance of faith and positive energy that we can always tap into as long as we keep doubt, fear and worry from our mind. Thanks to this voice, Hill was able to push his fear aside, put in the necessary work and finish his book. As a result, Hill became the first great writer of the self-help genre, and his work continues to be read worldwide. In other words, Hill became a non-drifter, which is someone who knows that the key to success is becoming the master of your own mind. Hill’s breakthrough came, in part, because he had a very clear goal in life. If you want to increase your chances of success, you’ll have to find a life goal of your own. Indeed, identifying your goal is all-important, since a person’s success often hinges on whether or not he knows what he wants. Now, this work can’t be done for you; neither school nor church can determine your path in life. So it’s lucky that you (and everyone else on Earth) has an invaluable privilege. We’re all self-determining. Even in the worst of situations, we have a choice: we can let our mind fill either with positive or with negative thoughts. For example, a lot of people struggled during the Great Depression, but some had the self-determination to stay positive and accomplish greatness. Take Henry Ford. Like so many other people of his time, he could have let the prevailing negative thoughts cloud his mind. But, instead, Ford kept fear at bay and didn’t let negative thinking get in the way of his developing one of the biggest automobile companies in America. Ultimately, it was determination and positive thinking that helped him create assembly-line manufacturing and realize his dream of producing an affordable car that every middle-class American could buy. So remember, the most important determining factor for success is whether you choose to think negatively or positively. And when you combine positive thinking with a definite goal in life, you’ll be on your way to avoiding the fate of being a drifter. Franklin D. Roosevelt is another great example. He had a very clear purpose when he became president of the United States: to sweep away the fear that had been persisting since the start of the Great Depression and to shift the nation’s focus away from depression and toward recovery. When asked about the major problem facing the United States, Roosevelt replied, “It is not a question of majors and minors; we have but one problem and that is to stop fear and supplant it with faith.” This was a definite plan, and it worked – it allowed Roosevelt to immediately take control and put America on the road to recovery. As the saying goes, “You reap what you sow.” In other words, your results are going to reflect your effort. And once you start thinking positively and pursue your goals, you’ll soon find how effective having a purpose can really be. Whether the ostensible culprit is poor eating habits or an irregular sleeping schedule, people are great at coming up with excuses for bad and unproductive behavior. The real danger, however, is when those habits start to become a regular way of life. When drinking ceases to be a monthly activity and starts becoming a daily one, then you may be falling victim to what the author terms the law of hypnotic rhythm – a fixed engagement in habitual behaviors. This law applies to both bad and good habits. However, you should be especially wary of negative habits since they can quickly have a devastating effect on your life. For example, most headaches and other illnesses are caused by overeating or indulging in the wrong kinds of foods. And when people develop bad eating habits, their ability to function can deteriorate and their goals can go out the window. The same can happen with other habits, such as sex, which can become such a strong focus of desire that all other goals fall away. To avoid such habits, successful people tend to surround themselves with people who have positive habits. After all, it’s common knowledge that the habits of the people around you will rub off on you. This would seem like a simple enough strategy, yet most people go through life accepting their circumstances instead of pursuing better ones. A good example of someone who didn’t just accept his circumstances is Andrew Carnegie, who served as a mentor to the author. The philanthropist and business titan did what many other successful leaders have done; he surrounded himself with successful people. So, if you find yourself being negatively influenced by the dark moods of your friends or colleagues, it may be time to find peers with better attitudes. If you once pursued a project and, in the end, were met with failure, you may have taken this as a sign to give up. But successful people know that failures are only a rough patch on the road to reaching their goals. Take Thomas Edison – the man behind the light bulb, the phonograph and a long list of other revolutionary inventions. He had to go through dozens of failures before he successfully realized any of his visions. There are likely thousands of people more intelligent than Edison. What really set him apart and put him into the history books was his perseverance in the face of countless setbacks. During the Great Depression, the author published Think and Grow Rich (1937), which helped people see beyond the hard times and disappointments of that decade. And that book’s advice still holds true today. We always need to find a way of creating goals in spite of whatever desolate circumstances we may find ourselves in. To this day, the author’s 1937 book remains among the top ten self-help books of all time. Another habit many successful people have is to recognize that any given failure may be the seed that grows into success. Every problem you encounter will have a solution, so there’s no reason to think of failure as anything other than a temporary state of mind. For example, Julie Krone was told time and time again that she couldn’t be a professional jockey because none of the horse owners wanted a female jockey. But Krone had a motto: “Keep showing up!” And sure enough, she wore those horse owners down until they finally let her ride. Julie Krone became a champion jockey. Indeed, years later, USA Today listed her as one of the toughest athletes in history. If you have your dream, don’t let someone else’s negative attitude make you think it can’t be done. The key message in these blinks: We all have good thoughts and bad thoughts. Sometimes that inner voice tells us to keep fighting and other times it tells us to give up. Fortunately, we can choose to listen to the positive voice and follow it while ignoring the negativity and pushing aside the fear that keeps so many people from making their dreams come true. By recognizing our fears, exercising the power of positive thinking and following a clear plan, we can all overcome failure and achieve our deepest desires.  Got feedback?

Sure, we pay lip service to the importance of soft skills, like communication, but we worry about appearing to be too soft. We hold back from sharing our worries, stress and anxiety, for fear of being seen as weak. And we discourage human displays of emotion in the office by stereotyping them as somehow unprofessional. This is unhelpful because the reality is that emotion is ever-present at work. There’s the gnawing feeling in your gut when an email from your manager arrives at 8:00 p.m. on a Sunday night. The thrill when your CEO offers rare words of praise on Slack. Or the utter fury you feel when that jerk in marketing interrupts you for the fourth time that meeting. Humans are emotional beings, and we’d all lead more fulfilled working lives if we were able to be our authentic selves in the office, rather than emotionless automatons. And with the world of work ever more focused on interactions between teams and colleagues, it’s more important than ever to understand not only our own emotional needs, but those of our colleagues, bosses and juniors. In these blinks, you’ll learn why control is at the heart of staying motivated; how we’d rather break up with a partner than confront a work colleague; and why teams of people who like horror movies work better together. Would you rather work in an office where people say a cheery “hello” to one another in the hall, and share the occasional moment of joy or sadness? Or one where people appear enthusiastic at their desks but head off to the bathroom for a long, lonely cry. A healthy emotional culture in the workplace makes a difference. For example, a study by Kim Cameron, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, found that organizations that discourage compassion and gratitude have higher staff turnover rates. Meanwhile, research from Barry Staw, a professor at Berkeley, showed that employees whose managers are rude are more likely to make poor decisions, and they forget important information more frequently. The good news is that it doesn’t take an organizational overhaul to encourage emotional expression in the workplace. In fact, small gestures can be particularly important. Take the example of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Group’s 10/5 rule. The hotel’s employees are taught that if they walk within ten feet of someone, they should smile and make eye contact. Within five feet, they offer a friendly “hello.” The 10/5 rule has been implemented at hospitals, and it seems to make not just customers, but also employees happier. Another way to build a positive emotional culture is to cultivate a sense of belonging. Doing so is a good investment because, as a 2017 New York Times article noted, a feeling of not belonging among employees is one of the highest predictors of turnover. Google’s own research shows that employees who get a warm welcome from their managers on the first day at the office are more productive a full nine months later. So try taking an idea from IDEO, the design consultancy where Duffy, one of the authors, works. The company gives each of their new hires a first-day enterview, in which everyone who interviewed the new recruit shares exactly why they are pumped for him or her to join. And they go one step further: after filling out a quirky onboarding survey a few weeks before her start date, Duffy made a pleasant discovery on her first day of work – a pack of her favorite snacks waiting for her on her desk! A simple touch, but one that made her feel positive about her new workplace from day one. Of course, while we all have a part to play in building a healthy emotional culture at work, leaders have a special responsibility. Let’s examine this in the next blink. In 2008, Howard Schultz returned to Starbucks as CEO after an eight-year break. As he stood on a stage, in full view of his employees, he cried. Before his return, Starbucks was having a difficult time. Daily sales figures were falling fast. Schultz, who grew up poor, knew his employees were scared about the future. So he decided to lift a mask that few normal employees, let alone CEOs, are willing to lift in front of their colleagues. In front of his employees, he let his pure, human emotion flow. It’s important for leaders to share their emotions. That’s because employees perform to higher standards and act more kindly to colleagues if they feel a personal connection with their leaders, according to a 2012 study in The Leadership Quarterly. But at the same time, leaders need to think carefully about what feelings they share and how they share them. No employee wants to hear his or her leader’s fears and stresses about the future, without any reassurance that things will work out alright. Indeed, leaders who share too much emotion can lose their authority, particularly when that emotion is anger. A 2015 lab experiment at the University of Amsterdam showed that employees having to deal with an angry manager showed less willingness to work. Conversely, when managers controlled their words and body language at tense moments, their employees’ stress levels were reduced by over 30 percent. So when Howard Schultz let the tears fall onstage in front of his employees, he wasn’t just wallowing in fear. Instead, he went on to lay out a clear plan for how to get Starbucks back to health. In the following month, Schultz was bombarded with over 5,000 emails expressing appreciation for his shared vulnerability and his plan for the future. And by 2010, Starbucks’s stock price was at its highest levels ever. So if you are a leader, be willing to share your feelings. But be selective. Don’t overshare. And don’t share frustration, anger or fear, without also sharing a plan to tackle the causes of those emotions. This may not be an easy task, but you risk overwhelming your people if you don’t tread carefully. And as the next blink shows, nothing good comes from feeling overwhelmed. What are the chances that you’ll look back on your life and wish you’d spent more late nights in the office? Probably pretty low. And yet, too many of us not only work long hours, but then come home and obsess about work during dinner, a workout, while lying in bed at night or even in our dreams. If your mood and life are coming to be dominated by work, then a good approach is to simply try to care a little less about your work, and a bit more about yourself. The first practical step you can take is simple: take a vacation. Astoundingly, according to a 2017 MarketWatch article, over 50 percent of Americans don’t even take all the paid vacation they are entitled to. So, there’s a role here for leaders to provide a little encouragement. According to research by Project: Time Off, a majority of employees say that their bosses give mixed or negative messages about them taking leave, or simply say nothing at all. But they found that, if encouraged, almost everyone would take more vacation. So leaders, make an investment in your team’s health and happiness, and start encouraging vacations today. If you can’t take a vacation, take what breaks you can. Consider the Boston Consulting Group, a management consulting firm. They initiated a policy of predictable time off, which gave every employee a specified weeknight off a week. The result? Knowing they had one work-free evening a week, employees were happier and less likely to quit. And the company started a culture where team members were mindful of each other’s health. Taking a break is important, but it can still be hard to avoid extending the behaviors of the workplace into our time off. A better approach? Be strictly unproductive. If you are a budding pianist, for example, try to take a relaxed approach to your hobby. Forcing yourself to practice for every weeknight at 9:00 p.m. and fretting if you miss a day probably won’t help you unwind from a hard workday. A Duke University study showed that when we set frameworks around our leisure activities, we enjoy them less. So embrace being strictly unproductive, and be less passionate about your work. That doesn’t mean you have to stop caring about it. It just means you should try to get the balance right. Now let’s take a look at what to do if your problem is that you just don’t care at all. According to a Gallup poll from 2018, just 15 percent of employees feel engaged at work. That means there are a lot of us out there who are struggling to conjure up the motivation to do our jobs each day. If you are in need of a boost, it’s time to learn what really motivates you. And newsflash: a morning coffee sadly isn’t enough. Having a feeling of control is important to our sense of motivation, so much so that we value it more than power. The Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin reviewed nine experiments and found that people who claim to want jobs that give them power actually choose jobs with a lot of freedom when given the choice. And there’s plenty of evidence from the business world that organizations thrive when they give their people control. In 2001, Best Buy launched a radical policy called the Results-Only Work Environment, which said that all employees should stop any activity they thought was a waste of time. Moreover, they had complete control over their time: arriving at the office at 2:00 p.m. was fine, as was leaving early. The policy was a huge success. Younger employees valued a later start, avoiding rush hour, while parents on the staff loved leaving early to pick up their kids. Morale rose – and so did productivity. Not all of us are lucky enough to work somewhere as enlightened as Best Buy. But you can still find ways to build autonomy. Try asking your manager to set desired outcomes, rather than dictating processes. That way, you can find your own way to deliver a task. To stay motivated, it’s also important to feel a sense of purpose. Consider the story of a group of Wharton School employees who make cold calls seeking donations to fund scholarships. Adam Grant, a professor at the university, set up five-minute meetings between the beneficiaries of the scholarships and the callers. Four weeks later, the callers who had talked to the scholarship recipients – and had heard how much their lives had been changed – raised almost double the funds as those colleagues who hadn’t met them. All of us can get a motivational boost by reflecting on or connecting with the people who ultimately benefit through our work. For example, if you’re a barista, don’t think of it as yet another latte made – think of it as an opportunity to perk up somebody’s morning. We often like to think of decision-making as an unemotional process. “Let’s think about this rationally,” we say, consciously or unconsciously downplaying the role of emotions. But actually, when you are making decisions at or about work, you should always pay attention to your emotions because they can be an important source of information. For example, say you’re deciding on a new, lucrative job as a sales executive, but the prospect fills your stomach with dread. Well, those gut feelings are based on your brain’s quick way of processing your collected experiences and knowledge and help remind you just how awful making sales calls made you feel in the past. Your emotions are telling you something. And while you shouldn’t always listen to them, it’s always good to consider them. Consider a study recounted in the Academy of Management Journal in 2007, which surveyed a group of investors. It found that when they were making investment decisions, the investors who felt strong emotions – good or bad – made better decisions than those who felt nothing. So how can we practice proper emotional decision-making in our daily work lives? A good approach is to embrace relevant emotions and ignore irrelevant emotions. What’s the difference? Well, let’s say you are offered a new job, and while thinking about turning it down, you feel a sense of regret. That’s a relevant emotion because it speaks directly to your decision. In fact, reflecting on regret can be a powerful way to reveal what choices will make you happy. One of the authors uses this tactic to make decisions. For example, she asks herself questions like, “In five years time, will I feel more regret if I hadn’t gone to graduate school, or if I did go?” Reflecting on regret can help us to visualize our future and how happy we feel about it. By contrast, irrelevant emotions are those that get their tentacles into our decision-making process, even though they are, well, irrelevant. It’s why interviewing someone while cross and hungry is a bad idea: your hanger – an irrelevant emotion – is likely to cloud your decision-making. So next time you have a big decision, write out the options you face. List all your feelings, from your deepest fears to your caffeine craving, before rationalizing away those that are irrelevant. Then you’ll be prepped with all the information you need to make a great decision. In a 2013 experiment, members of eight teams in an upcoming business school pitch competition were asked questions, including whether they liked horror movies and whether they got annoyed by spelling mistakes. The data-scientist running the experiment, Alastair Shepherd, knew nothing about the team members’ business experiences, intelligence or leadership abilities. However, he accurately predicted the ranking of the eight teams in the subsequent competition, using only the quiz answers. That’s because teams perform better if they’re tolerant and welcoming of different perspectives. There’s plenty of evidence to back up this idea – what matters in a team is not the seniority or experience of the people involved, but their attitudes toward each other. And what really matters is the extent of psychological safety within the group. This is measurable by the degree to which members of the group feel free and able to propose ideas and thoughts without any risk of embarrassment. When Google analyzed 200 teams in 2012, it found that the best performers were those who were part of teams with high levels of psychological safety. Not only were they less likely to quit; they were also twice as often described as effective by their superiors. When teams aren’t psychologically safe, performance suffers. A 2017 Wall Street Journal article recounted a simulation in which teams of doctors treated a supposedly sick mannequin. Some teams were assigned an observer who then treated them rudely, belittling their efforts during the simulation. These teams made serious mistakes, like misdiagnosis or failure to ventilate properly. So if you’re in a leadership position, how can you help create an environment of psychological safety? Well, a fun way to show that it’s okay for your team members to share their ideas is to kick off discussions with a bad idea brainstorm – asking for deliberately absurd ideas. Taking the pressure off a little will loosen things up when it comes to the serious discussion. Another way to encourage diverse ideas, particularly if there are introverts in a team, may be to ask everyone to write down their thoughts. Then the group leader can share them aloud and invite follow-up discussion. This way, it’s possible to build a foundational framework for a safe, thoughtful exchange of ideas. If, however, your teams aren’t embracing psychological safety, then maybe you need to think about how you are communicating with each other. Let’s take a look at that now. What would you fear more? Telling a romantic partner that it’s over or confronting a colleague who claimed credit for one of your ideas? Well, according to research from the UK’s Chartered Management Institute, most people would rather dump a lover than handle an awkward office confrontation. We are often reluctant to communicate openly and honestly at work. And that’s a problem because even minor miscommunications in the workplace can become major problems if they aren’t addressed. Fosslien, one of the authors, for example, used to get frustrated with a colleague, who would talk very slowly when answering her questions. For a while, she simmered with frustration at his apparent condescension, until eventually she asked him why he slowed down when talking to her. It turned out that he spoke this way to avoid sounding stupid to her. So how can we communicate better? Well, the answer lies in acknowledging your emotions, without becoming emotional. Stanford Business School teaches students a helpful formulation of words: “When you do that, I feel this.” For example, when start-up founder Chris Gomes struggled with the increasing impatience of his co-founder Scott Steinberg, he would say something along the lines of, “When you interrupt me, I feel stupid and irritated. And that makes me anxious about asking you questions.” That way, Gomes was able to voice his emotions, without getting emotional about it. The result? A productive conversation that resolved some issues, because it reflected the emotions of both people, without either of them getting emotional. Emotions – and the potential of them being misunderstood – are also present in the realm of digital communication. In fact, we don’t always realize how easily other people can misunderstand what we are trying to say when we write it down. We write “don’t be late!” in an email, meaning it jokily. But our recipient may well see it as a threat. To avoid text and email misunderstandings, emotionally proofread your messages. Reread anything you type, and check it for possible misunderstandings. And while you’ll want to use it sparingly, particularly with people you don’t know too well, don’t shy away from emojis. That “Don’t be late!” message could be improved by the addition of a winky face. An emoji might be a small gesture – but as we’ve seen, even small gestures are an important step toward a healthier, happier emotional culture in the workplace. And that’s something that we should all aspire to. The key message in these blinks: Most of us have gotten used to the idea that mixing our emotions with work is somehow taboo. But that’s just a myth. In fact, when you begin to listen to, understand, express and learn from your emotions, you are more likely to experience a richer, more satisfying and productive working life.  Actionable advice: Use icebreakers that get to the heart of who your colleagues are as people.  Need to get a group of colleagues to open up? Split them into pairs and use this great icebreaker prompt: “thinking about your childhood, tell me about a meal that comes to mind, and why.” No one just answers with “steak.” Instead, you’ll hear stories about culture, upbringing and family. You’ll generate real emotion and kick-start a mood of openness and warmth in the room. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

If you have, you’ll know how awful they can make people feel. A bully in the office can make going to work a miserable experience. Although office bullies can make life hell, they can be defeated. A well-run organization will have support channels that victims can turn to, procedures for removing both the bully and their poisonous activities from the workplace. Even though bullies can easily be confronted, there is a more damaging form of workplace abuse that often goes unchecked. And if it’s allowed to continue, workplace mobbing can destroy careers, and even lives. So what is it and what can you do about it? These blinks will tell you. In these blinks, you’ll discover why workplace mobbing can force people out of the careers they love; and why you need to become a speak no evil company. Despite its implications, “mobbing” is a term seldom heard in corporate culture. It’s not a day-to-day term. It’s usually not mentioned in workplace training. And yet, a recent survey found that 35 percent of American workers have experienced workplace abuse at some point during their working lives. But how exactly is mobbing different from bullying? Well, both involve the abuse of an individual. However, whereas bullying involves the targeted abuse of one individual by another (usually the boss), mobbing is an often-covert form of abuse (usually perpetrated by a group) that the organization itself supports. The express purpose of the abuse is the removal of the victim from the workplace. Bullying works differently. Say you have an awful boss who constantly criticizes your work, hounding and undermining you until you begin to hate your job. In this case, you could go to HR, and disciplinary actions would be taken against your boss. Now contrast this with mobbing. Imagine that you speak out against a company policy, thereby unwittingly infuriating your boss. Unbeknownst to you, he goes to the department head and brands you a “trouble maker.” Together, they work to undermine you, and even recruit a coworker who dislikes you. They spread malicious gossip about you and tell people that your work is garbage. Gradually you become a total outsider; your days become intolerable. Because the head of the department is against you too, you have nowhere to turn, and so you leave the company. Although there isn’t a typical profile for victims of mobbing, it’s likely to be someone who speaks out or seems different. Whistleblowers, for instance, who draw attention to unethical or inefficient business practices are likely to be the ones who suffer from mobbing. People who are culturally different from the rest of the team, or who seem like outsiders, are also often singled out. This includes people like recent immigrants or people with non-normative sexual identities. In 1991, a recently fired postal worker named Thomas McInvale walked into Royal Oak Post Office and shot dead four of his former managers before killing himself. But what could have motivated him to do that? Mobbing. By looking into this tragic case, we uncover three factors common to all incidents of mobbing. They also illuminate why McInvale snapped. First is work group dynamics. Mobbing occurs when team cohesion breaks down, and certain team members begin to be seen as outsiders holding the rest back. At McInvale’s postal service job, the relationships between management and employees were dreadful. Management allegedly treated the staff inhumanely, and McInvale was unfairly singled out by them, arbitrarily fired for doing something they would usually turn a blind eye to. Next is organizational dynamics, which can intensify mobbing. While there are many factors in organizational dynamics that can influence the likelihood of mobbing, we will focus on two: structure and external environment. The organizational structure of Royal Oak Postal Service was one of strict top-down hierarchy, with workers completely subordinate to management. This hierarchy was maintained through harsh discipline, and employees who didn’t toe the line were subject to constant abuse. This rigid structure and harsh disciplinary environment worked in concert with the economic conditions that made up the postal service’s external environment. Technology in the industry and competition from FedEx and UPS meant that US Post had to increase efficiencies and cut costs, making job insecurity and job-related stress very high. Finally there’s individual dynamics. People with certain personality traits, such as high anxiety or a quick temper, might have difficulty when confronted by workplace abuse. McInvale, for instance, was a high-strung former marine who had trouble handling stressful situations at work. Ultimately, his personality, combined with the other stressful factors in and around the organization, led him to snap. Being bullied is bad enough, as the feeling of isolation makes us unhappy and distraught. However, the effects of mobbing extend far beyond our feelings. Being constantly undermined by coworkers can be career-halting, and can leave victims with a gaping hole in their lives. Many people’s lives are centered around their careers, so much so that it can be the focal point of their entire personal identity. Having their career taken from them, therefore, can inflict very serious injuries. Some of these injuries are physical. Often, victims of mobbing suffer high levels of stress and misery, which can lead to heart problems, high blood pressure, fatigue and insomnia. Many serious psychological illnesses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are also associated with workplace mobbing. Victims feel trapped in a toxic environment filled with abuse. They desperately want to leave, but at the same time need to stay at the company to make ends meet and build up their resume. These contradicting stressors sometimes lead to PTSD. Adding to this, depression and being ostracized by coworkers (many of whom once seemed like friends) can make victims of mobbing feel alienated and worthless. Sometimes, it causes them to lose all faith in their abilities. While mobbing is rarely their fault, many victims nonetheless blame themselves, rather than the organization, for their suffering. Workplace mobbing can likewise damage the victim’s career. Many victims feel that they are unable to return to work again after being mobbed; they question their ability to work and, even if they do recover, they may lose confidence in their work performance, which keeps them stuck on the same rung of the career ladder. Many victims, in fact, leave the organizational workplace altogether, preferring entrepreneurship or self-employment. While mobbing centers around the abuse of a single person, that doesn’t mean that this one person is the only sufferer. In fact, mobbing affects the people around the target, and at great cost to the company where mobbing is taking place. For starters, mobbing affects the personal and work relationships that surround the victims of mobbing. Spousal and parent-child relationships are just one of many examples. The stress that comes from mobbing is often passed on to the victim’s loved ones. After all, if you have to devote all your energy to overcoming difficulties in the workplace, how much energy will you have left for your spouse or child? Furthermore, bystanders who witness mobbing also often suffer. Just witnessing instances of mobbing can lead to physical and psychological damage similar to that suffered by the victim. Incredibly, according to one study, witnesses of workplace mobbing reported higher levels of stress than emergency workers and first-responders! Finally, workplace mobbing affects the company where it takes place. The company not only loses all the skills and experience that the ousted mobbing victim brought to the table, but may also experience higher turnover rates as other employees become dissatisfied with the toxic working environment. Replacing staff is a costly affair, especially if the process of hiring new workers is ongoing due to continual mobbing. And as staff become more dissatisfied and stressed, the amount of hours lost to sickness, absenteeism and lost productivity rises with it, further burdening the company. In fact, some estimate the total monetary cost to US companies due to workplace abuse at somewhere between $180 million and $250 billion a year. Clearly, workplace mobbing has terrible consequences for everyone involved. Our final blinks will look at ways victims of mobbing can get their lives back. If you are a victim of workplace mobbing, you don’t have to feel that your situation is hopeless. While recovery can be slow, it’s not impossible. On your road to recovery, there are a few things that you ought to keep in mind. First, remember that grief is a necessary response to loss. Mobbing can take away all the things you once held dear. Be sure to take the time to grieve what you’ve lost, and don’t force yourself to snap out of it straightaway. Second, you’ll need to prioritize networking. After suffering from social exclusion, it’s tempting to shun networks and society altogether. But you must avoid this kind of thinking. Not only is a strong social community generally good for you, it also provides the support you need after your traumatic experience. Take care to continue nurturing your relationships with loved ones, and go out and find new networks of friends. Why not try volunteering, joining an art class or finding some other social activity you might enjoy? Of course, it’s also important to seek professional help from therapists, medical professionals and career counselors. But to ensure that you take the clearest route out of that mobbing malaise, you’ll need a good plan. First, build a support network of people you trust. Then, select the five life areas (such as trust, career, relationships, etc.) that have suffered the most as a result of mobbing. Then prioritize fixing these areas. Talk to your support team about your experiences with mobbing and listen to their perspective. Their advice and perspective will help you gain insights into what exactly happened, and they will have ideas on how to move forward in the future. Finally, as you move forward, follow an iterative process by asking yourself: Am I moving forward in the right way? If not, what can I do to adjust my trajectory? Every case is different, so be sure to remain flexible. Everyone wants to work in a healthy environment, and companies play an important role in making the workplace healthier and more resistant to mobbing. It’s therefore crucial that your company understands and acknowledges workplace mobbing, as well as the measures one takes to address and prevent it from happening. Traditionally, organizations were evaluated primarily in terms of their profitability and productivity. However, in today’s world, the good reputation of a company also hinges on the degree to which they care for their employees. Companies therefore need to look beyond profits as their metric for workplace success. That’s not to say that profits don’t play a role. Indeed, it’s in the organization’s financial interest to prevent mobbing, as healthy workplaces are more profitable than unhealthy ones. If you need convincing, consider that some of the most successful companies, among them Google and Starbucks, rank high in overall revenue performance and in their dedication to the health and well-being of their employees. In order to create a healthy work environment, you need to become a speak no evil company. In contrast, places where mobbing thrives are either see no evil companies, which ignore mobbing and bullying and focus only on profits, or hear no evil companies, which have established guidelines against abuse but focus on individual bullying rather than workplace mobbing. Speak no evil companies value people (both customers and employees), and place their primary focus on their well-being throughout the organization. Catholic Health Service is one such company. They always rank highly in both patient happiness and employee satisfaction. According to their value statement, they put patient care first, employee care second and community third in their list of priorities. Profits don’t even appear on the list! As a result of their people-focused business ethos, abuse within the organization is low and most staff retire after 30 years of service or more. The key message in this book: Workplace mobbing is a worrying phenomenon that doesn’t just ruin the lives of those at whom it’s directed, but the lives of those who witness it or are close to the victim, too. However, that doesn’t mean victims of mobbing are helpless! With the right techniques we can overcome the damage done by mobbing.

Do you think it’s unfair that a higher power, or fate or simply genetics endowed these people – and not you – with such exceptional talent? These blinks will show you that after decades of scientific research, we now know that no one is born a genius, or blessed with supernatural talent. Instead, talented people work hard to develop the skills they make seem second nature, dedicating endless hours to practicing correctly. So how do you need to approach practicing to become a top performer? And what part does your brain play in this process? Well, let’s get into it. In these blinks, you’ll learn how an “ordinary” guy learned to memorize 82 digits; why being a cab driver changes your brain’s structure; and why Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wasn’t a genius. It is said that Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart could identify any musical note, regardless on which instrument the note was played. But few people know how he was able to do this. Have you ever wondered how Mozart achieved such tremendous musical ability, or how some people memorize thousands of digits in pi as if doing so was as easy as knowing your phone number? We used to think such genius was the product of innate talent or a special, spiritual gift. But in reality, anyone can acquire highly specialized skills. It just takes practice. Consider perfect pitch, the ability that Mozart had to identify any musical note without a known tone for reference. This skill is rare; only one in 10,000 people can do it. Perfect pitch is considered an example of an innate ability. Yet a recent study found that having perfect pitch isn’t innate at all. In 2014, Japanese psychologist Ayako Sakakibara set out to teach 24 children between the ages of two and six how to identify the 14 different chords on a piano. Several times a day, every day for months, she taught the children chords. As the children progressed, Sakakibara tested them on individual notes. At the end of the experiment, all the children could correctly identify notes when played. In other words, they had acquired perfect pitch. It stands to reason that with the right training, any person can learn perfect pitch, too. This would require diligent instruction and practice, however, starting at the age of six. The point is, under favorable conditions, perfect pitch is something that almost anyone can master. Humans can develop highly specific skills regardless of the skill in question, be it music or otherwise, because of the way the brain responds to practicing. You’ll learn how in the next blink. London is a vast, sprawling city with thousands of streets that intersect at the oddest of angles. With a population of more than 8.5 million, the city is also home to hundreds of restaurants, housing estates, shopping malls, office buildings and all sorts of establishments catering to its many inhabitants. And if you want to be a taxi driver in London, you’ve got to know your way around this maze! Sounds daunting, right? While some tasks – like memorizing all of London’s streets – might seem impossible, humans can learn many difficult skills given the brain’s ability to adapt. Just as your body grows stronger when you lift weights, your brain is “plastic,” meaning it changes when you train it. Neuroscientist Eleanor Maguire at the University College London performed an experiment to test this idea in 2000. As part of her work, she compared the brains of London taxi drivers with those of non-drivers. Maguire found that cab drivers had a larger posterior hippocampus, the part of the brain that helps you navigate space and memorize locations. Also, drivers who had been in the trade the longest had the largest hippocampi. To be sure the data she gathered was scientifically relevant – that is, that cab drivers didn’t just start with large hippocampi, which helped them excel at the job – she scanned the brains of two groups of people. Her two groups were people about to start taxi driver training, and ordinary non-drivers as a control. At the start, she found no difference in hippocampi size between the two groups. Four years later, however, when she performed the test again, she found that the hippocampi of the now-trained taxi drivers were larger than those of her control subjects. This study implies a connection between navigation skills and the size of the brain’s posterior hippocampus. When trained, this part of the brain can clearly grow, becoming capable of executing tasks it couldn’t handle before deliberate training. So now we know that practice can change the human brain. But does practice affect thinking or the way we perceive situations? When you read the words “Mona Lisa,” you probably think of the famous painting of a mysteriously smiling woman by Leonardo da Vinci. When this happens, your brain “sees” the picture. This is called a mental representation. Mental representations are structures that are stored in the brain that correlate to particular objects, images, movements or anything that brain might have processed and stored for later retrieval. In a broad sense, mental representations allow you to sidestep your short-term memory, an ability that can be quite useful. Short-term memory is great for certain things, like remembering the words you just read to understand this sentence. But to memorize an entire language, you need the power and capacity of your long-term memory. Simply put, without the ability to store all the rules of a language in your long-term memory, you wouldn’t be able to communicate with the ease that you do. Here’s where mental representations come into play. These well-organized patterns of information, stored in long-term memory, allow you to respond quickly to the situation in which you find yourself. For example, these representations remind you that the Mona Lisa is a famous painting, which is why you don’t need to constantly relearn the significance of the painting every time you come across a reference to it. Mental representations also play a role as a performance booster. We know it takes years of practice to become an expert in a field, whether driving a taxi or playing chess. Only through practice can you develop detailed representations of the situations or movements that matter to your performance. Let’s consider the sport of baseball. Plenty of fans have a handful of mental representations stored away, but they're nothing compared to those of professional baseball players. Because of all the practicing they do, professional players have developed sophisticated representations of all the potential trajectories of a baseball. This means that when a batter receives a pitch, he can predict within a split second how fast it will approach, whether it’s a curveball or slider, and know exactly how to swing his bat. In this way, practice really does make perfect. But not any type of practice will do. Next, you’ll learn which type of practicing is required to develop specialized skills. Do you think that a professional musician, athlete, scientist or entrepreneur developed their skills and talents overnight? It’s unlikely. Instead, they probably used purposeful practice to achieve success. This technique pushes you to build skills through several mechanisms, including setting clear, specific goals, being focused, leaving your comfort zone and receiving constant feedback. To better understand how purposeful practice is achieved, consider an experiment by the author in the 1970s. A Carnegie Mellon University undergraduate named Steve was asked to memorize an ever-expanding string of numbers as the string was read out loud to him in one-second intervals. Steve did not already have any particular facility with numbers or memorizing. In general, most people can memorize around seven digits without much trouble, and initially, Steve proved no different. But with lots of training and practice, Steve could memorize chains of numbers that were 82 digits long. How did he achieve this? First, Steve had a clear and specific goal: to memorize more numbers than he could previously. Second, throughout the experiment, he remained focused. Steve also was pushed outside his comfort zone, as he was constantly encouraged to move past his current level of performance. If he managed to memorize 28 numbers in one session, for example, the trainer would start the new session by having him recite another string of the same length. Then immediately afterward, the trainer would ask Steve to memorize a string of 29 digits – a higher performance bar. And finally, Steve also received feedback on his performance, as the trainer would always inform him how he had done. This last mechanism is crucial. After all, how can you improve if there’s no one to tell you how you’re doing? Regardless whether you’re practicing sonatas or German grammar, it’s essential to know if you’re learning it correctly. Through purposeful practice, you can learn all manner of specialized skills. But purposeful practice is just a step toward a greater goal, which you’ll learn about in the next blink. Now we know that purposeful practice is essential to becoming a great performer. But what sets apart great performers from people who seem to touch genius? They achieve this through deliberate practice, or purposeful practice that’s informed. For your practice to become deliberate, two things need to happen. First, the practice must be applied to a field that’s well-developed, meaning that there are already more experienced practitioners in the world whose level of performance clearly differs from those who are just starting out. Second, deliberate practice requires a teacher or coach who can train a student using the practice activities necessary to improve. The musical tradition has developed over centuries, and obviously, there are differences in the quality of musical performances. Also, it’s not uncommon to find piano teachers who are expert performers in their own right. These musicians have developed sophisticated training techniques that help their students acquire the necessary skills to become experts themselves. In essence, deliberate practice must not only be based on a field with established experts but also involve guidance on how the student can become an expert. Thus you can take advantage of the specific techniques that teachers have used to achieve excellence to find excellence in your practice. By adopting a teacher’s knowledge, a student is given a template to follow, eliminating the need to start from scratch or waste time figuring out basic facts common to the field. For instance, let’s say you want to become a star high jumper. With a great coach, you won’t have to figure out things like the best place to start your jump, or how to achieve maximum distance. But let’s pause for a moment. If nearly any skill can be learned through intentionally guided practice, what does that say about the concept of talent? Now you know that highly specialized skills can be developed through diligent practice. But aren’t some abilities the result of sheer genius or a sort of talent bestowed by a higher power? Many people tend to think this is the case, believing that outstanding performers owe their skills to innate talent, especially in cases where landmark performances are inexplicably accomplished early in a performer’s life. What other explanation could there be for such unusual, extraordinary abilities? Many of Mozart’s biographers, for example, have pointed to the fact that he began composing at the age of six, and that he wrote a symphony just two years later. Innate talent seems like a convenient catch-all to explain how a small child could accomplish so much in such a short time. Yet there’s no evidence that innate talent exists. Rather, the incredible abilities of top performers, even a genius like Mozart, seem to be the result of deliberate practice. In fact, Mozart might not have accomplished that much when he was young. Evidence now suggests that the first compositions ascribed to him when he was eight years old match the handwriting of his father, Leopold Mozart, a composer who trained his son from a young age. While Mozart went on to become a legendary musical figure, he didn’t write any significant musical pieces until his teenage years, after nearly a decade of honing his skills through deliberate practice. The same holds for many other performers. Talented people don’t take shortcuts. They’ve all practiced deliberately for years, building their brains’ capacities by creating advanced mental representations. The key message in this book: Innate talent just doesn’t play much of a role in performance. Instead, the key to performing your best in whichever field you choose is to practice deliberately. By devoting yourself to a methodological training schedule, you can master almost any skill.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maybe you want to transfer to a new position within your firm or even change industries. Perhaps you’re a manager who wants your employees to be satisfied and productive. Regardless of which of these might apply to you, you probably know that making a major shift in your career direction can take time, and – if done badly – can be very expensive. But it needn’t be. The following blinks will teach you how to pivot. There are four steps involved: plant, scan, pilot and, finally, launch. There’s also a fifth element, lead, if you’re a manager looking to apply these useful lessons for your own employees. Join Jenny Blake as she shows you just how easy and efficient changing careers can be. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a failed bondage-teaching enterprise became a helpful stepping stone; how often the average American changes jobs; and what’s so special about the cheese counter at Whole Foods. We all know the feeling: you’re stuck in a rut in your job, but you’re too scared to switch things up and get out. After all, it might well put your finances at risk. Perhaps your family and friends have expressed concern at your desire to change tracks. They might even say it’s some sort of age-related crisis. But guess what? It’s perfectly normal for you to feel that way. These days, it’s quite normal to have multiple careers. Few people stay at the same company for their entire working lives before retiring – things just don’t work that way anymore. In fact, the average American employee stays in one position for just four to five years. Adam Chaloeicheep is a case in point. Chaloeicheep was once creative director of a real estate development company in Chicago, but, burnt out, he left his job and headed off to Thailand to study meditation. Eight months later he was back. His mind was clear. His passions for fashion, technology, entrepreneurship and brand strategy would now guide him. He went back to school to broaden his skill set and then started his own company, ABC Design Lab. Fulfillment and financial success followed soon after. Yes, Chaloeicheep’s story is a little on the extreme side. But it’s indicative of a broader trend. A recent Gallup poll showed that up to 90 percent of employees are either “not engaged” or “actively disengaged” from their jobs. It’s no great surprise, then, that people are on the lookout for new opportunities. Crises that make you look elsewhere are in no way voluntary. But you can use that same outward-looking mentality to make a deliberate career shift in a new direction. It’s known as a career pivot, and to do it, you don’t even have to leave your current employer. Let’s take Amy Schonberger as an example. She felt stuck as a senior creative strategist in a public relations firm, but she wasn’t ready to ditch just yet. Rather than looking for new jobs, Schonberger started taking responsibility for social media and blogging. Her coworkers weren’t interested themselves. They felt working in social media would damage their reputations. But Schonberger knew better, and before long, she found herself dealing with the company’s biggest clients. Her status as a social media expert soon led to her appointment to a new, official role: director of digital entertainment. Pivoting isn’t something you do without planning though. Let’s look now at all the stages along the way. It makes no difference whether you want to found a company or if you want to take on a new role at your current firm – change can be overwhelming. However, you can make things easier by zooming out to get the big picture and thinking about how you want to plant your pivot. There’s no need to get tangled up in the hows and whens of your pivot just yet. First of all, establish your vision: think carefully about what your broader values are. The author once had a client, Justin, who was sick of working for his family’s real estate business. Instead of delving into the issues of what Justin should do, the author’s first step was to identify Justin's values and status. Through their discussions, they determined that the most important factors for Justin were his health, financial security, environment and relationships with like-minded people. Based on this information, they were able to discuss Justin’s career options together. Within a few months, Justin had been accepted to a business school in San Diego on a scholarship. There, he was able to meet new and inspiring friends, in a place that offered an inspiring and healthy environment. The trick is to keep the focus of your dreams tight. Don’t start thinking long-term and in generalities; instead, define a pivot vision based on your values for the next couple of years. Consider the author’s sister-in-law, Gillian. One day, while on the conveyor-belt career path that would make her a lawyer, she realized she wanted to get off. She didn’t want to spend the year after law school writing legal documents  – she wanted to become more engaged. She needed an environment in which she could be flexible and physically active, and in which she could interact with like-minded peers. Perhaps most of all, she wanted to start a business and a family with her husband. Gillian had been taking a CorePower Yoga Teacher Training course at the time. Soon after starting, yoga had become central to her happiness. Even though she passed the bar, she decided to quit her position at the law firm to teach at a yoga studio and get involved in the yoga business. She was able to utilize her unique background to her advantage, and soon had a managerial position at the studio. This work left her feeling far more fulfilled than she would ever have been as a lawyer. The lesson here is clear: if you clearly define your values and your vision, you’ll be more equipped for large-scale changes. You’ll know just what to do when those daunting decisions inevitably come up. Thinking about making a change to your career is almost sure to stoke anxiety. It would for anyone. After all, you’ll be starting from scratch and losing your current regular paycheck. To deal with this fear while you’re planting your pivot, you’ll need to evaluate your current situation; this is the second part of planting. It implies considering how your current strengths will help you move on and up. The result is that you won’t be starting over with a blank slate, as you’ll know exactly where your strengths lie. Ask yourself: Are there any specific challenges I’m attracted to? What energizes me? Sometimes, your career portfolio can provide the answer. Other times, you might have to look back a bit. Take Jason Shen. He began in content marketing, but took up a product manager position at a start-up. As he was transitioning into his new role, he found an end-of-the-year evaluation from his kindergarten years hidden among old documents at home. In it his teacher had written, “He especially enjoys computer work, games and making things.” It was confirmation that his interest in computers and building had been there from the start. And what’s more, it gave him a huge boost of confidence: he realized that he wasn’t some hanger-on to Silicon Valley culture. He now knew that his new position was sure to play to the strengths he had had his entire life. You can also decrease the stress involved in change by obtaining a better understanding of your financial situation. That way, you’ll know when you can afford to take a big risk and – just as critically – when you can’t. Let’s look at Andrew Deffley. When he turned 30, Deffley decided to transition away from being a production manager at NFL Films, where he’d been for eight years. He wanted to fulfil his lifelong dream and become an actor, but he knew he couldn’t go into it blindly. He had to take stock of his financial situation and come up with a plan. First, he would save enough so that he could take a six-month break from NFL Films. He could use that time to see if acting was the right thing for him. Then, if he still wasn’t earning enough from acting alone after six months, he would start up a side hustle of production-related work. That way, he could continue to audition for roles. These side earnings played to Deffley's strengths by using his already-acquired skills. He was able to keep himself financially secure, while simultaneously pivoting toward his dream career with confidence. It worked out well. Since starting, Deffley has landed roles in web series and TV shows including I Love Ryan? and Orange is the New Black. Once you’ve got a good idea of the foundations required for a pivot, then it's time to scan for opportunities. Some people think what’s needed at this stage is a career mentor, someone to dispense expert advice in the long term. But it can be a laborious task finding someone to take on this time-consuming role. But no worries, it’s actually better to work with a series of one-off mentors and experts. In many cases, these advisory sessions morph into longer-term mentorships. The author herself is a case in point. When she was beginning as a career coach and speaker, she didn’t look for a long-term mentor. Instead, she called up Susan Biali, an expert in coaching and speaking, and asked for a one-off conversation. During the call, Biali offered to help her on a regular basis, even suggesting they check in each month. They’ve actually kept in contact to this day. If you think of these conversations as one-off interactions, that’ll park questions relating to long-term mentorship. You won’t feel you’re pushing your mentor for more time in the future. Aside from these one-off mentors, you should also build up a mastermind group of friends and peers with similar interests, who you can ask whenever questions come to mind. Let’s consider Luke Schrotberger. He was a consultant to an Alaskan oil and gas group and he wanted to pivot within his company. Schrotberger reached out to a peer for guidance. He had himself pivoted within the company. Your mastermind group might include friends who have similar goals to you. The author and her friend Alexis Grant are just like this. While they were both writing their books, they made sure to be in daily contact to keep each other on track by sharing experiences with each other. But what do you do when you don’t have friends or colleagues who can help? Thankfully the internet is a savior here. There are loads of sites and communities you can ask. The author believes her own ten-week courses are just the ticket for keeping your momentum up. These courses worked for Lora Koenig, who found a mastermind group thanks to the author’s program. She used them as a support system as she transitioned from product management to agricultural development as a Peace Corps volunteer in rural Ethiopia. However you choose to find your support network, the general lesson is clear: the relationships you foster at the start of your pivot are sure to help you throughout the entire pivoting process. We all know those people who are a bit too passive in their outlook; they sit around waiting for a miracle to happen. If you really want to switch things up, however, you need to actively scan for new breaks. And the most successful pivoters are those who look for opportunities related to their strengths. Consider Shawn Henry. In 1999, he’d been at the FBI for ten years and wanted to transition from his job as a special agent into a supervisory role. However, despite his experience and dedication, Henry found his applications rejected when he applied for four different positions across the agency. Then, he noticed that the position of chief of computer investigations was being advertised. Although Henry had no experience in the FBI’s computer division, he reckoned that he could lead the division in the face of rising digital crime. He felt he could apply the tactics he’d learned as a special agent – such as wiretapping and undercover work – to the digital realm and to the internet. He landed the job. Eventually, Henry worked his way up to becoming executive assistant director, the third-most important position in the FBI, before founding his own cybersecurity start-up, CrowdStrike. And it was all made possible by being proactive and using his strengths to sniff out opportunities. Another way you can create your own opportunities is by doing what’s known as platform-building, which can help make your desired direction known to all. Photographer Daniel Kelleghan is a good example. After quitting his product photography job at Groupon, he was able to shoot the fashion and architecture photos he’d always wanted to. In the meantime, he used corporate gigs to supplement his income. Kelleghan was able to gain a cult following for his photos on Instagram. Thanks to Instagram featuring his work, he was able to hit 100,000 followers almost overnight, which gave him an instant breakthrough. These days, Kelleghan’s platform gives his clients, such as Audi and Warby Parker, a way to get in contact to ask if he can shoot their products. He offers companies the chance to place their products in his Instagram feed, and he especially likes contacting hotels in places he wants to visit. That way, he gets to travel and stay in nice hotels for free. The point is that Kelleghan never stopped creating opportunities. He achieved success through education, hard work and sheer will. Without that, his “lucky break” would never have been possible. You've identified your next big move, and you’ve done it by recognizing your values and finding helpful resources. Now it's time to test out your vision in the third stage of the four-step method: piloting. The idea here is to seek out ways to pilot small-scale versions of your larger vision. That way, you can determine through experimentation whether your pivot is actually something that thrills you. Based on the results, you can adjust your methods according to your strengths and goals. Let’s look at Christian Roberts and Bill Connelly, the improv comedians behind Angry Landlord, a New York comedy show. Angry Landlord began as an experimental collaboration, since the comedians wanted to channel their talents into a new format that would fit with their interests. However, when they looked out from the stage during their third show and saw just eight people in the audience, they knew they’d have to adapt. What was and wasn’t working? What were their strengths?   Then they hit upon the answer: they had to network with comedians and build their brand. As such, they adjusted their approach and started building their social media profile. Before too long, they were posting short YouTube videos and expanding their network of comedians. Thanks to these efforts, Angry Landlord has been a sellout show ever since. Sometimes you should pilot in stages, which means incrementally increasing the risk in your experiments. That way, you don’t enact new changes all at once. Bob Gower did this. He’s a business consultant for Fortune 100 companies but was once working on developing a beginners' bondage course for couples. Gower set up a series of pilots to test his idea. However, he used the pseudonym Ryan White so as to keep the hustle separate from his day job. Instead of going all-in with a huge investment in the project, Gower continued his consulting. He thought that if enough people were interested in the Facebook group and the free PDF guide to basic bondage he’d written, he’d see it as an indication that there would also be interest in an e-book. And then, if his e-book was successful, he’d work on developing an online course. However, the experiments turned out differently than he expected. Gower still liked the project, but realized there wasn’t any point expanding it into a full-time gig. It wasn’t a waste of time, though. He was able to use his real-life stories about his bondage business endeavor in his consulting work. Not only did it give him an edge, it also made him seem authentic. Maybe you, like Gower, will find that your piloting will take you down a different path from the one you first envisaged. Once you’ve evaluated your values for planting your pivot, scanned for opportunities and connections and piloted your putative move, the only thing left to do is launch. But for some people, fear of failure can keep them from actualizing their pivot in the first place. Don’t get caught in this trap. Identify specific launch criteria to determine when to set your plan in action. You’ll need to engage in some basic troubleshooting and be prepared. Using launch criteria worked for Tom Meitner. Meitner worked answering customer service emails. His wife, Amanda, did the same job but on a different shift. They never had the chance to see each other. Meitner knew he was overqualified for his job and decided to write to 300 companies and offer his services as a copywriter. Meitner reckoned that a benchmark of success would be earning $2,500 a month freelancing. If he hit that figure, he would know he could launch properly. Within three weeks he had already made $3,000. Soon enough, he found himself in a position where he could take on more interesting work, instead of just anything he could get his hands on. Not long after that, he was able to raise his rates, and was making a six figure sum each year – all while working mostly at home. Meitner’s launch criterium was a financial benchmark, but yours needn’t be. It could also be a specific date, a milestone, an indication of external approval – such as acceptance to grad school – or even a gut feeling. More often than not, the anxieties involved in launching are rooted in a fear of failure. Just remember, though, that a good pivot also involves diverging from an original concept, especially if it’s clear that things aren’t going to plan. That’s not failure – that’s adaptation. Take Christian and John. They pivoted from their jobs as commodities traders and began SpringUps, an urban farming business. Even though the start-up was proving to be profitable after a year, it was clear that the project wasn’t going to be the cash cow they’d hoped. It wasn’t enough even to secure the financial future that was so important to them both. Consequently, they sold the company and parted ways – but they were able to bounce back. Rather than going back to trading, John landed a job at a predictive analytics startup. Christian, on the other hand, took a job in sales at a technology company. Ultimately, failures are just opportunities for another pivot. And if you feel stuck then just go back to those first three steps: plant, scan and pilot. And that’s how you pivot! What’s so great about the pivot method is that its usages aren’t limited to those pivoting into new careers. In fact, managers can employ it within their own companies. Although managers rarely discuss career mobility with their employees, a recent Inc. survey found that 51 percent of CEOs identified their biggest challenge as \"attracting and retaining skilled employees.\" If you're a manager, it's up to you to begin talking to your employees about pivoting. That’s how you keep good staff. Let’s consider Courtney John-Reader, an employee at an architectural firm. John-Reader felt she’d run her course as a digital communications coordinator at the company. Although she liked her projects as well as the company’s work, she felt she wasn’t valued enough, no matter how hard she worked. In the end, she quit. Sadly, John-Reader’s feelings are common among staff. As a manager, it’s your responsibility to promote and communicate a culture of mobility and recognition. But don’t discuss with your employees what they could or should being doing. Instead, use the basics of the pivot method: lead open-ended discussions using the simple question, \"what's next?\" On top of those efforts in leading a general discussion, you should offer real opportunities for your employees. Take the business and analytics software company SAS. SAS’s motto is “Pursue Growth and Learning.” It’s therefore keen on helping its employees reach their professional and personal goals. Consequently, the company offers business tools, equipment for hire, research resources and over 16,000 books, all with that aim in mind. You can also offer career programs to your employees. The supermarket chain Whole Foods does just this. It has job-specific certification programs that its employees can take, such as the training for the American Cheese Society’s Certified Professional Exam. These programs mean Whole Foods employees can gain skills and pivot to work in specialist sections within the company’s supermarkets. Just remember: be creative! It’s your aim to foster an environment where employees neither stagnate nor quit. It’s up to you to provide opportunities for them to pivot internally based on their skills and interests. In the end, it will be the company that benefits. The key message in these blinks: When seeking a career shift, begin by identifying your values, strengths and situation. If you then take small steps toward your goal and run experiments to test your way, pivoting can become not only manageable, but a way to keep your career exciting and dynamic. In today's job climate, pivoting provides you with the mentality you need to adapt to your surroundings, while fostering connections and opportunities. Actionable advice: Define your project-based purpose. When thinking about career motivations, we’re often encouraged to think of an all-encompassing purpose for our lives. Instead of thinking in such daunting terms, define a project-based purpose based on your values and what you want to accomplish. If you’re a teacher, perhaps you have a long-term purpose of contributing to the well-being and happiness of your students. With that in mind, you might create a project-based purpose of organizing fun and creative after-school activities. This project-based purpose will allow you to see more immediate results of your goals. If you get stuck defining your project-purpose, think about what impact you want to have on your friends, your family, your community, or society at large! Got feedback?

Are you torn between wanting to unleash your idea and the fear that it might fail? Well, you should know that you’re not alone. Even the most successful innovators have experienced these same worries. As the author and marketing guru Seth Godin makes clear, there’s always a fear of falling flat on your face when you’re striving to be the first out the door with a brilliantly innovative idea. Maybe you’ll be ahead of your time, or maybe the original idea will fail but will lead to the next idea that then proves to be the real game-changing winner. This could very well be the case, but you’ll never know unless you take that first step and instigate your idea. We live in a great era for people with innovative visions. Thanks to an economy with willing investors and inexpensive business models, it’s high time for you to take the leap and see what happens. In these blinks, you’ll discover what a poker player can teach you about persistence; what a Canadian rock band has to do with problem-solving; and why you shouldn’t propose half-baked ideas to people in restaurants. What would you do if there were no obstacles in your way? Is there a dream project you’d pursue if you had all the resources and the cooperation from others you needed? These days, instead of money, contacts and powerful organizations, the most important success factor for businesses is instigation capital: the desire and entrepreneurial spirit required to take the initiative and turn your dreams into a reality. In the past few years, money has become less important for business success. In 2012, 67 internet start-ups were funded in San Francisco and New York. But traditionally, the amount of money needed for this would have only covered around 20 companies in Silicon Valley. This illustrates how much cheaper it is to operate a successful business these days. This means that money and networks are no longer the most crucial factors for launching a successful venture. What you really need is the drive to pursue your goals. What you need is instigation capital. Anyone can take a business class and learn about marketing, distribution and all the other elements of business. What’s not taught in class is instigation. Yet, if there’s no one around to inspire and push an idea forward, there is no business – and certainly no product to market and distribute. Without initiative, all anyone can do is sit back and watch the changes that other players are instigating. Take Wikipedia, for example. It was started in 2001 by regular people who were inspired to build an online encyclopedia that was open to contributions from anyone. Though the idea wasn’t to overtake the dominant player at the time, Encyclopaedia Britannica, that’s exactly what happened. And the reason was that Encyclopaedia Britannica lacked the initiative to take advantage of the internet. With countless investors ready to fund the next great idea, there’s just one thing separating the next Wikipedia from the next Encyclopaedia Britannica: the initiative to bring that idea to life. Many people wait their entire lives for someone to give them their lucky break. But those who manage to bring their dreams to life don’t wait around for permission. They go ahead and poke the box, which is a habit that you too should start cultivating immediately. Poking the box is something curious people do, metaphorically speaking, as part of the innovative process. The term derives from a box-shaped toy the author’s uncle created for his cousin. Poking the various switches and controls on the box resulted in different combinations of lights and sounds. Take computer programming, for example. If you want to be a successful programmer, you’re not going to get there by following someone else’s code step by step. This isn’t how great new software comes into being. Instead, innovative programmers poke the box by trying something new, seeing what happens and proceeding accordingly through the process of trial and error. And your idea doesn’t need to be world-changing – it could be something as simple as finding a better way to deal with angry customers and teaching it to others. But just taking the first step isn’t enough. Those who find success are the ones with both passion and patience. Take Annie Duke, the former World Series Poker champion who turned her first game into a $4 million career. At first, Duke was broke and just trying to pay her bills, but she decided to give the box that all-important first poke by going to her first poker game. That initiative paid off with two thousand dollars in winnings – but she didn’t stop there. Duke kept poking the box, eager to make a living by studying the game, testing strategies, failing and trying different methods until she was at champion level. She could have walked away at any number of stages, but by putting in the effort to master her craft, she became one of the best players on the planet. You might be thinking that this is easier said than done. Well, in the next blink, we’ll look at what you can do to overcome your fear of taking the initiative. You might have noticed an important part of Annie Duke’s success in the last blink: failure. This simple word can easily send shivers up people’s spines. Many of us are so afraid of failure that we let it keep us from ever taking the initiative. But failure doesn’t have to be scary. After all, anyone who’s found success will tell you that failure is a natural part of the process of achieving your goals. Sometimes, when you poke the box, the box pokes back, and you hit a roadblock. However, once you recognize this as a natural part of the evolution of your project, you’ll find that success pretty much takes care of itself. For example, there’s a Canadian indie rock band by the name of Hollerado that has recently attained fame. But they weren’t an overnight success: it took four years of relentless and creative dedication for them to break through. One of the initial challenges was finding gigs in the United States. Time and time again, American venues gave them the cold shoulder. But the band was undeterred. They started taking risks like showing up at a venue and telling a tall story about a nearby gig canceling on them and then asking if they could possibly play a small set before returning home? It never hurts to try one’s luck, and in this case, it actually often worked. In fact, they were eventually given the opportunity to tour in China. After a three-week tour, they recorded a song in Mandarin and self-released it on the internet, which enabled them to return for another tour six months later. Being in a rock band isn’t a guaranteed recipe for success. But whatever challenges Hollerado has encountered, they’ve succeeded by coming up with outside-the-box solutions that have kept them going and doing what they love most, which is playing music for people. Of course, it’s natural to fear failure, but the first step in overcoming it is to identify it. The author was once trying to teach a fearful and resistant child how to ride a bike. The boy had plenty of excuses about why he didn’t want to get on the bike: he didn’t have anywhere he wanted to bike to, and none of his friends rode bikes. But the author could tell that the real reason was a fear of falling. This is the same for everyone. To learn how to ride a bike, you have to accept that you’ll fall a couple of times. Once you recognize this fear and understand that it’s part of the process, you can stop making excuses, start moving past the fear and take the initiative. Remember: it’s better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all. If you can get past the fear of making that first leap into the unknown and starting your dream project, you’ll have gotten past the hardest part. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t still many hurdles to clear before you get to realize your dream and reap the rewards. The next challenge is finishing what you started. The journey from instigation to completion of a project is a lot like walking from your front door to another city hundreds of miles away. It’s entirely possible to do this, but every step of the way you might well question your motives and decide to quit. So, now’s the time to prove your mettle and keep moving forward even when quitting is the much easier option. This can be the case even when you’re not trying to bring some grand dream project to life. Let’s say your job is to pitch ideas to your boss, but she keeps rejecting your ideas month after month. The job then becomes finding the energy to keep going, to continue to poke the box and try to find that winning idea. This state of perpetual innovation is the key to most of today’s and yesterday’s most successful companies. They manage to create a culture of innovation. Originally, Henry Ford found success thanks to the assembly line, which allowed Ford to turn out less expensive and more efficiently made cars. Today, the assembly line continues to be the dominant mode of production by companies around the world. However, the newest, most innovative companies like Apple or Pixar build and organize teams around projects. This is one of the main reasons Google has consistently stood out among competitors like Yahoo! or About.com – they always have teams at work developing the next generation of tools and projects. It’s entirely possible that the majority of Google’s ideas will never work out or even see the light of day, but as long as one or two are successful, those few successes will likely outweigh the many failures. As we’ve seen, one of the biggest hurdles to clear in generating new ideas is taking that first step. However, for a significant portion of people, the problem isn’t starting, but rather overstarting. There’s a good chance you might know an overstarter – someone who loves to take on new projects before the previous ones are even completed. And while it’s great to have an endless supply of new ideas, overstarting can also be a form of self-sabotage. One of the bad ways in which overstarting can reveal itself is if a person sees every moment as a chance to start some new idea or project while being blind to its possibly harmful repercussions. For instance, let’s say you’re at a restaurant, and you spot Elton John sitting at another table. If you’re an overstarter, you might see this as the perfect opportunity to tell him what a big fan you are and to ask him to sing at your daughter’s wedding, even if that doesn’t really make sense. This kind of spontaneous behavior can easily end up ruining what could have actually been a great collaboration with the singer if you had a well-prepared idea and a professional pitch. Instead, you likely came off as rude, intrusive and unrealistic, sabotaging any chance of a future partnership. Propositioning everyone in their contact list, no matter how inappropriate it might be, is just one of the overstarter’s bad habits. But there are effective ways to rein in your overstarting urges, such as being well-prepared and understanding that poking the box requires a full commitment. When you’re initiating something, you need to commit to devoting the time and effort required to see it through to the end. A while ago, the author was giving a full-day seminar in Los Angeles, and before it started, he got an email from a stranger who wanted to set up a half-hour meeting backstage. The stranger’s email revealed a total lack of preparation that practically guaranteed that his projects were likely to fail. In a sense, this kind of lack of preparation is the same as not even trying at all. It’s easy to set yourself up to fail – anyone can do it. To succeed, you need patience, preparedness and perseverance, as these qualities will set you apart. If you’re well prepared, this will reveal itself during meetings with potential collaborators and instill in them confidence and willingness to be part of a well-thought-out project. The key message in these blinks: Innovation is the key to success, and it comes from poking the box, seeing what the response is and testing out exciting ideas. Bringing an idea to life is easier said than done but by recognizing our fears around failure, we can push ourselves to take the big leap into the unknown. Whether it’s a ground-breaking concept or a small, personal project, every endeavor requires the appropriate amount of attention, preparedness and determination to see it through to the end.

Instead, we keep our head down, work hard and hope that we’ll eventually move up the greasy pole. These blinks show how this way of thinking is completely wrong. They show that if you want to get power you have to work for it. They provide tips on how you can stand out among the competition and make your way to the top. In these blinks, you’ll discover why if you are a nail, standing up is best; how one Democrat tamed the Republicans; and the true value of a smile. Every day you work hard at your job: you come in early, find a way to accomplish all your tasks and responsibilities and you stay late into the night, burning the midnight oil. With all that you do, you’re convinced that a promotion is right around the corner, just as soon as the boss notices all your hard work. But actually, you could be waiting a long time, because a broad range of studies have shown that there’s not much of a link between job performance and promotions. For example, a study on Fokker — a Dutch aircraft manufacturer — found that white-collar workers were only 12 percent more likely to be promoted when they received a performance rating of “very good,” as opposed to merely “good.” And this leads us to a common misunderstanding: many people mistakenly assume that positions of power and prestige are earned by people who deserve them. In other words, most of us think that the world is a fair place, a mindset that was first described by psychologist Melvin Lerner as the just-world hypothesis. We think that successful people are the ones who follow the rules. This viewpoint prevents us from adopting techniques used by people who have achieved their power through nefarious means. When we see someone who got to the top by using a slightly underhanded or ruthless approach — maybe by taking a little too much credit for a team project or by being rude with coworkers — we tell ourselves, “He’ll get what’s coming to him!” Since we take it for granted that their bad behavior will somehow be punished, we don’t bother to learn from their success. But that mindset is way too limiting, because we’re missing out on a wide range of useful tips and techniques just because we don’t like the people who use them. When you see the President, you probably think to yourself: “Now that’s a natural leader! It looks like she was born to do this job.” This reflects a common mindset: we often believe that some people are naturally suited to power, as if they have some genetic gift for it. But, in fact, anyone has the potential to become a great leader: you can learn leadership! So what does an education in leadership consist of? Well, it starts by understanding what kinds of qualities are inherent to good leadership. And the most visible quality associated with leadership is confidence. Think about it this way: You cannot hope to become a great leader if you don’t think you can be one. Rather, you need confidence to move toward your goal. Whatever you’re trying to achieve — whether it’s climbing Mount Everest or getting promoted at work — you cannot possibly hope to succeed if you don’t think you’re capable of it. But confidence isn’t the only thing that characterizes leadership; so does energy. Since the path to power is marked by early mornings and late nights of hard work, you need lots of energy to succeed. There’s another important quality inherent in strong leadership, too: empathy, the ability to understand what other people want. Throughout your entire career, you’ll have to stand out to get noticed by the decision-makers at the top. Thus, it helps to know what they’re looking for: do the decision-makers want a sensible and reliable person, or would they rather find someone with great communication skills and the capacity to lead? Confidence, energy and empathy are only a few of the qualities associated with leadership — there are many others, such as resiliency and self-awareness. And, ultimately, reflecting on these qualities and honestly considering which ones you embody (and which you don’t) is the first step to increasing your personal power. Because in order to be successful, you need to have a clear grasp of both your strengths and your weaknesses. Once you know your weaknesses, you can train yourself to overcome them. And in the upcoming blinks, you’ll find out how to do just that. When it comes to building a career, most of us intuitively understand that a multinational bank probably offers better future prospects than a local grocery store. And yet, the differences that exist between companies also exist within companies themselves, in different departments. And if you want to be on the path to power, it’s important to land in the right department. Want proof? One study analyzed the career paths of 338 managers in a public utility that employs 3,500 people. The researchers found that managers who began their career in the more high-powered departments enjoyed higher salary growth and were also more likely to land in powerful departments at other companies when they changed jobs. So how can you figure out which department is most powerful? There’s no universal answer that works across companies, so you have to evaluate on a case-by-case basis. There are three factors to consider. The first is pretty simple: it’s a matter of relative pay. More powerful departments tend to offer higher salaries. Physical proximity to top leadership is another important indicator of power. For example, the location of departments in the Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s headquarters changed to reflect a shift in power. Over time, the law and finance units moved up in the building, so that they were closer to senior management, while the engineering department moved down. And during this period, the representation of law and finance employees who moved into senior management positions rose accordingly. The third key way to gauge departmental power is to look at the composition of important committees, like the board of directors. More powerful departments will have higher representation in these committees. There’s an old Japanese proverb, “the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.” The author turns this proverb on its head. Put yourself in the shoes of a manager trying to decide who should get a promotion: If you’re looking at a wooden plank with dozens of nails hammered into it, and there’s one nail sticking out, which nail would you choose? Simply put: When it comes to career advancement, being more visible gets you noticed. But how can you achieve this? Start by asking powerful people for help. For example, you could invite your boss to a lunch meeting and then ask her what steps you should take in order to get a promotion. The boss will likely remember that you were confident and daring enough to ask her that question. Many people are afraid of making these kinds of moves because they feel that people will ignore or reject them. This principle was demonstrated in a study conducted by business school director Frank Flynn and doctoral student Vanessa Lake. Participants had two tasks: (1) To ask other people for a small favor (to fill out a questionnaire), and (2) To guess in advance how many requests they would have to make before someone agreed to do the favor. Unbelievably, participants overrated the number of people they thought they would have to ask by a factor of three. As the study suggests, you shouldn’t be afraid of asking for what you want and being visible. But what should you do when that’s not enough? You also have to be memorable; you have to stand out from the crowd for doing things differently. Just think of world-famous sports stars like Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo is a great soccer player, but there are many great soccer players. Ronaldo doesn't break the rules of the game more often than others but he stands out because he breaks social rules by being overly narcissistic. Most of us can’t achieve power on our own; we need other people’s help to get to the top. But how can we get help? First, you need to provide something of value in exchange. In other words, you need to have resources: social support, money, career advice — any kind of asset people want or need. Sharing the resources you have will compel others to help you, because the exchange involves an element of reciprocity; after all, there’s a social obligation to return favors. For example, imagine you’re telling a colleague that you’re planning to move next weekend. And let’s say the colleague offers her help: if you choose to accept her assistance, you’ll probably have the feeling that you owe her something in return. And even if you don’t accept her offer at all, you still might feel obligated to offer her help next time she seems to need it. And, in fact, your ability to help others is a fantastic resource. In the workplace, there are plenty of boring menial tasks people seek to avoid. Helping a colleague with something like this won’t cost you very much, and will earn you a lot of gratitude. Let’s say your boss decides that your division should spend the day outside the office doing team-building activities. If you volunteer to help organize the day, your boss will be extremely grateful. Here’s another resource you can leverage: treat people fairly and politely. Don’t believe us? Consider Democrat Willie Brown, who was essentially ruled the California Assembly for 16 years. Although he promoted legislation that supported gay equality and the legalization of small amounts of marijuana, he received support from many ideologically-opposed Republican legislators. The reason for this unusual support? Brown had previously chaired a committee in which he treated Republicans with respect and fairness. He won respect, and thus his colleagues were willing to support him on certain matters, even when they personally disagreed. When you turn on any political talk show, you’ll see politicians quarreling with each other about whatever issue happens to be most controversial at the moment. Try to think of a moment when politicians from different sides of the aisle were able to agree about something. Can’t think of anything? Well, there is one thing: politicians agree that the way they speak and behave can communicate authority and influence people. This is an important principle all powerful people have internalized: the way you carry yourself influences the way people interact with you. And how you present yourself goes deep: your emotions don’t simply influence the people around you; they’re contagious. When you walk through a corridor smiling, for example, you’ll be greeted with smiles in return. A study on this very topic and its use in marketing found that people actually become happier themselves when they encounter others smiling. So, in this case, if they see an ad for a product containing someone smiling, the happiness will rub off on the customer — and she will have more positive feelings about the product. In short, if you want to become powerful, it helps to exude power. There are several ways you can do this convincingly. First of all, you should always display dominant behavior when interacting with others — for example, by displaying anger when you disagree with something. This was shown to be a successful strategy by psychologist Larissa Tiedens, who found that people who easily express anger are perceived to be strong, competent and smart. Another way to exude power is to take your time when speaking. This will prevent you from wasting words or contradicting yourself — which will make you seem competent. For example, the most successful politicians speak slowly and deliberately. They think about what they are going to say and make sure it’s clear and consistent. At the 2001 California Medical Association, Albin Avgher, PhD, presented a theory of human communication. Throughout his talk, Avgher expounded on some ideas and theories that went against the accepted practices of other physicians and attorneys in the audience. Nevertheless, most people stayed in their seats and listened attentively: They were truly interested in what this expert had to say. That is, they were interested until Avgher admitted that he wasn’t actually Albin Avgher, PhD, but rather a comedian named Charlie Varon — and that everything he had just said was completely made up. This anecdote highlights how much reputation matters if you want to get ahead. Because once people form a judgment about you, they’ll consistently find ways to back it up. In other words, they’ll concentrate on the things about you which are consistent with their judgement and ignore everything that isn’t. This process is called cognitive discounting. So since Varon had been introduced as a PhD, the audience members immediately assumed that he was an expert with a valuable opinion. This judgment led them to trust everything he said, even when it went against their prior knowledge. But it doesn’t end there: people modify their own behavior when they interact with you based on their assumptions. So if Varon had never gone on to disclose his real profession, the audience would have questioned him — though not by challenging his theories, but rather by asking less critically for supporting evidence about what they could learn from his research. As we’ve seen, reputation is crucial. How can you ensure that you have a good one? Well, nothing beats a first impression. If you fail at first, you might get stuck in an environment where people have a bad opinion of you. It might be easier to change companies than try to change anyone’s already established beliefs. Although most people are conflict-averse — that is, we try and avoid confrontation — the best leaders use a different tactic. These people realize that they’re bound to meet others with different goals and different values. And since they want to succeed, leaders figure out how to face these people head on and win them over. But of course, this approach isn’t about going out and picking a fight with just anyone. There are a few important ground rules to keep in mind. First of all, in order to become powerful, choose your fights wisely and don’t engage in unnecessary conflicts. There’s no reason to get worked up when someone parks in your favorite spot or forgets to put the milk back in the fridge. Instead, feel free to fiercely defend yourself when someone stands in the way of your main goals — by harshly criticizing your work, for example. And then when you do get involved in a conflict, always offer your opponents a graceful way to retreat. After all, you don’t want to make permanent enemies — people who feel compelled to attack you again and again — so act respectfully, even when you disagree with someone. This approach was the key to California Democrat Willie Brown’s political power. After winning a tough campaign fight, he helped his former rivals secure other kinds of desirable posts. Doing so kept them out of his way. Another important aspect of dealing with conflict has to do with how to move forward when you lose a battle. It’s natural to feel the desire to retreat when you experience an embarrassing failure, but don’t give in to the temptation. For inspiration, consider the story of Steve Jobs. When Jobs was fired from Apple, the company he co-founded in 1985, he considered leaving Silicon Valley. But instead he decided to start over. He started two companies, NeXT and Pixar, which went on to great success. He later called the whole experience, “the best thing that could have happened to me.” The key message: Although many of us mistakenly believe that power and success is earned by people who follow the rules, that’s not the most effective way to get what you want. Instead, you should develop your leadership skills, find ways to stand out from your competitors and exude confidence.   Actionable advice: If you want to establish a good reputation for yourself, ask for help! Too often, our attempts to promote ourselves are perceived as arrogance by other people. But if you can get someone else to promote you (by hiring a PR firm, for example), you can avoid this potential drawback. Suggested further reading: The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli The Prince is a 16th century guide on how to be an autocratic leader of a country. It explains why ends like glory and power always justify even brutal means for princes.

But when you really think about it, relationships are a meaningful part of both our professional and personal lives. The people we meet, befriend, collaborate with and fall in love with all play a huge part in shaping our futures. Of course, there are good relationships and bad relationships, but then there are power relationships. These are the ones that support us through difficult times, nurture our talents and propel us to accomplish amazing things. In short, they’re the sort of relationships that can make our dreams come true. But they’re also rewarding in that they require us to give, support and help the other person grow as well. According to the authors, there are 26 laws on how these most rewarding of relationships work. The blinks that follow are based on all of these laws and will show you how to form the kind of partnerships that can help define a career and a life. In these blinks you’ll find: which power relationship was at the heart of the TV show Judge Judy; how knowing the right question can be better than knowing the right answer; and why it’s never too early to start treating someone like a valued client. If you’ve ever watched an awards show, you may have thought about who you would thank if you were up at the podium accepting an award for your work. The average successful person will say they’ve had around twelve to fifteen vital relationships in their careers. We can call these power relationships. So how do you form them? Well, you can start by making sure you have great conversations. Bill Jenkins has come to learn the power of great conversation. In his career as a financial advisor, he was used to giving clients PowerPoint presentations. But then one day, Jenkins was approached by an assistant to one of his clients, and she told him that her boss actually enjoyed his informal talks with Jenkins more than anything else. She also told Jenkins that his competitors were getting pretty aggressive in trying to woo his client away, and it would probably be in Jenkins’s best interests to have fewer slides and more meaningful conversations. He took the advice and started having more conversations over lunch and coffee and, sure enough, he began to form a better idea of this client’s hopes and dreams than ever before. It not only led to him being in a better position to help his client – two years later, this client is one of the biggest revenue producers for Jenkins’s firm. This brings us to another important aspect of forming power relationships: never be afraid to ask a question. Years ago, one of the authors was helping to organize the annual Chamber of Commerce meeting in Alliance, Ohio. In an effort to raise the event’s profile, he came up with the idea of trying to book a legend of commerce, J.C. Penney, to be a guest speaker. At first, he asked the manager of the local JC Penney store to help connect him, but he refused. Determined, the author decided to call Mr. Penney directly, and just like that he was soon talking to the man, telling him how much he enjoyed reading his autobiography. He then explained how honored the town would be if he would speak at their meeting. Thanks to that initial heartfelt conversation, Mr. Penney not only accepted the offer but became his mentor and a lifelong friend. Some people like to make new friends every chance they get, while others are content with a small group of loyal friends. When building power relationships, you want to focus on quality over quantity. It’s always better to have a small network of committed people than hundreds of contacts. Think of your personal network as a group of twelve to fifteen apostles, with everyone dedicated to helping one another succeed and supporting one another’s projects. Good people to have in this network would be collaborators, donors, advisors and anyone who’s willing to go the extra mile to help you out. It’s also better to create this network now – before you find yourself wishing you had one. You never know, a strong relationship now could pay off big time later on down the road. This is exactly what happened to Petri Hawkins-Byrd, who worked for years as a courthouse bailiff in Brooklyn. During that time he nurtured a friendship with one of the judges, Judy Sheindlin. Fast forward to years later, Byrd found he had an amazing opportunity waiting for him in Los Angeles: as the bailiff for Sheindlin’s wildly popular TV show, Judge Judy. Now, this doesn’t mean that a person’s power or success should be the determining factor in whether you choose to connect with them. Instead of focusing on what position they happen to have now, you should concentrate on connecting with people you really like, and who share your interests and values. At any rate, it’s rare for people who find success later in life to bring a newcomer into their network. You’re much more likely to benefit from having started a power relationship with someone early on, prior to their success. Another tip for building a strong and useful network is to make sure it has people whose ideas and characteristics are different to yours. Think of the differences in the power duo of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. While Jobs was a charismatic and brilliant salesman who could charm anyone, Wozniak was a technical wizard who was in his element around other engineers. They were quite different, but they wouldn’t have created the Apple technology empire without each other. By creating your own diverse network early on, you’ll be setting yourself up for personal growth as well as some amazing future possibilities that you could never have predicted. When people think about the benefits of networking, it’s usually about what they can get out of it. But when it comes to power relationships, it's all about what you’re giving. This is why another rule of power relationships is to give people your confidence and unwavering belief. For the Pulitzer Prize-winning sportswriter, Walter Wellesley “Red” Smith, one of his most significant power relationships was with his homeroom grade school teacher, Miss Adelaide Breckenridge. From early on, Miss Breckenridge had an unwavering belief in Red’s writing ability, and encouraged him to keep working hard at developing his craft. Their relationship continued to grow during high school, when Miss Breckenridge would check in with him and ask about his work in English class. Even though Red lost touch with her after high school, he never forgot that early encouragement. And when he went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for his writing in 1976, Red heard from Miss Breckenridge once again: she sent him a note that said, “I told you so.” Power relationships are also strengthened by helping someone accomplish their agenda. Richard Major has 25 years of experience in providing clients with financial assistance, and he’s often ranked at the top of his firm in revenue earnings. When asked if there was a secret to his success, Richard took out a piece of paper containing a list of his top clients, along with a description of each client’s goal. He explained that it was his mission in life to make it possible for these people to accomplish their agendas. Along these lines comes another law of power relationships: acts of kindness and selflessness often create the most powerful bonds. Even small acts, like holding a door open or checking in with a colleague to see if they need help, can significantly strengthen a relationship. So, if you want to forge powerful relationships, think about how you can help the other person by offering support and learning about their goals, priorities and needs – both personally and professionally. Chances are, your generosity will come back around. Everyone likes a good shortcut, but the fact of the matter is, there’s no such thing as a shortcut to power relationships. These kinds of bonds require a strong foundation, and can’t be rushed. For example, one day, a man by the name of Sal showed up at one of the authors’ offices. He started by saying that he loved their books, and then requested that they immediately start working together. But this isn’t how the author works. Like any other potential new client, Sal was sent a proposal as a way of laying the foundation for a business relationship. But apparently unhappy that he couldn’t take a shortcut, Sal never responded. You may find some exceptions to this rule, but generally speaking, power relationships require time and dedication on both sides in order to lay a solid foundation of mutual respect. Only then will you start to reap the benefits. Another rule for power relationships is integrity. This pertains to the core principles of honesty, consistency and reliability, which must remain uncompromised. When one of the authors was working on a project in San Diego, he was thrilled when the businessman C. Arnholt Smith donated $5 million in fundraising money. Shortly afterward, however, Smith was busted for fraud and one of the project leaders knew that they had to return the money immediately as a matter of integrity. The author admits that his first thought was to seek a possible loophole that would allow them to keep the money. But in the end, he knew that the organization’s integrity was more valuable, as it was important to keep everyone on the team feeling good about where their funds came from. They ultimately proved that they could get the job done without the dirty money. Another key ingredient to power relationships is empathy. To illustrate this rule, the authors relay an anecdote they heard from a CEO who’d brought in an outside investment banking firm to evaluate the company. For his part, the CEO had a dedicated team working around the clock to prepare the evaluation. But at one point, the bank’s boss entered the room, and without showing any respect or empathy for the team’s effort, he picked up an employee’s sandwich and began eating it! Eventually, that employee became the Chief Financial Officer, and he made sure they never worked with that bank again. Once you’ve set the foundation for a power relationship, you can create an even deeper bond by establishing trust. And the thing about trust is that to earn it, you also have to give it. Without trust, relationships are doomed to fail from the beginning. For example, when a man at a New York City steakhouse went to pay his bill and realized he’d forgotten his wallet, he tried to explain this honest mistake to the owners, but they weren’t having it. He even offered to leave his iPhone behind while he ran to get his wallet, but instead, the owners had him arrested! Trust looks a lot different: Once, in a restaurant in Paris, one of the authors realized he’d forgotten his wallet in his hotel room. But rather than causing an embarrassing scene, the waiter contacted the hotel and had it all sorted out peacefully. No one benefits from a lack of trust. It makes the business look insulting and the client feel like a criminal. But when you do offer trust to your clients, you put yourself in a position where you can form lifelong relationships with loyal and appreciative customers. Another rule for power relationships is to prevent things from getting stale by regularly switching up the routine. We also see this in romantic relationships, as studies show how couples who regularly change their date night routines tend to feel more intimate and closely connected than couples who do the same thing every time. With that in mind, try making time together with your business partners and potential clients memorable. The next time you’re scheduling a meeting with a client, don’t just settle for the same old place. Instead, think of a new environment where you and your client can create a unique experience. As the saying goes, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.” So naturally, meeting someone for the first time can be stressful. When you’re about to sit down for an interview, you’re probably hoping that you’ll present yourself in a good light and have the right answers. However, it can often look better to have the right questions. It’s also good to ask questions that show you’re interested in what the other person thinks. When a CEO was giving a Q&A at a big industry conference, it wasn’t the questions about stats, figures and business decisions that interested him. What delighted the CEO was when he was asked more personal questions, like what he was most looking forward to in the years ahead. When one of the authors asked him this question, he not only became visibly energized in talking about an upcoming project, he thanked the author afterwards and told him to get in touch. If your meeting gets off to a rocky start, don’t panic. You can usually make a good impression by bringing up a shared interest, since having commonalities is always helpful in building strong relationships. The president of Yale University, A. Bartlett Giamatti, found himself in a tough spot when he was meeting with Fay Vincent, a wealthy alum from whom Giamatti was hoping to get a donation. When the meeting started, it was clear that Giamatti had done his homework and was well prepared, but this didn’t impress Vincent, who even said he had no interest in helping the Yale Law School. Giamatti came clean and admitted that he’d studied the file on Vincent, but then took a different route by mentioning that Vincent’s father actually went to Yale at the same time as Giamatti’s father, and maybe he’d like to make the donation in his father’s name? This bit of shared history got Vincent much more interested, and he became even more delighted when Giamatti got them talking about their mutual love for baseball. In fact, these shared interests laid the groundwork for a mutually beneficial friendship that would persist for years. So don’t dismiss a relationship if things get off to a rocky start. There’s always a chance that a bad first impression can lead to a life-changing relationship once you find that common connection that’s just waiting to be discovered. It’s highly competitive out there, so everyone is looking for new ways to gain an edge in keeping their current clients and gaining new ones. That’s why treating potential clients as though they’re already a valued part of your team is essential. Even if someone hasn’t officially signed on to be your client, that doesn’t mean you can’t start treating them as if they have. This includes meeting them for lunches, sharing ideas and inviting them to events where they can benefit from meeting other people in your network. These are all things that Mary Ellen Rodgers does as the corporate responsibility officer for the professional services company Deloitte. For one prospective client, Mary spent five years nurturing a relationship without ever once mentioning the benefits Deloitte could offer. This strategy, of treating everyone as though they're already a valued client, has proven to be so successful at bringing in new contracts that she single handedly tripled the company’s revenue. This is just one reason why she’s been ranked among America’s most influential women. As for your current clients, these relationships can be strengthened by aligning your efforts with their ambitions. When your clients can clearly see that your work is focused on helping them meet their specific plans for growth and profit, your relationship is sure to become more meaningful. Some businesses will boast to their clients that they’re using advanced technological methods to invest their money, but this doesn’t tell the client that their personal interests are being looked after. So rather than just treating all clients the same, explain how your efforts are centered around improving their specific business and getting them to where they want to be in the future. For example, Ellen is a partner at a large public accounting firm, and when she completes an audit for her clients, she always insists on sitting down with the CFO or SVP for at least two lunches every month. This is quite unusual for a standard audit, but it strengthens the relationship because it allows her to familiarize herself with the client’s priorities and goals. And when this happens, the client can see that Ellen is more interested in helping them grow than in ticking off another audit. One of Ellen’s talents is that she provides insight that clients can’t always see themselves, and that’s why she’s often hired to do additional work. This also shows that when you find ways to contribute to someone else’s growth, they’ll want you around forever! If you’ve ever sought out dating advice, you may have been told that people find it alluring when you play it cool and maintain a certain amount of mystery. This can apply to power relationships as well, as one of the laws states: it’s always good to keep people curious and intrigued. And one way of doing this is to always give people the information they need to know, rather than telling them everything you know. For example, when one of the authors was meeting with a potential client who was thinking of becoming more customer-centric, he told the client that there were risks involved in choosing this new business model. He explained that if other departments were to lose power because of this shift, the executives of those departments could try to sabotage the venture. Since the client had not heard this from any other potential consultant, their curiosity was piqued and they were eager to hire him. Another attractive quality to have is enthusiasm. Mannie Jackson’s enthusiasm took him on an amazing journey. It got him through the discrimination he faced as being the University of Illinois’ first African American basketball player. Then it made him a popular star of the Harlem Globetrotters. It would later help him become the executive vice president of the Fortune 100 multinational company, Honeywell. Other times, however, call for another quality: vulnerability. During the campaign for the 1952 presidential election, Richard Nixon was running as vice president alongside the Republican presidential nominee, Dwight Eisenhower. Just before the election, reports came out revealing that Nixon may have used his campaign funds illegally. To weather this storm of bad press, Nixon knew he had to exercise vulnerability, which he did to great effect. What followed was his famous “Checkers speech,” in which he appeared on live TV and humbly asked that, if the people believed that he should remain the vice president, then please write letters to the Republican National Committee saying so. Nixon’s display of vulnerability led to an outpouring of public support and saved his political career – Eisenhower kept him on the ticket, and won the election in a landslide victory. We all need a compliment every once in a while. In fact, letting people know you value them goes a long way in relationship building. That said, it won’t help at all if the praise is superficial or insincere. Building strong power relationships requires a balance of truth and love. When the Norwegian speed skater Johann Olav Koss was first coached, it was by a man who was cold, aggressive and extremely critical. This led to a subsequent coach who was eager to shower Koss with praise and positive reinforcement. Eventually, Koss found the right balance between these two coaching styles – the perfect mix of truth and love that would win him four Olympic gold medals. Criticism can be useful in helping someone grow in their work, but before you start dispensing your truthful advice, it’s best to first make sure you understand the context of the work in question. When it comes to giving praise and telling someone how much they mean to you, it’s best to deliver it early. If you sit on it for too long, who knows what could happen in the interim. One of the authors’ greatest influences was his father. Despite the fact that his father had to quit school early and therefore never fully learned to read or write, he was full of wisdom. He taught the author many important parables, such as the importance of keeping an open mind and heart. Sadly though, the author never found the time to tell his dad how much he meant to him before he passed away. He encourages others to not make the same mistake. Aside from the fact that giving praise and telling someone how much you value them is personally satisfying, it’s also wonderful at strengthening bonds. What often happens is a rewarding boomerang effect, as the person receiving the praise will be eager to pass on a compliment to you, thereby making it clear how strong the relationship really is. As you can tell, power relationships are a two-way street, with both people giving and receiving, forming a mutually beneficial relationship that can make each person stronger than they would have been otherwise. The key message in these blinks: Even though it takes time and effort, by engaging in practices such as good conversation and contributing to people’s goals and priorities, you can develop a small network of loyal relationships that will support you throughout your career. When you consciously bring qualities like honesty, praise, enthusiasm, trust and integrity to a relationship, you can expect to receive the same in return. Actionable advice: Create a list of those you want in your network. Instead of seeing someone skyrocket to success and wishing that some of their good fortune would come your way, it’s time to make your own network for future brilliance. This list should contain around a dozen talented people who are still on their way to reaching a peak in their careers. Along with their names, you should list their skills, aspirations and goals, and what you could do to help them. Can you connect them with someone who could help their career? Do you know an upcoming event that you could invite them to? Try to meet with these people at least twice a month to continue growing your power relationship, and discover the personal and professional benefits of these friendships! Got feedback?

As if these roles weren’t tiring and daunting enough, there are countless others that we adopt as life goes on, such as leader or teacher, athlete or entrepreneur. So, how can you stay motivated when performing these myriad roles? Well, that’s exactly what these blinks seek to help you with. Drawing on a range of sources, from athletic research to academic studies, they’ll provide you with practical tips and professional pointers for staying calm and performing at the very top of your abilities. In these blinks, you’ll also learn: that pre-performance anxiety can be dispelled with a spank; why contagion is sometimes positive; and which song is the best motivation booster. The big day has arrived. In a few hours, you’ll be auditioning for Broadway’s next hit musical, singing and dancing for a group of people you’ve never seen before. You’re so nervous you could explode. OK, maybe musical theater isn’t your thing – but you’ve probably experienced pre-performance anxiety at some point, whether before a job interview or while preparing a presentation. Anticipatory anxiousness – more commonly known as the fight-or-flight response – is a physiological reaction to stress. When you feel threatened, your body produces adrenaline, a hormone that causes an increase in your blood pressure, as well as your heart and respiratory rates. Now, this is helpful if you have to run away or engage in a physical confrontation. It’s not so great, however, when there’s no tangible threat of danger. Inconveniently, almost any stress can trigger the fight-or-flight response. For instance, the American musician Carly Simon once suffered such an acute attack of anxiety during a 1981 concert that she had to seek help from the audience. Fans had to get onstage and calm her down by rubbing her arms. But maybe you’re looking for a less hands-on relaxant. Well, one way to alleviate anxiety is to reappraise it. Alison Brooks first perceived the benefits of reappraisal while auditioning for Princeton’s undergrad a cappella group. She noticed that excited singers tended to perform better than nervous ones. Later, while pursuing her doctorate, she conducted a study. Before giving a performance, participants were told to do one of three things: say “I’m so excited,” say “I’m so nervous” or say nothing and try to remain calm. The results proved Brooks’ hypothesis. The participants who announced their excitement, and thus reappraised it, performed better than the others. They managed to alchemize anxiety into excitement. This is effective because returning from an anxious state to a calm state is hard. The two emotions are far apart. Transitioning from anxious to excited, however, doesn’t take much effort. Centering is yet another anxiety-reducing technique. Aikido masters in Japan remain calm yet intent when practicing their martial art. Robert Nideffer, a sports psychologist, devised steps to achieving similar focus. Begin by breathing deeply. While concentrating on your breath, release the tension in your muscles. Then imagine that all your body’s energy is concentrated in your physical center, the point just beneath your belly button. Once it’s all there, release it. This centering technique will bring you calm and renewed focus. There are countless ways to prepare yourself for an upcoming performance. Some people opt for meditation. Others, like the singer Carly Simon, sometimes asked to be spanked, because the physical pain helped her conquer her stage fright. Regardless of how you choose to dispel those pre-performance jitters, however, there’s something you should always be: consistent. Athletes are aware of this – and it pays off. Just consider the findings of a 2010 study conducted by sports psychologist Stewart Cotterill. He took studies of athletes’ pre-performance routines and, in an attempt to gauge the effectiveness of these routines, did a meta-analysis. His findings were illuminating. They showed that when athletes engage in an uncontested activity, such as a putt in golf or a free throw in basketball, a little ritual – think swinging the club twice or bouncing the ball a few times – improved their performance. Furthermore, athletes without rituals can learn one and expect the same results: better performance. Group rituals are even more effective, according to a study by Michael Norton, professor at Harvard Business School. In the study, he split 221 participants into multiple teams, who then competed in a scavenger hunt. Prior to the hunt, some teams learned and performed a ritual; standing in a circle, they stomped and clapped, then put their hands in the middle and yelled: “Let’s Go!” Meanwhile, members of the other teams silently read an article. In the end, the teams who performed the rituals did far better in the hunt. They found locations faster and missed task deadlines half as often as the other teams. And, post-hunt, the members of these teams were more likely to say they liked each other. Belief also has an effect on performance. Just consider the surprising findings of Lancaster University’s Sally Linkenauger. In one study, she found that if golfers believed their clubs had once belonged to renowned Professional Golfers’ Association players, they performed much better. Compared to a control group, they estimated holes to be 9 percent larger and were 32 percent more likely to sink their putts. Linkenauger thinks this is due to “positive contagion,” a term she coined to describe the idea that objects can be imbued with the powers of the people who touch them. It’s also partially why people cherish autographs; the mere signature of a famous person infuses the signed paper with a special intimacy. You’ve probably heard of Thinking, Fast and Slow, the best-selling book by Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman. In the book, Kahneman argues that the human brain has two cognitive systems – one “fast,” the other “slow.” System 1, the fast one, is almost reflexive. It operates with little conscious effort. System 2, in contrast, operates slowly and requires concentration. System 1 is a sort of autopilot. Meanwhile, system 2 has you fully in the driver’s seat. This impacts performance because system 1 can help you stay cool under pressure. Richard Jenkins, who serves as CEO of a start-up, always switches to system 1 cognition when he gives presentations. He does this by opening with the same introduction, which he knows so well that he barely has to think. This intro helps him establish an instant connection with the audience, and, after delivering it, he can seamlessly transition to the topic he’s presenting on, knowing that the audience is engaged and sympathetic. So knowing when, and how, to switch between system 1 and system 2 may affect your performance. But it’s not the only performance-influencing phenomenon out there. Another is priming – that is, planting a subconscious bias in someone without their knowledge. The most famous research in this field is by John Bargh, a psychology professor at Yale. In one of his experiments, he had participants solve word puzzles. Some of these puzzles contained “rude” words, such as “obnoxious” and “impolite.” Others contained “polite” words, like “patiently,” “cordially” and “appreciative.” Afterward, each participant was asked to wait. They would receive further instructions soon. Meanwhile, the person who was to give them these instructions conducted a conversation with a third party, in full view of the participant. The result? Well, the people whose puzzles had featured “rude” words were quicker to interrupt the conversation than those who’d been exposed to “polite” words. In short, each participant had been primed to act in a particular way. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem likely that you can prime yourself. After all, priming takes place subconsciously, and it’s pretty tough, if not entirely impossible, to consciously alter your subconscious processes. So the question remains – what else can you do to perform better? In the classic 1986 sports film Hoosiers, Gene Hackman’s character, coach Norman Dale, delivers a particularly effective pep talk to his basketball team as they play in the semifinals. Coach Dale tells his team of young players to remember the fundamental things that got them here. They should ignore the size of the crowd and the opposing team’s fancy uniforms; they should even ignore the score. All that matters, Dale says, is that they execute, to the best of their ability, the things they’ve been practicing. If they do that, and really try their best, then they’re all winners. You’ll notice that this speech doesn’t focus on outputs, such as winning the game. Rather, it focuses on inputs, or the amount of effort each player contributes. This, according to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, is the sort of pep talk that will put people in a “growth mindset” – a state of mind that enables them to perform well and, over time, even improve. So, when giving a pep talk, do your best to emphasize input, not output. Another tip for good pep talks is knowing when to appeal to the emotions of your audience and when to rely more on facts. Tiffanye Vargas used to play soccer in Texas. During this time, she became interested in pep talks, so it seemed only natural to tackle the topic when she entered graduate school. In research conducted for her PhD, Vargas discovered that there is a time and place for information-heavy pep talks. When a team has never played against a particular opponent, or when it’s suffered a narrow loss to that opponent, concrete information is especially useful. However, if the team is an underdog or about to compete in a championship match, it’s better to stir up the players’ emotions with some fiery language. If you had to name the quintessential motivational song, the one most associated with getting psyched up and ready to rumble, which would you choose? Did “Eye of the Tiger” come to mind? Well, there’s a reason Survivor’s rock single was used as the theme song for Rocky III: It truly does improve people’s performance. Just consider these results from a 1995 study. Researchers took runners who’d clocked identical times on the 60-meter dash and paired them up against one another. However, before racing, one runner from each pair listened to “Eye of the Tiger” while the other stood silently by. One minute of music had significant effects. It hastened the listening runners’ heartbeats, as well as tensed their muscles and lowered their anxiety – physiological effects that gave them a definite advantage and allowed them to beat their opponents. Today, this song is used as an inspirational anthem by countless individuals, from care providers assisting stroke patients to CEOs setting the mood for board meetings. But why are some songs – such as “Eye of the Tiger” – such effective motivators? Well, Costas Karageorghis has one answer. A consultant for massive sporting brands like Nike and the agency IMG, Karageorghis is the world’s preeminent expert on the effects of music on athletic performance. He says that rhythm and musicality (the use of melody and harmony) are the ingredients that make a song motivating. The effects of motivational music are less vague. When listening to inspirational music, an athlete will begin to move in sync with the beat. This synchronicity both energizes and calms the athlete. The music may also reduce the athlete’s perception of exertion, making the workout feel easier than it truly is. What’s the best way to harness the motivational might of music? When working out, try splitting up your regimen into separate periods – one for stretching, one for warming up, and then one for strength training, endurance and cooling down. Karageorghis recommends tailoring your playlist to each period, so that while you're running, for example, there’s a rhythmic beat, and a more relaxing tempo for when you’re cooling down. Do you remember the first time you felt it? Perhaps it was during a game of Monopoly. Or maybe during your first game of tag. Whenever it was, you’ve probably experienced it: the thrill of competition. Even if it was more of a low-level wish to win, you’ve doubtless felt the invigorating determination that competition gives rise to. But is this a good thing? Well, in performative terms, yes it is. Head-to-head competition improves performance. Way back in the 1890s, an Indiana University graduate student named Norman Triplett carried out a few experiments that are as relevant today as they were then. He looked at a series of bicycle races from 1897, in which some 2,000 cyclists had competed, and analyzed the results. There were three types of races: His analysis showed that paced cyclists rode on average 34.4 seconds per mile faster than unpaced cyclists. Also, those competing directly against other cyclists averaged 5 seconds faster yet. Competing against a rival – that is, against someone you know, as opposed to a complete stranger – can be even more motivating. While still a child, Gavin Kilduff, an associate professor of management at New York University, noted that competing against strangers didn’t motivate him as much as competing against a known rival. His research shows that, when playing against rivals, NCAA basketball teams played better defense and blocked more shots. Similarly, long-distance runners tended to run faster when pitted against rivals. But rivalry extends beyond sports. It can provide extra motivation in the business world, too. In 2012, a man named John Legere took over as CEO of T-Mobile. At the time, the company wasn’t doing very well. Of the four big US wireless carriers, it was the tiniest, and a merger with AT&T had recently been blocked by the Federal Trade Commission. Team spirit was not high. But Legere took this slump as an opportunity to engage in some unorthodox tactics. He started publicly bad-mouthing AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile’s main competitors, tweeting about their poor service and generally talking trash about them in order to induce rivalry. And it worked. Since then, T-Mobile’s stock price has more than doubled, as has its number of subscribers. The lesson is that people always tend to root for the underdog. You probably associate performance-enhancing drugs with athletes who’d do anything to get an edge on the competition, even if it means putting their career on the line. However, today there are many ordinary people who take such drugs to deal with more mundane situations. Just consider propranolol, a beta blocker initially intended to treat heart disease. Developed in 1962 by a Scottish pharmacologist named James Black, the drug inhibited the body’s reaction to adrenaline. This, in turn, lowered blood pressure and reduced that likelihood of heart attack. Fast-forward to the 1970s, and it was also being prescribed as cure for performance anxiety. Today, it’s in wide use, and some people, such as Scott Stossel, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, swear by it. Before beginning to use propranolol, Stossel’s anxiety was threatening to derail his career. He could hardly give speeches or get through televised interviews without having a total meltdown. There are side effects, including blurred vision and feelings of constriction in the chest – but, for Stossel, it’s worth it. He’s now able to do things he could barely tolerate before. Performance-enhancing drugs are now also commonly used to improve focus. The two most famous examples are Adderall and Ritalin. But there are others. Modafinil, for instance, is especially popular among Silicon Valley and Wall Street highfliers. Developed in France in 1970, Modafinil was intended to treat narcolepsy, among other sleep disorders. How it works is still a bit unclear, but users feel an enhanced sensation of alertness and wakefulness. This, in turn, helps them enter a state of concentrated flow. Most people are familiar with the potential side effects of Adderall and Ritalin. Addiction, for example, is common and can cause psychosis. Unlike these drugs, Modafinil is less addictive, according to some studies. Nonetheless, the FDA considers its risk of addiction significant enough to classify it as a “schedule IV controlled substance.” Despite these risks, many people do take performance-enhancing drugs, claiming that they help them get more out of life. The key message in these blinks: Whether you’re running a 100-meter sprint or a board meeting, you want to ensure you put in your best performance. Luckily, there are ways to give yourself a competitive edge. By selecting the right music, engaging in rivalries and adopting rituals, you can fend off anxiety and psych yourself up for any occasion.  Actionable advice: Make use of performance contagion. Performance contagion occurs when someone is using an object that he or she believes previously belonged to someone with exceptional skill. When starting a new, daunting project, consider acquiring such an object from someone who has already succeeded in what you aim to do. Using it may well give you an extra performance boost. The author, for example, is a fan of author Malcolm Gladwell and managed to procure a keyboard Gladwell had written on. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Some of us will have even made tentative plans to reach that place. Unfortunately, hardly any of us make it to the Promised Land, and many Americans are stuck either in jobs they hate, or in jobs they simply don’t care about. That’s where these blinks can help. Based on Acuff’s own journey from a series of dead-end jobs to his goal of being an author, they explain how you, too, can make the jump to your dream job happen. Read on and take your first step to the future you really want for yourself. In these blinks you’ll discover why finding your dream job starts by not quitting your current one; why it’s better to work hard in the morning than at night; and why some people never seem to have enough. A survey in the United States in 2011 showed that 84 percent of employees planned to look for a new job that year. That’s a huge number, isn’t it? You might’ve even been one of them! Yet how do you go about finding this dream job? By quitting your old one? Well, no. Don’t quit your day job. If you quit right away without planning what to do next, two things could happen. First, you might replace your old boss with new mini bosses that were previously hidden. That means your electricity bill, your water bill, your health insurance – in short, bills. When they rule your life, there’s not much chance of being your own boss. Second, your personal relationships can be put under pressure. Worrying about money leads to an unhealthy and neurotic mind-set. You might find yourself shouting at your partner for spending too long in the shower and causing the water bill to go up, for instance. There’s a wiser way to find your dream job: keep your day job. Well, at least initially. Why? You run less risk of getting sucked into a opportunity that isn’t actually good enough. You don’t have to feel forced into accepting any old offer just because you have no others. Jon Acuff’s first book contract, for example, was terrible. A publisher offered to buy the book for nothing, keep 100 percent of the profits and then sell copies back to him so he could then sell them via his blog. Luckily, he had work at the time, so he could reject the offer. Imagine if he’d been unemployed and desperate. It probably would’ve been a completely different story. Of course, staying in your day job also helps you maintain a disciplined and healthy lifestyle, whereas being unemployed can lead to procrastination and unhappiness. And we want to avoid a negative state of mind. Some of us have a vague idea of what we’d like to be doing in life, like, “I’m an accountant, but I want to be an artist.” Yet not everyone can see their path with such clarity. Some of us want to pursue a dream without even knowing what it is. So how can we recognize our dreams? Instead of asking the overwhelming question, “What do I want to do with my life?” ask yourself a more manageable question, like, “What have I done in my life so far that I really loved doing?” Dreams don’t suddenly appear to us as surprises. Usually, we realize what they are when we revisit them again after a first encounter. Bono, the anti-poverty campaigner and lead singer of U2, realized his dream this way. He first visited Ethiopia in the 1980s. He struggled to understand the poverty and hunger faced by the people there, and he wanted to try to help. About a decade later, he realized what he could do to make a difference. So in the 1990s, he started working with the likes of Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela to fight against poverty. So if you’ve forgotten what that special something was, look back through your life for what the author calls hinge moments. A hinge moment often initially appears to be insignificant or not obvious. It could be happy or sad. Ultimately, it’s a moment that pushes you in a direction you might not have been expecting to take. When Acuff was a young student, for example, his third grade teacher asked him to write a book. He wrote it even though the other students were doing a different project. His book was then laminated and bound to make it look real. He later identified this as a hinge moment: he realized that writing was something he loved, and could do forever. Naturally, following your dream does involve some hazards. Acuff encountered many risks when pursuing his dream of becoming a writer. He quit his job, moved his family to another state and left his friends behind – a high price if things didn’t work out. Being aware of and coming to terms with these risks is crucial if you want to find your dream job. Luckily, there’s a good way to ensure these risks don’t get the better of you. There are three main ways to view risks, only one of which enables you to overcome them easily. First, you can look at them through a magnifying glass, which blows them out of proportion. This makes them seem huge and impossible to overcome. Alternatively, you can look at them through a kaleidoscope, in which all your fears and worries intersect, and become complex. This also makes them seem massive and overwhelming. The right way to look at them, however, is through a telescope. This is where you see the risks associated with your dreams from a safe distance. They are small and manageable and certainly not too large to put a stop to your dream. One common risk is perfectionism. Don’t become a perfectionist. It’s better to be 90 percent perfect and share your ideas with the world, instead of hanging on and waiting till you’re 100 percent perfect. We saw earlier that you shouldn’t quit your day job if you want to successfully chase your dream job, but you might’ve been thinking, “I hate my job. I can’t keep at it any longer.” If that’s the case, try thinking of how you can get your terrible day job to direct you to your true calling. Your day job can actually give you the time you need to realize your dream. For instance, when Acuff worked as a copywriter for AutoTrader.com, he had time to develop his dream of becoming a writer. His day job allowed him to make mistakes that didn’t cost too much. He could try new things with less risk. If you’re having a tough time remembering what you like about your day job, try looking for parallels between your day job and dream job. You can almost always learn things in your day job that will benefit you when you have your dream job. In Acuff’s case, he learned to write with clarity and precision, which was applicable for his future work as a writer, blogger and speaker. It’s also wise to look for purpose. Ask yourself – how can your dream job impact your day job? This will bring more purpose to your day job, and you’ll probably start to appreciate it more. Acuff’s dream job was to connect with people and have a positive impact on their lives, but he forgot about the people who surrounded him every week at work. When he started reaching out to his colleagues, he could implement a bit of his dream, and bring new purpose to his daily work. Let’s say you make a careful plan for finding your dream job, and you resolve to stick to it no matter what. Will this strategy work? Nope. Don’t let the plan myth paralyze you. Your success in a particular field isn’t dependent on you having everything planned. Making a rigid plan won’t lead you anywhere, unfortunately. Strictly following a plan means that you concentrate on small, insignificant steps instead of seeing the bigger picture. And of course, you can’t possibly plan for everything, can you? A soccer player can plan for some things in training, but can they plan for the ball to come in at an angle? For the defender to jump too early? For a breeze to lift the ball? For the glare from the sun to make the goalie miss it? There will always be unpredictable occurrences in the game. You simply can’t plan for every eventuality. So instead of having a fixed plan, grow through practice. Practicing involves giving yourself small but necessary tasks, such as visiting stores like the one you want to open, or reading blogs like the one you want to start. You’ll gradually research your interest, without too much pressure. When you’re practicing, you haven’t succeeded yet – you’re not a famous writer or a renowned entrepreneur. On a global scale, you’re pretty much invisible, but that anonymity can be great: you can make mistakes without everyone watching! You have the time to develop creatively. Sergey Brin, the founder of Google, said, “We knew that Google was going to get better every single day as we worked on it . . . So we were never in a big hurry to get you to use it today. Tomorrow would be better.” So make the most of your time – don’t rush. You’ll be grateful in the end. Many of us imagine that one day, our dream will somehow fall into our laps. It will appear out of nowhere, like something from Cinderella. Unfortunately, things aren’t this easy in real life. If you want to succeed you need to learn to hustle. “Hustling” is slang for the effort you exert to make something happen. You should concentrate on using it at certain times. It’s better to work hard, or hustle in the morning. This is because the excuses haven’t woken up yet. Few people balance their checkbook, return a call or find something good on TV at 5 a.m. It gives you a natural boost for the day and you feel good about making a positive start by having achieved something. The opposite is true for night owls, however. Night owls face short-timer’s disease. They’re less likely to stay focused during the day. They’re counting down the minutes until they get back to their dream job at night. Hustling also requires you to monitor your progress, without measuring your success against your competitors. Nothing good comes from measuring yourself against others – if you’re beating them, you’ll get cocky and lazy; if they’re beating you, you’ll get discouraged and depressed. However, it is important that you measure yourself. Would you start a diet without measuring your body fat beforehand? In the same way, you need to have a gauge to see how your dream is developing. Just be sure not to let those numbers control your dream. For instance, Acuff was fascinated by Google Analytics, which tracks activity on a website. He became so engrossed in it that he started defining his self-worth by the number of people who read his blog. Not good. We all want to be successful, right? But should we chase success above all else? Success can actually be dangerous, if we aren’t prepared for it. If you suddenly become famous, you’ll find your life changing. You’ll get more attention. People will start telling you whatever you want to hear, to get on your good side. This might make you arrogant, and less aware of your mistakes. The 2008 financial crisis was a dramatic example of this phenomenon. Author Malcolm Gladwell blamed the crisis on overconfident leaders, who believed that they could control the economy and ignore any risks. Their arrogance resulted in a major error. To ensure that you don’t let your success affect you like this, keep a realistic vision of success. We often tell ourselves we’ll finally be successful when we’ve got “enough.” But what exactly is “enough”? A football player, for example, might say it’ll be enough when he wins the championship. But then he’ll spend the next year expecting to be rewarded for being a star player – his “enough” will never be “enough.” It’s much better if we’re more realistic. Instead of never having “enough,” define how much “enough” means to you, and concentrate on achieving it. Acuff uses a service that allows him to email himself in the future. He tells himself what “enough” is. In one email, for example, he defined “enough” as having a wonderful family and a good job. When the email reached him a year later, he was going through a period of intense success. His previous definition of enough helped him realize that he didn’t actually need anything more. Chasing his dream would’ve only hurt him. So remember to have a realistic perspective on whatever you want to do. Define what “enough” is for you, so you won’t lose sight of your goal. Once the practice and planning is over, it’s finally time to quit your day job. Your dream job should comfortably fill your empty schedule. But before you drop everything, make sure you’ve got a few things in order! First, give your dream a test run so you can fully know that your plan will work out. Acuff, for instance, didn’t start working for Dave Ramsey, author and broadcaster, until June 2010, even though he offered Acuff a job in 2008. Right workplace, wrong job. Next, make sure you have a strong support network. This is crucial in achieving your dream. When Acuff moved to Nashville for his new job he had a supportive family, which made it easier for him to make the decision. He drew security from his support network – his wife, his brother and the fans following his blog. It also doesn’t hurt to make a list of any potential risks. You won’t be able to think of all of them, but at least you’ll be prepared for certain possibilities, such as how your new job might affect your family. Also, think of some guidelines to put in place for your new life. This will help you make a smoother transition from your old life to the new one. For example, when Acuff began his new job with Ramsey, he agreed to speak at all of his events. However, he’d already pre-planned some events before starting the job, so he ended up being away for seven weekends in a row, which upset his wife. If he’d thought of some guidelines to put in place, such as no back-to-back speaking events, he may have avoided the stress he put on the family. Avoiding negativity is crucial. There are three main ways in which you could prevent yourself from closing the gap between your day job and your dream job. Let’s examine them. Many people view their lives as somehow removed from their jobs. They see a clean distinction between work and personal life. But this isn’t always so easy to achieve. Why? Because in certain ways, your work defines who you are. Imagine an accountant who says, “I’m not really an accountant.” What they really want to say is, “My current job doesn’t define who I am.” If they had a job they identified with, they’d be more than happy to say, “I am a novelist.” Have you ever noticed how musicians often begin sentences with, “As a musician...”? This is because they are happy identifying themselves as musicians. Music is their passion. They are following their dream. People often think of their day jobs as just something to fund the rest of their lives. But that diminishes their value. Your job probably also provides social interaction, opportunities to help others, a sense of accomplishment, and the chance to practice working toward your dream. So don’t just fund your life – get out there and live it! Lots of people assume that their work will never be fulfilling, but life doesn’t have to be like this. Of course it won’t always be fun, but work is really a good way to bring change to the world, or at least your own world. While working his day job during the recession, Acuff partnered with readers of his blog to raise $60,000 in 25 days. Two kindergartens in Vietnam were built with the money. Remember, a day job doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t accomplish fulfilling things. The key message in this book: Your dream job isn’t going to fall into your lap. You need to plan it before it can take shape. So don’t quit your day job immediately – use it to help you transition into making your dream come true. Write your own definition of success, and make a flexible plan. With dedication, preparation and positivity you’ll be able to close the gap between your day job and dream job.  Actionable advice: Hustle in the morning.  Most people will experience a boost for the rest of the day if they do something active and productive in the morning. So push yourself to get up early, and complete some small tasks. You’ll feel more energized for the rest of the day, and be more productive over all.

Many successful people, such as Tiger Woods, start to focus on one path early in life. But delve a little deeper, and it becomes clear that it’s generalists, not specialists, who are primed to excel. Generalists may take a little longer to find their path in life, but they are more creative, can make connections between diverse fields that specialists cannot. This makes them more innovative and, ultimately, more impactful. Drawing on examples from medicine to academia to sport, these blinks explore how breadth and range are far more powerful than specialized expertise. They also show that experts often judge their own fields more narrowly than open-minded, intellectually curious amateurs do. In these blinks, you’ll learn what comic books have to tell us about the ingredients of success; how the complexity of modern life has changed the way we think; and why you should be a Roger, not a Tiger. At the age of ten months old, Tiger Woods picked up his first miniature golf club. At two, he showed off his golf drive on national television. Later that same year, he entered and won his first tournament in the under ten category. Tiger Woods embodies a now popular idea that the key to success in life is to specialize, get a head start and practice intensively. This trend toward specialization doesn’t only show up in the sports world. In fact, it’s also true of academia, our complex financial system and medicine. Oncologists, for example, now rarely focus on cancer alone. Rather, they specialize in cancer of a particular organ. The writer and surgeon Atul Gawande notes that when doctors joke about right-ear surgeons, we shouldn’t be so quick to assume they don’t actually exist. But is specializing really the way to go? Simply put, no. In many walks of life, building up experience in just one field doesn’t help performance. In a 2009 paper, psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein explored the connection between experience and performance. Klein shows that experience counts in certain fields. For firefighters, for example, years of focused experience trains them to recognize patterns in the behavior of flames, which enables them to make 80 percent of their on-the-job decisions instinctively in seconds. But Kahneman found that in other areas, experience counted for nothing. Studying the assessment of officer candidates in the Israeli Defence Forces, he found that recruiters’ predictions of a recruit’s future performance, based on physical and mental abilities, were no more reliable than guesswork. Crucially, as the recruiters received more and more feedback after multiple recruitment rounds, they didn’t get any better at making predictions. Kahneman concluded that there was a complete disconnect between experience and performance. Some fields of life resemble golf or firefighting. While not necessarily easy, they offer recurring patterns or simple rules that govern decision-making. But there are many more fields of life, like army recruitment, that are much more nebulous and require the creativity and flexibility that generalization offers. Let’s find out how this works. In 2006, a now 31-year-old Tiger Woods watched Roger Federer win the US Open final for the third year in a row. Both were at the peak of their powers. As they sipped champagne together in the locker room afterward, Federer felt he had never connected with someone who understood his feeling of invincibility so well. They became firm friends. But, as Roger later told a biographer, his story was very different from Tiger’s. Roger’s mom was a tennis coach, but if she ever felt tempted to coach him, she resisted it. As a young boy, he dabbled in squash, skiing, wrestling, skateboarding, basketball, tennis and badminton. Later, he gave credit to this range of sports experience for helping his hand-eye coordination and athleticism. Over time, he found that he liked sports with balls. He moved toward tennis as a teenager, but not intensively. In fact, when his instructors recognized his talent and tried to move him to a group of older players, he asked to stay in the group with his friends. Roger Federer’s winding path to tennis success points to the fact that sampling, rather than specialization, can often be the best route to eventual success.   And plenty of evidence across multiple disciplines supports this. This is true even in an area like music, where plenty of outstanding musicians do specialize young. World-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma, for instance, started playing music at a very young age. But what many people don’t know is that Ma first tried violin and piano, and only moved to the cello because he didn’t like the first two. Yo-Yo Ma isn’t alone in this. In a study of students at a British boarding school, music psychologist John Sloboda found that every one of the students who attended structured music lessons early in their development was categorized by the school as “average,” while not one was “exceptional.” In contrast, those children identified as exceptional were those who had tried out three instruments. So, if you haven’t yet found your calling, experiment. You could take Vincent van Gogh as inspiration. He tried everything from working in bookstores to teaching and art dealing to preaching before finding his calling as an artist who changed painting forever. In 1981, James Flynn, a professor of political studies from the beautiful hilly town of Dunedin in New Zealand, changed the way we think about thinking. Flynn stumbled upon reports of IQ test scores of American troops that showed dramatic improvement between the two World Wars. The same score that placed a World War I soldier in the 50th percentile would only land him in the 22nd percentile of World War II troops. Intrigued, Flynn asked researchers in other countries for data. He received IQ test results from the Netherlands that showed similarly huge leaps from generation to generation. He then compiled data from 14 other nations. In what’s now known as the Flynn effect, this research reveals an average three-point increase in IQ every decade in over 30 countries. But what causes this rapid rise? The work of a Russian psychologist, Alexander Luria, gives us an idea. In 1931, the Soviet Union was changing rapidly. Remote, essentially premodern villages operating in ways unchanged for centuries were converted to collective farms with industrialized development, planned production and division of labor. Luria capitalized on this rate of change to conduct unique studies. In one experiment, he asked villagers to sort wools into groups. In more modern villages, people would happily group similar pieces of wool, like those in different shades of blue. But in the remote, still premodern villages, participants simply refused to do so. According to them, each piece of wool was different – it was an impossible task! Other questions involving conceptual thinking got a similar response. One villager, named Rakmat, was shown a picture of three adults and one child and asked which person did not belong. But Rakmat didn’t think about the question abstractly, as we would, and identify the child as different. Instead, he insisted that the boy must stay with the adults and help them with their work. Luria’s findings were clear. The more exposure to modernization, the greater the ability to make conceptual connections between objects or abstract notions. Today, our minds are constantly dealing with abstract concepts. We glance at a download progress bar on our computer, for example, and instantly understand its meaning. Our minds are better at understanding a breadth of topics and making connections between ideas than ever before. And yet, we continue to narrow our conceptual focus. The teachers you liked the most in your educational career might be the ones who taught you the least. A study of teaching at the US Air Force Academy tracked the progress of thousands of students working with hundreds of different professors, starting with Calculus I classes. It found that the professors whose students’ got better grades on the exam were also highly rated in student evaluations. The professors whose students did not receive good grades received harsher student feedback. But when the economists conducting the study looked at long-term results, there was a twist. The professors who received positive feedback had a net negative effect on their students in the long run. In contrast, those professors who received worse feedback actually inspired better student performance later on. Rather than teaching to the test, these professors appeared to be facilitating a deeper understanding of underlying math concepts. It made their classes frustrating and difficult, hence the poor grades and student evaluations. But it paid off in the long run. Those professors were using desirable difficulties – harder, but ultimately more rewarding, ways to learn. There are certain techniques we can all use that embrace desirable difficulties. One such technique is spacing, which means leaving time between learning something and practicing it. Consider a 1987 study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology. This study separated Spanish students into two groups, testing one group on vocabulary that they had learned the same day, and the other group weeks later. Eight years later, and with no further study in the interim, the two groups were tested again. The results showed that the latter group could remember over 200 percent more words. Even short-term spacing is effective. In a 1972 study, researchers at Iowa State University read people a series of words. The first group of participants was asked to recite the words straight away. Another group was asked to recite them after being distracted for fifteen seconds by some simple math problems. The first group did considerably better than the group that was distracted. But later the same day, the participants were asked to write down each word they could recall. This time, the group that previously performed worse did the best. The process of working hard to recall the information in the first instance had helped them move it from short-term to long-term memory. So, don’t get too excited by quick progress when you learn. Embrace hard, slow learning. It will pay off in the long run. In some environments, dealing with specialists is desirable. If you need an operation, you probably want a doctor who specializes in the procedure and has done it many times before. However, as we benefit from more reflection and thinking, this narrow focus can be unhelpful. For example, cardiologists use stents – metal tubes that hold blood vessels open – to treat chest pain so often that they often do so reflexively, even in situations that may be dangerous or inappropriate. This explains a 2015 study by Dr. Anupam Jena of Harvard Medical School. The study found that patients with cardiac arrest or heart failure were actually less likely to die if they were admitted to hospital while top cardiologists were away. Other fields also point to the benefits of looking at problems with an outside view, rather than the inside view dictated by your own particular specialty. In a study by University of Sydney professor Dan Lovallo, private equity investors were asked to provide a detailed assessment of businesses they were considering investing in, including their estimated return on investment. The investors were then asked to write notes about some other projects with broad similarities, like another tech start-up or an infrastructure project. It turned out that the investors’ estimates of returns for the businesses they were actually planning to invest in were around 50 percent higher than for those alternative projects they had identified but not looked at in detail. The investors were shocked to discover the differences, and quickly slashed their estimated profit for their original potential investments. As further psychological research has repeatedly shown, the more details we consider about something, the more extreme our judgments become. In one example, students rated a university higher when told that only certain science departments, rather than all science departments, were ranked in the national top ten. Clearly, failing to see things from a broad perspective can lead to some bad calls. Comic books can tell us a surprising amount about range and success. When Dartmouth business professor Alva Taylor and Henrik Greve from the Norwegian School of Management decided to examine the impact of individual breadth on creative impact, they chose to study comics. Tracking the careers of comic creators and the commercial success of thousands of comic books from 1971 onward, they made some predictions about what would boost the average value of a comic. They predicted that the more comics a creator made, the better the comics would be. Further, they thought that the more resources a publisher had, the higher quality and more successful its product would be. All these assumptions were wrong. Neither experience nor financial resources bred success. What did drive success was the breadth of a comic creator’s experience across comic genres. Of 22 genres, the more a creator had worked in, from comedy to crime, fantasy to non-fiction, the more successful they were. But this link between breadth and success isn’t just the case in creative or artistic worlds. Andy Ouderkirk, an inventor at the multinational company 3M, was named Innovator of the Year in 2013 and has been named on 170 patents, a proxy for creative success. He became fascinated with what generates successful and inventive teams, so he started to do some research. He found that the inventors who were most likely to succeed within 3M and win the company’s Carlton Award, which recognized innovation, were not specialists. They were polymaths, people with one area of depth, but a great deal of expertise in other areas as well. These polymaths tended to have many patents in their area of focus, but also repeatedly took expertise gathered in one area and applied it to another. A study of prestigious scientists led by Robert Root Bernstein, a Professor of Psychology at Michigan State University, confirm Ouderkirk’s findings. Comparing Nobel prize-winning scientists to other scientists, the figures show that Nobel laureates are a full 22 times more likely to be an amateur actor, magician, dancer or performer. So, for any hiring managers out there looking for fresh talent, here’s a plea. Don’t just look for people who fit into your clearly-defined slots. Make some space for those who don’t fit so clearly into any one category. Their breadth of experience might be invaluable. During 20 years of the Cold War, world-renowned forecasting expert Philip Tetlock collected and assessed the predictions of 284 experts. He concluded that experts are absolutely terrible at making predictions about anything. Tetlock found that an expert’s years of experience, academic degree and even ability to access classified information made no difference. When experts said that some potential event was impossible, it happened in 15 percent of cases. Events declared to be an absolute sure thing failed to occur 25 percent of the time. And worryingly for anyone who listens to cable news, Tetlock found that there was a perverse and inverse relationship between fame and accuracy. The more an expert appeared in the news, the more likely they were to be wrong, or as Tetlock famously put it, “roughly as accurate as a dart-throwing chimpanzee.” One of the problems was that many of the experts’ focus was too narrow. Having spent entire careers studying a single issue – say, US-Soviet relations – they tended to have explicit theories about how it worked. So, what makes a better forecaster of future events? Well, researchers like psychologist Jonathan Baron point to active open-mindedness – a willingness to question your own beliefs. Most of us fail at this, and can’t override our strong instinct to cherry-pick evidence that confirms our existing beliefs. Consider a study run by Yale professor Dan Kahan. Pro and anti-Brexit voters were first tasked with interpreting a set of statistics about the effectiveness of a skin cream. Most participants completed the task successfully. But when presented with the same numbers framed as the link between crime and immigration, many of the participants misinterpreted the statistics according to their political beliefs. The same study has yielded similar results in the US on the topic of gun control. So, how exactly can we combat our tendency to stick to our existing beliefs, despite the evidence? Kahan argues that one personality feature is important if we want to stay open-minded and think clearly about the world around us. Instead of scientific knowledge – how much you know – emphasize scientific curiosity – a desire to learn more, willingness to look at new evidence and ability to think with a genuinely open mind. Now, let’s consider how we can embrace this kind of curiosity. See if you can answer this question correctly. Disease X has a prevalence of one in 1,000 people. The test for the disease has a false positive rate of five percent. What is the chance that someone receiving a positive test result has the disease? If your answer was two percent, or 1.96 to be precise, you got it right. And in doing so, you did better than the 75 percent of physicians and students at Harvard and Boston University who got it wrong. Their most frequent answer was 95 percent. The problem is straightforward if you know how to think about it. In a sample of 10,000 people, ten will have the disease and get a true positive. Five percent, or 500 people, will get a false positive. So out of the 510 people with a positive result, only 10, or 1.96% are ill. Sadly, many students aren’t taught to think openly about such problems. And this, according to Arturo Casadevall –  a star in the world of microbiology and immunology – has to change. In a new role at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Casadevall is developing programs focused on an interdisciplinary understanding of topics such as philosophy, ethics, statistics and logic. One course, called “How do we Know What is True,” examines different types of evidence in various academic disciplines. “Anatomy of Scientific Error” encourages students to hunt for signs of misconduct or poor methodology in scientific research. Casadevall hopes that, with a more rigorous grounding in reasoning and multidisciplinary thinking, students will be better prepared to make a real impact on our economy and society. Of course, not all of us hold senior academic positions like Casadevall. What can we do to expand our range? Well, one thing is to embrace failure. Dean Keith Simonton, a creativity researcher, has shown that the more work creators produce, the more failures they produce, but they are also more likely to produce a superstar success. Thomas Edison, for instance, held over 1,000 patents, many of which were ultimately failures. But his successes, like the light bulb, were revolutionary. Treading a wide-roaming, disorderly path of experimentation may not always bring instant results. But it may just be the best route to greatness in the end. The key message in these blinks: Embracing range, experimentation and breadth of experience is often a better road to success than specialization. Range demands patience, open-mindedness and scientific curiosity. If we can foster and exemplify these, the chances that we will generate major innovations and contribute significantly to our economy and society increase. Got feedback?

If you’re a sports fan and you’ve enjoyed learning about the psychology behind human performance in these blinks, why not take a look at The Sports Gene. These blinks to the first book by David Epstein dive into the nature versus nurture debate and take a fascinating look at the physiological traits most helpful in various sports. Exploring the hereditary nature of some sports success, these blinks also consider why people in certain parts of the world have evolved in a particular way, and why that can be beneficial in sports like long-distance running. In this way, they ask us to reconsider the essence of athleticism.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Whether we’re dealing with technology, work or even politics, the ground seems constantly to be shifting beneath our feet. As a result, we face new challenges on a daily basis, and we have to continuously adapt if we want to be successful. Of course, this is easier said than done. How do you do it? The secret lies in implementing the strategies that will enable you to perpetually reinvent yourself. By doing this, you can put yourself in a position to conquer the challenges of modern life. As the proverb goes, if the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. The world isn’t going to adapt to you – so it’s time for you to start adapting to it. In these blinks, you will learn what Pope Francis and Eminem can teach us about the best ways to deal with suffering; how being broke can be a blessing in disguise; and how to wake up every morning with a sense of excitement for the day ahead. Once upon a time, the road to success was straightforward: you earned a degree, landed a stable job and saved up for a comfortable retirement. This road has become a thing of the past, and yet many people are still trying to follow it – saddling themselves with debt from student loans, credit cards and mortgages along the way. The old road is no longer viable because in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing world there simply isn’t a linear, fixed and preestablished route to success; you need to blaze your own path. One of the keys to doing so is to avoid letting your degree or job title define you. Consider a company that exemplifies reinvention: Google. Catching up with a friend who works at Google, the author asked, “What are the latest projects your company is working on?” The author expected them to be search-related. But, actually, they were totally different: building an automated car, developing a bracelet to cure cancer and connecting remote areas to Wi-Fi through stratospheric balloons. In other words, Google doesn’t let its “job” (providing a search engine) define it. Google’s cofounder Larry Page doesn’t let his degree define him, either. He majored in computer science, but his job today isn’t about tinkering with software; it’s about solving major societal problems.    Of course, breaking free of the confines of your degree or job title is easier said than done. Fortunately, just because you have to blaze your own path doesn’t mean you have to go it alone; mentors can provide guidance. Here are some steps to finding them. First, do some research on a person you respect and want to learn from. Read her bio. Check out articles she’s written or interviews she’s given. Next, contact her with ideas that might help her. For example, when the author was seeking mentorship from someone who had written an academic article, he didn’t just read the article; he sent feedback, thus providing value as a mentee. As you continue on your journey, provide your mentor with progress updates every three months. That way, she can see her influence on you in action and feel appreciated. Finally, don’t just seize opportunities to meet up with your mentor; create those opportunities. It might even be worth going so far as to fly to another country and send her a message saying you’re available to discuss an idea further! Some of history’s most creative people have also been the most prolific. Pablo Picasso created 50,000 works of art, which averages at two per day. Jimi Hendrix recorded enough music to fill nearly 70 albums, despite living only 27 years. Now, you don’t need to churn out work every minute to be creative – but high production can help you sharpen your talents. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. The writer Barbara Cortland provides an inspirational example of how much you can accomplish if you put in enough work. In 1983, she set the world record for writing the most novels in a single year: an astounding 23. Her passion was writing about romance, and she pursued it every day. Thanks to her dedication, she published 723 novels and sold 600 million copies of them. The rapper Coolio provides another example. As a child, he set his heart on becoming a famous rapper. To that end, he wrote lyrics on a daily basis, beginning at the age of 14. For the next 17 years, he continued to practice and refine his craft. Finally, in 1994, his perseverance paid off with his first big hit, “Fantastic Voyage.” The next year, his perseverance paid off even more with “Gangsta’s Paradise,” which, at the time, became the number-one song in the world. In theory, you could follow Coolio’s lead by taking any skill and practicing it until you achieve your breakthrough. But how do you decide which one to practice? How can you tell which one lies in the direction of your calling? One way is to recall your childhood and ask yourself: What did I love doing or dream of doing back then? Which activity made me lose my sense of time while doing it or imagining doing it? There lies your calling. It might not seem practicable – but even if it was childish, it can still give you a starting point from which to set out.    Chip Conley, the head of hospitality at Airbnb, for instance, was led into his career in the hospitality industry by recollecting the hours he would spend imagining he was running a restaurant as a child. And a friend of Chip’s went from being a dissatisfied lawyer to a world-renowned pastry chef by remembering the pastime of her six-year-old self: making mud pies! Imagine if every morning, you woke up feeling so motivated and excited about the day ahead that you practically bolted out of bed. Does this sound like a dream compared to your present reality? If so, it’s a sign that you need to identify the goals and activities that will fill you with a burning desire to start your day and pursue your passions. Once kindled, this desire will give you the drive to overcome the obstacles in your path – a power that’s exemplified by the story of Wayne Dyer. To say the odds were stacked against him would be an understatement; he was an orphan who spent his childhood bouncing between foster homes. Nonetheless, he was able to earn a PhD in educational counseling and become a professor. He then wrote his first book, Your Erroneous Zones, which eventually sold a whopping 35 million copies. But his journey from orphanhood to best-selling author wasn’t a smooth one. At first, his book sold only 5,000 copies, which he considered a failure. However, rather than give up, he decided to buy all of the unsold books from his publisher and go on a cross-country adventure, visiting bookstores in person to convince them to sell his book. To market his book, he also tried to appear on national television – only to be rejected by the producers of every show he approached. But once again, he refused to give up; instead, he drove from station to station and promoted his book face-to-face. Thanks to his tenacity, he was able to take his initial sales numbers and multiply them by 7,000! Empowered by a burning desire like Wayne Dyer’s, you’ll be able not only to overcome your obstacles, but also to conquer your fear of failure. To see the importance of doing so, consider the Rolling Stones. Two of its founding members, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, were childhood friends who were brought back together by the passion they shared for music, which led them to form the band. The rest is history, right? Well, not quite. At first, music critics panned their songs. Reviewers derided Mick Jagger’s voice, which they said was “fuzzy and undisciplined . . . complete chaos.” But the band didn’t give up. Instead, they welcomed every gig that came their way, performing 200 concerts per year, despite earning little money from them and attracting audiences as small as four people. It was their zeal for music that enabled them to overcome their fear of failure and to become one of the most successful bands of all time. Imagine a world without borders – one where trade flows freely between nations, innovation flourishes in its wake and people extend their generosity to everyone, overcoming their ethnic, racial and social divisions. Wouldn’t this be an ideal world to live in? Well, it may take many years for this vision of the world to be realized, but we can still live by the values that animate it in the here and now by continually striving to benefit others. One person who embodies such a spirit of generosity is Pope Francis. Here is just one example. A young woman became pregnant, and her husband pressured her to have an abortion. Wanting to keep the baby, she divorced him. Afterward, she sank into depression. Desperate, she sent a letter to the pope. A few weeks later, her phone rang – and, to her surprise, it was Pope Francis himself! He comforted her over the phone, and later he even baptized the baby himself. If you think about it, such an act of kindness is remarkable. After all, the pope leads an enormous, nearly 2,000-year-old institution. Nonetheless, he frequently takes time to call the ordinary people who write to him, just to bring some happiness into their lives. Such acts of kindness earn the pope plenty of adulation – but rather than basking in it, he actively discourages us from viewing him as some sort of moral Superman. Instead, he reminds us that he is a human being who laughs and cries just like us. Why is that truth important? Because the flip side is that we are just as capable of kindness as he is. Now, it’s clear that we should try to alleviate other people’s pain – but what should we do about our own pain? One answer is to channel it into our passions. Someone who did that to great effect was the rapper Eminem. Growing up in a poor family in a trailer park, he suffered many tribulations, which continued into his young adulthood with a slew of familial betrayals and bad jobs. However, rather than stewing in his troubles, he used them as grist for his creative mill – transforming them into material for the rap lyrics that would eventually propel him from underground rap battles in Detroit to worldwide superstardom, with 220 million record sales under his belt. Imagine you’ve sparked your burning desire and identified the talent that represents your calling. Mission accomplished, right? Well, not quite. You’ve ignited your inner fire, but now you need to keep fueling it. One way of doing so is to keep practicing. Now, habitual practice takes great willpower. That’s why determination is the key to success; without it, your talent will peter out before it’s taken you far. Consider Serena Williams. She’s extremely talented at tennis, but she didn’t acquire her talents overnight. It took her years of hard work to develop them. When she was only three years old, she started a daily training regimen with her father. By the time she turned ten, she’d achieved her first success: playing in the junior circuit. But she didn’t stop there. She kept practicing and competing – and after devoting 30 years of her life to tennis, she had the goods to show for it: 23 Grand Slam titles to date, more than any other player in the world. On the opposite end of the physicality spectrum, consider the author Charles Bukowski. When he was young, he managed to get only two stories published. Then, he stopped writing for a decade. No determination, no success. But then he returned to writing with a newfound sense of resolve. For 15 years, he wrote stories and poems every single day, and he submitted thousands of them to every publication possible, enabling him to live off his writing. With his first novel, Post Office, he finally attained success. He was 49 years old. Besides challenges, there’s another form of kindling that can feed your inner fire: being broke. While this might seem like the opposite of success, it can also help you to achieve it. Consider the story of Daymond John. When he was young, his mother taught him how to sew wool hats. After sewing 80 of them, he sold them for $10 each, bringing in a total of $800 – a significant sum for them at the time, since they were strapped for cash. His fire was sparked, and he started fueling it right away. Eventually, he started the clothing brand FUBU. Within a few years, the company achieved $350 million in sales. Ten years later, it was worth $6 billion. Dedication brought him to that achievement – but being broke gave him the drive to start down his path to success. Every business has a set of values, and those values are embodied in its goals, which could range from boosting customers’ confidence to providing them with healthy, delicious food. Like a business, your values are what guide you on your journey toward success. Also like a business, if you lose sight of them, you run the risk of losing your way. That’s what often befalls family-run businesses; they go under by the third generation. Why? Well, they begin with a set of guiding values – providing upward mobility to their employees, perhaps, or ensuring customer satisfaction. The founder tries to pass those values down to her successors, but with each new generation, they get weaker and weaker. How can this be avoided? Dick Yuengling provides one answer. His family-run brewing company, D.G. Yuengling & Son, is still going strong, despite having reached its fifth generation of ownership. What’s his secret? Well, he set up his company in a novel way: instead of simply inheriting it, each new generation must purchase it from the previous one. Having to literally invest themselves in the company, the new owners are naturally led to reevaluate its values as they figure out how they want to run it. By keeping sight of your values, you too can keep your eye on the prize: your goals. But that’s not enough. To truly make progress, you also have to ensure you‘re making decisions that help you grow. Every time you make a decision in your career or business, you should ask yourself, “Was my decision fear-based or growth-oriented?” Many decisions are made out of fear. The author himself once took a job simply because he feared going broke, even though he didn’t feel any passion for the position itself. When you make a fear-based decision, it generally points toward an underlying insecurity. For example, you might stay in a job you hate because you’re afraid you won’t find another one. It’s natural to make such fear-based decisions, but it’s also inadvisable. In the author’s experience, they always lead to regret. But it’s never too late to reverse course. After just three days into the job he took out of fear, the author simply got up and walked off into the proverbial sunset. As he left, he felt a profound sense of empowerment and freedom. That’s not to say everything was easy for him from there on out. Moving forward, he often had money troubles. But his growth-oriented decision to quit his job enabled him to begin his journey toward becoming the successful author he is today. The key message in these blinks: In today’s fast-paced world, the only constant is change. Companies go bankrupt, technologies become obsolete and governments change their policies. To succeed in such a world, we must master the art of reinventing ourselves in order to navigate our way through the ever-shifting seas of the modern world and reach the shores of success.  Actionable advice: Every day, write down ten ideas on new ways you could pursue your passions.    If you get into the daily habit of writing down ten ideas per day, you’ll generate 3,650 ideas in a single year. Whether it’s about the business you want to start, the novel you want to write or the public-speaking skills you want to develop, each of these ideas will represent one possible path you could take toward achieving your goals and living out your passions. Out of all those ideas, at least one or two of them are bound to take you closer to where you want to be! Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But perhaps the struggles and obstacles Pao had to endure leading up to the trial are less well known. What was it like working at Kleiner? What were the challenges faced by Pao and other women working at the firm? And how did she come to pursue a lawsuit against one of the most powerful venture capital firms in the world? These blinks will give you an insight into the events leading up to and surrounding the case, as well as how Pao dealt with the blow of losing to Kleiner. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how deeply the “boys club” culture permeates the workplace; which highly popular social media site Pao was the former CEO of; and about an office romance that went astray. Ellen Pao grew up believing that a good education would inevitably lead to success, and so when she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1994, she saw endless career opportunities laid out in front of her. When she began working at the well-known New York City law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore as a corporate lawyer, however, she quickly realized things weren’t going to go quite how she’d expected. One of the things Pao noticed was that sexual discrimination had become so deeply rooted in the workplace that it often happened without anyone noticing it, sometimes not even the person on the receiving end. A coworker who was black and female was constantly mistaken for an administrative assistant or a paralegal, despite being dressed in suits donned only by attorneys. Furthermore, even though as a lawyer she had the authority to use company cars, Pao’s coworker faced difficulties in doing so. At the time, Pao’s coworker didn’t think too much about it, and thus never reported what happened. Ultimately, however, she was so distressed by these experiences that she ended up leaving the profession entirely. The case of Pao’s coworker serves as a reminder of how it’s nearly impossible to ascend the corporate ladder if you’re not one of “the boys,” despite your hardest efforts. Pao relates a time when the head of her department invited 12 male coworkers to dinner, following it up with a visit to a strip club. Pao pointed out that going to the strip club allowed the male coworkers an opportunity to get to know their boss on a more personal level, which is a massive advantage. These men-only events happened all the time. Pao managed to get a ticket to a hockey game once, but she was only allowed to come if she didn’t sit beside the senior partner. Such behaviors excluded women from important conversations and opportunities, and as a result, they had to double their efforts just to keep pace with their male counterparts. Pao finished her two-year MBA at Harvard Business School and in 2005 joined the influential venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as chief of staff. Venture capital firms receive financial support from wealthy individuals, universities, families and pension funds, which they invest into startups, hoping for a return on investment. The venture capital industry is dominated by men, being a real “boys club”, and is predominantly white. On a business trip to New York, Pao shared a table with four white male colleagues, one of whom was a tech CEO and investor named Ted. The tech CEO expressed his desire to have a woman join his board, which consisted of only men, and Pao suggested that he invite one of Google’s founding partners, Marissa Mayer. Upon Pao’s suggestion, Ted said Mayer would be “too controversial,” while the rest of the men remarked that they would like her to join because she was hot. The men at the table then continued to openly discuss the type of sex worker they liked and bragged about meeting Jenna Jameson, a porn star, leaving Pao cringeing and uncomfortable. She was aware that the male colleagues didn’t like her being there. This feeling of exclusion was confirmed when they landed at Teterboro Airport, and the men organized a night out without extending an invitation to Pao. As a result, Pao missed out on the exchange of advice and information that occurs during these men-only events. A sad reality of the business world is that men are praised for having ambition and being forward-thinking; however, when women show those qualities, they’re often ignored. During the early days of Twitter, Pao saw promise and potential in the platform’s ability to connect people all over the world, and so she decided to get in touch with their CEO, Jack Dorsey. She then pitched Twitter to a partner at Kleiner, but he showed no interest and dismissed her proposal. Almost four years later, Kleiner would finally invest in Twitter, upon the suggestion of a male junior partner, of course. By that point, Twitter’s value had gone up by 400 percent, but the male partner was celebrated as a genius nonetheless, while Pao’s foresight was completely disregarded. Though she was aware of the inequality rampant in the world of venture capital, Pao decided to stay at Kleiner because she enjoyed the work. But even following her promotion to junior partner in 2007, her male coworkers still didn’t take her seriously nor did they listen to her opinions. One incident that comes to mind is the pitch of an Indian classifieds website to their fund’s investors. During preparation for the pitch, a colleague of Pao’s suggested that she “search for turbans!” When she refused to do so, her colleagues branded her a “killjoy.” Furthermore, when Pao brought this incident up with her managing partner, he simply told her she was overreacting and making a big fuss about nothing. The managing partner repeated the same distasteful joke at a fundraising meeting and had to apologize immediately when he saw that one of the investors was an Indian woman. This insensitive behavior toward women in the workplace is perpetuated by the “boys club” dogma of protecting its own members. While on a business trip, Pao’s coworker Ajit Nazre told her that he believed they would make a good couple, even though he was a married man at the time. After he told Pao that he’d separated from his wife, the two began dating. He would give her the inside scoop on who had left the company and share Kleiner’s various philosophies and beliefs on investment. During this time, Pao felt like she’d finally been accepted and seen as an equal at the firm. However, it turned out that Nazre had lied to Pao about divorcing his wife, and so when Pao learned the truth, she stopped seeing him romantically. The problem was that she still had to face him at work. It became evident that since the break up, Nazre was intentionally misleading Pao and excluding her from important email threads and meetings. Pao alerted her managing partner, Ray Lane, to Nazre’s misconduct, but her concerns fell on deaf ears. Lane had gotten to know Nazre from the male-only dinners and events, and they bonded over conversations about women. Due to Lane’s fondness for Nazre, the managing partner defended him in the face of Pao’s complaints. Having been promoted to senior partner, Nazre was now in a higher and more powerful rank than Pao. He gained the authority to impede her career aspirations by writing negative performance reviews about her. In an attempt to do something about this abuse of power, Pao filed a number of verbal and written reports, but, after a while, the HR consultant at Kleiner told her to stop complaining. Additionally, Pao confided in her fellow junior partner, Trae Vassallo, about her unfair treatment, hoping to build her case. Much to her surprise, however, Vassallo admitted that Nazre had sexually harassed her. Nazre had asked Vassallo to join him on a business trip to New York – which turned out not to be a business trip at all. Nazre had lied, again, and showed up at her hotel room wearing nothing but a bathrobe, unsuccessfully insisting that she let him in. With this story up her sleeve, Pao relayed Nazre’s series of misdemeanors to the managing partners at Kleiner. He finally left the firm after negotiating the conditions of his severance package for two months. Though she had won this small battle, Pao wasn’t satisfied. She wanted to see real, long-lasting change and to eradicate the “boys club” culture at Kleiner. Furthering her efforts, Pao convinced the firm to hire an independent investigator, but Kleiner seemed less than interested in her and Vassallo’s experiences of harassment in the workplace. This disinterest became apparent when Kleiner failed to introduce anti-discrimination and anti-sexual harassment training in the workplace. Unsatisfied with these results, Pao contacted the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and filed a lawsuit against her company for their inaction, the inadequate investigation efforts and the unfair treatment and exclusion of women in the workplace. She was advised by her lawyer to continue working at Kleiner, as this would strengthen her case. But she only lasted a few months before being fired on the claim that she had performed poorly in her latest review. Pao vs. Kleiner escalated when the company’s lead defense lawyer started to publicly shame Pao, using private information from her therapy sessions and from conversations between herself, her husband and her lawyers. Public shaming, Pao discovered upon becoming Reddit’s CEO, is found all over the internet. Back then, Reddit was a small startup that called itself “the front page of the internet.” Reddit users could share news and photos that would be either upvoted or downvoted in real time. It was through Reddit that Pao familiarized herself with the dark side of the web. Journalist Eron Gjoni created a blog in August 2014 called “The Zoe Post,” where he wrote about his ex-girlfriend Zöe Quinn’s infidelity. Via the internet, he rallied supporters whom he would encourage to continue publicly shaming her on other platforms, such as 4chan, 8chan, Internet Relay Chat, and of course, Reddit. His supporters published her personal information online, hacked into her account, sent her death and rape threats and made computer games depicting violent acts against her. This type of online behavior was unacceptable to Pao, and, in 2015, she banned revenge porn and unsolicited nudes on Reddit. Her actions encouraged many well-known websites, like Facebook, to take the same zero-tolerance attitude. Emboldened to do more, Pao employed Reddit and the internet as her weapons to take down discrimination and harassment. To help her with her ambitious task, Pao sought the advice of investor and entrepreneur Susan Wu. Wu became an activist after hearing about the case of a woman raped by Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner. Wu created the hashtag #IWasRapedToo in an attempt to encourage more women to speak up about their experiences. Meanwhile, online press coverage began picking up Pao’s lawsuit against her former company, and many women reached out to her. It was clear that sexual discrimination was happening everywhere. Reporters began to call this sudden flood of women speaking up about their experiences the Pao Effect. Pao was convinced that she had enough evidence to win the case against her former employer, but the firm had the financial capabilities and the human resources to build a strong defense based on hundreds and thousands of emails. During her trial, Pao was also busy with two full-time jobs: being the CEO of Reddit and a mother. On 27 March 2015, the final verdict was in: Pao had lost the case. Nevertheless, the support she received throughout the trial was of immense importance. Though she had lost, Pao never once felt she was alone in her battle. She was forever grateful for the support of her family and friends, who stuck with her right to the end. She also received a lot of unexpected support from women all around the world. Her inbox on LinkedIn alone was flooded with hundreds of supportive messages. Pao hadn’t won the case, but she’d won the hearts and minds of many women across all industries, including the tech industry. With this overwhelming support, Pao decided to gather other women in executive positions to brainstorm how they could reset the tech industry. Pao’s initiative resulted in the founding of Project Include, with a mission to provide CEOs and venture capital firms with the tools and solutions they needed to effectively fight against workplace discrimination. The co-founders are influential women who all share similar experiences, like former Google engineer, Erica Joy Baker, diversity advocate Brianna Wu and Pinterest engineer Tracy Chou. These women developed the project’s three core solutions to combat discrimination at work: inclusion of all employees, comprehensiveness and accountability. Project Include gives CEOs useful advice on how to diversify their teams and lead them to success. Since its founding, the project has become an award-winning non-profit organization, spreading the word for more inclusivity in the workplace. The key message in this book: No matter your race, gender, age, sexuality, disability or if you’re pregnant, everyone is entitled to equal career opportunities. This means fair allocation of jobs, a workplace that doesn’t tolerate discrimination or harassment, and the assurance that every employee is paid according to their performance. Pao’s journey shows us that we shouldn’t be discouraged after one knockback, and that speaking up against these injustices can have wide-reaching effects. Actionable advice: Introduce and enforce zero-tolerance discrimination and harassment policies. To help end misconduct in the workplace, the first thing companies need to do is clearly communicate to their employees which behaviors are appropriate and which are not. This means equal opportunities based on performance, plus devising and implementing anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies that provide clear-cut reporting processes. There should be zero tolerance for violations regardless of company rank. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maybe you make sure your educational background looks solid; maybe you make a strong personal statement. However, you probably place the most emphasis on showing how experienced you are. We believe that, while youthful passion will take us so far, employees are looking for, above all else, the know how of time spent on the job. And, to be fair, for a long time this was true, but not now. In the modern world, experience is no longer what we need. Instead, we need the drive, enthusiasm and flexibility found in rookies. These blinks show you how and why business of the future will be driven by the rookies. In these blinks, you’ll discover how after one world-breaking runner’s record led to several more; how we can become a perpetual rookie; and why one successful film director keeps reading the same book over and over again. Next time you’re faced with a stack of resumes, look beyond experience. The strongest candidates might be rookies, or someone without experience. Why? Because technology has changed the modern workplace in three distinctive ways that work in their favor. First, our knowledge about the world is increasing faster than ever. In fact, every year and a half or so, human knowledge doubles. Second, because of constantly improving research, new findings are rapidly proving old ones false. Therefore, mastery of old knowledge is becoming less and less relevant. Take for example, a 2005 study which showed that the annual knowledge relevance decay rate—or how much knowledge becomes irrelevant each year—is 15 percent overall and up to 30 percent for high tech knowledge. So if workers aren’t continuously learning, only about 15 percent of what they know may be up-to-date in five years. The final change is that technological advancements have expanded the workplace beyond the 9-to-5 day. Now, it’s standard practice to get an email from the boss at 9PM and be expected to respond. Due to these developments, experienced workers can struggle in this new environment. Many find it difficult to keep asking questions and learning when they’ve already accumulated a base of knowledge earlier in their careers. In addition, it’s harder for them to look for new solutions when they already have an old method that has worked in the past. On the other hand, rookies aren’t yet set in their ways, so they’re predisposed to deal well with change. They are willing and eager to learn and try new solutions. In the modern workplace, these traits are what translates into success. Because whether it’s day one on the job or day 1,000, the enemy of success is cutting ourselves off from new information and approaches. What makes rookies so valuable? Read on to find out how the rookie mindset leads to success and how everyone can have it. It’s a common way of thinking: if it worked in the past, it’ll work today. However, history has proven that the old ways aren’t always the best. So who can see new possibilities and improvements? Rookies can, because they aren’t bound by the status quo. Take, for example, runner Gunder Hägg. In 1945, Hägg beat the world record speed for running a mile, a record that had seemed unbreakable. A medical student named Roger Bannister disagreed. He developed his own unique training program to beat the record and did so in 1954. But then, only 46 days after Bannister broke Hägg’s record, someone else set an even faster one. Once people saw that breaking Hägg’s record was possible, the illusion of a limit was shattered and others were inspired to innovate as well. In contrast, rookies see and explore new solutions because they simply don’t know what is considered possible yet and aren’t fearful of tarnishing their reputation. Consider the story of Hara Kefalidou, a Greek politician who first entered politics with no experience, amidst a financial crisis. Government spending was being slashed across the Mediterranean country, and thanks to her rookie status, Kefalidou was able to offer a valuable suggestion. Unaccustomed to the status quo of living life as a Greek politician, she quickly pointed out unnecessary perks politicians enjoyed which were burdens on Greek taxpayers. For example, Greek legislators were paid extra when they attended committee meetings. To Kefalidou, attending these meetings was an important component of being a good legislator and not something deserving of a bonus, so she argued against them. She was a rookie, so she hadn’t gotten used to the old system and was consequently able to spot this cost-saving opportunity easily. After some convincing of the entrenched politicians, the additional pay was cut in half. It’s easy to assume that veterans know more than rookies simply due to their experience. However, that’s not always true. Why? Experienced workers tend to fall into the rut of opinion stasis, where they only seek out what confirms their own existing opinions and ignore everything else. Because of their background and confidence, they might actively put aside ideas which could prove their old ideas wrong–including new, better ways of working. Additionally, these blinders influence who they choose to associate with. Those with opinion stasis gravitate toward others with the same views. This makes them even less likely to get shaken out of complacency toward improved ideas and solutions because there are no differing notions around them. On the other hand, rookies actively seek out multiple opinions and ask for help. Rookies want to learn from a range of people and are more open to what they offer because they don’t have their own experience to fall back on. For example, a study showed that rookies reached out to experts 40 percent more often than experienced workers did. Additionally, rookies contacted six experts on average, while experienced workers only contacted one. Since they’re drawing information from so many different people and sources, the author estimates that rookies outshine experienced workers by five-to-25 times in terms of expertise. To that end, think of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel. Often considered his greatest achievement, it’s also the work of a rookie. Before painting the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo had focused on sculpture and had never painted a fresco. To overcome his lack of expertise, he hired assistants who were fresco experts to work shoulder to shoulder with him for weeks. He also consulted the papal court for ideas on content. Being a rookie pushed him to ask for help until he mastered the technique and could paint solo, bringing with him ideas from experts. Think of an experienced worker as a veteran marathon runner who moves at a slow, steady pace. There’s no reason to make a dash because she has run this before and already knows the pace needed to finish. In the workplace, this attitude translates into experienced workers having a hard time pushing themselves beyond their comfort zone because they’re so used to the current pace and attitude. This can be seen in the example of data processing company DATAPROF. The organization wanted a new headquarters that would improve its public image and passed the task onto Jack Peterson, an experienced facilities manager. After 12 months of work, Jack presented a potential project which worked from a financial and facilities point of view, but he failed completely at the task most important to the board: public image. His proposed construction looked identical to all the company’s other buildings. In contrast to experienced workers like Jack Peterson, rookies are eager to prove themselves, so they strive to overachieve. Because of their ambition, they reach and innovate. If rookies were running a marathon, they would sprint ahead and might well end up with a better time as a result. They’re unaware of their limitations, so they keep pushing. At DATAPROF, after Jack’s flop, the company brought in a rookie colleague to take on the project. The rookie made a slam dunk. How? Because he lacked facilities experience, he asked the employees who’d eventually work in the new building about their needs. And because he knew that public image was of utmost importance, he coordinated with the people who specialized in DATAPROF’s image, utilizing their expertise. Thanks to simply asking questions and considering new solutions, the rookie’s eventual proposal turned out to be perfect. There’s that saying: better the devil you know then the angel you don’t. Well, experienced workers tend to get stuck in this mindset: they get bogged down in protocol and how things were done in the past because it seems safer. Unfortunately, working within the confines of that safe zone limits their innovative potential. For example, a highly experienced New York-based sales manager received a promotion of greater responsibility, for a larger sales region. In the past, he had worked from an office in the city and relied on a narrow network of sales contacts. But when his region expanded, he failed to adapt accordingly. He needed more contacts and a new strategy to cover the larger area, but was too stuck in his ways to grow. Predictably, his performance plummeted. Unlike that experienced sales manager, rookies are always in a position in which they have to improvise and build something from nothing. They lack the knowledge, routine and network to do things in any set way. For example, at Stanford University, student Jane Cheng enrolled in a course with the goal of creating a baby incubator suited for the developing world. Jane and her team didn’t have a massive research team or a million dollar budget; they just had curiosity and ambition. So what did they do? They went out of their way to understand the countries to which they would provide incubators, learning about local issues like lack of electricity and how these countries couldn’t afford the traditional $20,000 incubators. The Stanford team developed an incubator that was, not only functional in a lab, but functional and realistic for the nations they were helping. They could provide incubators for just $25 which would serve the function of keeping an infant warm for four hours and could also be cleaned and recharged easily with boiling water. Happily, it’s not only recent graduates who can enjoy the rookie advantage. In the next blinks, you’ll learn how you can build a rookie mindset and reap the benefits, even when you are no longer a rookie. Despite what you might think, having the rookie advantage isn’t a matter of youth—rather, it’s all a matter of mindset. You can get the rookie advantage even if you’re a senior employee. There are perpetual rookies: people who are able to combine experience with rookie smarts. They achieve that practice by having hungry, curious minds, and always being willing to take on a challenge. They’re also humble enough to always allow others to teach them. A great example of someone who pushed himself to be a perpetual rookie is the 1970s world champion surfer Wayne “Rabbit” Bartholomew. Despite being one of the highest ranked surfers, he avoided the big waves other professionals sought out and preferred to surf at Huntington Beach, California. There, he was inspired and energized by the teenagers and other rookies who frequented the inferior waves. Another way to keep rookie smarts is to start fresh. Looking at your job and goals with fresh eyes is an easy way to start giving yourself the rookie advantage. Even if it’s a project you’ve tackled 100 times, imagine that this is the very first time you’ve done anything like it. The author learned this trick from business professor C.K. Prahalad. He regularly throws away notes he made from previous semesters, even if he’s teaching the same course, because he wants to share fresh thoughts. A final technique to adopt rookie smarts is to find inspiration among genuine rookies. Let their fresh ideas rattle your old ways of thinking. With these tools, you can take advantage of important rookie traits even if being a perpetual rookie doesn’t come naturally to you. Do you feel like you’ve lost the rookie mindset? Not to worry, thankfully there are ways to regain it. The first step to relearning rookie smarts is switching to learning mode, which is defined by a readiness to learn. Open yourself to new ideas; forget old notions of arrogance and routine; and use every source of inspiration available to you. This is a technique San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh used in preparing his players for a big game. While most of the team members were seasoned professionals, Jim saw the importance of their rookie enthusiasm and drive. He harnessed it by putting high school photos of each player above their locker to remind them of the learning attitude they had when they were young. It was that attitude that propelled them to the pros in the first place. One way to ease yourself into learning mode is to put yourself into a new, fresh situation. Try volunteering or swapping jobs for a day. By jumping into a new setting, it’s easier for your brain to switch over to learning mode, asking questions and enjoying the rookie advantage when you’re doing something new. You can also develop rituals and patterns that will help bring back your rookie mindset: trick your mind into stepping back in time to when you were a true rookie. Award-winning filmmaker Francois Truffaut had a rookie mindset ritual. Early in his career he went into a small bookstore and discovered a book about filmmaking which left a lasting impression on him. Even though he directed films for a quarter of a century afterwards, every year he would go back to the same shop and relive that defining moment by buying the same book and rereading it. How can rookie smarts help entire teams perform? Keep reading to see how great leaders harness rookie power. So how can you as a leader help harness the power of rookies in your organization? One way to do that is by remembering that rookies don’t just bring new ideas to the projects they’re working on, they can inspire whole teams. For instance, when Nike bought Converse in 2003, head of innovation Peter Hudson brought the brand back to the top of the industry by hiring new talent and entrusting older employees with bigger responsibilities, helping to instill a rookie mindset. Beyond coming up with just fresh clothing designs, the reborn team also suggested structural changes like working directly with factories. This made Converse much more agile and adaptable by shortening the process from design to finished product by several weeks. However, it’s important to remember that in order to make the most of rookies’ energy, leadership needs to point them in the right direction. Rookies need clear objectives to strive for. In addition, rookies need to be given enough responsibility and challenges so they can shine. These challenges should not be so big they can damage the organization, but not too small that they settle into minor roles and get bogged down in the status quo, ultimately losing their edge. When it comes to hospitals, experienced doctors often complain that resident doctors need to be reined in because they’re not adequately experienced to handle a dying patient on an operating table. However, such dire scenarios constitute only 5 percent of all circumstances, so actually, 95 percent of situations could be handled by the rookie residents. That’s lots of responsibility rookies can safely assume. So the next time a task needs dedication, creativity and enthusiasm, consider a rookie. He or she just might surprise your whole organization! The key message: In today’s fast-paced workplace, learning and innovating are the keys to success. This means rookies can often outperform experienced workers thanks to the rookie advantage. Thankfully, even senior executives can keep their rookie advantage by staying open to new ideas and inspiration. Actionable advice: In the office, assume a new role or swap jobs for a day. Or, volunteer somewhere outside the office. Is someone at work going on holiday for a few days? Offer to take on some of their tasks and responsibilities. New challenges trick your mind into stepping back in time, to when you were a true rookie. It’s an easy way to get the brain used to learning, asking questions, innovating and enjoying the rookie advantage again.

What’s more, even experienced speakers sometimes have trouble formulating their thoughts. These blinks explore two problems relating to public speaking: how to prepare a speech effectively, and how to present it in a way that really moves the audience. At the core of successful speeches is a laser-like focus, and after reading these blinks you’ll master the author’s original and helpful SCORRE-method to define this focus. In these blinks you’ll discover why after a presentation, 70 percent of people don’t know what it was about; how a touching story might ruin your performance if you’re not ready to improvise; and why it’s always important to check that your fly is done up! Have you ever heard a speech that gave you goosebumps? Did you wonder how the speaker managed to affect you so deeply? The secret to a powerful speech is simple: focus. Though it can be tempting to cram a speech with facts and statistics in order to convince your audience, that tactic will surely reduce the audience’s attention span. This finding is reflected in a study conducted by the author. Of the 2,000 people surveyed, 70 percent were unable to recall the key messages of presentations they had just viewed. Even more surprisingly, 50 percent of the speakers were themselves unable to explain the purpose and motivation behind their own speeches. In this way, it is clear that a speech that lacks focus will also lack impact. Instead, an effective presentation will first adhere to a specific goal, which is only then supplemented with information. But how do we choose this goal? Making such a decision seems tough, but often we are able to do so without even thinking. Having objectives is part of human nature. It drives our instinctive ability to acquire food, shelter and ultimately survive. Similarly, in writing a speech, our subconscious directs us to our objectives, even if we are not consciously aware of them. The trick is to become aware of this innate process. By taking a step back and reflecting on what it is we really want to communicate, we can harness the power of objectives and create a speech that leads directly to them. In order to produce a presentation that has focus, our approach to writing it should also reflect focus. Davis’s SCORRE-method will allow us to create successful speeches by breaking it down into: subject, central theme, objective, rationale, resources and evaluation. Sitting down to write a speech can be incredibly overwhelming. How, for example, can we possibly choose where to begin talking about the ever-changing discipline of science or the universally discussed theme of love? This is where the first part of the SCORRE-method comes in, by helping us narrow our passion into a subject that gives our speech focus. It is astonishing how our grasp on a presentation improves once we’ve selected a subject that is narrow and specific. Otherwise, we run the risk of including everything we know about a topic, even getting lost on wild tangents unrelated to the topic itself. In writing the first draft of this book, for example, the author initially included too many irrelevant anecdotes. However, he had a clear objective in mind – educating others about public speaking. By using this narrowed subject, the author could discern which information was valuable in relation to his specific subject. Our subject should not only be specific, it should also be central to our speech. What does this mean? A central idea that runs throughout the presentation is one to which every point we make relates back. In this way, our presentation will take the shape of a complete story, rather than some scattered remarks across a handful of different aspects. Say you wanted to create a presentation all about scuba diving. It doesn’t seem too daunting a task. But a speech that covered the complete history of the underwater hobby would take several hours to present and drown your audience in information. Instead, simply selecting ‘how to learn scuba diving’ as your central theme would allow you to cover all vital aspects of the chosen subject within an appropriate duration. With a subject and central theme in mind, you’re well on the way to creating an effective presentation. But, that was just the first warm up for your next exercise: crafting an objective sentence for your speech. You’d hardly think that a 10 to 15 minute speech could be boiled down to a one-liner. Think again! The objective sentence is a tool that does just that, and though it’s just a single sentence, it should also reflect careful choices in its construction. Why? It’s the essence of your speech, a vehicle for your overarching message and at the heart of the SCORRE-method. The ingredients are threefold: a proposition, an interrogative question and answer, and a key word. A proposition is simply what you aim to put out there with your speech. It is a bold statement for the audience to consider, such as “all couples can have a lasting marriage.” Next, add an interrogative question and answer that demonstrate how the proposition can be implemented. In this case, “how can couples have a lasting marriage?” forms the interrogative question, while “by avoiding temptations” is a possible answer. Finally, a key word is required. In this example, we find it in the interrogative answer – temptations. This key word encompasses all the different forms of temptations that should and can be avoided, as you will demonstrate in your speech. The objective sentence of your speech emerges naturally as “all couples can have a lasting marriage by avoiding temptations.” Although this sentence does not reflect the snappiest turn of phrase, it is still incredibly valuable. With our objective sentence, the purpose of our speech is made clear. And in turn, the structure of our speech is also revealed. For example, in writing your speech on marriage, you may be tempted to comment on the tension that arises between couples at the prospect of having a baby. But, in light of your objective sentence, you will find that this is a tangent not related to your key word, temptations. So long as we actively return to this objective sentence while writing our speech, our focus will be retained, and so too will the power of our presentation. After successfully working through the first three letters of the SCORRE-method, we come to the two R’s and a final E - rationale, resources and evaluation. If our speech were a house, then what we’ve achieved so far is perhaps its architectural plan. The design created through our subject, central theme and objective sentence requires a real and solid foundation to build on. This is our rationale, a series of points that outline the argument of your speech so as to make it credible to the audience. These points should link not only to the key word but to each other, creating a logical flow. Using our previous example of marriage, our rationale could be: avoiding the temptations of being (1) unfaithful, (2) selfish, and (3) jealous. These three points support the speech’s argument and correspond with each other, so that understanding them is easy. However, an argument that makes sense is not enough to create a successful presentation. We need something else to bring the speech to life. The something else are our resources, anecdotes and even jokes, that illustrate our argument in a way that is captivating and lively. A humorous tale about the near break-up of a marriage through a trivial misunderstanding, or a contrasting tragedy of a couple that disintegrated in the face of temptation would not only demonstrate the truth to our speech’s argument, but also reveal a human side of it that the audience cannot help but engage with. Creating that human interest is something that dry divorce statistics alone cannot do. Finally, there’s one more step in the SCORRE-method: evaluation. It is not enough to develop our rationale, supplement it with resources and leave it at that. Rather, we must evaluate and re-evaluate the choices we make when constructing the speech. In this way, we can correct a rationale that has gone awry or resources that don’t quite fit, so that our focus remains strong as ever. The SCORRE-method allows us to achieve the bulk of the hard work involved in creating a speech. However, by performing some further steps, we will be rewarded with a goosebump-inducing speech that sticks with the audience for days after. The opening and conclusion are vital tools in this way. The first moments of your speech are arguably the most important, but don’t let this alarm you. All that is required of you is to take this chance to grab the audience’s attention in any original way, before briefly introducing the topic. After this, you’ll have already won the battle, with the audience’s attention starting strong and remaining strong throughout your speech. Think back to the 70 percent of forgetful audience members from the author’s study – perhaps a more striking introduction would have made all the difference. As your speech winds up, you’re presented with another opportunity to leave a lasting impression. Contrary to what we’ve often been taught, a conclusion is not merely a summary. Yes, it should reiterate your points, but in a final persuasive act that leaves your audience with your message, and leaves them on your side. How exactly to perform this bold move? A powerful conclusion is often best achieved by highlighting the real-world relevance of your argument, especially in the lives of your own audience. Encourage them to think back to your speech when faced with their own issues, perhaps in dealing with their own marriage and temptations, in line with our previous example. In this way, your speech will become not just something your audience listened to once, but something they return to again and again, as they take on and apply the objective you set out to communicate. We all have limited time in our busy lifestyles, and you may be feeling a little reluctant to set aside substantial amounts to prepare your speech. Certainly, the SCORRE processes of perfecting the objective sentence and interweaving an evaluated rationale with resources are time-consuming ones. But if you don’t give up time to create your presentation, why should anyone else want to give up his or her time to listen to it? The SCORRE-method is highly effective, but only when the time is taken to apply it properly. Use your time to prepare the speech, as well as presenting the speech. The structured approach of a SCORRE speech will aid you in dividing each part into easily digestible points and designate appropriate speaking time for these. Naturally, practice runs of your presentation will prove invaluable in ensuring you have an accurate grasp of its duration. What’s more, simply leaving the speech aside for a week or so can work wonders. By returning to your work with a fresh outlook, you’ll be surprised at how easily mistakes will jump out at you, and how quick it’ll be to fix them. You may even develop some new ideas in your time away from your speech that provide great support to your central theme. Put it aside for a week if you can. Time is a luxury, and treating yourself to a week of revision is something you and your audience will surely appreciate. Another thing your audience will appreciate is if you present your SCORRE speech with flair. We’ve all been members of a bored audience in the past, which makes the prospect of engaging one a little alarming. When giving a speech, think of your message as the product you’d like to sell. The audience is your customer – how are you going to engage them? A speech isn’t all about performing. What’s more important is an awareness of what you’re trying to communicate and whom you’re trying to communicate to. The concerns of a group of teenagers and a group of retirees are different, so why should you provide them with the same performance? Likewise, the mood of an audience can vary. The author had to make a last-minute change to a humorous introduction, rendered inappropriate as he found himself about to present after the previous speaker shared an emotional and personal story. Both cases reflect that audiences are diverse and it helps to be flexible and sensitive to their interests. Speaking to your specific audience is integral to effective audience engagement. An awareness of our own physical presence is also central to engaging the audience. While we often don’t pay attention to our voice, expressions and gestures on an every-day basis, on the stage these become powerful tools that can make a speech by bringing life to your words, or break a speech by providing visual distractions. For example, the author recalls several presentations in which he unwittingly distracted the audience by forgetting to close his fly. The room in which you present can also strengthen or weaken your presentation. Attention to the lighting, sound and arrangement of the room is vital. Use each element to bring the focus towards you, and not to the background. For example, the author recounts the ineffectiveness of one speaker in capturing the audience’s attention when competing with the stunning snowy landscape that stood behind him in Alaska. By closely considering every element that will shape your presentation experience, you can ensure that none of the hard work put into your speech will go to waste. Now that we’ve considered the importance of the physical landscape that we present in, let’s turn our attention to the emotional landscape of our speech. We can’t be sure that our audience will relate to every proposition in our speech. However, by engaging our audience on an emotional level, we can ensure that each audience member will connect with our presentation, regardless of his or her background or prior experiences. This emotional engagement should stem from the fact that we ourselves are emotionally involved in the speech. This way our natural emotive language appeals to the audience’s feelings ranging from sadness to joy. Allowing the audience to empathize with your ideas will ensure that they are effective and worth remembering. What makes a speech perhaps even more memorable is humor. Its use is particularly effective at opening an audience up to new propositions. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of a humorous approach, the author refers to a businessman who wrote to him after viewing one of his speeches. The audience member wrote that he was initially skeptical but that the speaker’s light-hearted and funny presentation led the businessman to accept the messages of Christianity for the first time. Humor can be used to turn audience expectations around, and it can be used even if you don’t consider yourself a particularly witty person. Even the truth can be funny in the way that it startles us, and elements of surprise or exaggeration in its delivery are simple to implement and highly effective. And with that, you’ve been equipped with all the vital tools for creating a speech, from coming up with a subject, to developing your focus and to communicating in an engaging manner. By making use of all of the author’s steps, your focused speeches will be the kind that give goosebumps to the audience, and perhaps to you too. The key message in this book: The secret to preparing an effective speech is to develop the focus. By implementing the SCORRE-method and engaging the audience through the physical surroundings and emotional landscape of your presentation, you can ensure your success as a moving and memorable public speaker. Actionable advice: Refresh and reflect! The evaluation process is vital for a successful speech, so make time to reflect on your work if you are encountering difficulties. Simply setting your speech aside for a week or so will provide you with a fresh perspective that may prove invaluable in creating a finished product that you are satisfied with.

But then came July 20, 1969, when NASA’s team of astronauts, engineers and mathematicians turned fantasy into reality and forever changed the popular perception of what was possible. Sure, it took some impressive minds to achieve this incredible goal, but behind all the rocket science were practices that anyone could use to reach their own milestones. As we’ll learn in the blinks ahead, it wasn’t just book-smarts that put humans on the moon; it was also the ability to find purpose in a task and remain prepared and well-rested for the unexpected challenges and fears that lay ahead. By learning from those who’ve achieved greatness, you’ll be in a better position to shoot for the moon and turn your wildest dreams into a reality. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a good night’s sleep can be the answer to your problems; why there’s a big difference between a December and a January deadline; and how a pen saved the Apollo 11 mission. July 20, 1969, is the date of a singular event in history, the day Apollo 11 landed safely on the moon. But it took decades of painstaking work filled with trials and tribulations to reach that goal. What kept the Apollo team motivated was a great sense of purpose. They held on to the dream that US ingenuity would be responsible for the first moon landing, and that this would promote the American values of freedom and democracy around the world. Such stakes are, of course, a big motivator. But having a strong sense of purpose doesn’t require rocket science. It can happen among any team, even one at a university call center. The University of Pennsylvania has a grant program to help qualified but financially-constrained students afford tuition. The program has a call center devoted to contacting alumni and asking them to donate. In 2007, psychologist Adam Grant had former beneficiaries of the program visit and speak to the team at the call center, to let them know in person just how much the money had changed their lives. Grant noted how this created an impressive motivating factor. With the staff now clear on the difference they were making, they had an increased sense of purpose which revealed itself as a 140 percent increase in the time spent working and a 171 percent increase in funds raised. Another proven way of boosting performance is to add a competitive element. And for the Apollo team, this aspect was certainly present. After all, the US was engaged in a riveting space race with the Soviet Union. Back in 1898, this motivating factor was studied by Norman Triplett, a psychology professor at Indiana University. When observing cyclists racing both with and without competitors, he noticed that the sportsmen consistently reached faster speeds when facing competition. In 2008, Triplett’s findings were expanded upon by Japanese psychologist Kou Murayama. He found that the motivating factor of competition increased even further when the individuals were part of a team, and team members were able to monitor their performance against their competitors’ performance. Then, in 2014, psychology professor Gavin Kilduff found that the motivating factor could be increased even further when the competitor is a personally-familiar rival. However, as we’ll see in the next blink, being competitive needs to be balanced against another important factor: knowing when to take it easy. It’s quite likely that the Apollo 11 moon landing would never have happened if it weren’t for one idea – that of the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. This is the breakthrough that made it possible for the astronauts to safely reach the surface by first having their main spacecraft orbit the moon closely. Once the main spacecraft was in orbit, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would use a small landing unit, named Eagle, to take them the final distance to the moon’s surface. This idea didn’t come out of a nonstop, 48-hour marathon brainstorming session. It came from months of deliberate tinkering with various possibilities and suggestions. Crucially, during this time there were also plenty of breaks for rest and periods when ideas could incubate and gradually come to fruition. Taking breaks and getting a good night’s sleep aren’t signs of laziness. In fact, they’re an essential part of generating innovative ideas. Creative minds such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are well-known for advocating the use of breaks and making time for energizing yet peaceful activities like long walks. Especially helpful are exercise breaks: In 2014, Stanford psychologist Marily Oppezzo found that people who walked on a treadmill during their break could increase creativity by up to 60 percent, compared to those who sat down. Importantly, Oppezzo found that this creativity boost could last several hours, long after the person resumed their seat. In other words, your work can benefit from hours of increased creativity after just a 30-minute walk. Similar benefits for innovative thinking come from getting restorative sleep. In 2004, psychologist Ulrich Wagner, from the University of Lübeck, gave participants a particularly tricky task involving a list of numbers where they had to replace some digits with other ones. Some participants were given this task in the morning, with no break for sleep, while others were given the task in the evening and could finish the next morning after a full night’s sleep. Now, the thing about this task was that it had a quick and innovative solution that wasn’t readily apparent to any of the participants. But what’s remarkable is that 60 percent of those who were able to return to the task after sleeping were able to deduce this innovative solution, while only 23 percent of the other participants were able to figure it out. It’s no wonder that many of the world’s leading companies, such as Google and Nike, are now encouraging their employees to take naps. So, the next time you have to solve a problem, you might try “sleeping on it,” as you may find a better solution in the morning. Most of the people on the Apollo 11 team didn’t come from privileged or well-to-do backgrounds. In fact, you could safely say that most of them had to overcome some form of adversity to reach their position on the team. This triumph over hardship had a beneficial effect since it instilled a belief that it is possible to achieve even the most ambitious of goals – such as blasting some astronauts into outer space and getting two of them to walk on the moon. A positive mind-set was a must among those on the Apollo 11 mission, as there was no shortage of challenges to overcome. So, no matter what you want to do in life, it’s important to maintain a positive outlook. This isn’t an outlook that will occur automatically – it must be cultivated. For this to happen, you should remember the times you performed well or accomplished something, whether it was a great test result or a successful project. Then, figure out what you did that led to this result and try to keep this positive result replaying in your mind as long as possible – as if it were a slow-motion replay during a sports telecast. To keep this mental replay going, it’s helpful to have some sort of visual cue, such as a card, photo or a memento from the event, placed somewhere you’re sure to see it every day, like on your bedside table. Over time, you’ll accumulate a variety of these positive events, and your positive outlook will naturally take root. Another useful tip for success is to have strong role models to look up to and keep as a living reminder that the extraordinary can be achieved. Your sense of optimism doesn’t have to come exclusively from your own experiences. There’s a rich history of other people who’ve accomplished amazing feats, and they should also serve as proof that the sky’s the limit for achievements. So find your own personal hero and keep them in mind when the going gets tough. Helen Keller is a good example: Born in 1888, Keller succumbed to an illness that took both her eyesight and hearing. Yet Keller learned how to communicate in other ways and eventually became the first deaf-blind person to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree. Keller also toured the United States and became a leading voice fighting for the rights of women and the poor, proving that even incredible adversity is no match for a strong will. If you had a bad math teacher early on, you may have struggled to learn and ended up with the idea that you’re no good at the subject. And if you were told that someone is a librarian, maybe you thought to yourself that they’re probably irrevocably introverted, right? Assumptions like these are common, but they’re also limiting and prejudicial. It’s better to have a mind-set that’s the opposite of limiting – the next quality of someone who shoots for the moon: a growth mind-set. When you have a growth mind-set, you don’t believe that anyone’s current situation is permanent. You believe that you and everyone else can change and improve and that a person’s abilities are not set in stone. Naturally, this is the kind of mind-set that encourages success. In the 1980s, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck coined the term growth mind-set as well as fixed mind-set, which describes the belief that someone’s abilities are set in stone. In 2007, Dweck proved the effect of these different mind-sets in a two-year study where she observed hundreds of high school students who were part of a difficult math program. At the beginning of the study, Dweck identified which students had a fixed mind-set and which had a growth mind-set. After a few months, it was apparent that the students with a growth mind-set were outperforming their fixed-minded peers, and this discrepancy only widened as the years went on. In looking at what exactly causes this discrepancy, Dweck saw that those with a growth mind-set had the ability to recover from failures. More precisely, she recognized that because the growth-minded students didn’t see their intelligence level as fixed, they weren’t afraid of failure. Instead, they knew they could learn from failure and use it to improve, so they were far more willing to take on challenging mathematical problems and learn from them. The fixed-minded students, on the other hand, worried that an incorrect solution to the problem would be a confirmation of the fixed notion that they were mediocre at math and would never get better. This made them reluctant to even try. One of the flight controllers on the Apollo 11 mission was Jerry Bostick, and he had some well-known words of wisdom: just because you can’t do everything you want to do, doesn’t mean you should give up and do nothing. Of course, Bostick’s words apply to everyone and not just rocket scientists, since he was essentially reminding people not to procrastinate by waiting for the perfect scenario that might never arrive. A good way to avoid procrastination is to take things one step at a time. Let’s say it’s the start of a new year and you’d like to lose ten pounds. Of course, this isn’t an easy goal, and if you dwell on all the potential difficulties, you may give up before you even start. But if you set a goal of losing at least one pound every month, it may start to appear a more achievable target. You may not lose all ten pounds by summertime, but six pounds would be better than nothing. And who knows, once you start getting results, you may feel so good that you start shedding the pounds even faster! Now, let’s say you want to launch a software startup while still keeping the steady paycheck of your current job. Your ideal vision might be to get up and running within a month, but when you realize that this would require you to work nonstop for every waking hour of four full weeks, you may give up before a single line of code is written. However, if you show some flexibility and just stick to working on the weekends, there’s a good chance you’ll be launching sooner than you think. Another helpful method for avoiding procrastination is to set smart deadlines. That’s right; some deadlines are cleverer than others. In a 2014 study, economist Yanping Tu, of Florida University, gave participants a six-month deadline to open a bank account. One group had the six months between June and December, while the other group had the six months between July and January of the following year. Oddly enough, since the January deadline was in the following year, this group procrastinated more because they felt they had more time than they actually did. So, a smart deadline will take this into account and prevent needless procrastination by avoiding dates that spill over into the following year, month or even week. Gerry Griffin was the lead flight director for the Apollo 12 mission, which was a notable mission for many reasons, not least that the rocket was struck by lightning moments after it took off on the afternoon of November 14, 1969. This unexpected development put Griffin in a tough spot because he was in charge of deciding whether the mission should proceed as planned or whether he should pull the plug before things got worse. The data visible in the control room was garbled due to the strike. Fortunately, the ground crew were still able to communicate with the astronauts and get them to flip a switch on their end that allowed the ship’s data to get back online. With this fix in place, mission control could now at least monitor the rocket. Obviously, a great deal of time, money and effort had gone into getting Apollo 12 prepared and launched, so pulling the plug would have felt like a tremendous waste. But then again, as one of Griffin’s trusted colleagues reminded him at that key moment, this time, there was no great need for them to land on the moon. So Griffin did what he was supposed to do, and after checking that everything was looking good, he decided that the mission could safely proceed as planned. This proved to be the right decision, as Apollo 12 gave NASA their second moon landing, and the astronauts returned safely to earth ten days later. Similarly, sometimes making decisions about your future requires you to acknowledge your fears. Fortunately, there are ways to practice and get better at this difficult fact of life. The more you do something, the easier it will get. Therefore, the more you do uncomfortable or scary things, the braver you’ll begin to feel as these things become less frightening. While you should never do anything reckless, routinely confronting your fears will make you better at responding well to a crisis. This is a good opportunity to consider what you feel frightened of – perhaps it’s public speaking, swimming, or talking to strangers at a party? So maybe it’s time to take a swimming class or volunteer to give a big presentation at work. When you emerge safe and sound from these experiences, you’ll find yourself becoming braver and more competent at making decisions, even in a crisis. While Apollo 11 is famous for its successful outcome, that doesn’t mean there weren’t any hiccups along the way. One memorable issue arose on July 20, 1969, as Eagle, the lunar module carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, was approaching the moon’s surface. It was, of course, a major moment in the mission. And it was just as the approach was underway that the control room received the first of many alerts, with the code number 1202 popping up. What was happening? Were Neil and Buzz in danger? In moments like these, it pays to be well-prepared, which mission leader Jack Garman certainly was. He had a sheet with all alert codes within reach, so he could quickly confirm that 1202 meant the Eagle’s computer was experiencing an overload. After all, it was attempting to calculate the remaining distance to the moon as well as the movements of the main shuttle as it continued to orbit the moon, and send information to the control room on earth. For a computer in 1969, that was asking a lot, and so now it was sending the alert, saving as much data as possible and restarting. Being prepared, Garman didn’t panic. He knew that the computer malfunction was temporary and wouldn’t interfere with the landing. So the mission proceeded as planned, and Neil Armstrong got to say his famous words, “The Eagle has landed.” To show grace under pressure and be as well-prepared as the Apollo 11 team, it’s wise to identify potential problems before launching your next big project. As a psychologist and decision-making specialist, Gary Klein has developed what he calls a pre-mortem, which is a way to prepare for high-pressure situations by imagining everything going wrong each step of the way. Then, at every step, you can examine the reasons behind each failure. Let’s say you’re organizing a fundraiser. One of the first problems may be that no one shows up! So why would that happen? Maybe the invites had the wrong date? Or maybe the directions to the venue were confusing? When you make a pre-mortem you can systematically go through all these potential pitfalls and make sure that you’ve done everything you can to prevent them from happening or quickly and calmly deal with them if they do arise. The computer overload alert wasn’t the only problem to arise when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about to touch down in their Eagle lunar module. As the Eagle was landing, one of the astronauts accidentally broke the button they would need to ignite the ascent engine of the lunar module and get them back to the orbiting spacecraft that would take them back home. Obviously, this was no small issue. Fortunately, Aldrin was quite adaptable and pretty good at thinking on his feet to find clever solutions. In this case, he thought of using the trusty felt-tip pen he kept in his pocket for jotting down notes. He knew the plastic pen wouldn’t conduct electricity, and it was just the right size to fit the opening where the button had broken off and activate the ignition. Sure enough, it did just that. So it’s not too much of a stretch to say that Buzz Aldrin’s pen, as well as his adaptability, saved them from being stranded on the moon. It also goes to show that even if you believe you’ve covered every possible pitfall, life will probably find a way to throw something unexpected your way. In fact, with any major project, it’s better to plan for something unexpected to happen because your success could very well depend on how you adapt and react – just as the success of Apollo 11 eventually depended on the resourcefulness of those astronauts. On the bright side, it turns out that being adaptable not only prevents failure, but it also has the added bonus of promoting happiness. In 2003, the British psychologist and management expert, Frank Bond, conducted a study where 400 employees were given questionnaires to find out how adaptable and flexible they were. They were asked how they responded to challenges at work, specifically whether they came up with multiple solutions or just tried to make one solution work each time. In the end, the study found that the more adaptable employees were not only more productive; they also reported being happier than their less adaptable peers. The men and women of the Apollo missions proved that it is possible to make the seemingly impossible a reality. And in doing so, they showed the world how anyone can make their dreams come true. With some focused effort, you can stay motivated, creative and courageous to take on the challenges life brings and not be afraid to dream big and shoot for the moon. The key message in these blinks: Nothing is out of reach, and you too can achieve the seemingly impossible by learning from the Apollo teams that made the lunar missions a reality. Achieving great things is neither a miracle nor just a matter of luck. To attain your goals, try to find a deeper purpose to your work, take sufficient breaks, sleep on problems, work on your courage and prepare for everything, even the unexpected. Actionable advice: Create your own competition to boost your motivation.  Competing is a great way to boost performance and motivation. So if you’re having trouble achieving some of your goals, see if you can’t make a competition out of it. For example, if you want to lose weight, you could turn it into a competition with your partner, to see who can lose the most. Or if you lack motivation at the gym, imagine that you’re competing with somebody you consider a rival. Your performance might just soar! Got feedback?

What to read next: Rocket Men, by Robert Kurson Apollo 11 may be the most celebrated mission in the Apollo legacy since it was the first to get an astronaut on the moon. But when it comes to the dramatic international tension of the Space Race between the USSR and the United States, the most pivotal NASA mission was Apollo 8. Rocket Men takes you behind the scenes of this risky mission and explains why it was such a make-or-break endeavor for the US space program. While Apollo 11 serves as the dramatic climax to the Space Race, Rocket Men puts you right in the middle of the running, when victory was still very much up for grabs.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Quit your day job and be your own boss!” Following this type of entrepreneurial advice comes with a fair share of risk. And let’s face it: not everyone who tries self-employment thrives as their own boss. So what if you have an inner-entrepreneur who wants to venture forth, but you also want to keep the benefits of your current job? There’s a lot to be said for health insurance, regular feedback and steady deadlines. Well, maybe it’s to consider becoming a side hustler! In these blinks, you’ll find out precisely what it means to have a business in addition to your day job, as well as learning the dos and don’ts of having a successful side hustle. From finding the perfect idea for your part-time business to optimizing your income from it, these blinks will make you into a side hustler in no time. You’ll also learn how obscure hobbies, like writing fish tank reviews, can give you an extra income; how some pretty simple math can prevent your making business mistakes; and why Girl Scouts have a lot to teach the business community. One day, a British construction manager decided to start writing reviews of fish tanks. The reviews included hyperlinks to Amazon product listings, and he knew he’d get a small commission if readers clicked through and purchased them. But the reviews were posted on an obscure website and, busy with his other day-job work, he half-forgot he’d ever written them. So he was pleasantly surprised when, several weeks later, he received a check for $350. Even now, years down the road, he’s still getting $700 a month for the same reviews. In short, he has the perfect side hustle. A side hustle can be defined as a profitable business venture that operates as an adjunct to other paid work or employment. No more than the bare minimum amount of time, money and effort should be invested. It shouldn't be a big deal. You can even think of it as a kind of job security. The days of a \"job for life\" are over, and a side hustle ensures several incomes from different sources. You simply won’t be held to the whims of a single employer whose loyalty to you can’t be counted on. Everybody needs a side hustle. It can make transitioning from your day job easier, too, if you decide to quit or are fired. Leaving may seem exhilarating in the abstract, but the reality can be difficult: you’ll lose a reliable income source and health insurance. A side hustle gives you a taste of entrepreneurship, but without all the risks of going it alone. There’s also no reason to feel daunted when beginning a side hustle. For starters, you don’t need to spend a lot of time doing it. No more than an hour a day maximum. Any more is probably a waste of time. Secondly, there’s no need to have a business degree to get going. Remember, it's your business you’re running, not someone else’s – you're the one setting the entry requirements! So those are the basics. But what kind of idea makes for the best side hustle? The adage has it wrong; money can grow on trees. But growing a money-bearing seedling requires planting the right seed under the right conditions. All it takes is a little thought, however, and you’ll find those fecund and productive ideas that are bound to blossom. To get going, it’s important to recognize that hustle-worthy ideas share three qualities. They need to be feasible, profitable and persuasive. If you can answer yes to the following three questions, then the idea is feasible. Does your idea motivate you? Will it earn you money? Can it be accomplished in a short period of time? How do you know if your idea is profitable? Well, try explaining the merits of your proposal to potential customers in two sentences. No luck? Then your potential customers won’t become paying customers any time soon. An idea is persuasive if your customers can’t say no. Consider Julia. As a caricaturist, she was earning $100 an hour as a side hustle. But when she started sketching with digital drawing technology, she found she could charge $250 an hour. This was possible because few customers had seen the technology before. The novelty gave her a persuasive edge over the competition, and that wow factor was irresistible So once you’ve got some feasible, profitable and persuasive ideas, you’ve got to do some basic math. You should calculate the projected profit of each hustle with this equation: “anticipated income minus anticipated expenses.” Put this way, making a profit is easily understood. You should spend less money on your hustle than you bring in. You should also calculate the answer twice. One should be a conservative projection, the other an optimistic one, depending on the predicted strength of possible outcomes. So now that you have an idea, how do you go about pitching it? You might think it’d be difficult to make a lot of money from giving guitar lessons as a side hustle. After all, there are already plenty of guitar teachers doing the rounds. But Jake earns $6,000 a month doing exactly that. He can make this much because his offer trumps the rest. Once you’ve got your idea, you can turn it into an offer. Every offer includes three elements: a promise, a pitch and a price. The promise is a bold statement that tells customers how they’ll immediately profit – that is, how you'll change their life. Jake promised \"The most awesome guitar lessons in the universe.\" A pitch tells customers all they need to know, with no irrelevant details. Jake's pitch was \"The typical goal is to have fun (always first and foremost), as well as learn the instrument, all while maximizing efficiency so we meet your goals.\" Your price communicates the cost, and should also include a \"call to action.\" A tag like \"phone this number\" or \"click this button” should do the trick. It needs to be easy and obvious. The best offers also create a sense of urgency. Your potential customers need to think they want your hustle immediately. A good way to do this is to ensure you respond to queries from customers quickly and efficiently. A study by the Harvard Business Review found that companies who responded to a customer's request for information within an hour were seven times more likely to get business. Another technique for communicating urgency is to use the color red. Highlighting words like \"now\" or \"today\" works wonders. Finally, if you’re selling online, you’ll find that a countdown on the checkout screen is great for hurrying customers along. Okay, we’ve covered the things that constitute an offer, so now let’s think about the kind of tools you’ll need to get up and running. One particular Valentine’s Day, Sarah spotted a gap in the market. No one was selling custom-printed candy hearts. So she got down to it herself and within days had multiple orders. When her supplier wasn’t able to keep up with demand, Sarah found her own printing machine to ensure the business kept chugging along. If you, like Sarah, want to be resourceful and have the right attitude for rapidly growing your hustle, you need to have the basics covered. You need a resource shopping list which will include the following. First, a website. This is your online home, and a content-management system such as Wordpress can make setting it up easy. A social media profile. You needn’t be operating on every single platform – just one or two should be fine. However, do register your side hustle’s name with the most popular platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, irrespective of your current reach. A scheduling tool. A side hustle is a time-based commitment and time management is critical. A scheduling tool means you’ll spend less time organizing meetings with colleagues and customers and more time working, as online scheduling applications are designed to display mutually available slots. A payment system. Be sure to have an invoicing system, PayPal account or shopping cart on your website before you launch. Once you have these four elements sorted out, you should prioritize providing more value and generating more money. Value is best improved by responding to customers' unspoken needs. For instance, say you’ve been walking a man’s dog while he’s on vacation. Maybe that same man needs regular dog care when he’s back in town? Ask him. Money can be generated through regularly scheduled price increases. Don’t be afraid of doing this – customers will understand. After all, once your business has proven its reliability, you need to charge a fair price. Each spring, Girl Scouts can be seen selling boxes of cookies at malls and outside supermarkets all over the United States. Their pitch is simple: “Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?\" They sell them by the truckload – 200 million boxes every year, to be precise. So what can a side hustler learn from the Girl Scouts? Well, they sell so many cookies not just because the cookies are scrumptious but because people know that they are. When you’re selling a product or service, you’ve really got to emphasize its merits. Lead with the benefits. You might tell customers that your product will make them happier or their lives simpler and better. Ideally, you should connect with people’s emotions. Consider a dog sitter. She might not explicitly try to assuage an owner’s guilt about leaving his dog at home alone, but she can imply it. A carefully crafted pitch might go “Leave your dog with me and he’ll feel loved and cared for.” Be subtle. Once you’re able to distill your side hustle’s benefits, you should reach out to four types of people who can help you along the way. There’s no need to do your solo side project alone. First, find supporters. Most likely this means your family and friends – people who can contribute in different ways and support your efforts. Second, seek out mentors. These are guides or experts who can give you feedback and advice. Third, identify influencers. These are trendsetters who'll spread the news about your product. Trusted authorities, like reviewers or bloggers, are generally best for this. Fourth, locate some ideal customers. These people are perfectly placed to evaluate products and respond to questions you might have with honest and detailed answers. Once you've established this network, you’re sure to go far. Often, when business owners are asked how their businesses are going, they’ll just respond with a perfunctory, \"Oh, it’s fine.\" That’s not the right answer! A business is never in stasis. It’s either on an upward trajectory – or it’s sinking. It’s important, in the early stages of your hustle, to know exactly what sort of trajectory your business is on. Once you’re up and running, ask yourself a simple question: is your venture making money? There are three possible answers. First, you might find you’re far exceeding initial expectations. Fine, that’s great. You’ve obviously got to keep going. Second, you might think your original idea was good, but people haven’t latched onto it. It’s difficult to admit it, but that’s the time to cut your losses and move on. The most common response in the early stages is the third. You’ve found your idea hasn’t completely gained traction, but as it’s making a bit of money it doesn’t make sense to pull the plug. If this last option sounds familiar, but you’re still not certain how to finesse the problem areas in your hustle, then have a look at your metrics. Metrics are measured in three areas. Profit – that’s income minus expenses. Growth – ask yourself how many new customers or what new prospects you have. And time – how long do you spend on your hustle each week? Once you’ve identified areas of concern, you can improve on them by applying two basic rules. In the first case, do more of what’s working. In the second, abandon what’s not. It’s universally tempting to try to solve a problem. But don’t. Really. In the author’s experience, the most successful people just drop them and concentrate more on those aspects that function best. Well, that’s it! You have all the tools you need to start your side hustle. From here, the only way is up. The key message in this book: Absolutely anyone can create and launch a successful part-time business. It doesn’t require much time, money or effort to start one, and it doesn’t mean quitting your day job. A side hustle is a great idea. It gives you an extra paycheck, but without the terrifying risks of being a self-employed entrepreneur. Actionable advice: Create a workflow for your side hustle. When working out how your customers will purchase your product or service and receive what they’ve paid for, it’s useful to write a list of processes that need to take place along the way. This list of processes is called a workflow. When you make this master list of activities, actions and next steps, you should consider: How will prospective customers learn about your idea? What will happen immediately after the customer registers for or purchases what you’re selling? What else needs to occur in order for the customer to purchase and actually get your product or service? Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

And yet, since thinking is a skill like any other, we actually can take active steps to improve it. This book presents a complete system for making better decisions by untangling the complex web of thoughts that hamper our thinking. The Six Hats method aims to compartmentalize these different kinds of thoughts in a way that allows each of them the time they deserve without letting them disrupt your thinking process. After reading these blinks, you’ll learn when it’s best to spill your emotions; why it’s so important to avoid eating the wrong berries; and how one company solved a problem that was costing it $100,000 per day in only 12 minutes. What’s the main obstacle in the way of thinking clearly? The answer: confusion. When we process information, we confront a number of varying thoughts simultaneously: ones that are emotional, informational, logical, creative and future-oriented. Trying to process them all at once is like trying to juggle too many balls. The solution? The Six Hats method. In this method, each “hat” has its own, easy-to-remember color – white, red, black, yellow, green, or blue – that represents a certain type of thinking. Here’s how it can come in handy. Let’s say you’re a manager and you want to know your team’s emotional reaction to something. But you know they won’t show their true emotions directly: people are afraid to be judged because of their emotions and would rather avoid the subject. However, since everyone on the team knows that the red hat represents emotional thoughts, you could instead say “Let’s try the red hat on” and the neutrality of the color allows the team to think emotionally without feeling embarrassed. That’s why, in practice, the hats are only referred to by color, never by function. Furthermore, the Six Hats method ensures that the entire group is thinking the same way. Imagine you’re at a gathering at a large house: one person is standing in the front yard, another in the back yard, another on the roof, another in the dining room, and one on either side. Each person has a different view of the house: from the side it appears very long, while from the front it seems quite short. Now, think about each perspective as a different hat. If you want to view a topic from the same vantage point, you’ll all need to be wearing the same hat. The six hats, therefore, enable your team in order to engage in parallel thinking, in which everyone views the problem from the same perspective. There are two ways to wear these hats: in single use or in sequence. When the hats are used singly, they function as symbols indicating that you want to concentrate on a particular type of thinking. Over the course of a conversation or discussion, you may reach a point where you need to generate some fresh opinions. Saying something like “I think we need some green-hat thinking here” allows you to easily convey this. Once people have been trained in the vocabulary and usage of hats, they’ll know exactly how to respond to your request: ask for green-hat thinking, and they’ll know to think of alternative options. Then there’s the sequential use. In this case, use any hat you like as often as you like and in any order, depending on what your group wants to accomplish. For instance, the leader may ask the group to switch from the white to the yellow hat and leave out the red hat entirely! Regardless of how you use the hats, you’ll need to consider both discipline and timing. Members of the group must have the discipline to use and maintain only the hat that is required at that present moment. Only the group leader, chairperson or facilitator has the power to change it. Luckily, developing that discipline only gets easier with practice – so keep at it. Whenever your group puts on a hat, it’s important to keep your time focused in order to foster concentration and reduce idle talk. For this reason, it’s recommended that your group spends one minute per person under a particular hat. For example, if there are four people in the meeting, you’d spend four minutes wearing each hat. Now that you understand the purpose and importance of the hats, the following blinks will examine each one individually. Imagine role-playing as a computer: you’d compute calculations and regurgitate facts in a neutral, objective manner – all in your best robot voice, of course. And you could forget about interpretation – that wasn’t programmed into your software! You only care about the facts. That’s what thinking with the white hat is like. The white hat is used to discuss whatever information is currently available and to identify any information that might also be necessary. When wearing the white hat, you’re not concerned with opinions but facts and figures. This means that there are no arguments. If facts contradict one another, you treat them equally. So when’s the right time to put on the white hat? Usually, in order to lay down the foundation of your discussion by providing background information at the beginning of a thinking session. You can also use it at the end of a thinking session as a sort of debriefing, or to confirm that proposals agree with existing information. Imagine, for example, that the head of marketing of your company wants to overhaul her current strategies. She can begin a team meeting by requesting white-hat thinking to lay out the current strategy’s hard numbers, like its scope and budget. You can also use the white hat to find alternatives when proposals contradict existing information. For example, after considering a new strategy that would exceed the budget, the same head of marketing could request additional information, like how many employee hours are available. With white-hat thinking, you contemplate what information you have and what data is missing. Then ask yourself how to best acquire that information. Above all else, remember that, when using the white hat, it is critical to stay neutral and objective. White, absent of all color, indicates neutrality. Thus, there’s no room for maybes – only facts. Don’t start white-hat thinking by stating what you believe to be true. Stick to hard facts, like statistical data. So what’s the opposite of neutrality, objectivity and raw data? That would be the red hat, representing fire and warmth. Prepare to get emotional! Wearing the red hat gives your team members an opportunity to express their feelings, emotions and intuition without any need to explain or justify them. Your intuition is likely based on an accumulated experience, so even saying things like “I feel this is a risky tactic” can be useful. However, it’s important to note that intuition isn’t always correct, and should therefore be treated with caution. A range of feelings can be expressed under the red hat: you can express your enthusiasm (“I love it!), ambivalence (“I’m not so sure about this.”) or even dissatisfaction (“I hate it!”). Of course, not all emotions fit neatly into these categories. If people say they have “mixed feelings” about something, ask them what feelings are in the mix. This can be tricky, as what’s considered appropriate expression of one’s feelings varies across cultures. Whereas in the United States someone might express their dissatisfaction in a very direct way (“What a lousy idea!”), in Japan, these same feelings would sound much more contained (“I must consider it.”). It’s also important that the leader never ask anyone to explain or justify their feelings. When people feel like they have to validate their feelings, they’ll only convey those that can be validated. Rather, just express the feelings as they arise in that moment. Red-hat exercises should always have full participation, i.e., every person in the group should voice their feelings on the subject. No one should be allowed to pass. The group must also give everybody the sense that their feelings are important by listening carefully. This ensures that voicing an unpopular emotion or being alone in expressing a particular emotion will not be met with condescension or punishment. Whenever you put on the red hat, you’re allowed to express exactly how you feel about the topic. Imagine you’re wearing your black judge’s robes as you preside over a murder trial. You’re the one responsible for weighing all evidence with the utmost scrutiny and prudence – after all, someone’s life is hanging in the balance. That’s what it’s like to wear the black hat: you stay within the law, point out difficulties and problems, and hold tight to values and ethics. The black hat is all about cautiousness. It stops us from doing things that will ultimately work against our interest, e.g., illegal, dangerous or unprofitable things. We base our critical judgments on past experiences by using an inherent mechanism called the mismatch mechanism. Just as an animal learns which berries are poisonous (based on inherited experience), your company’s survival can depend on which fruits it chooses to pluck. You can avoid these sorts of mistakes when you wear the black hat: it will help you find the elements of your policy, strategy, ethics, etc., that contradict one another. Just make sure you don’t let the black hat make you overly cautious. Some people spend too much time under it, obsessing over finding faults. Here’s a comparison: we know that food is essential for life. We also know that too much food can make us overweight, cause health problems and even lead to death. An obsession with the black hat functions in much the same way: while the black hat is necessary for decision making, you don’t want to overdo it. One of the great values of the Six Hats method is that we balance things out by making time for each hat. So don’t spend all your time under the black hat! Have you ever had one of those moments when everything seemed right in the world? When everything had a silver lining? Those moments occur when you think with the yellow hat, characterized by optimism and a focus on potential benefits. The yellow hat is harder to master than the black hat: our mind is naturally inclined to warn us against danger, not seek out sunshine and rainbows. To be able to find the positive, we need to develop value sensitivity, i.e., the awareness that there’s value in even the most unattractive ideas. The yellow hat is crucial because an idea’s positive impacts aren’t always immediately apparent, and trying to achieve something where the benefits are unclear is a waste of time. When wearing the yellow hat, you should consider things like how your new marketing plan could potentially change your brand’s image and reach new customers. Otherwise, what’s the point of making a new plan? Crucially, the positivity of the yellow hat should be logically based. Although the yellow hat strives to find value, that doesn’t mean we should deceive ourselves. Because while the yellow hat permits us to express our visions and dreams, it also values realism over fantasy, so these dreams should be framed by realistic expectations. In other words, when you don the yellow hat, you don’t fantasize about how your new marketing plan will save your company, make you a trillionaire and put your face on magazine covers. Instead, you think about what good things your new marketing plan might realistically achieve for your company. Yellow-hat thinking poses questions like: What are the potential values of this idea? Whom do they benefit? Under what circumstances? How are the values delivered? What other values are there? If an idea is promising and logical, the yellow hat can help motivate and encourage your team to take the steps to make it happen. Now it’s time to get creative! The green hat is all about new ideas, concepts, alternatives and alternatives to alternatives. These include both the obvious alternatives to the status quo as well as fresh, zany ideas. Wearing the green hat means being open to any possible improvements to your situation and to consider crazy alternatives that might seem impossible! In addition, the green hat permits us to consider possible outcomes. Because without a creative vision for the future, progress can come to a standstill. Just think: two thousand years ago Chinese technology was far more advanced than Western technology. But between then and now Chinese technological progress seemed to have run into a wall. But why? The most common explanation is that the Chinese were simply too satisfied with their situation. They didn’t fantasize about future possibilities – which made it impossible for them to find the incentive to progress. What’s more, the green hat can also be used to overcome the difficulties encountered during black-hat thinking. Whereas the black hat might have helped you pinpoint a major danger in your new marketing strategy, the green hat might help you figure out a creative way to avoid these dangers or brainstorm completely new ideas. However, in wearing the green hat, it’s important to remember that creativity is no longer just the business of the one “creative person” in your group while everyone else eagerly awaits their sagely wisdom. Everyone is encouraged to try on the green hat and make a creative effort. In order to do this, you’ll need to appropriately manage your group’s expectations. People are very good at doing exactly what’s expected of them – not more, not less. So, when you expect your group to be creative under the green hat, even those who’ve never considered themselves the “creative type” will start making a creative effort. As their confidence increases, so will the number of creative ideas. The blue hat is the hat for “thinking about thinking.” Like a hawk flying high into the blue sky to gain a better perspective of the fields below it, the person wearing the blue hat aims to get an overview of the other hats. The blue hat is used at the beginning of a thinking session to define the purpose and aim of your session. It might define a particular problem that needs to be addressed or the parameters of your brainstorming session. Under the blue hat, you consider which other hats will be needed during a thinking session in order to tackle a given problem. Maybe this particular session will require a lot of red and green thinking or black and white thinking. Whatever the case may be, all of this is determined under the blue hat. Typically, the blue hat is worn by the facilitator, chairperson or leader of the session. This is a permanent role and, as such, the group leader will not remove the blue hat during the session. However, during a specific blue-hat session, in which everyone dons the blue hat, anyone can make procedural suggestions. During the session, the blue hat helps maintain the discipline of the group, announce when it’s time to change hats and ensures that everyone is wearing the right hat. At the end of the session, it’s the blue hat that asks for the outcome. This may come in the form of a summary, conclusion, decision or solution, etc. The blue hat also lays out any next steps that will need to be taken after a session, such as the next actionable steps in a project or the topics for the next meeting. So now you know all about the different kinds of hats and what they’re used for. But why should you use the Six Hats method? The final blink will answer that question. Now that you’ve learned all about the Six Hats method, you might be wondering why you should adopt this strategy over others. There are three main reasons why the Six Hats method is so successful. First of all, it saves time. Here’s one real-life example: a week after the Financial Times published a short write-up of the Six Hats method, the author received a letter from a man who told him about how he and his wife had been arguing for a long time about whether or not to buy a large house in the country. But once they read the write-up, they decided to use the Six Hats method. By compartmentalizing the different elements of their conversation – factual, creative, emotional and so on – they were able to come up with a decision that satisfied them both in only ten minutes. Then there’s the major corporation ABB, which used to spend 20 days on their multinational project team discussions before reaching a conclusion. Using the Six Hats method, these discussions now take as little as two days! Second, it saves money. Norwegian multinational oil and gas company Statoil is a shining example of that. The company once had a problem with an oil rig that was costing it about $100,000 per day. A certified trainer came in and introduced them to the Six Hats method and solved their problem in just 12 minutes. Just imagine how much money they saved! Finally, the Six Hats method reduces irritation and provides an end in sight. Imagine you’re in a car with three other people and you have to drive somewhere but everyone only vaguely know the roads. There’s bound to be many heated arguments over which road to take, which will only get worse the longer you’re on the road. However, if you have a road map, then it’s much easier to choose the best route, making the best possible choice become obvious to all. The Six Hats method gives you that map. The key message in this book: Thinking is a skill just like any other and can be improved! Using the Six Hats method, you will be able to think more effectively, solve problems, develop creative solutions, stop wasting valuable energy and falling prey to disorganized and chaotic thinking.

Despite illness or injury, they make sure to meet their goals or deadlines. Sure, most of us aren’t like this. We may have wonderful ideas but never find the time to realize them. Or if we do pursue a particular goal, we easily get sidetracked, time and again. The good news is that you can learn how to stick with a plan, even if the world keeps throwing distractions your way. These blinks will give you helpful and easy methods to stay on track and realize your most lofty goals – smarter, faster and better. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to become a marathon runner even if you’ve never run a mile; why two researchers read 17.9 million papers in a quest to understand creativity; and why storytelling can help you reach your goals. Have you ever been excited to start a new project, only to have that excitement fade over time? This is a common problem. Let’s look at some tips for keeping your spirits high as you stay on track. You can maintain motivation by making choices to benefit yourself, your team or your project. Researchers at Columbia University found that people feel more motivated when they have greater control over a situation. Basically, people get excited when they get to make choices! A sense of control and responsibility can also help you recover from any setbacks during the process. In fact, neuropsychologist Mauricio Delgado at Columbia found that one of the brain’s “motivation centers” lights up whenever a person has an opportunity to make a choice – even something as simple as selecting a colored key in a video game. So make this phenomenon work for you! If you’re stuck with a task, let yourself make a decision. Even mundane choices can help to pick you back up. If you have 40 emails to read, for instance, just pick four and look at the rest later. Making choices isn’t always enough to give you a boost, however. You also need to remind yourself how your choices contribute to the project and your overarching goals. Remembering the big picture is another important element in staying motivated. Even if a task doesn’t feel rewarding on its own, you’ll feel good when you know it plays a part in something more important. Let’s say you want to develop a drone. You start reading an essay about drone building, but it’s terribly dry, and your attention starts to wane. You’d rather stop and do anything else to keep from falling asleep! What do you do in this situation? How do you get yourself back on track to focus on your goal? Consider this simple trick. At the top of the essay, write in bold letters: ”Reading this will help me make the drone.” In short, remind yourself of what you want. When you do this, the essay that will bring you one step closer to your goal won’t seem so boring anymore. Now that we’ve reviewed the power of choice, let’s go over some tips for bringing your ideas to life. Start with stretch goals, or your biggest ambitions. Don’t be afraid to dream! Studies have shown that people are more creative when they reach for higher, bigger goals. A 1997 study revealed that after Motorola had incorporated stretch goals into its management training, engineers were able to develop new products in a tenth of the time it took previously. This same philosophy can be applied to personal goals, such as an obese person wanting to lose a lot of weight. Even if the ultimate goal of shedding 100 pounds isn’t realized, aiming high can push a person to still achieve impressive results. Stretch goals by definition are goals that are out of reach, so sometimes they can feel overwhelming. If your goal seems too much, that’s where a SMART goal can come in handy. SMART goals break up your stretch goal into more manageable parts. They are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound. Let’s say your stretch goal is to run a marathon. First, you’ll want to break this goal into smaller, more specific steps, such as “be able run six miles without stopping.” Then figure out how to measure yourself: “I’ll run six laps on my local track.” Next, ask yourself if your goal is achievable. If you combine running with biweekly visits to the gym, it just might be. Remember to be realistic, too. You might tell yourself, “This will be tough and take time, but I can do it!” Finally, figure out the most effective way to schedule how long you’ll need to reach your goal. Maybe you’ll start running two miles the first week and aim to add a mile each week after that. Another good thing about SMART goals is you get an extra motivation boost each time you complete a stage. The more progress you make, the more excited you’ll be to keep going! Life is unpredictable. Even if you outline your stretch and SMART goals, unexpected events always pop up and draw your attention away. So how do you stay focused? One good way is to create mental models: positive stories that prevent distraction and keep you excited about the future. Mental models prepare you for upcoming projects or conversations. Let’s say you have a stressful week ahead. Get yourself through it by imagining how you’ll conquer, step by step, each challenge. Imagine you’re a journalist and have to write an article for a travel magazine on three top SLR cameras. First off, you might make a list of ten cameras, to later narrow down. Be sure to consider potential distractions, like a full email inbox. Perhaps you’ll turn on your email blocking software before lunch, to give yourself some uninterrupted thinking time. Once you’ve picked your top five cameras from your list, imagine yourself experimenting with them. Then imagine yourself choosing the best three, and writing out the results of your survey. Now you’ve envisioned the whole article, from start to finish, so you can write it in a snap. In sum, once you figure out how you want your week to go, you start working toward it! Granted, even the best plans can be interrupted, so consider how you’ll handle these ahead of time. Think about possible distractions and how likely each is during a work day. Maybe your partner will invite you out to lunch, for example. How could you spend that time in a way that doesn’t disrupt your entire day? You might want to go to a self-service restaurant near work, or pack a lunch together in advance. This way your meal will take 45 minutes instead of two hours. What’s the recipe for a great team? A group of overachievers or superstars? Not exactly. Google’s Project Aristotle spent two years researching what makes a team great. The project found that even a team of average performers can accomplish great things if the team has the right dynamic. But what’s the “right” dynamic? Well, the most important factor is whether team members feel psychologically safe. Team members feel safe when they know they won’t be ridiculed for making mistakes or suggesting ideas. Project Aristotle found that safe teams were more likely to perform better, envisioning more innovative products or meeting sales targets. Psychological safety enhances performance because it allows team members to admit mistakes, which means any issues can be quickly addressed. Team members also feel more comfortable sharing unconventional ideas, which makes the team as a whole more creative. “Safe” teams also thrive in an environment that is, in general, caring and respectful. Project Aristotle found that the safest teams are made up of empathetic individuals, which shouldn’t come as a surprise: it’s easier to trust people when they care about you. Team members also feel safe when they’re encouraged to contribute to a project’s success. Such encouragement shows each member that he or she is an important part of the group with opinions that are highly valued. Naturally, team leaders are tasked with fostering this psychological safety. So if you’re a leader, make sure all your team members have their voices heard at least once in every meeting. If you notice a team member is upset, encourage the person to share what’s wrong and make sure other members respond in a caring way. Resolve any conflicts in the open and never interrupt team members when they are speaking. Make sure everyone feels valued and respected! During the boom times in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, many CEOs felt that HR departments and other “company culture” ideas were irrelevant to the startup world. Developing ground-breaking ideas and products were all that mattered. Were they correct? Not at all. An exhaustive study has shown that company culture is deeply important to the success of any firm. And a “commitment culture” is the most successful kind of culture you can nurture at a company. In a commitment culture, management focuses on building trust and attachment to the company. Commitment culture companies rely on trust, care and the emotional connections between the organization and its employees. Such companies don’t necessarily aim to hire the smartest, highest achieving individuals. Instead, firms look for people who fit their larger team and company vision. In 1994, Stanford Business School professors James Baron and Michael Hannan started a study of nearly 200 Silicon Valley technology start-ups, in an attempt to understand more about the relationship between company culture and profit. The team found that of the five different company cultural styles they identified, commitment culture companies consistently proved to be the most successful. Not one commitment culture firm went bankrupt; they were the fastest to go public; and they maintained the highest profitability ratios. There’s another benefit to supporting a commitment culture, in that it allows a company to maintain fewer middle managers. Commitment companies hire driven, high-quality specialists who are usually good at managing themselves. That means a company’s middle management ranks can be leaner. Your company is more efficient when specialists can address questions or problems directly. A mid-level operations manager might not know which server to choose, for example, but an IT specialist can make the right choice immediately. Innovation isn’t always about starting from scratch. After all, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel to develop a groundbreaking new car! So instead of trying to create something completely new, strive to use old ideas in new ways. Behavioral economics is a good example of this phenomenon. The pioneers of behavioral economics combined psychological and economic models to try to understand why humans so often make decisions counter to their interests. People decline deals if they perceive them as unfair, for instance. This runs against the idea of rational behavior, which holds that people make decisions purely for gain, put forth by traditional economists. Behavioral economists thus managed to gain groundbreaking insight by finding new applications for old concepts. Brian Uzzi and Ben Jones, business professors at Northwestern University, in 2011 analyzed a range of creative academic papers. Using an algorithm, Uzzi and Jones evaluated 17.9 million papers and found that in the most creative papers, 90 percent of the content had already been published elsewhere. The innovative papers were considered groundbreaking because they approached existing concepts from new angles, not because they developed new concepts alone. Here’s another good way to boost creativity: tune into your feelings. Let emotions and intuition guide you. How you feel about a situation or idea will tell you whether you’re dealing with something great or just run-of-the-mill. Disney Animation President Edwin Catmull uses this strategy with his writers. When his team was working on the movie Frozen, for instance, he had them explore their emotional connections with siblings. Doing so allowed the writers to portray the relationship between the characters Anna and Elsa in a raw, authentic and relatable way, one big reason for the film’s sweeping success. The key message in this book: Staying productive, motivated and competitive is ultimately about making the right choices, both in your daily life and with your most ambitious goals. Set stretch goals for yourself, then narrow them down into achievable parts. Overcome distractions by staying prepared. Making the right choices isn’t just good for you – it’s better for your team and the company overall.  Actionable advice Learn a new concept by talking or writing about it.  Next time you read about something interesting, tell a friend or write a short essay about it. Your brain processes ideas more deeply when you engage with a topic, allowing your brain to build new neural connections. You’ll better understand an idea and will be more able to recall it, the more neural connections you establish. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

At first glance, this is an uncanny idea. Wouldn’t you rather see yourself as unique? The product of your own choices rather than a bit player reading lines in someone else’s drama?   But acting isn’t the enemy of authenticity. Just think of your favorite Hollywood stars. They’re convincing because they bring their own experiences and personalities to their roles. They don’t just act – they become their characters.     You don’t have to be a thespian to leverage that insight. From job interviews to presentations and first dates, life is full of situations in which we’re expected to play a part while bringing something special to the table. So, what’s the secret?  That’s exactly the question we’ll answer in these blinks, drawing from the wisdom of performance pro and former professional actor Michael Port. You’ll learn the tricks of the trade, and discover how you can apply these to your own life. Along the way, you’ll also find out  how improvisation can help you in the boardroom; why you’re a natural-born performer even if you don’t know it yet; and how to unlock your authentic inner voice. Picture these three scenarios: a manager attends a make-or-break performance review with his superiors; an up-and-coming corporate hotshot gives a speech at a conference attended by her industry’s movers and shakers; a young entrepreneur pitches an ambitious business idea to a group of grizzled venture capitalists.  If your hands are clamming up just thinking about putting yourself in any one of those situations, don’t worry – you’re not alone. Lots of folks find stepping into the limelight a pretty terrifying experience. To put that into perspective, Googling “public speaking” gets you 90 million hits. At the top of the list: advice on how to keep nerves and anxiety in check. So what makes public speaking so scary? Well, it’s a type of performance. Whether you’re interviewing for a job or giving a talk, you’re essentially acting – presenting, staging and playing a part to impress, delight or move your audience. Chances are this is something you’ve never been taught how to do. And that explains the familiar sense of dread. Public performances take us out of our comfort zone. No wonder we worry about fluffing our lines and ending up with egg on our faces!  But here’s the thing. As odd as it might sound, you are an actor – all of us are. Whether you’re aware of it or not, you’re constantly assuming different roles in different settings. When you use social media or describe yourself on a dating site, for example, you’re presenting yourself in a particular light. In other words, you’re performing. The same goes for the ways in which you might change your behavior when Skyping a colleague or talking to your boss at a holiday party.  This is good news – it means you already know how to play a part. The trick is to leverage that intuitive understanding of performance and take it to the next level. Think of it as a crash course in acting. But this isn’t about landing a part in your local drama group – it’s about learning a methodology you can apply in your professional life. Take it from the author, a professional actor who transitioned into the corporate world. Today, he’s a best-selling writer and a highly sought-after public speaker and consultant. That was a pretty big leap, but his acting background gave him an advantage: it allowed him to authentically play different roles and inspire confidence in others.  In the following blinks, we’ll learn how to follow his lead.  Every role has a script and a costume. Take one of the most common parts many of us play – the “professional.” We tend to speak and dress in certain ways when we’re at work. Things that we might talk about with our friends just don’t feel right in the office. Come Monday morning, we leave those comfortable old jeans in the wardrobe and pick something better suited to our workplace persona. It’s an act, but it’s an important one. Mixing the personal with the professional often ends badly. If Sam from accounts starts recounting his latest late-night adventures, he may damage his standing among his increasingly uncomfortable colleagues. If Suzie goes around telling others that she doesn’t believe she deserved her recent promotion, her subordinates are unlikely to respect her authority.   But playing a role doesn’t mean abandoning your true voice – the bundle of experiences, values and beliefs that define who you are and what you stand for. When you bring that perspective to your professional role, you become a much more rounded character. And that helps you connect with others.  Take Robin Roberts, the anchor of ABC’s Good Morning America show. Viewers came to see her in a different light after she opened up about being gay. Where they’d once seen a towering example of professional drive and ambition, they now saw a woman who, like the rest of us, was figuring stuff out along the way. She kept on playing her role as anchor on the show, but she was also able to give authentic expression to who she was as a person.  That kind of honesty goes a long way when you’re a leader. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, for example, wrote about her conflicted feelings about motherhood, work and marriage in her book Lean In. By drawing on her own experience as a woman in an ultra-competitive, male-dominated industry, she made herself relatable to millions of readers and inspired the launch of a movement dedicated to empowering women to pursue their dream careers.  So how do you find your true voice? Here’s where you can start: don’t get caught in the perfection trap. If you’re anxious about being the most original person in the room, you’re unlikely to believe that your unique history, insights and perspective are relevant to others. But remember, it’s not so much what you say but how you say it that counts. Think of a mother singing a lullaby that’s been sung a million times to her child. It doesn’t matter that the melody isn’t original – what’s important is the way her voice communicates her authentic love. We talked a little about authenticity in the previous blink, but we didn’t define the term. So what exactly is it? Oftentimes, it’s understood as “being true to yourself.” That’s not a bad gloss, but it raises another question: What kind of “self” are we talking about?  That might sound pretty abstract, but it’s an important distinction. Take a 2015 article by organizational psychologist Herminia Ibarra in the Harvard Business Review. Ibarra argues that our “self-concept” can either “keep us from sailing forth” or help us become more adaptable.  Let’s unpack that a little, beginning with adaptability. Successful people from all walks of life have one thing in common – they switch between different roles. A marine corps battalion leader, for example, might be a tough disciplinarian at work but play the role of a tender, loving father when he gets home to his young daughters. Both are authentic. Think of a chameleon changing its colors. It isn’t pretending to be something it’s not; rather, it’s expressing the full range of its potential.  When your sense of self is overly rigid, by contrast, you tend to develop a single, unchangeable way of thinking, feeling and behaving, whatever the context. Folks like this find it hard to improvise and often become downright intolerant when it comes to alternative perspectives. Worse, they struggle to make big transitions in life, like the jump from middle management to leadership, or from bachelorhood to married life.  Always playing the same role also leads to conflict and limits your ability to excel. Imagine a comedian who wants to direct a big-budget movie but can’t turn off his class-clown act in meetings with Hollywood executives. Said act may make him the life and soul of the party in certain circles, but no one’s going to cut him a million-dollar check while he’s making fart jokes. The key to mastering different roles is relatively simple: take a leaf out of the book of the pros who already know how to do it. Just as athletes obsess over every last detail of their idols’ shooting or swinging styles, you should be studying the “stars” you encounter in day-to-day life. Admire the master networker in your office? Analyze her plays and try them on for size yourself. This isn’t about pretending to be someone else – it’s about learning techniques you can make your own.  Have you ever heard the phrase “dialogue of the deaf?” It refers to conversations among people who aren’t listening to one another and are simply waiting for the right moment to jump in with their own well-rehearsed talking points.  It’s a frustrating experience that plays out in boardrooms and bedrooms around the world every day, and it creates a vicious circle. The less you’re listening, the less likely you are to respond in interesting ways. That, in turn, means that your conversation partner is less likely to bother listening to you.  Actors learn this early on in their training. As Cicely Berry, the former voice director at the Royal Shakespeare Company, points out, surprising responses are the fruit of openness. If you’re not tuned into what’s going on in front of you, you’re going to deliver a stilted and boring performance. That’s because actors don’t just “manufacture” emotions out of thin air – they get angry or sad in response to what they hear.  That makes listening a skill that’s well worth cultivating. The trick is to be in the moment. Neuroscientist Seth Horowitz calls this “whole brain listening.” Think of it as a kind of mindfulness. The idea is to be fully present and focused on what’s being said rather than trying to anticipate where arguments might lead or waiting for a chance to voice your own ideas.  Being in the moment isn’t just about the sound waves entering your ears, however – in fact, you can “listen” with all your senses. Take a job interview. The fact that your interviewer has dark rings under his eyes, makes little eye contact and is downing a triple espresso is just as revealing as what he’s telling you about the company. The same goes for a presentation. If your audience is busily scribbling notes, you’ve likely piqued their interest; if, on the other hand, they’re watching with stony-eyed indifference, now might be the right time to change things up.   When you approach conversations with this in mind, they become a bit like a game of long-distance throwing and catching. Imagine tossing a baseball to a partner standing 50 yards away. You don’t just watch the arc of the ball – you also listen for that telltale thwack sound of it landing in a leather glove. When you’re talking to someone, you need to do the same thing: keep your ears open for signs that your conversational partner has “caught” the drift of what you’re saying. We’ve all been there. You’re walking towards the podium or entering a conference room when you suddenly get a familiar antsy sensation in your stomach. Your focus narrows and the only thought in your head is a dull, monotonous refrain – “you don’t belong here.”  That’s your inner critic rebelling against your turn in the spotlight, and it’s something that plenty of actors experience every time they take to the stage. In this blink, we’ll wrap things up by looking at some of the techniques they use to beat these self-defeating patterns of thought.  Call it acting as if, a technique that uses the imagination to preempt anxiety. The idea is simple: if you act as though something is true, it’s more likely that it will turn out that way in the real world. That might sound like a load of New Age mumbo-jumbo, but there’s plenty of hard science to back it up.  Let’s start with a 2012 study published in the journal Psychiatric Annals. In it, Thomas Newmark shows that athletes who visualize successfully completing tasks measurably boost their performance. When you imagine something, your body feels like it’s really happening. Brain scans show an accompanying shift in neural activity from the brain’s logical left hemisphere to the creative right hemisphere, which creates new neural pathways between the two.  Then there’s power posing – assuming an expansive, dominant position in front of a mirror. To get the right idea, think of superheroes with their hands on their hips and legs planted firmly apart. Amy Cuddy, a psychologist at Harvard University, showed that these poses have demonstrable physiological effects. In her 2010 article on the subject, she concluded that acting confidently in front of a mirror actually makes folks more confident. As Cuddy explains, that’s because it can boost testosterone, a hormone linked to feelings of power and control, by up to 20 percent, while simultaneously reducing cortisol, a stress hormone, by up to 25 percent.  The author has firsthand experience of the power of visualization. Having recently received his US Coast Guard boat license, he still found docking his vessel pretty nerve-racking, especially in rough weather. When he talked to more seasoned captains, they told him that they always imagined going through the operation before steering their boats into their berths. Like actors, they were rehearsing their roles before putting themselves in the limelight.  That just goes to show how powerful acting can be! The key message in these blinks: Whether you know it or not, you’re a natural-born actor. Every day, you move between different roles and play different parts. But here’s the snag: that intuitive understanding of performance rarely equips you for those daunting moments when you’re forced into the limelight. So what should you do next time you take to the stage in front of your peers? The key is to let your inner voice shine and remember that perfect is often the enemy of good. Train your listening skills, make like a chameleon and act “as if” you’re already the performer you want to be, and you’ll take your acting to the next level in no time at all.    Actionable advice: Improve your speaking by pausing.   Speech trainers will often tell you that a simple way to improve your public speaking is to slow down. Sometimes that makes sense – when you’re nervous, you tend to rush through your material. But if you’re worrying about speaking too quickly, you might just be focusing on the wrong thing. What really makes the difference between a mediocre talk and a kick-ass presentation is pausing. Speaking too slowly is often downright soporific. Bursts of quick speech punctuated with pauses, on the other hand, create attention-grabbing rhythms. That helps your listeners absorb what you’re saying. Even better, pauses give them a moment to take down notes. Remember, you’ll quickly lose them if they’ve got their heads stuck in their laptops! Got feedback?
